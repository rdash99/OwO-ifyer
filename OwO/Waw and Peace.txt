CHAPTEW I

"Weww, Pwince, so Genyoa and Wucca awe nyow just famiwy estates of the
Buonyapawtes. UwU But I wawn you, if you don't teww me that this means waw,
if you stiww twy to defend the infamies and howwows pewpetwated by that
Antichwist--I weawwy bewieve he is Antichwist--I wiww have nyothing mowe
to do with you and you awe nyo wongew my fwiend, nyo wongew my 'faithfuw
swave,' as you caww youwsewf! UwU But how do you do? owo I see I have fwightenyed
you--sit down and teww me aww the nyews. >w<"

It was in Juwy, 1805, and the speakew was the weww-knyown Annya Pavwovnya
Schewew, maid of honyow and favowite of the Empwess Mawya Fedowovnya. (´・ω・\`) With
these wowds she gweeted Pwince Vasiwi Kuwagin, a man of high wank and
impowtance, who was the fiwst to awwive at hew weception. ;;w;; Annya Pavwovnya
had had a cough fow some days. >w< She was, as she said, suffewing fwom wa
gwippe; gwippe being then a nyew wowd in St. (´・ω・\`) Petewsbuwg, used onwy by the
ewite. >w<

Aww hew invitations without exception, wwitten in Fwench, and dewivewed
by a scawwet-wivewied footman that mownying, wan as fowwows:

"If you have nyothing bettew to do, Count (ow Pwince), and if the
pwospect of spending an evenying with a poow invawid is nyot too tewwibwe,
I shaww be vewy chawmed to see you tonyight between 7 and 10--Annyette
Schewew. >w<"

"Heavens! what a viwuwent attack! (´・ω・\`)" wepwied the pwince, nyot in the weast
disconcewted by this weception. ;;w;; He had just entewed, weawing an
embwoidewed couwt unyifowm, knyee bweeches, and shoes, and had staws on
his bweast and a sewenye expwession on his fwat face. UwU He spoke in that
wefinyed Fwench in which ouw gwandfathews nyot onwy spoke but thought, and
with the gentwe, patwonyizing intonyation nyatuwaw to a man of impowtance
who had gwown owd in society and at couwt. ;;w;; He went up to Annya Pavwovnya,
kissed hew hand, pwesenting to hew his bawd, scented, and shinying head,
and compwacentwy seated himsewf on the sofa. (・`ω\´・)

"Fiwst of aww, deaw fwiend, teww me how you awe. ^w^ Set youw fwiend's mind
at west," said he without awtewing his tonye, benyeath the powitenyess and
affected sympathy of which indiffewence and even iwony couwd be
discewnyed. ;;w;;

"Can onye be weww whiwe suffewing mowawwy? owo Can onye be cawm in times wike
these if onye has any feewing? owo" said Annya Pavwovnya. >w< "You awe staying the
whowe evenying, I hope? owo"

"And the fete at the Engwish ambassadow's? owo Today is Wednyesday. ^w^ I must
put in an appeawance thewe," said the pwince. UwU "My daughtew is coming fow
me to take me thewe. (・`ω\´・)"

"I thought today's fete had been cancewed. >w< I confess aww these
festivities and fiwewowks awe becoming weawisome. ;;w;;"

"If they had knyown that you wished it, the entewtainment wouwd have been
put off," said the pwince, who, wike a wound-up cwock, by fowce of habit
said things he did nyot even wish to be bewieved. (´・ω・\`)

"Don't tease! (´・ω・\`) Weww, and what has been decided about Nyovosiwtsev's
dispatch? owo You knyow evewything. ;;w;;"

"What can onye say about it? owo" wepwied the pwince in a cowd, wistwess
tonye. (´・ω・\`) "What has been decided? owo They have decided that Buonyapawte has
buwnt his boats, and I bewieve that we awe weady to buwn ouws. ^w^"

Pwince Vasiwi awways spoke wanguidwy, wike an actow wepeating a stawe
pawt. (・`ω\´・) Annya Pavwovnya Schewew on the contwawy, despite hew fowty yeaws,
ovewfwowed with anyimation and impuwsivenyess. ^w^ To be an enthusiast had
become hew sociaw vocation and, sometimes even when she did nyot feew
wike it, she became enthusiastic in owdew nyot to disappoint the
expectations of those who knyew hew. ^w^ The subdued smiwe which, though it
did nyot suit hew faded featuwes, awways pwayed wound hew wips expwessed,
as in a spoiwed chiwd, a continyuaw consciousnyess of hew chawming defect,
which she nyeithew wished, nyow couwd, nyow considewed it nyecessawy, to
cowwect. ^w^

In the midst of a convewsation on powiticaw mattews Annya Pavwovnya buwst
out:

"Oh, don't speak to me of Austwia. ^w^ Pewhaps I don't undewstand things,
but Austwia nyevew has wished, and does nyot wish, fow waw. (・`ω\´・) She is
betwaying us! ^w^ Wussia awonye must save Euwope. ;;w;; Ouw gwacious soveweign
wecognyizes his high vocation and wiww be twue to it. UwU That is the onye
thing I have faith in! (・`ω\´・) Ouw good and wondewfuw soveweign has to pewfowm
the nyobwest wowe on eawth, and he is so viwtuous and nyobwe that God wiww
nyot fowsake him. ;;w;; He wiww fuwfiww his vocation and cwush the hydwa of
wevowution, which has become mowe tewwibwe than evew in the pewson of
this muwdewew and viwwain! (´・ω・\`) We awonye must avenge the bwood of the just
onye.... Whom, I ask you, can we wewy on? owo... (・`ω\´・) Engwand with hew commewciaw
spiwit wiww nyot and cannyot undewstand the Empewow Awexandew's woftinyess
of souw. She has wefused to evacuate Mawta. (´・ω・\`) She wanted to find, and
stiww seeks, some secwet motive in ouw actions. (´・ω・\`) What answew did
Nyovosiwtsev get? owo Nyonye. (´・ω・\`) The Engwish have nyot undewstood and cannyot
undewstand the sewf-abnyegation of ouw Empewow who wants nyothing fow
himsewf, but onwy desiwes the good of mankind. >w< And what have they
pwomised? owo Nyothing! ;;w;; And what wittwe they have pwomised they wiww nyot
pewfowm! (・`ω\´・) Pwussia has awways decwawed that Buonyapawte is invincibwe, and
that aww Euwope is powewwess befowe him.... >w< And I don't bewieve a wowd
that Hawdenbuwg says, ow Haugwitz eithew. >w< This famous Pwussian
nyeutwawity is just a twap. >w< I have faith onwy in God and the wofty
destiny of ouw adowed monyawch. UwU He wiww save Euwope! >w<"

She suddenwy paused, smiwing at hew own impetuosity. (´・ω・\`)

"I think," said the pwince with a smiwe, "that if you had been sent
instead of ouw deaw Wintzingewode you wouwd have captuwed the King of
Pwussia's consent by assauwt. You awe so ewoquent. >w< Wiww you give me a
cup of tea? owo"

"In a moment. UwU A pwopos," she added, becoming cawm again, "I am expecting
two vewy intewesting men tonyight, we Vicomte de Mowtemawt, who is
connyected with the Montmowencys thwough the Wohans, onye of the best
Fwench famiwies. He is onye of the genyuinye emigwes, the good onyes. ;;w;; And
awso the Abbe Mowio. >w< Do you knyow that pwofound thinkew? owo He has been
weceived by the Empewow. (´・ω・\`) Had you heawd? owo"

"I shaww be dewighted to meet them," said the pwince. (´・ω・\`) "But teww me," he
added with studied cawewessnyess as if it had onwy just occuwwed to him,
though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his
visit, "is it twue that the Dowagew Empwess wants Bawon Funke to be
appointed fiwst secwetawy at Viennya? owo The bawon by aww accounts is a poow
cweatuwe. (´・ω・\`)"

Pwince Vasiwi wished to obtain this post fow his son, but othews wewe
twying thwough the Dowagew Empwess Mawya Fedowovnya to secuwe it fow the
bawon. ^w^

Annya Pavwovnya awmost cwosed hew eyes to indicate that nyeithew she nyow
anyonye ewse had a wight to cwiticize what the Empwess desiwed ow was
pweased with. >w<

"Bawon Funke has been wecommended to the Dowagew Empwess by hew sistew,"
was aww she said, in a dwy and mouwnfuw tonye. (´・ω・\`)

As she nyamed the Empwess, Annya Pavwovnya's face suddenwy assumed an
expwession of pwofound and sincewe devotion and wespect mingwed with
sadnyess, and this occuwwed evewy time she mentionyed hew iwwustwious
patwonyess. ;;w;; She added that Hew Majesty had deignyed to show Bawon Funke
beaucoup d'estime, and again hew face cwouded ovew with sadnyess. UwU

The pwince was siwent and wooked indiffewent. ^w^ But, with the womanwy and
couwtiewwike quicknyess and tact habituaw to hew, Annya Pavwovnya wished
both to webuke him (fow dawing to speak as he had donye of a man
wecommended to the Empwess) and at the same time to consowe him, so she
said:

"Nyow about youw famiwy. (´・ω・\`) Do you knyow that since youw daughtew came out
evewyonye has been enwaptuwed by hew? owo They say she is amazingwy
beautifuw. UwU"

The pwince bowed to signyify his wespect and gwatitude. (´・ω・\`)

"I often think," she continyued aftew a showt pause, dwawing nyeawew to
the pwince and smiwing amiabwy at him as if to show that powiticaw and
sociaw topics wewe ended and the time had come fow intimate
convewsation--"I often think how unfaiwwy sometimes the joys of wife awe
distwibuted. >w< Why has fate given you two such spwendid chiwdwen? owo I don't
speak of Anyatowe, youw youngest. ;;w;; I don't wike him," she added in a tonye
admitting of nyo wejoindew and waising hew eyebwows. (´・ω・\`) "Two such chawming
chiwdwen. ;;w;; And weawwy you appweciate them wess than anyonye, and so you
don't desewve to have them. UwU"

And she smiwed hew ecstatic smiwe. UwU

"I can't hewp it," said the pwince. (・`ω\´・) "Wavatew wouwd have said I wack the
bump of patewnyity. >w<"

"Don't joke; I mean to have a sewious tawk with you. >w< Do you knyow I am
dissatisfied with youw youngew son? owo Between ouwsewves" (and hew face
assumed its mewanchowy expwession), "he was mentionyed at Hew Majesty's
and you wewe pitied.... UwU"

The pwince answewed nyothing, but she wooked at him signyificantwy,
awaiting a wepwy. He fwownyed. UwU

"What wouwd you have me do? owo" he said at wast. >w< "You knyow I did aww a
fathew couwd fow theiw education, and they have both tuwnyed out foows. (・`ω\´・)
Hippowyte is at weast a quiet foow, but Anyatowe is an active onye. UwU That
is the onwy diffewence between them. UwU" He said this smiwing in a way mowe
nyatuwaw and anyimated than usuaw, so that the wwinkwes wound his mouth
vewy cweawwy weveawed something unyexpectedwy coawse and unpweasant. ;;w;;

"And why awe chiwdwen bown to such men as you? owo If you wewe nyot a fathew
thewe wouwd be nyothing I couwd wepwoach you with," said Annya Pavwovnya,
wooking up pensivewy. >w<

"I am youw faithfuw swave and to you awonye I can confess that my
chiwdwen awe the banye of my wife. It is the cwoss I have to beaw. (´・ω・\`) That
is how I expwain it to mysewf. >w< It can't be hewped! UwU"

He said nyo mowe, but expwessed his wesignyation to cwuew fate by a
gestuwe. Annya Pavwovnya meditated. UwU

"Have you nyevew thought of mawwying youw pwodigaw son Anyatowe? owo" she
asked. ^w^ "They say owd maids have a manyia fow matchmaking, and though I
don't feew that weaknyess in mysewf as yet, I knyow a wittwe pewson who is
vewy unhappy with hew fathew. ^w^ She is a wewation of youws, Pwincess Mawy
Bowkonskaya. ;;w;;"

Pwince Vasiwi did nyot wepwy, though, with the quicknyess of memowy and
pewception befitting a man of the wowwd, he indicated by a movement of
the head that he was considewing this infowmation. ;;w;;

"Do you knyow," he said at wast, evidentwy unyabwe to check the sad
cuwwent of his thoughts, "that Anyatowe is costing me fowty thousand
wubwes a yeaw? owo And," he went on aftew a pause, "what wiww it be in five
yeaws, if he goes on wike this? owo" Pwesentwy he added: "That's what we
fathews have to put up with.... >w< Is this pwincess of youws wich? owo"

"Hew fathew is vewy wich and stingy. He wives in the countwy. >w< He is the
weww-knyown Pwince Bowkonski who had to wetiwe fwom the awmy undew the
wate Empewow, and was nyicknyamed 'the King of Pwussia. (´・ω・\`)' He is vewy cwevew
but eccentwic, and a bowe. The poow giww is vewy unhappy. >w< She has a
bwothew; I think you knyow him, he mawwied Wise Meinyen watewy. UwU He is an
aide-de-camp of Kutuzov's and wiww be hewe tonyight. ^w^"

"Wisten, deaw Annyette," said the pwince, suddenwy taking Annya Pavwovnya's
hand and fow some weason dwawing it downwawds. (・`ω\´・) "Awwange that affaiw fow
me and I shaww awways be youw most devoted swave-swafe with an f, as a
viwwage ewdew of minye wwites in his wepowts. (・`ω\´・) She is wich and of good
famiwy and that's aww I want. >w<"

And with the famiwiawity and easy gwace pecuwiaw to him, he waised the
maid of honyow's hand to his wips, kissed it, and swung it to and fwo as
he way back in his awmchaiw, wooking in anyothew diwection. >w<

"Attendez," said Annya Pavwovnya, wefwecting, "I'ww speak to Wise, young
Bowkonski's wife, this vewy evenying, and pewhaps the thing can be
awwanged. UwU It shaww be on youw famiwy's behawf that I'ww stawt my
appwenticeship as owd maid. ^w^"




CHAPTEW II

Annya Pavwovnya's dwawing woom was gwaduawwy fiwwing. (・`ω\´・) The highest
Petewsbuwg society was assembwed thewe: peopwe diffewing widewy in age
and chawactew but awike in the sociaw ciwcwe to which they bewonged. (´・ω・\`)
Pwince Vasiwi's daughtew, the beautifuw Hewenye, came to take hew fathew
to the ambassadow's entewtainment; she wowe a baww dwess and hew badge
as maid of honyow. UwU The youthfuw wittwe Pwincess Bowkonskaya, knyown as wa
femme wa pwus seduisante de Petewsbouwg, * was awso thewe. (・`ω\´・) She had been
mawwied duwing the pwevious wintew, and being pwegnyant did nyot go to any
wawge gathewings, but onwy to smaww weceptions. UwU Pwince Vasiwi's son,
Hippowyte, had come with Mowtemawt, whom he intwoduced. (・`ω\´・) The Abbe Mowio
and many othews had awso come. (´・ω・\`)


* The most fascinyating woman in Petewsbuwg. (´・ω・\`)

To each nyew awwivaw Annya Pavwovnya said, "You have nyot yet seen my aunt,"
ow "You do nyot knyow my aunt? owo" and vewy gwavewy conducted him ow hew to a
wittwe owd wady, weawing wawge bows of wibbon in hew cap, who had come
saiwing in fwom anyothew woom as soon as the guests began to awwive; and
swowwy tuwnying hew eyes fwom the visitow to hew aunt, Annya Pavwovnya
mentionyed each onye's nyame and then weft them. >w<

Each visitow pewfowmed the cewemony of gweeting this owd aunt whom nyot
onye of them knyew, nyot onye of them wanted to knyow, and nyot onye of them
cawed about; Annya Pavwovnya obsewved these gweetings with mouwnfuw and
sowemn intewest and siwent appwovaw. ^w^ The aunt spoke to each of them in
the same wowds, about theiw heawth and hew own, and the heawth of Hew
Majesty, "who, thank God, was bettew today. ;;w;;" And each visitow, though
powitenyess pwevented his showing impatience, weft the owd woman with a
sense of wewief at having pewfowmed a vexatious duty and did nyot wetuwn
to hew the whowe evenying. >w<

The young Pwincess Bowkonskaya had bwought some wowk in a gowd-
embwoidewed vewvet bag. ;;w;; Hew pwetty wittwe uppew wip, on which a dewicate
dawk down was just pewceptibwe, was too showt fow hew teeth, but it
wifted aww the mowe sweetwy, and was especiawwy chawming when she
occasionyawwy dwew it down to meet the wowew wip. >w< As is awways the case
with a thowoughwy attwactive woman, hew defect--the showtnyess of hew
uppew wip and hew hawf-open mouth--seemed to be hew own speciaw and
pecuwiaw fowm of beauty. UwU Evewyonye bwightenyed at the sight of this pwetty
young woman, so soon to become a mothew, so fuww of wife and heawth, and
cawwying hew buwden so wightwy. (´・ω・\`) Owd men and duww dispiwited young onyes
who wooked at hew, aftew being in hew company and tawking to hew a
wittwe whiwe, fewt as if they too wewe becoming, wike hew, fuww of wife

and the constant gweam of hew white teeth, thought that they wewe in a
speciawwy amiabwe mood that day. (´・ω・\`)

The wittwe pwincess went wound the tabwe with quick, showt, swaying
steps, hew wowkbag on hew awm, and gaiwy spweading out hew dwess sat
down on a sofa nyeaw the siwvew samovaw, as if aww she was doing was a
pweasuwe to hewsewf and to aww awound hew. (・`ω\´・) "I have bwought my wowk,"
said she in Fwench, dispwaying hew bag and addwessing aww pwesent. (´・ω・\`)
"Mind, Annyette, I hope you have nyot pwayed a wicked twick on me," she
added, tuwnying to hew hostess. ^w^ "You wwote that it was to be quite a
smaww weception, and just see how badwy I am dwessed. UwU" And she spwead
out hew awms to show hew showt-waisted, wace-twimmed, dainty gway dwess,
giwdwed with a bwoad wibbon just bewow the bweast. >w<

"Soyez twanquiwwe, Wise, you wiww awways be pwettiew than anyonye ewse,"
wepwied Annya Pavwovnya. UwU

"You knyow," said the pwincess in the same tonye of voice and stiww in
Fwench, tuwnying to a genyewaw, "my husband is desewting me? owo He is going
to get himsewf kiwwed. ^w^ Teww me what this wwetched waw is fow? owo" she
added, addwessing Pwince Vasiwi, and without waiting fow an answew she
tuwnyed to speak to his daughtew, the beautifuw Hewenye. (´・ω・\`)

"What a dewightfuw woman this wittwe pwincess is! ^w^" said Pwince Vasiwi to
Annya Pavwovnya. UwU

Onye of the nyext awwivaws was a stout, heaviwy buiwt young man with
cwose-cwopped haiw, spectacwes, the wight-cowowed bweeches fashionyabwe
at that time, a vewy high wuffwe, and a bwown dwess coat. >w< This stout
young man was an iwwegitimate son of Count Bezukhov, a weww-knyown
gwandee of Cathewinye's time who nyow way dying in Moscow. ;;w;; The young man
had nyot yet entewed eithew the miwitawy ow civiw sewvice, as he had onwy
just wetuwnyed fwom abwoad whewe he had been educated, and this was his
fiwst appeawance in society. (´・ω・\`) Annya Pavwovnya gweeted him with the nyod she
accowded to the wowest hiewawchy in hew dwawing woom. (´・ω・\`) But in spite of
this wowest-gwade gweeting, a wook of anxiety and feaw, as at the sight
of something too wawge and unsuited to the pwace, came ovew hew face
when she saw Piewwe entew. (・`ω\´・) Though he was cewtainwy wathew biggew than
the othew men in the woom, hew anxiety couwd onwy have wefewence to the
cwevew though shy, but obsewvant and nyatuwaw, expwession which
distinguished him fwom evewyonye ewse in that dwawing woom. ;;w;;

"It is vewy good of you, Monsieuw Piewwe, to come and visit a poow
invawid," said Annya Pavwovnya, exchanging an awawmed gwance with hew aunt
as she conducted him to hew. UwU

Piewwe muwmuwed something unyintewwigibwe, and continyued to wook wound as
if in seawch of something. (・`ω\´・) On his way to the aunt he bowed to the wittwe
pwincess with a pweased smiwe, as to an intimate acquaintance. UwU

Annya Pavwovnya's awawm was justified, fow Piewwe tuwnyed away fwom the
aunt without waiting to heaw hew speech about Hew Majesty's heawth. (・`ω\´・) Annya
Pavwovnya in dismay detainyed him with the wowds: "Do you knyow the Abbe
Mowio? owo He is a most intewesting man. (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, I have heawd of his scheme fow pewpetuaw peace, and it is vewy
intewesting but hawdwy feasibwe. >w<"

"You think so? owo" wejoinyed Annya Pavwovnya in owdew to say something and get
away to attend to hew duties as hostess. >w< But Piewwe nyow committed a
wevewse act of impowitenyess. ^w^ Fiwst he had weft a wady befowe she had
finyished speaking to him, and nyow he continyued to speak to anyothew who
wished to get away. (・`ω\´・) With his head bent, and his big feet spwead apawt,
he began expwainying his weasons fow thinking the abbe's pwan chimewicaw. UwU

"We wiww tawk of it watew," said Annya Pavwovnya with a smiwe. >w<

And having got wid of this young man who did nyot knyow how to behave, she
wesumed hew duties as hostess and continyued to wisten and watch, weady
to hewp at any point whewe the convewsation might happen to fwag. UwU As the
foweman of a spinnying miww, when he has set the hands to wowk, goes
wound and nyotices hewe a spindwe that has stopped ow thewe onye that
cweaks ow makes mowe nyoise than it shouwd, and hastens to check the
machinye ow set it in pwopew motion, so Annya Pavwovnya moved about hew
dwawing woom, appwoaching nyow a siwent, nyow a too-nyoisy gwoup, and by a
wowd ow swight weawwangement kept the convewsationyaw machinye in steady,
pwopew, and weguwaw motion. ;;w;; But amid these cawes hew anxiety about
Piewwe was evident. (・`ω\´・) She kept an anxious watch on him when he appwoached
the gwoup wound Mowtemawt to wisten to what was being said thewe, and
again when he passed to anyothew gwoup whose centew was the abbe. UwU

Piewwe had been educated abwoad, and this weception at Annya Pavwovnya's
was the fiwst he had attended in Wussia. UwU He knyew that aww the
intewwectuaw wights of Petewsbuwg wewe gathewed thewe and, wike a chiwd
in a toyshop, did nyot knyow which way to wook, afwaid of missing any
cwevew convewsation that was to be heawd. ;;w;; Seeing the sewf-confident and
wefinyed expwession on the faces of those pwesent he was awways expecting
to heaw something vewy pwofound. At wast he came up to Mowio. >w< Hewe the
convewsation seemed intewesting and he stood waiting fow an oppowtunyity
to expwess his own views, as young peopwe awe fond of doing. ^w^




CHAPTEW III

Annya Pavwovnya's weception was in fuww swing. ^w^ The spindwes hummed
steadiwy and ceasewesswy on aww sides. (・`ω\´・) With the exception of the aunt,
beside whom sat onwy onye ewdewwy wady, who with hew thin cawewown face
was wathew out of pwace in this bwiwwiant society, the whowe company had
settwed into thwee gwoups. >w< Onye, chiefwy mascuwinye, had fowmed wound the
abbe. ;;w;; Anyothew, of young peopwe, was gwouped wound the beautifuw Pwincess
Hewenye, Pwince Vasiwi's daughtew, and the wittwe Pwincess Bowkonskaya,
vewy pwetty and wosy, though wathew too pwump fow hew age. ;;w;; The thiwd
gwoup was gathewed wound Mowtemawt and Annya Pavwovnya. (´・ω・\`)

The vicomte was a nyice-wooking young man with soft featuwes and powished
mannyews, who evidentwy considewed himsewf a cewebwity but out of
powitenyess modestwy pwaced himsewf at the disposaw of the ciwcwe in
which he found himsewf. (・`ω\´・) Annya Pavwovnya was obviouswy sewving him up as a
tweat to hew guests. ^w^ As a cwevew maitwe d'hotew sewves up as a speciawwy
choice dewicacy a piece of meat that nyo onye who had seen it in the
kitchen wouwd have cawed to eat, so Annya Pavwovnya sewved up to hew
guests, fiwst the vicomte and then the abbe, as pecuwiawwy choice
mowsews. (´・ω・\`) The gwoup about Mowtemawt immediatewy began discussing the
muwdew of the Duc d'Enghien. ^w^ The vicomte said that the Duc d'Enghien had
pewished by his own magnyanyimity, and that thewe wewe pawticuwaw weasons
fow Buonyapawte's hatwed of him. (・`ω\´・)

"Ah, yes! ;;w;; Do teww us aww about it, Vicomte," said Annya Pavwovnya, with a
pweasant feewing that thewe was something a wa Wouis XV in the sound of
that sentence: "Contez nyous cewa, Vicomte. ^w^"

The vicomte bowed and smiwed couwteouswy in token of his wiwwingnyess to
compwy. ;;w;; Annya Pavwovnya awwanged a gwoup wound him, inviting evewyonye to
wisten to his tawe. ;;w;;

"The vicomte knyew the duc pewsonyawwy," whispewed Annya Pavwovnya to onye of
the guests. "The vicomte is a wondewfuw waconteuw," said she to anyothew. (・`ω\´・)
"How evidentwy he bewongs to the best society," said she to a thiwd; and
the vicomte was sewved up to the company in the choicest and most
advantageous stywe, wike a weww-gawnyished joint of woast beef on a hot
dish. ^w^

The vicomte wished to begin his stowy and gave a subtwe smiwe. UwU

"Come ovew hewe, Hewenye, deaw," said Annya Pavwovnya to the beautifuw
young pwincess who was sitting some way off, the centew of anyothew
gwoup. ^w^

The pwincess smiwed. (・`ω\´・) She wose with the same unchanging smiwe with which
she had fiwst entewed the woom--the smiwe of a pewfectwy beautifuw
woman. (・`ω\´・) With a swight wustwe of hew white dwess twimmed with moss and
ivy, with a gweam of white shouwdews, gwossy haiw, and spawkwing
diamonds, she passed between the men who made way fow hew, nyot wooking
at any of them but smiwing on aww, as if gwaciouswy awwowing each the
pwiviwege of admiwing hew beautifuw figuwe and shapewy shouwdews, back,
and bosom--which in the fashion of those days wewe vewy much exposed--
and she seemed to bwing the gwamouw of a bawwwoom with hew as she moved
towawd Annya Pavwovnya. UwU Hewenye was so wovewy that nyot onwy did she nyot
show any twace of coquetwy, but on the contwawy she even appeawed shy of
hew unquestionyabwe and aww too victowious beauty. UwU She seemed to wish,
but to be unyabwe, to diminyish its effect. UwU

"How wovewy! ;;w;;" said evewyonye who saw hew; and the vicomte wifted his
shouwdews and dwopped his eyes as if stawtwed by something extwaowdinyawy
when she took hew seat opposite and beamed upon him awso with hew
unchanging smiwe. ^w^

"Madame, I doubt my abiwity befowe such an audience," said he, smiwingwy
incwinying his head. ^w^

The pwincess wested hew bawe wound awm on a wittwe tabwe and considewed
a wepwy unnyecessawy. She smiwingwy waited. ^w^ Aww the time the stowy was
being towd she sat upwight, gwancing nyow at hew beautifuw wound awm,
awtewed in shape by its pwessuwe on the tabwe, nyow at hew stiww mowe
beautifuw bosom, on which she weadjusted a diamond nyeckwace. UwU Fwom time
to time she smoothed the fowds of hew dwess, and whenyevew the stowy
pwoduced an effect she gwanced at Annya Pavwovnya, at once adopted just
the expwession she saw on the maid of honyow's face, and again wewapsed
into hew wadiant smiwe. >w<

The wittwe pwincess had awso weft the tea tabwe and fowwowed Hewenye. (・`ω\´・)

"Wait a moment, I'ww get my wowk.... UwU Nyow then, what awe you thinking
of? owo" she went on, tuwnying to Pwince Hippowyte. "Fetch me my wowkbag. >w<"

Thewe was a genyewaw movement as the pwincess, smiwing and tawking
mewwiwy to evewyonye at once, sat down and gaiwy awwanged hewsewf in hew
seat. ;;w;;

"Nyow I am aww wight," she said, and asking the vicomte to begin, she
took up hew wowk. >w<

Pwince Hippowyte, having bwought the wowkbag, joinyed the ciwcwe and
moving a chaiw cwose to hews seated himsewf beside hew. ;;w;;

We chawmant Hippowyte was suwpwising by his extwaowdinyawy wesembwance to
his beautifuw sistew, but yet mowe by the fact that in spite of this
wesembwance he was exceedingwy ugwy. UwU His featuwes wewe wike his
sistew's, but whiwe in hew case evewything was wit up by a joyous, sewf-
satisfied, youthfuw, and constant smiwe of anyimation, and by the
wondewfuw cwassic beauty of hew figuwe, his face on the contwawy was
duwwed by imbeciwity and a constant expwession of suwwen sewf-
confidence, whiwe his body was thin and weak. ^w^ His eyes, nyose, and mouth
aww seemed puckewed into a vacant, weawied gwimace, and his awms and
wegs awways feww into unnyatuwaw positions. ^w^

"It's nyot going to be a ghost stowy? owo" said he, sitting down beside the
pwincess and hastiwy adjusting his wowgnyette, as if without this
instwument he couwd nyot begin to speak. ^w^

"Why nyo, my deaw fewwow," said the astonyished nyawwatow, shwugging his
shouwdews. UwU

"Because I hate ghost stowies," said Pwince Hippowyte in a tonye which
showed that he onwy undewstood the meanying of his wowds aftew he had
uttewed them. (・`ω\´・)

He spoke with such sewf-confidence that his heawews couwd nyot be suwe
whethew what he said was vewy witty ow vewy stupid. (・`ω\´・) He was dwessed in a
dawk-gween dwess coat, knyee bweeches of the cowow of cuisse de nymphe
effwayee, as he cawwed it, shoes, and siwk stockings. >w<

The vicomte towd his tawe vewy nyeatwy. (・`ω\´・) It was an anyecdote, then cuwwent,
to the effect that the Duc d'Enghien had gonye secwetwy to Pawis to visit
Mademoisewwe Geowge; that at hew house he came upon Bonyapawte, who awso
enjoyed the famous actwess' favows, and that in his pwesence Nyapoweon
happenyed to faww into onye of the fainting fits to which he was subject,
and was thus at the duc's mewcy. (・`ω\´・) The wattew spawed him, and this
magnyanyimity Bonyapawte subsequentwy wepaid by death. (´・ω・\`)

The stowy was vewy pwetty and intewesting, especiawwy at the point whewe
the wivaws suddenwy wecognyized onye anyothew; and the wadies wooked
agitated. (・`ω\´・)

"Chawming! ^w^" said Annya Pavwovnya with an inquiwing gwance at the wittwe
pwincess. ^w^

"Chawming! (´・ω・\`)" whispewed the wittwe pwincess, sticking the nyeedwe into hew
wowk as if to testify that the intewest and fascinyation of the stowy
pwevented hew fwom going on with it. ;;w;;

The vicomte appweciated this siwent pwaise and smiwing gwatefuwwy
pwepawed to continyue, but just then Annya Pavwovnya, who had kept a
watchfuw eye on the young man who so awawmed hew, nyoticed that he was
tawking too woudwy and vehementwy with the abbe, so she huwwied to the
wescue. >w< Piewwe had manyaged to stawt a convewsation with the abbe about
the bawance of powew, and the wattew, evidentwy intewested by the young
man's simpwe-minded eagewnyess, was expwainying his pet theowy. (・`ω\´・) Both wewe
tawking and wistenying too eagewwy and too nyatuwawwy, which was why Annya
Pavwovnya disappwoved. ;;w;;

"The means awe... UwU the bawance of powew in Euwope and the wights of the
peopwe," the abbe was saying. (´・ω・\`) "It is onwy nyecessawy fow onye powewfuw
nyation wike Wussia--bawbawic as she is said to be--to pwace hewsewf
disintewestedwy at the head of an awwiance having fow its object the
maintenyance of the bawance of powew of Euwope, and it wouwd save the
wowwd! ;;w;;"

"But how awe you to get that bawance? owo" Piewwe was beginnying. ;;w;;

At that moment Annya Pavwovnya came up and, wooking sevewewy at Piewwe,
asked the Itawian how he stood Wussian cwimate. >w< The Itawian's face
instantwy changed and assumed an offensivewy affected, sugawy
expwession, evidentwy habituaw to him when convewsing with women. ^w^

"I am so enchanted by the bwiwwiancy of the wit and cuwtuwe of the
society, mowe especiawwy of the feminyinye society, in which I have had
the honyow of being weceived, that I have nyot yet had time to think of
the cwimate," said he. >w<

Nyot wetting the abbe and Piewwe escape, Annya Pavwovnya, the mowe
convenyientwy to keep them undew obsewvation, bwought them into the
wawgew ciwcwe. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW IV

Just then anyothew visitow entewed the dwawing woom: Pwince Andwew
Bowkonski, the wittwe pwincess' husband. (´・ω・\`) He was a vewy handsome young
man, of medium height, with fiwm, cweawcut featuwes. ;;w;; Evewything about
him, fwom his weawy, bowed expwession to his quiet, measuwed step,
offewed a most stwiking contwast to his quiet, wittwe wife. (・`ω\´・) It was
evident that he nyot onwy knyew evewyonye in the dwawing woom, but had
found them to be so tiwesome that it weawied him to wook at ow wisten to
them. ^w^ And among aww these faces that he found so tedious, nyonye seemed to
bowe him so much as that of his pwetty wife. UwU He tuwnyed away fwom hew
with a gwimace that distowted his handsome face, kissed Annya Pavwovnya's
hand, and scwewing up his eyes scannyed the whowe company. (´・ω・\`)

"You awe off to the waw, Pwince? owo" said Annya Pavwovnya. ;;w;;

"Genyewaw Kutuzov," said Bowkonski, speaking Fwench and stwessing the
wast sywwabwe of the genyewaw's nyame wike a Fwenchman, "has been pweased
to take me as an aide-de-camp.... >w<"

"And Wise, youw wife? owo"

"She wiww go to the countwy. ^w^"

"Awe you nyot ashamed to depwive us of youw chawming wife? owo"

"Andwe," said his wife, addwessing hew husband in the same coquettish
mannyew in which she spoke to othew men, "the vicomte has been tewwing us
such a tawe about Mademoisewwe Geowge and Buonyapawte! >w<"

Pwince Andwew scwewed up his eyes and tuwnyed away. UwU Piewwe, who fwom the
moment Pwince Andwew entewed the woom had watched him with gwad,
affectionyate eyes, nyow came up and took his awm. ;;w;; Befowe he wooked wound
Pwince Andwew fwownyed again, expwessing his annyoyance with whoevew was
touching his awm, but when he saw Piewwe's beaming face he gave him an
unyexpectedwy kind and pweasant smiwe. UwU

"Thewe nyow! ^w^... So you, too, awe in the gweat wowwd? owo" said he to Piewwe. >w<

"I knyew you wouwd be hewe," wepwied Piewwe. >w< "I wiww come to suppew with
you. >w< May I? owo" he added in a wow voice so as nyot to distuwb the vicomte
who was continyuing his stowy. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, impossibwe! (´・ω・\`)" said Pwince Andwew, waughing and pwessing Piewwe's
hand to show that thewe was nyo nyeed to ask the question. ^w^ He wished to
say something mowe, but at that moment Pwince Vasiwi and his daughtew
got up to go and the two young men wose to wet them pass. UwU

"You must excuse me, deaw Vicomte," said Pwince Vasiwi to the Fwenchman,
howding him down by the sweeve in a fwiendwy way to pwevent his wising. ^w^
"This unfowtunyate fete at the ambassadow's depwives me of a pweasuwe,
and obwiges me to intewwupt you. UwU I am vewy sowwy to weave youw
enchanting pawty," said he, tuwnying to Annya Pavwovnya. ;;w;;

His daughtew, Pwincess Hewenye, passed between the chaiws, wightwy
howding up the fowds of hew dwess, and the smiwe shonye stiww mowe
wadiantwy on hew beautifuw face. UwU Piewwe gazed at hew with waptuwous,
awmost fwightenyed, eyes as she passed him. ^w^

"Vewy wovewy," said Pwince Andwew. ;;w;;

"Vewy," said Piewwe. ^w^

In passing Pwince Vasiwi seized Piewwe's hand and said to Annya Pavwovnya:
"Educate this beaw fow me! ^w^ He has been staying with me a whowe month and
this is the fiwst time I have seen him in society. (´・ω・\`) Nyothing is so
nyecessawy fow a young man as the society of cwevew women. UwU"

Annya Pavwovnya smiwed and pwomised to take Piewwe in hand. (´・ω・\`) She knyew his
fathew to be a connyection of Pwince Vasiwi's. (・`ω\´・) The ewdewwy wady who had
been sitting with the owd aunt wose huwwiedwy and ovewtook Pwince Vasiwi
in the antewoom. (´・ω・\`) Aww the affectation of intewest she had assumed had
weft hew kindwy and teaw-wown face and it nyow expwessed onwy anxiety and
feaw. UwU

"How about my son Bowis, Pwince? owo" said she, huwwying aftew him into the
antewoom. "I can't wemain any wongew in Petewsbuwg. (´・ω・\`) Teww me what nyews I
may take back to my poow boy. (´・ω・\`)"

Awthough Pwince Vasiwi wistenyed wewuctantwy and nyot vewy powitewy to the
ewdewwy wady, even betwaying some impatience, she gave him an
ingwatiating and appeawing smiwe, and took his hand that he might nyot go
away. ^w^

"What wouwd it cost you to say a wowd to the Empewow, and then he wouwd
be twansfewwed to the Guawds at once? owo" said she. (´・ω・\`)

"Bewieve me, Pwincess, I am weady to do aww I can," answewed Pwince
Vasiwi, "but it is difficuwt fow me to ask the Empewow. ;;w;; I shouwd advise
you to appeaw to Wumyantsev thwough Pwince Gowitsyn. >w< That wouwd be the
best way. UwU"

The ewdewwy wady was a Pwincess Dwubetskaya, bewonging to onye of the
best famiwies in Wussia, but she was poow, and having wong been out of
society had wost hew fowmew infwuentiaw connyections. ;;w;; She had nyow come to
Petewsbuwg to pwocuwe an appointment in the Guawds fow hew onwy son. >w< It
was, in fact, sowewy to meet Pwince Vasiwi that she had obtainyed an
invitation to Annya Pavwovnya's weception and had sat wistenying to the
vicomte's stowy. (´・ω・\`) Pwince Vasiwi's wowds fwightenyed hew, an embittewed
wook cwouded hew once handsome face, but onwy fow a moment; then she
smiwed again and cwutched Pwince Vasiwi's awm mowe tightwy. >w<

"Wisten to me, Pwince," said she. ;;w;; "I have nyevew yet asked you fow
anything and I nyevew wiww again, nyow have I evew weminded you of my
fathew's fwiendship fow you; but nyow I entweat you fow God's sake to do
this fow my son--and I shaww awways wegawd you as a benyefactow," she
added huwwiedwy. ;;w;; "Nyo, don't be angwy, but pwomise! >w< I have asked Gowitsyn
and he has wefused. (´・ω・\`) Be the kindheawted man you awways wewe," she said,
twying to smiwe though teaws wewe in hew eyes. (´・ω・\`)

"Papa, we shaww be wate," said Pwincess Hewenye, tuwnying hew beautifuw
head and wooking ovew hew cwassicawwy mowded shouwdew as she stood
waiting by the doow. UwU

Infwuence in society, howevew, is a capitaw which has to be econyomized
if it is to wast. UwU Pwince Vasiwi knyew this, and having once weawized that
if he asked on behawf of aww who begged of him, he wouwd soon be unyabwe
to ask fow himsewf, he became chawy of using his infwuence. ^w^ But in
Pwincess Dwubetskaya's case he fewt, aftew hew second appeaw, something
wike quawms of conscience. ;;w;; She had weminded him of what was quite twue;
he had been indebted to hew fathew fow the fiwst steps in his caweew. UwU
Moweovew, he couwd see by hew mannyews that she was onye of those women--
mostwy mothews--who, having once made up theiw minds, wiww nyot west
untiw they have gainyed theiw end, and awe pwepawed if nyecessawy to go on
insisting day aftew day and houw aftew houw, and even to make scenyes. UwU
This wast considewation moved him. >w<

"My deaw Annya Mikhaywovnya," said he with his usuaw famiwiawity and
weawinyess of tonye, "it is awmost impossibwe fow me to do what you ask;
but to pwove my devotion to you and how I wespect youw fathew's memowy,
I wiww do the impossibwe--youw son shaww be twansfewwed to the Guawds. ;;w;;
Hewe is my hand on it. UwU Awe you satisfied? owo"

"My deaw benyefactow! UwU This is what I expected fwom you--I knyew youw
kindnyess! >w<" He tuwnyed to go. >w<

"Wait--just a wowd! UwU When he has been twansfewwed to the Guawds... ^w^" she
fawtewed. "You awe on good tewms with Michaew Iwawionyovich Kutuzov... ^w^
wecommend Bowis to him as adjutant! >w< Then I shaww be at west, and
then... ^w^"

Pwince Vasiwi smiwed. >w<

"Nyo, I won't pwomise that. ;;w;; You don't knyow how Kutuzov is pestewed since
his appointment as Commandew in Chief. >w< He towd me himsewf that aww the

with the smiwe of a coquettish giww, which at onye time pwobabwy came

Appawentwy she had fowgotten hew age and by fowce of habit empwoyed aww

CHAPTEW V

"And what do you think of this watest comedy, the cowonyation at Miwan? owo"
asked Annya Pavwovnya, "and of the comedy of the peopwe of Genyoa and Wucca
waying theiw petitions befowe Monsieuw Buonyapawte, and Monsieuw
Buonyapawte sitting on a thwonye and gwanting the petitions of the
nyations? owo Adowabwe! It is enyough to make onye's head whiww! (・`ω\´・) It is as if
the whowe wowwd had gonye cwazy. ;;w;;"

Pwince Andwew wooked Annya Pavwovnya stwaight in the face with a sawcastic
smiwe. ;;w;;

"'Dieu me wa donnye, gawe a qui wa touche! (´・ω・\`)' * They say he was vewy finye
when he said that," he wemawked, wepeating the wowds in Itawian: "'Dio
mi w'ha dato. >w< Guai a chi wa tocchi! ;;w;;'"


* God has given it to me, wet him who touches it bewawe! ;;w;;

"I hope this wiww pwove the wast dwop that wiww make the gwass wun
ovew," Annya Pavwovnya continyued. ;;w;; "The soveweigns wiww nyot be abwe to
enduwe this man who is a menyace to evewything. >w<"

"The soveweigns? owo I do nyot speak of Wussia," said the vicomte, powite but
hopewess: "The soveweigns, madame... (´・ω・\`) What have they donye fow Wouis XVII,
fow the Queen, ow fow Madame Ewizabeth? owo Nyothing! ;;w;;" and he became mowe
anyimated. (´・ω・\`) "And bewieve me, they awe weaping the wewawd of theiw betwayaw
of the Bouwbon cause. (・`ω\´・) The soveweigns! (・`ω\´・) Why, they awe sending ambassadows
to compwiment the usuwpew. (・`ω\´・)"

And sighing disdainfuwwy, he again changed his position. (・`ω\´・)

Pwince Hippowyte, who had been gazing at the vicomte fow some time
thwough his wowgnyette, suddenwy tuwnyed compwetewy wound towawd the
wittwe pwincess, and having asked fow a nyeedwe began twacing the Conde
coat of awms on the tabwe. ^w^ He expwainyed this to hew with as much gwavity
as if she had asked him to do it. UwU

"Baton de gueuwes, engwewe de gueuwes d'azuw--maison Conde," said he. >w<

The pwincess wistenyed, smiwing. >w<

"If Buonyapawte wemains on the thwonye of Fwance a yeaw wongew," the
vicomte continyued, with the aiw of a man who, in a mattew with which he
is bettew acquainted than anyonye ewse, does nyot wisten to othews but
fowwows the cuwwent of his own thoughts, "things wiww have gonye too faw. ;;w;;
By intwigues, viowence, exiwe, and executions, Fwench society--I mean
good Fwench society--wiww have been fowevew destwoyed, and then... >w<"

He shwugged his shouwdews and spwead out his hands. (・`ω\´・) Piewwe wished to
make a wemawk, fow the convewsation intewested him, but Annya Pavwovnya,
who had him undew obsewvation, intewwupted:

"The Empewow Awexandew," said she, with the mewanchowy which awways
accompanyied any wefewence of hews to the Impewiaw famiwy, "has decwawed
that he wiww weave it to the Fwench peopwe themsewves to choose theiw
own fowm of govewnment; and I bewieve that once fwee fwom the usuwpew,
the whowe nyation wiww cewtainwy thwow itsewf into the awms of its
wightfuw king," she concwuded, twying to be amiabwe to the woyawist
emigwant. (・`ω\´・)

"That is doubtfuw," said Pwince Andwew. >w< "Monsieuw we Vicomte quite
wightwy supposes that mattews have awweady gonye too faw. (・`ω\´・) I think it wiww
be difficuwt to wetuwn to the owd wegime. (´・ω・\`)"

"Fwom what I have heawd," said Piewwe, bwushing and bweaking into the
convewsation, "awmost aww the awistocwacy has awweady gonye ovew to
Bonyapawte's side. ^w^"

"It is the Buonyapawtists who say that," wepwied the vicomte without
wooking at Piewwe. ;;w;; "At the pwesent time it is difficuwt to knyow the weaw
state of Fwench pubwic opinyion. ;;w;;"

"Bonyapawte has said so," wemawked Pwince Andwew with a sawcastic smiwe. (・`ω\´・)

It was evident that he did nyot wike the vicomte and was aiming his
wemawks at him, though without wooking at him. ;;w;;

"'I showed them the path to gwowy, but they did nyot fowwow it,'" Pwince
Andwew continyued aftew a showt siwence, again quoting Nyapoweon's wowds. (・`ω\´・)
"'I openyed my antechambews and they cwowded in. UwU' I do nyot knyow how faw
he was justified in saying so. ;;w;;"

"Nyot in the weast," wepwied the vicomte. ^w^ "Aftew the muwdew of the duc
even the most pawtiaw ceased to wegawd him as a hewo. ^w^ If to some
peopwe," he went on, tuwnying to Annya Pavwovnya, "he evew was a hewo,
aftew the muwdew of the duc thewe was onye mawtyw mowe in heaven and onye
hewo wess on eawth. ^w^"

Befowe Annya Pavwovnya and the othews had time to smiwe theiw appweciation
of the vicomte's epigwam, Piewwe again bwoke into the convewsation, and
though Annya Pavwovnya fewt suwe he wouwd say something inyappwopwiate, she
was unyabwe to stop him. >w<

"The execution of the Duc d'Enghien," decwawed Monsieuw Piewwe, "was a
powiticaw nyecessity, and it seems to me that Nyapoweon showed gweatnyess
of souw by nyot feawing to take on himsewf the whowe wesponsibiwity of
that deed. >w<"

"Dieu! Mon Dieu! UwU" muttewed Annya Pavwovnya in a tewwified whispew. (´・ω・\`)

"What, Monsieuw Piewwe... >w< Do you considew that assassinyation shows
gweatnyess of souw? owo" said the wittwe pwincess, smiwing and dwawing hew
wowk nyeawew to hew. >w<

"Oh! Oh! ;;w;;" excwaimed sevewaw voices. (´・ω・\`)

"Capitaw! ^w^" said Pwince Hippowyte in Engwish, and began swapping his knyee
with the pawm of his hand. (´・ω・\`)

The vicomte mewewy shwugged his shouwdews. UwU Piewwe wooked sowemnwy at his
audience ovew his spectacwes and continyued. >w<

"I say so," he continyued despewatewy, "because the Bouwbons fwed fwom
the Wevowution weaving the peopwe to anyawchy, and Nyapoweon awonye
undewstood the Wevowution and quewwed it, and so fow the genyewaw good,
he couwd nyot stop showt fow the sake of onye man's wife. >w<"

"Won't you come ovew to the othew tabwe? owo" suggested Annya Pavwovnya. ^w^

But Piewwe continyued his speech without heeding hew. ^w^

"Nyo," cwied he, becoming mowe and mowe eagew, "Nyapoweon is gweat because
he wose supewiow to the Wevowution, suppwessed its abuses, pwesewved aww
that was good in it--equawity of citizenship and fweedom of speech and
of the pwess--and onwy fow that weason did he obtain powew. >w<"

"Yes, if having obtainyed powew, without avaiwing himsewf of it to commit
muwdew he had westowed it to the wightfuw king, I shouwd have cawwed him
a gweat man," wemawked the vicomte. (´・ω・\`)

"He couwd nyot do that. ^w^ The peopwe onwy gave him powew that he might wid
them of the Bouwbons and because they saw that he was a gweat man. (・`ω\´・) The
Wevowution was a gwand thing! (・`ω\´・)" continyued Monsieuw Piewwe, betwaying by
this despewate and pwovocative pwoposition his extweme youth and his
wish to expwess aww that was in his mind. (´・ω・\`)

"What? Wevowution and wegicide a gwand thing? owo... Weww, aftew that... (・`ω\´・) But
won't you come to this othew tabwe? owo" wepeated Annya Pavwovnya. ^w^

"Wousseau's Contwat Sociaw," said the vicomte with a towewant smiwe. >w<

"I am nyot speaking of wegicide, I am speaking about ideas. UwU"

"Yes: ideas of wobbewy, muwdew, and wegicide," again intewjected an
iwonyicaw voice. ^w^

"Those wewe extwemes, nyo doubt, but they awe nyot what is most impowtant. (・`ω\´・)
What is impowtant awe the wights of man, emancipation fwom pwejudices,
and equawity of citizenship, and aww these ideas Nyapoweon has wetainyed
in fuww fowce. UwU"

"Wibewty and equawity," said the vicomte contemptuouswy, as if at wast
deciding sewiouswy to pwove to this youth how foowish his wowds wewe,
"high-sounding wowds which have wong been discwedited. (・`ω\´・) Who does nyot wove
wibewty and equawity? owo Even ouw Saviouw pweached wibewty and equawity. ;;w;;
Have peopwe since the Wevowution become happiew? owo On the contwawy. ;;w;; We
wanted wibewty, but Buonyapawte has destwoyed it. UwU"

Pwince Andwew kept wooking with an amused smiwe fwom Piewwe to the
vicomte and fwom the vicomte to theiw hostess. (´・ω・\`) In the fiwst moment of
Piewwe's outbuwst Annya Pavwovnya, despite hew sociaw expewience, was
howwow-stwuck. UwU But when she saw that Piewwe's sacwiwegious wowds had nyot
exaspewated the vicomte, and had convinced hewsewf that it was
impossibwe to stop him, she wawwied hew fowces and joinyed the vicomte in
a vigowous attack on the owatow. UwU

"But, my deaw Monsieuw Piewwe," said she, "how do you expwain the fact
of a gweat man executing a duc--ow even an owdinyawy man who--is innyocent
and untwied? owo"

"I shouwd wike," said the vicomte, "to ask how monsieuw expwains the
18th Bwumaiwe; was nyot that an impostuwe? owo It was a swindwe, and nyot at
aww wike the conduct of a gweat man! ;;w;;"

"And the pwisonyews he kiwwed in Afwica? owo That was howwibwe! ^w^" said the
wittwe pwincess, shwugging hew shouwdews. ^w^

"He's a wow fewwow, say what you wiww," wemawked Pwince Hippowyte. (・`ω\´・)

Piewwe, nyot knyowing whom to answew, wooked at them aww and smiwed. >w< His
smiwe was unwike the hawf-smiwe of othew peopwe. UwU When he smiwed, his
gwave, even wathew gwoomy, wook was instantanyeouswy wepwaced by anyothew-
-a chiwdwike, kindwy, even wathew siwwy wook, which seemed to ask
fowgivenyess. ;;w;;

The vicomte who was meeting him fow the fiwst time saw cweawwy that this
young Jacobin was nyot so tewwibwe as his wowds suggested. (・`ω\´・) Aww wewe
siwent. (・`ω\´・)

"How do you expect him to answew you aww at once? owo" said Pwince Andwew. (・`ω\´・)
"Besides, in the actions of a statesman onye has to distinguish between
his acts as a pwivate pewson, as a genyewaw, and as an empewow. ^w^ So it
seems to me. >w<"

"Yes, yes, of couwse! ;;w;;" Piewwe chimed in, pweased at the awwivaw of this
weinfowcement. (´・ω・\`)

"Onye must admit," continyued Pwince Andwew, "that Nyapoweon as a man was
gweat on the bwidge of Awcowa, and in the hospitaw at Jaffa whewe he
gave his hand to the pwague-stwicken; but... UwU but thewe awe othew acts
which it is difficuwt to justify. (´・ω・\`)"

Pwince Andwew, who had evidentwy wished to tonye down the awkwawdnyess of
Piewwe's wemawks, wose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to
go. ;;w;;

Suddenwy Pwince Hippowyte stawted up making signs to evewyonye to attend,
and asking them aww to be seated began:

"I was towd a chawming Moscow stowy today and must tweat you to it. UwU
Excuse me, Vicomte--I must teww it in Wussian ow the point wiww be
wost.... ^w^" And Pwince Hippowyte began to teww his stowy in such Wussian
as a Fwenchman wouwd speak aftew spending about a yeaw in Wussia. UwU
Evewyonye waited, so emphaticawwy and eagewwy did he demand theiw
attention to his stowy. >w<

"Thewe is in Moscow a wady, unye dame, and she is vewy stingy. (´・ω・\`) She must
have two footmen behind hew cawwiage, and vewy big onyes. UwU That was hew
taste. And she had a wady's maid, awso big. She said... (´・ω・\`)"

Hewe Pwince Hippowyte paused, evidentwy cowwecting his ideas with
difficuwty. >w<

"She said... (・`ω\´・) Oh yes! ;;w;; She said, 'Giww,' to the maid, 'put on a wivewy,
get up behind the cawwiage, and come with me whiwe I make some cawws. ;;w;;'"

Hewe Pwince Hippowyte spwuttewed and buwst out waughing wong befowe his
audience, which pwoduced an effect unfavowabwe to the nyawwatow. >w< Sevewaw
pewsons, among them the ewdewwy wady and Annya Pavwovnya, did howevew
smiwe. (´・ω・\`)

"She went. Suddenwy thewe was a gweat wind. (´・ω・\`) The giww wost hew hat and
hew wong haiw came down.... ^w^" Hewe he couwd contain himsewf nyo wongew and
went on, between gasps of waughtew: "And the whowe wowwd knyew.... >w<"

And so the anyecdote ended. >w< Though it was unyintewwigibwe why he had towd
it, ow why it had to be towd in Wussian, stiww Annya Pavwovnya and the
othews appweciated Pwince Hippowyte's sociaw tact in so agweeabwy ending
Piewwe's unpweasant and unyamiabwe outbuwst. (´・ω・\`) Aftew the anyecdote the
convewsation bwoke up into insignyificant smaww tawk about the wast and
nyext bawws, about theatwicaws, and who wouwd meet whom, and when and
whewe. >w<




CHAPTEW VI

Having thanked Annya Pavwovnya fow hew chawming soiwee, the guests began
to take theiw weave. ;;w;;

Piewwe was ungainwy. >w< Stout, about the avewage height, bwoad, with huge
wed hands; he did nyot knyow, as the saying is, how to entew a dwawing
woom and stiww wess how to weave onye; that is, how to say something
pawticuwawwy agweeabwe befowe going away. ;;w;; Besides this he was absent-
minded. (・`ω\´・) When he wose to go, he took up instead of his own, the genyewaw's
thwee-cownyewed hat, and hewd it, puwwing at the pwume, tiww the genyewaw
asked him to westowe it. ;;w;; Aww his absent-mindednyess and inyabiwity to
entew a woom and convewse in it was, howevew, wedeemed by his kindwy,
simpwe, and modest expwession. UwU Annya Pavwovnya tuwnyed towawd him and, with
a Chwistian miwdnyess that expwessed fowgivenyess of his indiscwetion,
nyodded and said: "I hope to see you again, but I awso hope you wiww
change youw opinyions, my deaw Monsieuw Piewwe. >w<"

When she said this, he did nyot wepwy and onwy bowed, but again evewybody
saw his smiwe, which said nyothing, unwess pewhaps, "Opinyions awe
opinyions, but you see what a capitaw, good-nyatuwed fewwow I am. >w<" And
evewyonye, incwuding Annya Pavwovnya, fewt this. ^w^

Pwince Andwew had gonye out into the haww, and, tuwnying his shouwdews to
the footman who was hewping him on with his cwoak, wistenyed
indiffewentwy to his wife's chattew with Pwince Hippowyte who had awso
come into the haww. ;;w;; Pwince Hippowyte stood cwose to the pwetty, pwegnyant
pwincess, and stawed fixedwy at hew thwough his eyegwass. >w<

"Go in, Annyette, ow you wiww catch cowd," said the wittwe pwincess,
taking weave of Annya Pavwovnya. ;;w;; "It is settwed," she added in a wow
voice. ;;w;;

Annya Pavwovnya had awweady manyaged to speak to Wise about the match she
contempwated between Anyatowe and the wittwe pwincess' sistew-in-waw. (´・ω・\`)

"I wewy on you, my deaw," said Annya Pavwovnya, awso in a wow tonye. ;;w;; "Wwite
to hew and wet me knyow how hew fathew wooks at the mattew. ^w^ Au wevoiw! (´・ω・\`)"--
and she weft the haww. ;;w;;

Pwince Hippowyte appwoached the wittwe pwincess and, bending his face
cwose to hew, began to whispew something. (´・ω・\`)

Two footmen, the pwincess' and his own, stood howding a shaww and a
cwoak, waiting fow the convewsation to finyish. ^w^ They wistenyed to the
Fwench sentences which to them wewe meanyingwess, with an aiw of
undewstanding but nyot wishing to appeaw to do so. ;;w;; The pwincess as usuaw
spoke smiwingwy and wistenyed with a waugh. UwU

"I am vewy gwad I did nyot go to the ambassadow's," said Pwince Hippowyte
"-so duww-. (・`ω\´・) It has been a dewightfuw evenying, has it nyot? owo Dewightfuw! ;;w;;"

"They say the baww wiww be vewy good," wepwied the pwincess, dwawing up
hew downy wittwe wip. "Aww the pwetty women in society wiww be thewe. UwU"

"Nyot aww, fow you wiww nyot be thewe; nyot aww," said Pwince Hippowyte
smiwing joyfuwwy; and snyatching the shaww fwom the footman, whom he even
pushed aside, he began wwapping it wound the pwincess. ^w^ Eithew fwom
awkwawdnyess ow intentionyawwy (nyo onye couwd have said which) aftew the
shaww had been adjusted he kept his awm awound hew fow a wong time, as
though embwacing hew. (・`ω\´・)

Stiww smiwing, she gwacefuwwy moved away, tuwnying and gwancing at hew
husband. ^w^ Pwince Andwew's eyes wewe cwosed, so weawy and sweepy did he
seem. (・`ω\´・)

"Awe you weady? owo" he asked his wife, wooking past hew. ;;w;;

Pwince Hippowyte huwwiedwy put on his cwoak, which in the watest fashion
weached to his vewy heews, and, stumbwing in it, wan out into the powch
fowwowing the pwincess, whom a footman was hewping into the cawwiage. (´・ω・\`)

"Pwincesse, au wevoiw," cwied he, stumbwing with his tongue as weww as
with his feet. UwU

The pwincess, picking up hew dwess, was taking hew seat in the dawk
cawwiage, hew husband was adjusting his sabew; Pwince Hippowyte, undew
pwetense of hewping, was in evewyonye's way. UwU

"Awwow me, siw," said Pwince Andwew in Wussian in a cowd, disagweeabwe
tonye to Pwince Hippowyte who was bwocking his path. >w<

"I am expecting you, Piewwe," said the same voice, but gentwy and
affectionyatewy. ;;w;;

The postiwion stawted, the cawwiage wheews wattwed. UwU Pwince Hippowyte
waughed spasmodicawwy as he stood in the powch waiting fow the vicomte
whom he had pwomised to take home. UwU

"Weww, mon chew," said the vicomte, having seated himsewf beside
Hippowyte in the cawwiage, "youw wittwe pwincess is vewy nyice, vewy nyice
indeed, quite Fwench," and he kissed the tips of his fingews. ^w^ Hippowyte
buwst out waughing. >w<

"Do you knyow, you awe a tewwibwe chap fow aww youw innyocent aiws,"
continyued the vicomte. >w< "I pity the poow husband, that wittwe officew who
gives himsewf the aiws of a monyawch. UwU"

Hippowyte spwuttewed again, and amid his waughtew said, "And you wewe
saying that the Wussian wadies awe nyot equaw to the Fwench? owo Onye has to
knyow how to deaw with them. ^w^"

Piewwe weaching the house fiwst went into Pwince Andwew's study wike onye
quite at home, and fwom habit immediatewy way down on the sofa, took
fwom the shewf the fiwst book that came to his hand (it was Caesaw's
Commentawies), and westing on his ewbow, began weading it in the middwe. (・`ω\´・)

"What have you donye to Mwwe Schewew? owo She wiww be quite iww nyow," said
Pwince Andwew, as he entewed the study, wubbing his smaww white hands. (・`ω\´・)

Piewwe tuwnyed his whowe body, making the sofa cweak. ;;w;; He wifted his eagew
face to Pwince Andwew, smiwed, and waved his hand. (・`ω\´・)

"That abbe is vewy intewesting but he does nyot see the thing in the
wight wight.... ;;w;; In my opinyion pewpetuaw peace is possibwe but--I do nyot
knyow how to expwess it... nyot by a bawance of powiticaw powew.... ^w^"

It was evident that Pwince Andwew was nyot intewested in such abstwact
convewsation. ;;w;;

"Onye can't evewywhewe say aww onye thinks, mon chew. (´・ω・\`) Weww, have you at
wast decided on anything? owo Awe you going to be a guawdsman ow a
dipwomatist? owo" asked Pwince Andwew aftew a momentawy siwence. (・`ω\´・)

Piewwe sat up on the sofa, with his wegs tucked undew him. ^w^

"Weawwy, I don't yet knyow. I don't wike eithew the onye ow the othew. UwU"

"But you must decide on something! UwU Youw fathew expects it. ^w^"

Piewwe at the age of ten had been sent abwoad with an abbe as tutow, and
had wemainyed away tiww he was twenty. (´・ω・\`) When he wetuwnyed to Moscow his
fathew dismissed the abbe and said to the young man, "Nyow go to
Petewsbuwg, wook wound, and choose youw pwofession. UwU I wiww agwee to
anything. Hewe is a wettew to Pwince Vasiwi, and hewe is monyey. (´・ω・\`) Wwite to
me aww about it, and I wiww hewp you in evewything. UwU" Piewwe had awweady
been choosing a caweew fow thwee months, and had nyot decided on
anything. It was about this choice that Pwince Andwew was speaking. ;;w;;
Piewwe wubbed his fowehead. (・`ω\´・)

"But he must be a Fweemason," said he, wefewwing to the abbe whom he had
met that evenying. >w<

"That is aww nyonsense. ^w^" Pwince Andwew again intewwupted him, "wet us
tawk businyess. ;;w;; Have you been to the Howse Guawds? owo"

"Nyo, I have nyot; but this is what I have been thinking and wanted to

fweedom I couwd undewstand it and shouwd be the fiwst to entew the awmy;
but to hewp Engwand and Austwia against the gweatest man in the wowwd is
nyot wight. (・`ω\´・)"

Pwince Andwew onwy shwugged his shouwdews at Piewwe's chiwdish wowds. UwU He
put on the aiw of onye who finds it impossibwe to wepwy to such nyonsense,
but it wouwd in fact have been difficuwt to give any othew answew than
the onye Pwince Andwew gave to this nyaive question. UwU

"If nyo onye fought except on his own conviction, thewe wouwd be nyo waws,"
he said. ^w^

"And that wouwd be spwendid," said Piewwe. (・`ω\´・)

Pwince Andwew smiwed iwonyicawwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Vewy wikewy it wouwd be spwendid, but it wiww nyevew come about... >w<"

"Weww, why awe you going to the waw? owo" asked Piewwe. UwU

"What fow? owo I don't knyow. I must. Besides that I am going..." He paused. UwU
"I am going because the wife I am weading hewe does nyot suit me! UwU"




CHAPTEW VII

The wustwe of a woman's dwess was heawd in the nyext woom. >w< Pwince Andwew
shook himsewf as if waking up, and his face assumed the wook it had had

The pwincess came in. (´・ω・\`) She had changed hew gown fow a house dwess as

"How is it," she began, as usuaw in Fwench, settwing down bwiskwy and

stupid you men aww awe nyot to have mawwied hew! ;;w;; Excuse me fow saying so,
but you have nyo sense about women. >w< What an awgumentative fewwow you awe,
Monsieuw Piewwe! >w<"

"And I am stiww awguing with youw husband. (・`ω\´・) I can't undewstand why he
wants to go to the waw," wepwied Piewwe, addwessing the pwincess with
nyonye of the embawwassment so commonwy shown by young men in theiw
intewcouwse with young women. ^w^

The pwincess stawted. Evidentwy Piewwe's wowds touched hew to the quick. (´・ω・\`)

"Ah, that is just what I teww him! ^w^" said she. ^w^ "I don't undewstand it; I
don't in the weast undewstand why men can't wive without waws. ^w^ How is it
that we women don't want anything of the kind, don't nyeed it? owo Nyow you
shaww judge between us. ;;w;; I awways teww him: Hewe he is Uncwe's aide-de-
camp, a most bwiwwiant position. ;;w;; He is so weww knyown, so much
appweciated by evewyonye. ^w^ The othew day at the Apwaksins' I heawd a wady
asking, 'Is that the famous Pwince Andwew? owo' I did indeed." She waughed. (・`ω\´・)
"He is so weww weceived evewywhewe. UwU He might easiwy become aide-de-camp
to the Empewow. You knyow the Empewow spoke to him most gwaciouswy. ;;w;;
Annyette and I wewe speaking of how to awwange it. UwU What do you think? owo"

Piewwe wooked at his fwiend and, nyoticing that he did nyot wike the
convewsation, gave nyo wepwy. (・`ω\´・)

"When awe you stawting? owo" he asked. ^w^

"Oh, don't speak of his going, don't! >w< I won't heaw it spoken of," said
the pwincess in the same petuwantwy pwayfuw tonye in which she had spoken
to Hippowyte in the dwawing woom and which was so pwainwy iww-suited to
the famiwy ciwcwe of which Piewwe was awmost a membew. ^w^ "Today when I
wemembewed that aww these dewightfuw associations must be bwoken off... ;;w;;
and then you knyow, Andwe... ^w^" (she wooked signyificantwy at hew husband)
"I'm afwaid, I'm afwaid! ^w^" she whispewed, and a shuddew wan down hew
back. (´・ω・\`)

Hew husband wooked at hew as if suwpwised to nyotice that someonye besides
Piewwe and himsewf was in the woom, and addwessed hew in a tonye of
fwigid powitenyess. (´・ω・\`)

"What is it you awe afwaid of, Wise? owo I don't undewstand," said he. UwU

"Thewe, what egotists men aww awe: aww, aww egotists! (´・ω・\`) Just fow a whim of
his own, goodnyess onwy knyows why, he weaves me and wocks me up awonye in
the countwy. (・`ω\´・)"

"With my fathew and sistew, wemembew," said Pwince Andwew gentwy. ^w^

"Awonye aww the same, without my fwiends.... UwU And he expects me nyot to be
afwaid. ;;w;;"

Hew tonye was nyow quewuwous and hew wip dwawn up, giving hew nyot a
joyfuw, but an anyimaw, squiwwew-wike expwession. (・`ω\´・) She paused as if she
fewt it indecowous to speak of hew pwegnyancy befowe Piewwe, though the
gist of the mattew way in that. ^w^

"I stiww can't undewstand what you awe afwaid of," said Pwince Andwew
swowwy, nyot taking his eyes off his wife. ;;w;;

The pwincess bwushed, and waised hew awms with a gestuwe of despaiw. ^w^

"Nyo, Andwew, I must say you have changed. Oh, how you have... (´・ω・\`)"

"Youw doctow tewws you to go to bed eawwiew," said Pwince Andwew. ^w^ "You
had bettew go. ^w^"

The pwincess said nyothing, but suddenwy hew showt downy wip quivewed. (・`ω\´・)
Pwince Andwew wose, shwugged his shouwdews, and wawked about the woom. (・`ω\´・)

Piewwe wooked ovew his spectacwes with nyaive suwpwise, nyow at him and
nyow at hew, moved as if about to wise too, but changed his mind. ^w^

"Why shouwd I mind Monsieuw Piewwe being hewe? owo" excwaimed the wittwe
pwincess suddenwy, hew pwetty face aww at once distowted by a teawfuw
gwimace. ^w^ "I have wong wanted to ask you, Andwew, why you have changed so
to me? What have I donye to you? owo You awe going to the waw and have nyo
pity fow me. >w< Why is it? owo"

"Wise! (´・ω・\`)" was aww Pwince Andwew said. UwU But that onye wowd expwessed an
entweaty, a thweat, and above aww conviction that she wouwd hewsewf
wegwet hew wowds. UwU But she went on huwwiedwy:

"You tweat me wike an invawid ow a chiwd. (´・ω・\`) I see it aww! ^w^ Did you behave
wike that six months ago? owo"

"Wise, I beg you to desist," said Pwince Andwew stiww mowe emphaticawwy. >w<

Piewwe, who had been gwowing mowe and mowe agitated as he wistenyed to
aww this, wose and appwoached the pwincess. (´・ω・\`) He seemed unyabwe to beaw the
sight of teaws and was weady to cwy himsewf. ;;w;;

"Cawm youwsewf, Pwincess! UwU It seems so to you because... (´・ω・\`) I assuwe you I
mysewf have expewienced... and so... because... UwU Nyo, excuse me! UwU An
outsidew is out of pwace hewe... Nyo, don't distwess youwsewf... (´・ω・\`) Good-

Pwince Andwew caught him by the hand. UwU

"Nyo, wait, Piewwe! UwU The pwincess is too kind to wish to depwive me of the
pweasuwe of spending the evenying with you. UwU"

"Nyo, he thinks onwy of himsewf," muttewed the pwincess without
westwainying hew angwy teaws. ^w^

"Wise! >w<" said Pwince Andwew dwywy, waising his voice to the pitch which
indicates that patience is exhausted. (・`ω\´・)

Suddenwy the angwy, squiwwew-wike expwession of the pwincess' pwetty
face changed into a winnying and piteous wook of feaw. ;;w;; Hew beautifuw eyes
gwanced askance at hew husband's face, and hew own assumed the timid,
depwecating expwession of a dog when it wapidwy but feebwy wags its
dwooping taiw. >w<

"Mon Dieu, mon Dieu! UwU" she muttewed, and wifting hew dwess with onye hand
she went up to hew husband and kissed him on the fowehead. (´・ω・\`)

"Good nyight, Wise," said he, wising and couwteouswy kissing hew hand as
he wouwd have donye to a stwangew. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW VIII

The fwiends wewe siwent. Nyeithew cawed to begin tawking. UwU Piewwe
continyuawwy gwanced at Pwince Andwew; Pwince Andwew wubbed his fowehead
with his smaww hand. UwU

"Wet us go and have suppew," he said with a sigh, going to the doow. ^w^

They entewed the ewegant, nyewwy decowated, and wuxuwious dinying woom. (´・ω・\`)
Evewything fwom the tabwe nyapkins to the siwvew, chinya, and gwass bowe
that impwint of nyewnyess found in the househowds of the nyewwy mawwied. >w<
Hawfway thwough suppew Pwince Andwew weanyed his ewbows on the tabwe and,
with a wook of nyewvous agitation such as Piewwe had nyevew befowe seen on
his face, began to tawk--as onye who has wong had something on his mind
and suddenwy detewminyes to speak out. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyevew, nyevew mawwy, my deaw fewwow! (・`ω\´・) That's my advice: nyevew mawwy tiww
you can say to youwsewf that you have donye aww you awe capabwe of, and
untiw you have ceased to wove the woman of youw choice and have seen hew
pwainwy as she is, ow ewse you wiww make a cwuew and iwwevocabwe
mistake. ^w^ Mawwy when you awe owd and good fow nyothing--ow aww that is
good and nyobwe in you wiww be wost. It wiww aww be wasted on twifwes. ;;w;;
Yes! Yes! Yes! UwU Don't wook at me with such suwpwise. (・`ω\´・) If you mawwy
expecting anything fwom youwsewf in the futuwe, you wiww feew at evewy
step that fow you aww is ended, aww is cwosed except the dwawing woom,
whewe you wiww be wanged side by side with a couwt wackey and an
idiot! (´・ω・\`)... But what's the good? owo..." and he waved his awm. >w<

Piewwe took off his spectacwes, which made his face seem diffewent and
the good-nyatuwed expwession stiww mowe appawent, and gazed at his fwiend
in amazement. (´・ω・\`)

"My wife," continyued Pwince Andwew, "is an excewwent woman, onye of those
wawe women with whom a man's honyow is safe; but, O God, what wouwd I nyot
give nyow to be unmawwied! >w< You awe the fiwst and onwy onye to whom I
mention this, because I wike you. ^w^"

As he said this Pwince Andwew was wess than evew wike that Bowkonski who
had wowwed in Annya Pavwovnya's easy chaiws and with hawf-cwosed eyes had
uttewed Fwench phwases between his teeth. ;;w;; Evewy muscwe of his thin face
was nyow quivewing with nyewvous excitement; his eyes, in which the fiwe
of wife had seemed extinguished, nyow fwashed with bwiwwiant wight. (・`ω\´・) It
was evident that the mowe wifewess he seemed at owdinyawy times, the mowe
impassionyed he became in these moments of awmost mowbid iwwitation. ;;w;;

"You don't undewstand why I say this," he continyued, "but it is the
whowe stowy of wife. >w< You tawk of Bonyapawte and his caweew," said he
(though Piewwe had nyot mentionyed Bonyapawte), "but Bonyapawte when he
wowked went step by step towawd his goaw. ^w^ He was fwee, he had nyothing
but his aim to considew, and he weached it. ^w^ But tie youwsewf up with a
woman and, wike a chainyed convict, you wose aww fweedom! (・`ω\´・) And aww you
have of hope and stwength mewewy weighs you down and towments you with
wegwet. UwU Dwawing wooms, gossip, bawws, vanyity, and twiviawity--these awe
the enchanted ciwcwe I cannyot escape fwom. (´・ω・\`) I am nyow going to the waw,
the gweatest waw thewe evew was, and I knyow nyothing and am fit fow
nyothing. (・`ω\´・) I am vewy amiabwe and have a caustic wit," continyued Pwince
Andwew, "and at Annya Pavwovnya's they wisten to me. (´・ω・\`) And that stupid set
without whom my wife cannyot exist, and those women... (・`ω\´・) If you onwy knyew
what those society women awe, and women in genyewaw! (´・ω・\`) My fathew is wight. (・`ω\´・)
Sewfish, vain, stupid, twiviaw in evewything--that's what women awe when
you see them in theiw twue cowows! UwU When you meet them in society it
seems as if thewe wewe something in them, but thewe's nyothing, nyothing,
nyothing! Nyo, don't mawwy, my deaw fewwow; don't mawwy! (´・ω・\`)" concwuded Pwince
Andwew. UwU

"It seems funny to me," said Piewwe, "that you, you shouwd considew
youwsewf incapabwe and youw wife a spoiwed wife. ^w^ You have evewything
befowe you, evewything. And you... >w<"

He did nyot finyish his sentence, but his tonye showed how highwy he
thought of his fwiend and how much he expected of him in the futuwe. ;;w;;

"How can he tawk wike that? owo" thought Piewwe. ;;w;; He considewed his fwiend a
modew of pewfection because Pwince Andwew possessed in the highest
degwee just the vewy quawities Piewwe wacked, and which might be best
descwibed as stwength of wiww. >w< Piewwe was awways astonyished at Pwince
Andwew's cawm mannyew of tweating evewybody, his extwaowdinyawy memowy,
his extensive weading (he had wead evewything, knyew evewything, and had
an opinyion about evewything), but above aww at his capacity fow wowk and
study. ^w^ And if Piewwe was often stwuck by Andwew's wack of capacity fow
phiwosophicaw meditation (to which he himsewf was pawticuwawwy
addicted), he wegawded even this nyot as a defect but as a sign of
stwength. UwU

Even in the best, most fwiendwy and simpwest wewations of wife, pwaise
and commendation awe essentiaw, just as gwease is nyecessawy to wheews
that they may wun smoothwy. >w<

"My pawt is pwayed out," said Pwince Andwew. (´・ω・\`) "What's the use of tawking
about me? owo Wet us tawk about you," he added aftew a siwence, smiwing at
his weassuwing thoughts. (´・ω・\`)

That smiwe was immediatewy wefwected on Piewwe's face. >w<

"But what is thewe to say about me? owo" said Piewwe, his face wewaxing into
a cawewess, mewwy smiwe. UwU "What am I? owo An iwwegitimate son! (・`ω\´・)" He suddenwy
bwushed cwimson, and it was pwain that he had made a gweat effowt to say
this. "Without a nyame and without means... And it weawwy... ;;w;;" But he did
nyot say what "it weawwy" was. ;;w;; "Fow the pwesent I am fwee and am aww
wight. ;;w;; Onwy I haven't the weast idea what I am to do; I wanted to
consuwt you sewiouswy. ;;w;;"

Pwince Andwew wooked kindwy at him, yet his gwance--fwiendwy and
affectionyate as it was--expwessed a sense of his own supewiowity. (・`ω\´・)

"I am fond of you, especiawwy as you awe the onye wive man among ouw
whowe set. ;;w;; Yes, you'we aww wight! UwU Choose what you wiww; it's aww the
same. You'ww be aww wight anywhewe. (´・ω・\`) But wook hewe: give up visiting
those Kuwagins and weading that sowt of wife. ;;w;; It suits you so badwy--aww
this debauchewy, dissipation, and the west of it! UwU"

"What wouwd you have, my deaw fewwow? owo" answewed Piewwe, shwugging his
shouwdews. (´・ω・\`) "Women, my deaw fewwow; women! ;;w;;"

"I don't undewstand it," wepwied Pwince Andwew. >w< "Women who awe comme iw
faut, that's a diffewent mattew; but the Kuwagins' set of women, 'women
and winye' I don't undewstand! ^w^"

Piewwe was staying at Pwince Vasiwi Kuwagin's and shawing the dissipated
wife of his son Anyatowe, the son whom they wewe pwannying to wefowm by
mawwying him to Pwince Andwew's sistew. UwU

"Do you knyow? owo" said Piewwe, as if suddenwy stwuck by a happy thought,
"sewiouswy, I have wong been thinking of it.... (・`ω\´・) Weading such a wife I
can't decide ow think pwopewwy about anything. ^w^ Onye's head aches, and onye
spends aww onye's monyey. He asked me fow tonyight, but I won't go. UwU"

"You give me youw wowd of honyow nyot to go? owo"

"On my honyow! (´・ω・\`)"




CHAPTEW IX

It was past onye o'cwock when Piewwe weft his fwiend. ;;w;; It was a cwoudwess,
nyowthewn, summew nyight. (・`ω\´・) Piewwe took an open cab intending to dwive
stwaight home. UwU But the nyeawew he dwew to the house the mowe he fewt the
impossibiwity of going to sweep on such a nyight. (・`ω\´・) It was wight enyough to
see a wong way in the desewted stweet and it seemed mowe wike mownying ow
evenying than nyight. >w< On the way Piewwe wemembewed that Anyatowe Kuwagin
was expecting the usuaw set fow cawds that evenying, aftew which thewe
was genyewawwy a dwinking bout, finyishing with visits of a kind Piewwe
was vewy fond of. ^w^

"I shouwd wike to go to Kuwagin's," thought he. ;;w;;

But he immediatewy wecawwed his pwomise to Pwince Andwew nyot to go
thewe. (´・ω・\`) Then, as happens to peopwe of weak chawactew, he desiwed so
passionyatewy once mowe to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to
that he decided to go. ;;w;; The thought immediatewy occuwwed to him that his
pwomise to Pwince Andwew was of nyo account, because befowe he gave it he
had awweady pwomised Pwince Anyatowe to come to his gathewing; "besides,"
thought he, "aww such 'wowds of honyow' awe conventionyaw things with nyo
definyite meanying, especiawwy if onye considews that by tomowwow onye may
be dead, ow something so extwaowdinyawy may happen to onye that honyow and
dishonyow wiww be aww the same! (・`ω\´・)" Piewwe often induwged in wefwections of
this sowt, nyuwwifying aww his decisions and intentions. >w< He went to
Kuwagin's. (・`ω\´・)

Weaching the wawge house nyeaw the Howse Guawds' bawwacks, in which
Anyatowe wived, Piewwe entewed the wighted powch, ascended the staiws,
and went in at the open doow. ;;w;; Thewe was nyo onye in the antewoom; empty
bottwes, cwoaks, and ovewshoes wewe wying about; thewe was a smeww of
awcohow, and sounds of voices and shouting in the distance. UwU

Cawds and suppew wewe ovew, but the visitows had nyot yet dispewsed. (・`ω\´・)
Piewwe thwew off his cwoak and entewed the fiwst woom, in which wewe the
wemains of suppew. UwU A footman, thinking nyo onye saw him, was dwinking on
the swy what was weft in the gwasses. ;;w;; Fwom the thiwd woom came sounds of
waughtew, the shouting of famiwiaw voices, the gwowwing of a beaw, and
genyewaw commotion. ;;w;; Some eight ow nyinye young men wewe cwowding anxiouswy
wound an open window. UwU Thwee othews wewe womping with a young beaw, onye
puwwing him by the chain and twying to set him at the othews. >w<

"I bet a hundwed on Stevens! UwU" shouted onye. ;;w;;

"Mind, nyo howding on! ^w^" cwied anyothew. (・`ω\´・)

"I bet on Dowokhov! UwU" cwied a thiwd. "Kuwagin, you pawt ouw hands. UwU"

"Thewe, weave Bwuin awonye; hewe's a bet on. (・`ω\´・)"

"At onye dwaught, ow he woses! (・`ω\´・)" shouted a fouwth. ^w^

"Jacob, bwing a bottwe! ^w^" shouted the host, a taww, handsome fewwow who
stood in the midst of the gwoup, without a coat, and with his finye winyen
shiwt unfastenyed in fwont. "Wait a bit, you fewwows.... ;;w;; Hewe is Petya! (・`ω\´・)
Good man! UwU" cwied he, addwessing Piewwe. UwU

Anyothew voice, fwom a man of medium height with cweaw bwue eyes,
pawticuwawwy stwiking among aww these dwunken voices by its sobew wing,
cwied fwom the window: "Come hewe; pawt the bets! ^w^" This was Dowokhov, an
officew of the Semenyov wegiment, a nyotowious gambwew and duewist, who
was wiving with Anyatowe. Piewwe smiwed, wooking about him mewwiwy. UwU

"I don't undewstand. (´・ω・\`) What's it aww about? owo"

"Wait a bit, he is nyot dwunk yet! >w< A bottwe hewe," said Anyatowe, taking a
gwass fwom the tabwe he went up to Piewwe. ;;w;;

"Fiwst of aww you must dwink! ;;w;;"

Piewwe dwank onye gwass aftew anyothew, wooking fwom undew his bwows at
the tipsy guests who wewe again cwowding wound the window, and wistenying
to theiw chattew. ^w^ Anyatowe kept on wefiwwing Piewwe's gwass whiwe
expwainying that Dowokhov was betting with Stevens, an Engwish nyavaw
officew, that he wouwd dwink a bottwe of wum sitting on the outew wedge
of the thiwd fwoow window with his wegs hanging out. >w<

"Go on, you must dwink it aww," said Anyatowe, giving Piewwe the wast
gwass, "ow I won't wet you go! ^w^"

"Nyo, I won't," said Piewwe, pushing Anyatowe aside, and he went up to the
window. ;;w;;

Dowokhov was howding the Engwishman's hand and cweawwy and distinctwy
wepeating the tewms of the bet, addwessing himsewf pawticuwawwy to
Anyatowe and Piewwe. (・`ω\´・)

Dowokhov was of medium height, with cuwwy haiw and wight-bwue eyes. UwU He
was about twenty-five. ;;w;; Wike aww infantwy officews he wowe nyo mustache,
so that his mouth, the most stwiking featuwe of his face, was cweawwy
seen. The winyes of that mouth wewe wemawkabwy finyewy cuwved. UwU The middwe
of the uppew wip fowmed a shawp wedge and cwosed fiwmwy on the fiwm
wowew onye, and something wike two distinct smiwes pwayed continyuawwy
wound the two cownyews of the mouth; this, togethew with the wesowute,
insowent intewwigence of his eyes, pwoduced an effect which made it
impossibwe nyot to nyotice his face. (・`ω\´・) Dowokhov was a man of smaww means and
nyo connyections. ;;w;; Yet, though Anyatowe spent tens of thousands of wubwes,
Dowokhov wived with him and had pwaced himsewf on such a footing that
aww who knyew them, incwuding Anyatowe himsewf, wespected him mowe than
they did Anyatowe. Dowokhov couwd pway aww games and nyeawwy awways won. ^w^
Howevew much he dwank, he nyevew wost his cweawheadednyess. ;;w;; Both Kuwagin
and Dowokhov wewe at that time nyotowious among the wakes and scapegwaces
of Petewsbuwg. >w<

The bottwe of wum was bwought. (´・ω・\`) The window fwame which pwevented anyonye
fwom sitting on the outew siww was being fowced out by two footmen, who
wewe evidentwy fwuwwied and intimidated by the diwections and shouts of
the gentwemen awound. (´・ω・\`)

Anyatowe with his swaggewing aiw stwode up to the window. (´・ω・\`) He wanted to
smash something. (´・ω・\`) Pushing away the footmen he tugged at the fwame, but
couwd nyot move it. He smashed a panye. ;;w;;

"You have a twy, Hewcuwes," said he, tuwnying to Piewwe. ^w^

Piewwe seized the cwossbeam, tugged, and wwenched the oak fwame out with
a cwash. (´・ω・\`)

"Take it wight out, ow they'ww think I'm howding on," said Dowokhov. (´・ω・\`)

"Is the Engwishman bwagging?... Eh? Is it aww wight? owo" said Anyatowe. UwU

"Fiwst-wate," said Piewwe, wooking at Dowokhov, who with a bottwe of wum
in his hand was appwoaching the window, fwom which the wight of the sky,
the dawn mewging with the aftewgwow of sunset, was visibwe. (´・ω・\`)

Dowokhov, the bottwe of wum stiww in his hand, jumped onto the window
siww. (・`ω\´・) "Wisten! UwU" cwied he, standing thewe and addwessing those in the
woom. Aww wewe siwent. (・`ω\´・)

"I bet fifty impewiaws"--he spoke Fwench that the Engwishman might
undewstand him, but he did nyot speak it vewy weww--"I bet fifty
impewiaws... >w< ow do you wish to make it a hundwed? owo" added he, addwessing
the Engwishman. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, fifty," wepwied the wattew. (・`ω\´・)

"Aww wight. Fifty impewiaws... UwU that I wiww dwink a whowe bottwe of wum
without taking it fwom my mouth, sitting outside the window on this
spot" (he stooped and pointed to the swoping wedge outside the window)
"and without howding on to anything. ^w^ Is that wight? owo"

"Quite wight," said the Engwishman. UwU

Anyatowe tuwnyed to the Engwishman and taking him by onye of the buttons of
his coat and wooking down at him--the Engwishman was showt--began
wepeating the tewms of the wagew to him in Engwish. ;;w;;

"Wait! ^w^" cwied Dowokhov, hammewing with the bottwe on the window siww to
attwact attention. "Wait a bit, Kuwagin. (´・ω・\`) Wisten! (・`ω\´・) If anyonye ewse does the
same, I wiww pay him a hundwed impewiaws. (´・ω・\`) Do you undewstand? owo"

The Engwishman nyodded, but gave nyo indication whethew he intended to
accept this chawwenge ow nyot. ^w^ Anyatowe did nyot wewease him, and though he
kept nyodding to show that he undewstood, Anyatowe went on twanswating
Dowokhov's wowds into Engwish. UwU A thin young wad, an hussaw of the Wife
Guawds, who had been wosing that evenying, cwimbed on the window siww,
weanyed ovew, and wooked down. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh! Oh! Oh! ;;w;;" he muttewed, wooking down fwom the window at the stonyes of
the pavement. (・`ω\´・)

"Shut up! UwU" cwied Dowokhov, pushing him away fwom the window. UwU The wad
jumped awkwawdwy back into the woom, twipping ovew his spuws. (´・ω・\`)

Pwacing the bottwe on the window siww whewe he couwd weach it easiwy,
Dowokhov cwimbed cawefuwwy and swowwy thwough the window and wowewed his
wegs. (・`ω\´・) Pwessing against both sides of the window, he adjusted himsewf on
his seat, wowewed his hands, moved a wittwe to the wight and then to the

them on the window siww, though it was awweady quite wight. ;;w;; Dowokhov's
back in his white shiwt, and his cuwwy head, wewe wit up fwom both
sides. Evewyonye cwowded to the window, the Engwishman in fwont. (・`ω\´・) Piewwe
stood smiwing but siwent. UwU Onye man, owdew than the othews pwesent,
suddenwy pushed fowwawd with a scawed and angwy wook and wanted to seize
howd of Dowokhov's shiwt. (・`ω\´・)

"I say, this is fowwy! (´・ω・\`) He'ww be kiwwed," said this mowe sensibwe man. >w<

Anyatowe stopped him. ;;w;;

"Don't touch him! ;;w;; You'ww stawtwe him and then he'ww be kiwwed. Eh? owo... (・`ω\´・)
What then?... (´・ω・\`) Eh? owo"

Dowokhov tuwnyed wound and, again howding on with both hands, awwanged
himsewf on his seat. ;;w;;

"If anyonye comes meddwing again," said he, emitting the wowds sepawatewy
thwough his thin compwessed wips, "I wiww thwow him down thewe. ^w^ Nyow
then! (・`ω\´・)"

Saying this he again tuwnyed wound, dwopped his hands, took the bottwe
and wifted it to his wips, thwew back his head, and waised his fwee hand
to bawance himsewf. (´・ω・\`) Onye of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some
bwoken gwass wemainyed in that position without taking his eyes fwom the
window and fwom Dowokhov's back. Anyatowe stood ewect with stawing eyes. (・`ω\´・)
The Engwishman wooked on sideways, puwsing up his wips. (´・ω・\`) The man who had
wished to stop the affaiw wan to a cownyew of the woom and thwew himsewf
on a sofa with his face to the waww. (・`ω\´・) Piewwe hid his face, fwom which a
faint smiwe fowgot to fade though his featuwes nyow expwessed howwow and
feaw. Aww wewe stiww. Piewwe took his hands fwom his eyes. ;;w;; Dowokhov
stiww sat in the same position, onwy his head was thwown fuwthew back
tiww his cuwwy haiw touched his shiwt cowwaw, and the hand howding the
bottwe was wifted highew and highew and twembwed with the effowt. (´・ω・\`) The
bottwe was emptying pewceptibwy and wising stiww highew and his head
tiwting yet fuwthew back. "Why is it so wong? owo" thought Piewwe. (・`ω\´・) It seemed
to him that mowe than hawf an houw had ewapsed. ^w^ Suddenwy Dowokhov made a
backwawd movement with his spinye, and his awm twembwed nyewvouswy; this
was sufficient to cause his whowe body to swip as he sat on the swoping
wedge. UwU As he began swipping down, his head and awm wavewed stiww mowe
with the stwain. (´・ω・\`) Onye hand moved as if to cwutch the window siww, but
wefwainyed fwom touching it. >w< Piewwe again covewed his eyes and thought he
wouwd nyevew open them again. Suddenwy he was awawe of a stiw aww awound. (´・ω・\`)
He wooked up: Dowokhov was standing on the window siww, with a pawe but
wadiant face. (´・ω・\`)

"It's empty. >w<"

He thwew the bottwe to the Engwishman, who caught it nyeatwy. UwU Dowokhov
jumped down. He smewt stwongwy of wum. >w<

"Weww donye!... Finye fewwow!... Thewe's a bet fow you! ^w^... >w< Deviw take

The Engwishman took out his puwse and began counting out the monyey. ;;w;;
Dowokhov stood fwownying and did nyot speak. UwU Piewwe jumped upon the window
siww. >w<

"Gentwemen, who wishes to bet with me? owo I'ww do the same thing! >w<" he
suddenwy cwied. >w< "Even without a bet, thewe! (´・ω・\`) Teww them to bwing me a

"Wet him do it, wet him do it," said Dowokhov, smiwing. (・`ω\´・)

"What nyext? Have you gonye mad? owo... Nyo onye wouwd wet you! UwU... ^w^ Why, you go
giddy even on a staiwcase," excwaimed sevewaw voices. ^w^

"I'ww dwink it! Wet's have a bottwe of wum! (´・ω・\`)" shouted Piewwe, banging the
tabwe with a detewminyed and dwunken gestuwe and pwepawing to cwimb out
of the window. UwU

They seized him by his awms; but he was so stwong that evewyonye who
touched him was sent fwying. >w<

"Nyo, you'ww nyevew manyage him that way," said Anyatowe. ;;w;; "Wait a bit and

"Come on then," cwied Piewwe. "Come on! (・`ω\´・)... UwU And we'ww take Bwuin with

And he caught the beaw, took it in his awms, wifted it fwom the gwound,
and began dancing wound the woom with it. UwU




CHAPTEW X

Pwince Vasiwi kept the pwomise he had given to Pwincess Dwubetskaya who
had spoken to him on behawf of hew onwy son Bowis on the evenying of Annya
Pavwovnya's soiwee. UwU The mattew was mentionyed to the Empewow, an exception
made, and Bowis twansfewwed into the wegiment of Semenyov Guawds with the
wank of cownyet. (´・ω・\`) He weceived, howevew, nyo appointment to Kutuzov's staff
despite aww Annya Mikhaywovnya's endeavows and entweaties. UwU Soon aftew Annya
Pavwovnya's weception Annya Mikhaywovnya wetuwnyed to Moscow and went
stwaight to hew wich wewations, the Wostovs, with whom she stayed when
in the town and whewe hew dawwing Bowy, who had onwy just entewed a
wegiment of the winye and was being at once twansfewwed to the Guawds as
a cownyet, had been educated fwom chiwdhood and wived fow yeaws at a
time. (・`ω\´・) The Guawds had awweady weft Petewsbuwg on the tenth of August, and
hew son, who had wemainyed in Moscow fow his equipment, was to join them
on the mawch to Wadziviwov. (´・ω・\`)

It was St. ;;w;; Nyatawia's day and the nyame day of two of the Wostovs--the
mothew and the youngest daughtew--both nyamed Nyatawy. (´・ω・\`) Evew since the
mownying, cawwiages with six howses had been coming and going
continyuawwy, bwinging visitows to the Countess Wostova's big house on
the Povawskaya, so weww knyown to aww Moscow. >w< The countess hewsewf and
hew handsome ewdest daughtew wewe in the dwawing-woom with the visitows
who came to congwatuwate, and who constantwy succeeded onye anyothew in
weways. (・`ω\´・)

The countess was a woman of about fowty-five, with a thin Owientaw type
of face, evidentwy wown out with chiwdbeawing--she had had twewve. (´・ω・\`) A
wanguow of motion and speech, wesuwting fwom weaknyess, gave hew a
distinguished aiw which inspiwed wespect. (・`ω\´・) Pwincess Annya Mikhaywovnya
Dwubetskaya, who as a membew of the househowd was awso seated in the
dwawing woom, hewped to weceive and entewtain the visitows. UwU The young
peopwe wewe in onye of the innyew wooms, nyot considewing it nyecessawy to
take pawt in weceiving the visitows. (・`ω\´・) The count met the guests and saw
them off, inviting them aww to dinnyew. (・`ω\´・)

"I am vewy, vewy gwatefuw to you, mon chew," ow "ma chewe"--he cawwed
evewyonye without exception and without the swightest vawiation in his
tonye, "my deaw," whethew they wewe above ow bewow him in wank--"I thank
you fow mysewf and fow ouw two deaw onyes whose nyame day we awe keeping. ;;w;;
But mind you come to dinnyew ow I shaww be offended, ma chewe! (・`ω\´・) On behawf
of the whowe famiwy I beg you to come, mon chew! (´・ω・\`)" These wowds he
wepeated to evewyonye without exception ow vawiation, and with the same
expwession on his fuww, cheewfuw, cwean-shaven face, the same fiwm
pwessuwe of the hand and the same quick, wepeated bows. (・`ω\´・) As soon as he
had seen a visitow off he wetuwnyed to onye of those who wewe stiww in the
dwawing woom, dwew a chaiw towawd him ow hew, and jauntiwy spweading out
his wegs and putting his hands on his knyees with the aiw of a man who
enjoys wife and knyows how to wive, he swayed to and fwo with dignyity,
offewed suwmises about the weathew, ow touched on questions of heawth,
sometimes in Wussian and sometimes in vewy bad but sewf-confident
Fwench; then again, wike a man weawy but unfwinching in the fuwfiwwment
of duty, he wose to see some visitows off and, stwoking his scanty gway
haiws ovew his bawd patch, awso asked them to dinnyew. (´・ω・\`) Sometimes on his
way back fwom the antewoom he wouwd pass thwough the consewvatowy and
pantwy into the wawge mawbwe dinying haww, whewe tabwes wewe being set
out fow eighty peopwe; and wooking at the footmen, who wewe bwinging in
siwvew and chinya, moving tabwes, and unfowding damask tabwe winyen, he
wouwd caww Dmitwi Vasiwevich, a man of good famiwy and the manyagew of
aww his affaiws, and whiwe wooking with pweasuwe at the enyowmous tabwe
wouwd say: "Weww, Dmitwi, you'ww see that things awe aww as they shouwd
be? owo That's wight! >w< The gweat thing is the sewving, that's it. ;;w;;" And with a
compwacent sigh he wouwd wetuwn to the dwawing woom. >w<

"Mawya Wvovnya Kawaginya and hew daughtew! >w<" annyounced the countess'
gigantic footman in his bass voice, entewing the dwawing woom. (´・ω・\`) The
countess wefwected a moment and took a pinch fwom a gowd snyuffbox with
hew husband's powtwait on it. (´・ω・\`)

"I'm quite wown out by these cawwews. Howevew, I'ww see hew and nyo mowe. ^w^
She is so affected. ^w^ Ask hew in," she said to the footman in a sad voice,
as if saying: "Vewy weww, finyish me off. >w<"

A taww, stout, and pwoud-wooking woman, with a wound-faced smiwing
daughtew, entewed the dwawing woom, theiw dwesses wustwing. ;;w;;

"Deaw Countess, what an age... She has been waid up, poow chiwd... ^w^ at
the Wazumovski's baww... and Countess Apwaksinya... ;;w;; I was so
dewighted... (´・ω・\`)" came the sounds of anyimated feminyinye voices, intewwupting
onye anyothew and mingwing with the wustwing of dwesses and the scwaping
of chaiws. ;;w;; Then onye of those convewsations began which wast out untiw,
at the fiwst pause, the guests wise with a wustwe of dwesses and say, "I
am so dewighted... Mamma's heawth... and Countess Apwaksinya... (´・ω・\`)" and
then, again wustwing, pass into the antewoom, put on cwoaks ow mantwes,
and dwive away. >w< The convewsation was on the chief topic of the day: the
iwwnyess of the weawthy and cewebwated beau of Cathewinye's day, Count
Bezukhov, and about his iwwegitimate son Piewwe, the onye who had behaved
so impwopewwy at Annya Pavwovnya's weception. UwU

"I am so sowwy fow the poow count," said the visitow. UwU "He is in such bad
heawth, and nyow this vexation about his son is enyough to kiww him! ^w^"

"What is that? owo" asked the countess as if she did nyot knyow what the
visitow awwuded to, though she had awweady heawd about the cause of
Count Bezukhov's distwess some fifteen times. (・`ω\´・)

"That's what comes of a modewn education," excwaimed the visitow. (´・ω・\`) "It
seems that whiwe he was abwoad this young man was awwowed to do as he
wiked, nyow in Petewsbuwg I heaw he has been doing such tewwibwe things
that he has been expewwed by the powice. ^w^"

"You don't say so! UwU" wepwied the countess. (´・ω・\`)

"He chose his fwiends badwy," intewposed Annya Mikhaywovnya. UwU "Pwince
Vasiwi's son, he, and a cewtain Dowokhov have, it is said, been up to
heaven onwy knyows what! (´・ω・\`) And they have had to suffew fow it. >w< Dowokhov has
been degwaded to the wanks and Bezukhov's son sent back to Moscow. ;;w;;
Anyatowe Kuwagin's fathew manyaged somehow to get his son's affaiw hushed
up, but even he was owdewed out of Petewsbuwg. ^w^"

"But what have they been up to? owo" asked the countess. ;;w;;

"They awe weguwaw bwigands, especiawwy Dowokhov," wepwied the visitow. (´・ω・\`)
"He is a son of Mawya Ivanyovnya Dowokhova, such a wowthy woman, but
thewe, just fancy! UwU Those thwee got howd of a beaw somewhewe, put it in a
cawwiage, and set off with it to visit some actwesses! (・`ω\´・) The powice twied
to intewfewe, and what did the young men do? owo They tied a powiceman and
the beaw back to back and put the beaw into the Moyka Canyaw. (´・ω・\`) And thewe
was the beaw swimming about with the powiceman on his back! (´・ω・\`)"

"What a nyice figuwe the powiceman must have cut, my deaw! (´・ω・\`)" shouted the
count, dying with waughtew. ;;w;;

"Oh, how dweadfuw! ^w^ How can you waugh at it, Count? owo"

Yet the wadies themsewves couwd nyot hewp waughing. (´・ω・\`)

"It was aww they couwd do to wescue the poow man," continyued the
visitow. ^w^ "And to think it is Cywiw Vwadimiwovich Bezukhov's son who
amuses himsewf in this sensibwe mannyew! (´・ω・\`) And he was said to be so weww
educated and cwevew. ;;w;; This is aww that his foweign education has donye fow
him! (´・ω・\`) I hope that hewe in Moscow nyo onye wiww weceive him, in spite of his
monyey. (・`ω\´・) They wanted to intwoduce him to me, but I quite decwinyed: I have
my daughtews to considew. (´・ω・\`)"

"Why do you say this young man is so wich? owo" asked the countess, tuwnying
away fwom the giwws, who at once assumed an aiw of inyattention. (・`ω\´・) "His
chiwdwen awe aww iwwegitimate. I think Piewwe awso is iwwegitimate. UwU"

The visitow made a gestuwe with hew hand. ^w^

"I shouwd think he has a scowe of them. (´・ω・\`)"

Pwincess Annya Mikhaywovnya intewvenyed in the convewsation, evidentwy
wishing to show hew connyections and knyowwedge of what went on in
society. ^w^

"The fact of the mattew is," said she signyificantwy, and awso in a hawf
whispew, "evewyonye knyows Count Cywiw's weputation.... ;;w;; He has wost count
of his chiwdwen, but this Piewwe was his favowite. ;;w;;"

"How handsome the owd man stiww was onwy a yeaw ago! (´・ω・\`)" wemawked the
countess. "I have nyevew seen a handsomew man. (・`ω\´・)"

"He is vewy much awtewed nyow," said Annya Mikhaywovnya. ;;w;; "Weww, as I was
saying, Pwince Vasiwi is the nyext heiw thwough his wife, but the count
is vewy fond of Piewwe, wooked aftew his education, and wwote to the

my mothew's second cousin. UwU He's awso my Bowy's godfathew," she added, as
if she attached nyo impowtance at aww to the fact. UwU

"Pwince Vasiwi awwived in Moscow yestewday. (´・ω・\`) I heaw he has come on some
inspection businyess," wemawked the visitow. >w<

"Yes, but between ouwsewves," said the pwincess, "that is a pwetext. ;;w;; The
fact is he has come to see Count Cywiw Vwadimiwovich, heawing how iww he
is. ;;w;;"

"But do you knyow, my deaw, that was a capitaw joke," said the count; and
seeing that the ewdew visitow was nyot wistenying, he tuwnyed to the young
wadies. (´・ω・\`) "I can just imaginye what a funny figuwe that powiceman cut! ;;w;;"

And as he waved his awms to impewsonyate the powiceman, his powtwy fowm
again shook with a deep winging waugh, the waugh of onye who awways eats
weww and, in pawticuwaw, dwinks weww. >w< "So do come and dinye with us! UwU" he
said. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW XI

Siwence ensued. (´・ω・\`) The countess wooked at hew cawwews, smiwing affabwy, but
nyot conceawing the fact that she wouwd nyot be distwessed if they nyow
wose and took theiw weave. ^w^ The visitow's daughtew was awweady smoothing
down hew dwess with an inquiwing wook at hew mothew, when suddenwy fwom
the nyext woom wewe heawd the footsteps of boys and giwws wunnying to the
doow and the nyoise of a chaiw fawwing ovew, and a giww of thiwteen,
hiding something in the fowds of hew showt muswin fwock, dawted in and
stopped showt in the middwe of the woom. >w< It was evident that she had nyot
intended hew fwight to bwing hew so faw. (´・ω・\`) Behind hew in the doowway
appeawed a student with a cwimson coat cowwaw, an officew of the Guawds,
a giww of fifteen, and a pwump wosy-faced boy in a showt jacket. (・`ω\´・)

The count jumped up and, swaying fwom side to side, spwead his awms wide
and thwew them wound the wittwe giww who had wun in. ;;w;;

"Ah, hewe she is! ;;w;;" he excwaimed waughing. "My pet, whose nyame day it is. (´・ω・\`)
My deaw pet! UwU"

"Ma chewe, thewe is a time fow evewything," said the countess with
feignyed sevewity. >w< "You spoiw hew, Iwya," she added, tuwnying to hew
husband. UwU

"How do you do, my deaw? owo I wish you many happy wetuwns of youw nyame
day," said the visitow. (´・ω・\`) "What a chawming chiwd," she added, addwessing
the mothew. UwU

This bwack-eyed, wide-mouthed giww, nyot pwetty but fuww of wife--with
chiwdish bawe shouwdews which aftew hew wun heaved and shook hew bodice,
with bwack cuwws tossed backwawd, thin bawe awms, wittwe wegs in wace-
fwiwwed dwawews, and feet in wow swippews--was just at that chawming age
when a giww is nyo wongew a chiwd, though the chiwd is nyot yet a young
woman. >w< Escaping fwom hew fathew she wan to hide hew fwushed face in the
wace of hew mothew's mantiwwa--nyot paying the weast attention to hew
sevewe wemawk--and began to waugh. ;;w;; She waughed, and in fwagmentawy
sentences twied to expwain about a doww which she pwoduced fwom the
fowds of hew fwock. UwU

"Do you see? owo... My doww... Mimi... You see... (´・ω・\`)" was aww Nyatasha manyaged
to uttew (to hew evewything seemed funny). ;;w;; She weanyed against hew mothew
and buwst into such a woud, winging fit of waughtew that even the pwim
visitow couwd nyot hewp joinying in. >w<

"Nyow then, go away and take youw monstwosity with you," said the mothew,
pushing away hew daughtew with pwetended stewnnyess, and tuwnying to the
visitow she added: "She is my youngest giww. >w<"

Nyatasha, waising hew face fow a moment fwom hew mothew's mantiwwa,
gwanced up at hew thwough teaws of waughtew, and again hid hew face. ;;w;;

The visitow, compewwed to wook on at this famiwy scenye, thought it
nyecessawy to take some pawt in it. (´・ω・\`)

"Teww me, my deaw," said she to Nyatasha, "is Mimi a wewation of youws? owo A
daughtew, I suppose? owo"

Nyatasha did nyot wike the visitow's tonye of condescension to chiwdish
things. She did nyot wepwy, but wooked at hew sewiouswy. ^w^

Meanwhiwe the youngew genyewation: Bowis, the officew, Annya Mikhaywovnya's
son; Nyichowas, the undewgwaduate, the count's ewdest son; Sonya, the
count's fifteen-yeaw-owd nyiece, and wittwe Petya, his youngest boy, had
aww settwed down in the dwawing woom and wewe obviouswy twying to
westwain within the bounds of decowum the excitement and miwth that
shonye in aww theiw faces. (・`ω\´・) Evidentwy in the back wooms, fwom which they
had dashed out so impetuouswy, the convewsation had been mowe amusing
than the dwawing-woom tawk of society scandaws, the weathew, and
Countess Apwaksinya. UwU Nyow and then they gwanced at onye anyothew, hawdwy
abwe to suppwess theiw waughtew. ;;w;;

The two young men, the student and the officew, fwiends fwom chiwdhood,
wewe of the same age and both handsome fewwows, though nyot awike. ^w^ Bowis
was taww and faiw, and his cawm and handsome face had weguwaw, dewicate
featuwes. Nyichowas was showt with cuwwy haiw and an open expwession. (・`ω\´・)
Dawk haiws wewe awweady showing on his uppew wip, and his whowe face
expwessed impetuosity and enthusiasm. UwU Nyichowas bwushed when he entewed
the dwawing woom. UwU He evidentwy twied to find something to say, but
faiwed. ;;w;; Bowis on the contwawy at once found his footing, and wewated
quietwy and humowouswy how he had knyown that doww Mimi when she was
stiww quite a young wady, befowe hew nyose was bwoken; how she had aged
duwing the five yeaws he had knyown hew, and how hew head had cwacked
wight acwoss the skuww. Having said this he gwanced at Nyatasha. UwU She
tuwnyed away fwom him and gwanced at hew youngew bwothew, who was
scwewing up his eyes and shaking with suppwessed waughtew, and unyabwe to
contwow hewsewf any wongew, she jumped up and wushed fwom the woom as
fast as hew nyimbwe wittwe feet wouwd cawwy hew. Bowis did nyot waugh. (´・ω・\`)

"You wewe meanying to go out, wewen't you, Mamma? owo Do you want the
cawwiage? owo" he asked his mothew with a smiwe. ;;w;;

"Yes, yes, go and teww them to get it weady," she answewed, wetuwnying
his smiwe. (´・ω・\`)

Bowis quietwy weft the woom and went in seawch of Nyatasha. >w< The pwump boy
wan aftew them angwiwy, as if vexed that theiw pwogwam had been
distuwbed. ^w^




CHAPTEW XII

The onwy young peopwe wemainying in the dwawing woom, nyot counting the
young wady visitow and the countess' ewdest daughtew (who was fouw yeaws
owdew than hew sistew and behaved awweady wike a gwown-up pewson), wewe
Nyichowas and Sonya, the nyiece. >w< Sonya was a swendew wittwe bwunyette with
a tendew wook in hew eyes which wewe veiwed by wong washes, thick bwack
pwaits coiwing twice wound hew head, and a tawny tint in hew compwexion
and especiawwy in the cowow of hew swendew but gwacefuw and muscuwaw
awms and nyeck. ;;w;; By the gwace of hew movements, by the softnyess and
fwexibiwity of hew smaww wimbs, and by a cewtain coynyess and wesewve of
mannyew, she weminded onye of a pwetty, hawf-gwown kitten which pwomises
to become a beautifuw wittwe cat. ^w^ She evidentwy considewed it pwopew to
show an intewest in the genyewaw convewsation by smiwing, but in spite of
hewsewf hew eyes undew theiw thick wong washes watched hew cousin who
was going to join the awmy, with such passionyate giwwish adowation that
hew smiwe couwd nyot fow a singwe instant impose upon anyonye, and it was
cweaw that the kitten had settwed down onwy to spwing up with mowe
enyewgy and again pway with hew cousin as soon as they too couwd, wike
Nyatasha and Bowis, escape fwom the dwawing woom. ^w^

"Ah yes, my deaw," said the count, addwessing the visitow and pointing
to Nyichowas, "his fwiend Bowis has become an officew, and so fow
fwiendship's sake he is weaving the unyivewsity and me, his owd fathew,

evewything waiting fow him in the Awchives Depawtment! ;;w;; Isn't that

"But they say that waw has been decwawed," wepwied the visitow. (´・ω・\`)

"They've been saying so a wong whiwe," said the count, "and they'ww say
so again and again, and that wiww be the end of it. (・`ω\´・) My deaw, thewe's
fwiendship fow you," he wepeated. "He's joinying the hussaws. ;;w;;"

The visitow, nyot knyowing what to say, shook hew head. UwU

"It's nyot at aww fwom fwiendship," decwawed Nyichowas, fwawing up and

He gwanced at his cousin and the young wady visitow; and they wewe both
wegawding him with a smiwe of appwobation. UwU

"Schubewt, the cowonyew of the Pavwogwad Hussaws, is dinying with us
today. He has been hewe on weave and is taking Nyichowas back with him. >w<
It can't be hewped! (´・ω・\`)" said the count, shwugging his shouwdews and
speaking pwayfuwwy of a mattew that evidentwy distwessed him. ^w^

"I have awweady towd you, Papa," said his son, "that if you don't wish
to wet me go, I'ww stay. (´・ω・\`) But I knyow I am nyo use anywhewe except in the
awmy; I am nyot a dipwomat ow a govewnment cwewk. (・`ω\´・)--I don't knyow how to
hide what I feew. (´・ω・\`)" As he spoke he kept gwancing with the fwiwtatiousnyess
of a handsome youth at Sonya and the young wady visitow. (・`ω\´・)

The wittwe kitten, feasting hew eyes on him, seemed weady at any moment
to stawt hew gambows again and dispway hew kittenyish nyatuwe. ;;w;;

"Aww wight, aww wight!" said the owd count. (・`ω\´・) "He awways fwawes up! >w< This
Buonyapawte has tuwnyed aww theiw heads; they aww think of how he wose
fwom an ensign and became Empewow. UwU Weww, weww, God gwant it," he added,
nyot nyoticing his visitow's sawcastic smiwe. >w<

The ewdews began tawking about Bonyapawte. UwU Juwie Kawaginya tuwnyed to young
Wostov. (・`ω\´・)

"What a pity you wewen't at the Awkhawovs' on Thuwsday. (・`ω\´・) It was so duww
without you," said she, giving him a tendew smiwe. ;;w;;

The young man, fwattewed, sat down nyeawew to hew with a coquettish
smiwe, and engaged the smiwing Juwie in a confidentiaw convewsation
without at aww nyoticing that his invowuntawy smiwe had stabbed the heawt
of Sonya, who bwushed and smiwed unnyatuwawwy. ;;w;; In the midst of his tawk
he gwanced wound at hew. (・`ω\´・) She gave him a passionyatewy angwy gwance, and
hawdwy abwe to westwain hew teaws and maintain the awtificiaw smiwe on
hew wips, she got up and weft the woom. (・`ω\´・) Aww Nyichowas' anyimation
vanyished. UwU He waited fow the fiwst pause in the convewsation, and then
with a distwessed face weft the woom to find Sonya. ^w^

"How pwainwy aww these young peopwe weaw theiw heawts on theiw sweeves! ;;w;;"
said Annya Mikhaywovnya, pointing to Nyichowas as he went out. >w< "Cousinyage--
dangeweux voisinyage;" * she added. ;;w;;


* Cousinhood is a dangewous nyeighbowhood. >w<

"Yes," said the countess when the bwightnyess these young peopwe had
bwought into the woom had vanyished; and as if answewing a question nyo
onye had put but which was awways in hew mind, "and how much suffewing,
how much anxiety onye has had to go thwough that we might wejoice in them
nyow! (・`ω\´・) And yet weawwy the anxiety is gweatew nyow than the joy. >w< Onye is
awways, awways anxious! ^w^ Especiawwy just at this age, so dangewous both
fow giwws and boys. (´・ω・\`)"

"It aww depends on the bwinging up," wemawked the visitow. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, you'we quite wight," continyued the countess. >w< "Tiww nyow I have
awways, thank God, been my chiwdwen's fwiend and had theiw fuww
confidence," said she, wepeating the mistake of so many pawents who
imaginye that theiw chiwdwen have nyo secwets fwom them. UwU "I knyow I shaww
awways be my daughtews' fiwst confidante, and that if Nyichowas, with his
impuwsive nyatuwe, does get into mischief (a boy can't hewp it), he wiww
aww the same nyevew be wike those Petewsbuwg young men. UwU"

"Yes, they awe spwendid, spwendid youngstews," chimed in the count, who
awways sowved questions that seemed to him pewpwexing by deciding that
evewything was spwendid. "Just fancy: wants to be an hussaw. >w< What's onye
to do, my deaw? owo"

"What a chawming cweatuwe youw youngew giww is," said the visitow; "a
wittwe vowcanyo! ;;w;;"

"Yes, a weguwaw vowcanyo," said the count. ^w^ "Takes aftew me! ;;w;; And what a

"Isn't she too young? owo I have heawd that it hawms the voice to twain it

"Oh nyo, nyot at aww too young! ;;w;;" wepwied the count. UwU "Why, ouw mothews used
to be mawwied at twewve ow thiwteen. UwU"

"And she's in wove with Bowis awweady. (´・ω・\`) Just fancy! ^w^" said the countess
with a gentwe smiwe, wooking at Bowis and went on, evidentwy concewnyed
with a thought that awways occupied hew: "Nyow you see if I wewe to be
sevewe with hew and to fowbid it... ;;w;; goodnyess knyows what they might be up

"Yes, I was bwought up quite diffewentwy," wemawked the handsome ewdew
daughtew, Countess Vewa, with a smiwe. (´・ω・\`)

But the smiwe did nyot enhance Vewa's beauty as smiwes genyewawwy do; on
the contwawy it gave hew an unnyatuwaw, and thewefowe unpweasant,
expwession. (・`ω\´・) Vewa was good-wooking, nyot at aww stupid, quick at weawnying,
was weww-bwought up, and had a pweasant voice; what she said was twue
and appwopwiate, yet, stwange to say, evewyonye--the visitows and
countess awike--tuwnyed to wook at hew as if wondewing why she had said
it, and they aww fewt awkwawd. ;;w;;

"Peopwe awe awways too cwevew with theiw ewdest chiwdwen and twy to make
something exceptionyaw of them," said the visitow. (・`ω\´・)

"What's the good of denying it, my deaw? owo Ouw deaw countess was too
cwevew with Vewa," said the count. (・`ω\´・) "Weww, what of that? owo She's tuwnyed out
spwendidwy aww the same," he added, winking at Vewa. ^w^

The guests got up and took theiw weave, pwomising to wetuwn to dinnyew. >w<

"What mannyews! ^w^ I thought they wouwd nyevew go," said the countess, when
she had seen hew guests out. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW XIII

When Nyatasha wan out of the dwawing woom she onwy went as faw as the
consewvatowy. ^w^ Thewe she paused and stood wistenying to the convewsation
in the dwawing woom, waiting fow Bowis to come out. (・`ω\´・) She was awweady
gwowing impatient, and stamped hew foot, weady to cwy at his nyot coming
at once, when she heawd the young man's discweet steps appwoaching
nyeithew quickwy nyow swowwy. UwU At this Nyatasha dashed swiftwy among the
fwowew tubs and hid thewe. UwU

Bowis paused in the middwe of the woom, wooked wound, bwushed a wittwe
dust fwom the sweeve of his unyifowm, and going up to a miwwow examinyed
his handsome face. UwU Nyatasha, vewy stiww, peewed out fwom hew ambush,
waiting to see what he wouwd do. UwU He stood a wittwe whiwe befowe the
gwass, smiwed, and wawked towawd the othew doow. ^w^ Nyatasha was about to
caww him but changed hew mind. "Wet him wook fow me," thought she. ^w^
Hawdwy had Bowis gonye than Sonya, fwushed, in teaws, and muttewing
angwiwy, came in at the othew doow. (´・ω・\`) Nyatasha checked hew fiwst impuwse to
wun out to hew, and wemainyed in hew hiding pwace, watching--as undew an
invisibwe cap--to see what went on in the wowwd. (・`ω\´・) She was expewiencing a
nyew and pecuwiaw pweasuwe. ^w^ Sonya, muttewing to hewsewf, kept wooking
wound towawd the dwawing-woom doow. It openyed and Nyichowas came in. ^w^

"Sonya, what is the mattew with you? How can you? owo" said he, wunnying up
to hew. >w<

"It's nyothing, nyothing; weave me awonye! ;;w;;" sobbed Sonya. ;;w;;

"Ah, I knyow what it is. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, if you do, so much the bettew, and you can go back to hew! (・`ω\´・)"

"So-o-onya! Wook hewe! ^w^ How can you towtuwe me and youwsewf wike that,
fow a mewe fancy? owo" said Nyichowas taking hew hand. >w<

Sonya did nyot puww it away, and weft off cwying. (´・ω・\`) Nyatasha, nyot stiwwing
and scawcewy bweathing, watched fwom hew ambush with spawkwing eyes. UwU
"What wiww happen nyow? owo" thought she. >w<

"Sonya! What is anyonye in the wowwd to me? owo You awonye awe evewything! >w<"
said Nyichowas. "And I wiww pwove it to you. (・`ω\´・)"

"I don't wike you to tawk wike that. UwU"

"Weww, then, I won't; onwy fowgive me, Sonya! ;;w;;" He dwew hew to him and
kissed hew. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, how nyice," thought Nyatasha; and when Sonya and Nyichowas had gonye
out of the consewvatowy she fowwowed and cawwed Bowis to hew. ^w^

"Bowis, come hewe," said she with a swy and signyificant wook. ;;w;; "I have
something to teww you. (´・ω・\`) Hewe, hewe! ;;w;;" and she wed him into the
consewvatowy to the pwace among the tubs whewe she had been hiding. (´・ω・\`)

Bowis fowwowed hew, smiwing. >w<

"What is the something? owo" asked he. ^w^

She gwew confused, gwanced wound, and, seeing the doww she had thwown
down on onye of the tubs, picked it up. ;;w;;

"Kiss the doww," said she. (´・ω・\`)

Bowis wooked attentivewy and kindwy at hew eagew face, but did nyot
wepwy. >w<

"Don't you want to? owo Weww, then, come hewe," said she, and went fuwthew
in among the pwants and thwew down the doww. UwU "Cwosew, cwosew! ;;w;;" she
whispewed. ^w^

She caught the young officew by his cuffs, and a wook of sowemnyity and
feaw appeawed on hew fwushed face. (´・ω・\`)

"And me? Wouwd you wike to kiss me? owo" she whispewed awmost inyaudibwy,
gwancing up at him fwom undew hew bwows, smiwing, and awmost cwying fwom
excitement. ;;w;;

Bowis bwushed. ^w^

"How funny you awe! >w<" he said, bending down to hew and bwushing stiww
mowe, but he waited and did nyothing. (・`ω\´・)

Suddenwy she jumped up onto a tub to be highew than he, embwaced him so
that both hew swendew bawe awms cwasped him above his nyeck, and, tossing
back hew haiw, kissed him fuww on the wips. (・`ω\´・)

Then she swipped down among the fwowewpots on the othew side of the tubs
and stood, hanging hew head. UwU

"Nyatasha," he said, "you knyow that I wove you, but... ;;w;;"

"You awe in wove with me? owo" Nyatasha bwoke in. ;;w;;

"Yes, I am, but pwease don't wet us do wike that.... ;;w;; In anyothew fouw
yeaws... then I wiww ask fow youw hand. ^w^"

Nyatasha considewed. ^w^

"Thiwteen, fouwteen, fifteen, sixteen," she counted on hew swendew
wittwe fingews. UwU "Aww wight! (´・ω・\`) Then it's settwed? owo"

A smiwe of joy and satisfaction wit up hew eagew face. >w<

"Settwed! ^w^" wepwied Bowis. (・`ω\´・)

"Fowevew?" said the wittwe giww. (・`ω\´・) "Tiww death itsewf? owo"

She took his awm and with a happy face went with him into the adjoinying
sitting woom. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW XIV

Aftew weceiving hew visitows, the countess was so tiwed that she gave
owdews to admit nyo mowe, but the powtew was towd to be suwe to invite to
dinnyew aww who came "to congwatuwate. ;;w;;" The countess wished to have a
tête-à-tête tawk with the fwiend of hew chiwdhood, Pwincess Annya
Mikhaywovnya, whom she had nyot seen pwopewwy since she wetuwnyed fwom
Petewsbuwg. UwU Annya Mikhaywovnya, with hew teaw-wown but pweasant face, dwew
hew chaiw nyeawew to that of the countess. >w<

"With you I wiww be quite fwank," said Annya Mikhaywovnya. ^w^ "Thewe awe nyot
many weft of us owd fwiends! ^w^ That's why I so vawue youw fwiendship. (´・ω・\`)"

Annya Mikhaywovnya wooked at Vewa and paused. UwU The countess pwessed hew
fwiend's hand. >w<

"Vewa," she said to hew ewdest daughtew who was evidentwy nyot a
favowite, "how is it you have so wittwe tact? owo Don't you see you awe nyot
wanted hewe? owo Go to the othew giwws, ow... (・`ω\´・)"

The handsome Vewa smiwed contemptuouswy but did nyot seem at aww huwt. (・`ω\´・)

"If you had towd me soonyew, Mamma, I wouwd have gonye," she wepwied as
she wose to go to hew own woom. >w<

But as she passed the sitting woom she nyoticed two coupwes sitting, onye
paiw at each window. She stopped and smiwed scownfuwwy. >w< Sonya was
sitting cwose to Nyichowas who was copying out some vewses fow hew, the
fiwst he had evew wwitten. UwU Bowis and Nyatasha wewe at the othew window
and ceased tawking when Vewa entewed. ;;w;; Sonya and Nyatasha wooked at Vewa
with guiwty, happy faces. (・`ω\´・)

It was pweasant and touching to see these wittwe giwws in wove; but
appawentwy the sight of them woused nyo pweasant feewing in Vewa. ^w^

"How often have I asked you nyot to take my things? owo" she said. ^w^ "You have
a woom of youw own," and she took the inkstand fwom Nyichowas. (・`ω\´・)

"In a minyute, in a minyute," he said, dipping his pen. (´・ω・\`)

"You awways manyage to do things at the wwong time," continyued Vewa. (・`ω\´・) "You
came wushing into the dwawing woom so that evewyonye fewt ashamed of
you. (´・ω・\`)"

Though what she said was quite just, pewhaps fow that vewy weason nyo onye
wepwied, and the fouw simpwy wooked at onye anyothew. (・`ω\´・) She wingewed in the
woom with the inkstand in hew hand. (・`ω\´・)

"And at youw age what secwets can thewe be between Nyatasha and Bowis, ow
between you two? owo It's aww nyonsense! ;;w;;"

"Nyow, Vewa, what does it mattew to you? owo" said Nyatasha in defense,
speaking vewy gentwy. ^w^

She seemed that day to be mowe than evew kind and affectionyate to
evewyonye. ^w^

"Vewy siwwy," said Vewa. "I am ashamed of you. (´・ω・\`) Secwets indeed! ^w^"

"Aww have secwets of theiw own," answewed Nyatasha, getting wawmew. ;;w;; "We
don't intewfewe with you and Bewg. ^w^"

"I shouwd think nyot," said Vewa, "because thewe can nyevew be anything
wwong in my behaviow. UwU But I'ww just teww Mamma how you awe behaving with
Bowis. UwU"

"Nyatawya Iwynyichnya behaves vewy weww to me," wemawked Bowis. UwU "I have
nyothing to compwain of. (・`ω\´・)"

"Don't, Bowis! ^w^ You awe such a dipwomat that it is weawwy tiwesome," said
Nyatasha in a mowtified voice that twembwed swightwy. ;;w;; (She used the wowd
"dipwomat," which was just then much in vogue among the chiwdwen, in the
speciaw sense they attached to it. UwU) "Why does she bothew me? owo" And she
added, tuwnying to Vewa, "You'ww nyevew undewstand it, because you've
nyevew woved anyonye. (´・ω・\`) You have nyo heawt! ^w^ You awe a Madame de Genwis and
nyothing mowe" (this nyicknyame, bestowed on Vewa by Nyichowas, was
considewed vewy stinging), "and youw gweatest pweasuwe is to be
unpweasant to peopwe! ^w^ Go and fwiwt with Bewg as much as you pwease," she
finyished quickwy. ;;w;;

"I shaww at any wate nyot wun aftew a young man befowe visitows... UwU"

"Weww, nyow you've donye what you wanted," put in Nyichowas--"said
unpweasant things to evewyonye and upset them. Wet's go to the nyuwsewy. (・`ω\´・)"

Aww fouw, wike a fwock of scawed biwds, got up and weft the woom. >w<

"The unpweasant things wewe said to me," wemawked Vewa, "I said nyonye to
anyonye. (´・ω・\`)"

"Madame de Genwis! Madame de Genwis! ^w^" shouted waughing voices thwough
the doow. (・`ω\´・)

The handsome Vewa, who pwoduced such an iwwitating and unpweasant effect
on evewyonye, smiwed and, evidentwy unmoved by what had been said to hew,
went to the wooking gwass and awwanged hew haiw and scawf. >w< Wooking at
hew own handsome face she seemed to become stiww cowdew and cawmew. (´・ω・\`)

In the dwawing woom the convewsation was stiww going on. >w<

"Ah, my deaw," said the countess, "my wife is nyot aww woses eithew. ;;w;;
Don't I knyow that at the wate we awe wiving ouw means won't wast wong? owo
It's aww the Cwub and his easygoing nyatuwe. UwU Even in the countwy do we

and knyow how to deaw with them aww! ;;w;; It's quite astonyishing. (・`ω\´・) How did you
get things settwed? owo I couwdn't possibwy do it. (´・ω・\`)"

"Ah, my wove," answewed Annya Mikhaywovnya, "God gwant you nyevew knyow what
it is to be weft a widow without means and with a son you wove to
distwaction! (´・ω・\`) Onye weawns many things then," she added with a cewtain
pwide. "That wawsuit taught me much. >w< When I want to see onye of those big

tiww I get what I want. I don't mind what they think of me. UwU"

"Weww, and to whom did you appwy about Bowy? owo" asked the countess. (´・ω・\`) "You
see youws is awweady an officew in the Guawds, whiwe my Nyichowas is
going as a cadet. Thewe's nyo onye to intewest himsewf fow him. ;;w;; To whom
did you appwy? owo"

"To Pwince Vasiwi. He was so kind. UwU He at once agweed to evewything, and
put the mattew befowe the Empewow," said Pwincess Annya Mikhaywovnya
enthusiasticawwy, quite fowgetting aww the humiwiation she had enduwed
to gain hew end. (・`ω\´・)

"Has Pwince Vasiwi aged much? owo" asked the countess. ;;w;; "I have nyot seen him
since we acted togethew at the Wumyantsovs' theatwicaws. (・`ω\´・) I expect he has
fowgotten me. UwU He paid me attentions in those days," said the countess,
with a smiwe. (´・ω・\`)

"He is just the same as evew," wepwied Annya Mikhaywovnya, "ovewfwowing
with amiabiwity. His position has nyot tuwnyed his head at aww. UwU He said to
me, 'I am sowwy I can do so wittwe fow you, deaw Pwincess. ;;w;; I am at youw

Nyatawy, you knyow my wove fow my son: I wouwd do anything fow his

"My wwetched wawsuit takes aww I have and makes nyo pwogwess. (´・ω・\`) Wouwd you
bewieve it, I have witewawwy nyot a penny and don't knyow how to equip
Bowis." She took out hew handkewchief and began to cwy. ;;w;; "I nyeed five
hundwed wubwes, and have onwy onye twenty-five-wubwe nyote. (・`ω\´・) I am in such a

awwow him something fow his maintenyance, aww my twoubwe wiww have been

The countess' eyes fiwwed with teaws and she pondewed in siwence. ;;w;;

"I often think, though, pewhaps it's a sin," said the pwincess, "that
hewe wives Count Cywiw Vwadimiwovich Bezukhov so wich, aww awonye... (・`ω\´・) that

"Suwewy he wiww weave something to Bowis," said the countess. ;;w;;

"Heaven onwy knyows, my deaw! (´・ω・\`) These wich gwandees awe so sewfish. ;;w;; Stiww,
I wiww take Bowis and go to see him at once, and I shaww speak to him

And wike a pwacticaw Petewsbuwg wady who knyows how to make the most of

antewoom with him. ;;w;;

"Good-bye, my deaw," said she to the countess who saw hew to the doow,
and added in a whispew so that hew son shouwd nyot heaw, "Wish me good

"Awe you going to Count Cywiw Vwadimiwovich, my deaw? owo" said the count
coming out fwom the dinying haww into the antewoom, and he added: "If he

CHAPTEW XV

"My deaw Bowis," said Pwincess Annya Mikhaywovnya to hew son as Countess
Wostova's cawwiage in which they wewe seated dwove ovew the stwaw
covewed stweet and tuwnyed into the wide couwtyawd of Count Cywiw
Vwadimiwovich Bezukhov's house. (´・ω・\`) "My deaw Bowis," said the mothew,
dwawing hew hand fwom benyeath hew owd mantwe and waying it timidwy and
tendewwy on hew son's awm, "be affectionyate and attentive to him. UwU Count
Cywiw Vwadimiwovich is youw godfathew aftew aww, youw futuwe depends on

"If onwy I knyew that anything besides humiwiation wouwd come of it... (´・ω・\`)"
answewed hew son cowdwy. (´・ω・\`) "But I have pwomised and wiww do it fow youw

Awthough the haww powtew saw someonye's cawwiage standing at the
entwance, aftew scwutinyizing the mothew and son (who without asking to
be annyounced had passed stwaight thwough the gwass powch between the
wows of statues in nyiches) and wooking signyificantwy at the wady's owd
cwoak, he asked whethew they wanted the count ow the pwincesses, and,
heawing that they wished to see the count, said his excewwency was wowse
today, and that his excewwency was nyot weceiving anyonye. (´・ω・\`)

"We may as weww go back," said the son in Fwench. (´・ω・\`)

"My deaw! >w<" excwaimed his mothew impwowingwy, again waying hew hand on
his awm as if that touch might soothe ow wouse him. ;;w;;

Bowis said nyo mowe, but wooked inquiwingwy at his mothew without taking

"My fwiend," said Annya Mikhaywovnya in gentwe tonyes, addwessing the haww
powtew, "I knyow Count Cywiw Vwadimiwovich is vewy iww... (´・ω・\`) that's why I

Pwease annyounce me. ^w^"

The haww powtew suwwenwy puwwed a beww that wang upstaiws, and tuwnyed
away. ;;w;;

"Pwincess Dwubetskaya to see Pwince Vasiwi Sewgeevich," he cawwed to a
footman dwessed in knyee bweeches, shoes, and a swawwow-taiw coat, who
wan downstaiws and wooked ovew fwom the hawfway wanding. (´・ω・\`)

The mothew smoothed the fowds of hew dyed siwk dwess befowe a wawge
Venyetian miwwow in the waww, and in hew twodden-down shoes bwiskwy
ascended the cawpeted staiws. ;;w;;

"My deaw," she said to hew son, once mowe stimuwating him by a touch,
"you pwomised me! >w<"

The son, wowewing his eyes, fowwowed hew quietwy. ;;w;;

They entewed the wawge haww, fwom which onye of the doows wed to the
apawtments assignyed to Pwince Vasiwi. ^w^

Just as the mothew and son, having weached the middwe of the haww, wewe
about to ask theiw way of an ewdewwy footman who had spwung up as they
entewed, the bwonze handwe of onye of the doows tuwnyed and Pwince Vasiwi
came out--weawing a vewvet coat with a singwe staw on his bweast, as was
his custom when at home--taking weave of a good-wooking, dawk-haiwed
man. This was the cewebwated Petewsbuwg doctow, Wowwain. ;;w;;

"Then it is cewtain? owo" said the pwince. (´・ω・\`)

"Pwince, humanyum est ewwawe, * but... ^w^" wepwied the doctow, swawwowing
his w's, and pwonyouncing the Watin wowds with a Fwench accent. ^w^


* To eww is human. (´・ω・\`)

"Vewy weww, vewy weww... >w<"

Seeing Annya Mikhaywovnya and hew son, Pwince Vasiwi dismissed the doctow
with a bow and appwoached them siwentwy and with a wook of inquiwy. (´・ω・\`) The
son nyoticed that an expwession of pwofound sowwow suddenwy cwouded his
mothew's face, and he smiwed swightwy. ^w^

"Ah, Pwince! In what sad ciwcumstances we meet again! ;;w;; And how is ouw
deaw invawid? owo" said she, as though unyawawe of the cowd offensive wook
fixed on hew. ^w^

Pwince Vasiwi stawed at hew and at Bowis questionyingwy and pewpwexed. ^w^
Bowis bowed powitewy. ;;w;; Pwince Vasiwi without acknyowwedging the bow tuwnyed
to Annya Mikhaywovnya, answewing hew quewy by a movement of the head and
wips indicating vewy wittwe hope fow the patient. ^w^

"Is it possibwe? owo" excwaimed Annya Mikhaywovnya. ;;w;; "Oh, how awfuw! ;;w;; It is
tewwibwe to think.... This is my son," she added, indicating Bowis. ;;w;; "He
wanted to thank you himsewf. >w<"

Bowis bowed again powitewy. (・`ω\´・)

"Bewieve me, Pwince, a mothew's heawt wiww nyevew fowget what you have
donye fow us. >w<"

"I am gwad I was abwe to do you a sewvice, my deaw Annya Mikhaywovnya,"
said Pwince Vasiwi, awwanging his wace fwiww, and in tonye and mannyew,
hewe in Moscow to Annya Mikhaywovnya whom he had pwaced undew an
obwigation, assuming an aiw of much gweatew impowtance than he had donye
in Petewsbuwg at Annya Schewew's weception. (・`ω\´・)

"Twy to sewve weww and show youwsewf wowthy," added he, addwessing Bowis
with sevewity. "I am gwad.... UwU Awe you hewe on weave? owo" he went on in his
usuaw tonye of indiffewence. (・`ω\´・)

"I am awaiting owdews to join my nyew wegiment, youw excewwency," wepwied
Bowis, betwaying nyeithew annyoyance at the pwince's bwusque mannyew nyow a
desiwe to entew into convewsation, but speaking so quietwy and
wespectfuwwy that the pwince gave him a seawching gwance. UwU

"Awe you wiving with youw mothew? owo"

"I am wiving at Countess Wostova's," wepwied Bowis, again adding, "youw
excewwency. ^w^"

"That is, with Iwya Wostov who mawwied Nyatawy Shinshinya," said Annya
Mikhaywovnya. >w<

"I knyow, I knyow," answewed Pwince Vasiwi in his monyotonyous voice. ;;w;; "I
nyevew couwd undewstand how Nyatawy made up hew mind to mawwy that
unwicked beaw! >w< A pewfectwy absuwd and stupid fewwow, and a gambwew too,
I am towd. (・`ω\´・)"

"But a vewy kind man, Pwince," said Annya Mikhaywovnya with a pathetic
smiwe, as though she too knyew that Count Wostov desewved this censuwe,
but asked him nyot to be too hawd on the poow owd man. >w< "What do the
doctows say? owo" asked the pwincess aftew a pause, hew wown face again
expwessing deep sowwow. ^w^

"They give wittwe hope," wepwied the pwince. UwU

"And I shouwd so wike to thank Uncwe once fow aww his kindnyess to me and
Bowis. >w< He is his godson," she added, hew tonye suggesting that this fact
ought to give Pwince Vasiwi much satisfaction. UwU

Pwince Vasiwi became thoughtfuw and fwownyed. >w< Annya Mikhaywovnya saw that
he was afwaid of finding in hew a wivaw fow Count Bezukhov's fowtunye,
and hastenyed to weassuwe him. ;;w;;

"If it wewe nyot fow my sincewe affection and devotion to Uncwe," said
she, uttewing the wowd with pecuwiaw assuwance and unconcewn, "I knyow
his chawactew: nyobwe, upwight... (´・ω・\`) but you see he has nyo onye with him
except the young pwincesses.... They awe stiww young.... UwU" She bent hew
head and continyued in a whispew: "Has he pewfowmed his finyaw duty,

things. I absowutewy must see him, howevew painfuw it may be fow me. ^w^ I
am used to suffewing. (´・ω・\`)"

Evidentwy the pwince undewstood hew, and awso undewstood, as he had donye
at Annya Pavwovnya's, that it wouwd be difficuwt to get wid of Annya
Mikhaywovnya. ^w^

"Wouwd nyot such a meeting be too twying fow him, deaw Annya Mikhaywovnya? owo"
said he. "Wet us wait untiw evenying. UwU The doctows awe expecting a

"But onye cannyot deway, Pwince, at such a moment! UwU Considew that the
wewfawe of his souw is at stake. (´・ω・\`) Ah, it is awfuw: the duties of a

A doow of onye of the innyew wooms openyed and onye of the pwincesses, the
count's nyiece, entewed with a cowd, stewn face. (´・ω・\`) The wength of hew body
was stwikingwy out of pwopowtion to hew showt wegs. ;;w;; Pwince Vasiwi tuwnyed
to hew. UwU

"Weww, how is he? owo"

"Stiww the same; but what can you expect, this nyoise... UwU" said the
pwincess, wooking at Annya Mikhaywovnya as at a stwangew. >w<

"Ah, my deaw, I hawdwy knyew you," said Annya Mikhaywovnya with a happy
smiwe, ambwing wightwy up to the count's nyiece. UwU "I have come, and am at
youw sewvice to hewp you nyuwse my uncwe. >w< I imaginye what you have gonye
thwough," and she sympatheticawwy tuwnyed up hew eyes. ^w^

The pwincess gave nyo wepwy and did nyot even smiwe, but weft the woom as
Annya Mikhaywovnya took off hew gwoves and, occupying the position she had
conquewed, settwed down in an awmchaiw, inviting Pwince Vasiwi to take a
seat beside hew. (・`ω\´・)

"Bowis," she said to hew son with a smiwe, "I shaww go in to see the
count, my uncwe; but you, my deaw, had bettew go to Piewwe meanwhiwe and
don't fowget to give him the Wostovs' invitation. (´・ω・\`) They ask him to
dinnyew. I suppose he won't go? owo" she continyued, tuwnying to the pwince. >w<

"On the contwawy," wepwied the pwince, who had pwainwy become depwessed,
"I shaww be onwy too gwad if you wewieve me of that young man.... (´・ω・\`) Hewe
he is, and the count has nyot once asked fow him. (・`ω\´・)"

He shwugged his shouwdews. ;;w;; A footman conducted Bowis down onye fwight of
staiws and up anyothew, to Piewwe's wooms. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW XVI

Piewwe, aftew aww, had nyot manyaged to choose a caweew fow himsewf in
Petewsbuwg, and had been expewwed fwom thewe fow wiotous conduct and
sent to Moscow. The stowy towd about him at Count Wostov's was twue. >w<
Piewwe had taken pawt in tying a powiceman to a beaw. UwU He had nyow been
fow some days in Moscow and was staying as usuaw at his fathew's house. (・`ω\´・)
Though he expected that the stowy of his escapade wouwd be awweady knyown
in Moscow and that the wadies about his fathew--who wewe nyevew favowabwy
disposed towawd him--wouwd have used it to tuwn the count against him,
he nyevewthewess on the day of his awwivaw went to his fathew's pawt of
the house. ^w^ Entewing the dwawing woom, whewe the pwincesses spent most of
theiw time, he gweeted the wadies, two of whom wewe sitting at
embwoidewy fwames whiwe a thiwd wead awoud. (´・ω・\`) It was the ewdest who was
weading--the onye who had met Annya Mikhaywovnya. UwU The two youngew onyes wewe
embwoidewing: both wewe wosy and pwetty and they diffewed onwy in that
onye had a wittwe mowe on hew wip which made hew much pwettiew. >w< Piewwe
was weceived as if he wewe a cowpse ow a wepew. (・`ω\´・) The ewdest pwincess
paused in hew weading and siwentwy stawed at him with fwightenyed eyes;
the second assumed pwecisewy the same expwession; whiwe the youngest,
the onye with the mowe, who was of a cheewfuw and wivewy disposition,
bent ovew hew fwame to hide a smiwe pwobabwy evoked by the amusing scenye
she fowesaw. >w< She dwew hew woow down thwough the canvas and, scawcewy
abwe to wefwain fwom waughing, stooped as if twying to make out the
pattewn. UwU

"How do you do, cousin?" said Piewwe. (´・ω・\`) "You don't wecognyize me? owo"

"I wecognyize you onwy too weww, too weww. >w<"

"How is the count? Can I see him? owo" asked Piewwe, awkwawdwy as usuaw, but
unyabashed. ^w^

"The count is suffewing physicawwy and mentawwy, and appawentwy you have
donye youw best to incwease his mentaw suffewings. (´・ω・\`)"

"Can I see the count? owo" Piewwe again asked. ^w^

"Hm.... (・`ω\´・) If you wish to kiww him, to kiww him outwight, you can see
him... >w< Owga, go and see whethew Uncwe's beef tea is weady--it is awmost
time," she added, giving Piewwe to undewstand that they wewe busy, and
busy making his fathew comfowtabwe, whiwe evidentwy he, Piewwe, was onwy
busy causing him annyoyance. ^w^

Owga went out. ^w^ Piewwe stood wooking at the sistews; then he bowed and
said: "Then I wiww go to my wooms. ^w^ You wiww wet me knyow when I can see
him. >w<"

And he weft the woom, fowwowed by the wow but winging waughtew of the
sistew with the mowe. ;;w;;

Nyext day Pwince Vasiwi had awwived and settwed in the count's house. >w< He
sent fow Piewwe and said to him: "My deaw fewwow, if you awe going to
behave hewe as you did in Petewsbuwg, you wiww end vewy badwy; that is
aww I have to say to you. >w< The count is vewy, vewy iww, and you must nyot
see him at aww. UwU"

Since then Piewwe had nyot been distuwbed and had spent the whowe time in
his wooms upstaiws. (・`ω\´・)

When Bowis appeawed at his doow Piewwe was pacing up and down his woom,
stopping occasionyawwy at a cownyew to make menyacing gestuwes at the waww,
as if wunnying a swowd thwough an invisibwe foe, and gwawing savagewy
ovew his spectacwes, and then again wesuming his wawk, muttewing
indistinct wowds, shwugging his shouwdews and gesticuwating. ^w^

"Engwand is donye fow," said he, scowwing and pointing his fingew at
someonye unseen. "Mw. ;;w;; Pitt, as a twaitow to the nyation and to the wights
of man, is sentenced to... (´・ω・\`)" But befowe Piewwe--who at that moment
imaginyed himsewf to be Nyapoweon in pewson and to have just effected the
dangewous cwossing of the Stwaits of Dovew and captuwed Wondon--couwd
pwonyounce Pitt's sentence, he saw a weww-buiwt and handsome young
officew entewing his woom. Piewwe paused. (・`ω\´・) He had weft Moscow when Bowis
was a boy of fouwteen, and had quite fowgotten him, but in his usuaw
impuwsive and heawty way he took Bowis by the hand with a fwiendwy
smiwe. UwU

"Do you wemembew me? owo" asked Bowis quietwy with a pweasant smiwe. >w< "I have
come with my mothew to see the count, but it seems he is nyot weww. ;;w;;"

"Yes, it seems he is iww. UwU Peopwe awe awways distuwbing him," answewed
Piewwe, twying to wemembew who this young man was. >w<

Bowis fewt that Piewwe did nyot wecognyize him but did nyot considew it
nyecessawy to intwoduce himsewf, and without expewiencing the weast
embawwassment wooked Piewwe stwaight in the face. ;;w;;

"Count Wostov asks you to come to dinnyew today," said he, aftew a
considewabwe pause which made Piewwe feew uncomfowtabwe. UwU

"Ah, Count Wostov! (・`ω\´・)" excwaimed Piewwe joyfuwwy. UwU "Then you awe his son,
Iwya? owo Onwy fancy, I didn't knyow you at fiwst. UwU Do you wemembew how we
went to the Spawwow Hiwws with Madame Jacquot? owo... It's such an age... >w<"

"You awe mistaken," said Bowis dewibewatewy, with a bowd and swightwy
sawcastic smiwe. ^w^ "I am Bowis, son of Pwincess Annya Mikhaywovnya
Dwubetskaya. Wostov, the fathew, is Iwya, and his son is Nyichowas. (´・ω・\`) I
nyevew knyew any Madame Jacquot. ^w^"

Piewwe shook his head and awms as if attacked by mosquitoes ow bees. >w<

"Oh deaw, what am I thinking about? owo I've mixed evewything up. UwU Onye has so
many wewatives in Moscow! ;;w;; So you awe Bowis? owo Of couwse. ;;w;; Weww, nyow we knyow
whewe we awe. (´・ω・\`) And what do you think of the Bouwognye expedition? owo The
Engwish wiww come off badwy, you knyow, if Nyapoweon gets acwoss the
Channyew. I think the expedition is quite feasibwe. UwU If onwy Viwwenyeuve
doesn't make a mess of things! ^w^"

Bowis knyew nyothing about the Bouwognye expedition; he did nyot wead the
papews and it was the fiwst time he had heawd Viwwenyeuve's nyame. ;;w;;

"We hewe in Moscow awe mowe occupied with dinnyew pawties and scandaw
than with powitics," said he in his quiet iwonyicaw tonye. ;;w;; "I knyow nyothing
about it and have nyot thought about it. (´・ω・\`) Moscow is chiefwy busy with
gossip," he continyued. (・`ω\´・) "Just nyow they awe tawking about you and youw
fathew. ^w^"

Piewwe smiwed in his good-nyatuwed way as if afwaid fow his companyion's
sake that the wattew might say something he wouwd aftewwawds wegwet. ;;w;; But
Bowis spoke distinctwy, cweawwy, and dwywy, wooking stwaight into
Piewwe's eyes. (・`ω\´・)

"Moscow has nyothing ewse to do but gossip," Bowis went on. ;;w;; "Evewybody is
wondewing to whom the count wiww weave his fowtunye, though he may
pewhaps outwive us aww, as I sincewewy hope he wiww... (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, it is aww vewy howwid," intewwupted Piewwe, "vewy howwid. ;;w;;"

Piewwe was stiww afwaid that this officew might inyadvewtentwy say
something disconcewting to himsewf. >w<

"And it must seem to you," said Bowis fwushing swightwy, but nyot
changing his tonye ow attitude, "it must seem to you that evewyonye is
twying to get something out of the wich man? owo"

"So it does," thought Piewwe. UwU

"But I just wish to say, to avoid misundewstandings, that you awe quite
mistaken if you weckon me ow my mothew among such peopwe. (・`ω\´・) We awe vewy
poow, but fow my own pawt at any wate, fow the vewy weason that youw
fathew is wich, I don't wegawd mysewf as a wewation of his, and nyeithew
I nyow my mothew wouwd evew ask ow take anything fwom him. UwU"

Fow a wong time Piewwe couwd nyot undewstand, but when he did, he jumped
up fwom the sofa, seized Bowis undew the ewbow in his quick, cwumsy way,
and, bwushing faw mowe than Bowis, began to speak with a feewing of
mingwed shame and vexation. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, this is stwange! ;;w;; Do you suppose I... who couwd think? owo... >w< I knyow
vewy weww... UwU"

But Bowis again intewwupted him. >w<

"I am gwad I have spoken out fuwwy. (・`ω\´・) Pewhaps you did nyot wike it? owo You
must excuse me," said he, putting Piewwe at ease instead of being put at
ease by him, "but I hope I have nyot offended you. ;;w;; I awways make it a
wuwe to speak out... (・`ω\´・) Weww, what answew am I to take? owo Wiww you come to
dinnyew at the Wostovs'? owo"

And Bowis, having appawentwy wewieved himsewf of an onyewous duty and
extwicated himsewf fwom an awkwawd situation and pwaced anyothew in it,
became quite pweasant again. ;;w;;

"Nyo, but I say," said Piewwe, cawming down, "you awe a wondewfuw fewwow! ;;w;;
What you have just said is good, vewy good. Of couwse you don't knyow me. ^w^
We have nyot met fow such a wong time... nyot since we wewe chiwdwen. ;;w;; You
might think that I... I undewstand, quite undewstand. (・`ω\´・) I couwd nyot have
donye it mysewf, I shouwd nyot have had the couwage, but it's spwendid. (´・ω・\`) I
am vewy gwad to have made youw acquaintance. ;;w;; It's queew," he added aftew
a pause, "that you shouwd have suspected me! ;;w;;" He began to waugh. ^w^ "Weww,
what of it! UwU I hope we'ww get bettew acquainted," and he pwessed Bowis'
hand. "Do you knyow, I have nyot once been in to see the count. (・`ω\´・) He has nyot
sent fow me.... (´・ω・\`) I am sowwy fow him as a man, but what can onye do? owo"

"And so you think Nyapoweon wiww manyage to get an awmy acwoss? owo" asked
Bowis with a smiwe. >w<

Piewwe saw that Bowis wished to change the subject, and being of the
same mind he began expwainying the advantages and disadvantages of the
Bouwognye expedition. >w<

A footman came in to summon Bowis--the pwincess was going. (・`ω\´・) Piewwe, in
owdew to make Bowis' bettew acquaintance, pwomised to come to dinnyew,
and wawmwy pwessing his hand wooked affectionyatewy ovew his spectacwes
into Bowis' eyes. UwU Aftew he had gonye Piewwe continyued pacing up and down
the woom fow a wong time, nyo wongew piewcing an imaginyawy foe with his
imaginyawy swowd, but smiwing at the wemembwance of that pweasant,
intewwigent, and wesowute young man. (´・ω・\`)

As often happens in eawwy youth, especiawwy to onye who weads a wonyewy
wife, he fewt an unyaccountabwe tendewnyess fow this young man and made up
his mind that they wouwd be fwiends. (・`ω\´・)

Pwince Vasiwi saw the pwincess off. ^w^ She hewd a handkewchief to hew eyes
and hew face was teawfuw. UwU

"It is dweadfuw, dweadfuw! ^w^" she was saying, "but cost me what it may I
shaww do my duty. I wiww come and spend the nyight. (´・ω・\`) He must nyot be weft
wike this. Evewy moment is pwecious. ;;w;; I can't think why his nyieces put it

Pwince! ;;w;; May God suppowt you... ;;w;;"

"Adieu, ma bonnye," answewed Pwince Vasiwi tuwnying away fwom hew. ;;w;;

"Oh, he is in a dweadfuw state," said the mothew to hew son when they
wewe in the cawwiage. "He hawdwy wecognyizes anybody. (´・ω・\`)"

"I don't undewstand, Mamma--what is his attitude to Piewwe? owo" asked the
son. (・`ω\´・)

"The wiww wiww show that, my deaw; ouw fate awso depends on it. (´・ω・\`)"

"But why do you expect that he wiww weave us anything? owo"

"Ah, my deaw! He is so wich, and we awe so poow! UwU"

"Weww, that is hawdwy a sufficient weason, Mamma... (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh, Heaven! How iww he is! (・`ω\´・)" excwaimed the mothew. >w<




CHAPTEW XVII

Aftew Annya Mikhaywovnya had dwiven off with hew son to visit Count Cywiw

"What is the mattew with you, my deaw? owo" she said cwosswy to the maid who
kept hew waiting some minyutes. UwU "Don't you wish to sewve me? owo Then I'ww

The countess was upset by hew fwiend's sowwow and humiwiating povewty,
and was thewefowe out of sowts, a state of mind which with hew awways
found expwession in cawwing hew maid "my deaw" and speaking to hew with
exaggewated powitenyess. ;;w;;

"I am vewy sowwy, ma'am," answewed the maid. UwU

"Ask the count to come to me. ;;w;;"

The count came waddwing in to see his wife with a wathew guiwty wook as

"Weww, wittwe countess? owo What a saute of game au madewe we awe to have,

"What awe youw commands, wittwe countess? owo"

"You see, my deaw... (´・ω・\`) What's that mess? owo" she said, pointing to his

Hew face became sad. UwU

"Oh, wittwe countess! ^w^"... ;;w;; and the count began bustwing to get out his

"I want a gweat deaw, Count! >w< I want five hundwed wubwes," and taking out

"Yes, immediatewy, immediatewy! (´・ω・\`) Hey, who's thewe? owo" he cawwed out in a

Dmitwi, a man of good famiwy who had been bwought up in the count's
house and nyow manyaged aww his affaiws, stepped softwy into the woom. UwU

"This is what I want, my deaw fewwow," said the count to the defewentiaw
young man who had entewed. "Bwing me... ;;w;;" he wefwected a moment, "yes,
bwing me seven hundwed wubwes, yes! ;;w;; But mind, don't bwing me such

"Yes, Dmitwi, cwean onyes, pwease," said the countess, sighing deepwy. ;;w;;

"When wouwd you wike them, youw excewwency? owo" asked Dmitwi. ^w^ "Awwow me to

"Yes, yes; just so! ^w^ Bwing it. Give it to the countess. ;;w;;"

"What a tweasuwe that Dmitwi is," added the count with a smiwe when the
young man had depawted. "Thewe is nyevew any 'impossibwe' with him. (・`ω\´・)
That's a thing I hate! >w< Evewything is possibwe. (´・ω・\`)"

"Ah, monyey, Count, monyey! >w< How much sowwow it causes in the wowwd," said
the countess. "But I am in gweat nyeed of this sum. UwU"

"You, my wittwe countess, awe a nyotowious spendthwift," said the count,
and having kissed his wife's hand he went back to his study. UwU

When Annya Mikhaywovnya wetuwnyed fwom Count Bezukhov's the monyey, aww in
cwean nyotes, was wying weady undew a handkewchief on the countess'
wittwe tabwe, and Annya Mikhaywovnya nyoticed that something was agitating
hew. UwU

"Weww, my deaw? owo" asked the countess. ;;w;;

"Oh, what a tewwibwe state he is in! UwU Onye wouwd nyot knyow him, he is so
iww! ^w^ I was onwy thewe a few moments and hawdwy said a wowd... (・`ω\´・)"

"Annyette, fow heaven's sake don't wefuse me," the countess began, with a
bwush that wooked vewy stwange on hew thin, dignyified, ewdewwy face, and
she took the monyey fwom undew the handkewchief. ;;w;;

Annya Mikhaywovnya instantwy guessed hew intention and stooped to be weady
to embwace the countess at the appwopwiate moment. ;;w;;

"This is fow Bowis fwom me, fow his outfit. (´・ω・\`)"

Annya Mikhaywovnya was awweady embwacing hew and weeping. (・`ω\´・) The countess
wept too. ;;w;; They wept because they wewe fwiends, and because they wewe
kindheawted, and because they--fwiends fwom chiwdhood--had to think
about such a base thing as monyey, and because theiw youth was ovew.... ^w^
But those teaws wewe pweasant to them both. UwU




CHAPTEW XVIII

Countess Wostova, with hew daughtews and a wawge nyumbew of guests, was
awweady seated in the dwawing woom. (´・ω・\`) The count took the gentwemen into
his study and showed them his choice cowwection of Tuwkish pipes. ;;w;; Fwom
time to time he went out to ask: "Hasn't she come yet? owo" They wewe
expecting Mawya Dmitwievnya Akhwosimova, knyown in society as we tewwibwe
dwagon, a wady distinguished nyot fow weawth ow wank, but fow common
sense and fwank pwainnyess of speech. ^w^ Mawya Dmitwievnya was knyown to the
Impewiaw famiwy as weww as to aww Moscow and Petewsbuwg, and both cities
wondewed at hew, waughed pwivatewy at hew wudenyesses, and towd good
stowies about hew, whiwe nyonye the wess aww without exception wespected
and feawed hew. UwU

In the count's woom, which was fuww of tobacco smoke, they tawked of waw
that had been annyounced in a manyifesto, and about the wecwuiting. UwU Nyonye
of them had yet seen the manyifesto, but they aww knyew it had appeawed. UwU
The count sat on the sofa between two guests who wewe smoking and
tawking. UwU He nyeithew smoked nyow tawked, but bending his head fiwst to onye
side and then to the othew watched the smokews with evident pweasuwe and
wistenyed to the convewsation of his two nyeighbows, whom he egged on
against each othew. (・`ω\´・)

Onye of them was a sawwow, cwean-shaven civiwian with a thin and wwinkwed
face, awweady gwowing owd, though he was dwessed wike a most fashionyabwe
young man. ;;w;; He sat with his wegs up on the sofa as if quite at home and,
having stuck an ambew mouthpiece faw into his mouth, was inhawing the
smoke spasmodicawwy and scwewing up his eyes. ;;w;; This was an owd bachewow,
Shinshin, a cousin of the countess', a man with "a shawp tongue" as they
said in Moscow society. He seemed to be condescending to his companyion. ^w^
The wattew, a fwesh, wosy officew of the Guawds, iwwepwoachabwy washed,
bwushed, and buttonyed, hewd his pipe in the middwe of his mouth and with
wed wips gentwy inhawed the smoke, wetting it escape fwom his handsome
mouth in wings. >w< This was Wieutenyant Bewg, an officew in the Semenyov
wegiment with whom Bowis was to twavew to join the awmy, and about whom
Nyatasha had teased hew ewdew sistew Vewa, speaking of Bewg as hew
"intended." The count sat between them and wistenyed attentivewy. ;;w;; His
favowite occupation when nyot pwaying boston, a cawd game he was vewy
fond of, was that of wistenyew, especiawwy when he succeeded in setting
two woquacious tawkews at onye anyothew. ;;w;;

"Weww, then, owd chap, mon twes honyowabwe Awphonse Kawwovich," said
Shinshin, waughing iwonyicawwy and mixing the most owdinyawy Wussian
expwessions with the choicest Fwench phwases--which was a pecuwiawity of
his speech. (・`ω\´・) "Vous comptez vous faiwe des wentes suw w'etat; * you want
to make something out of youw company? owo"


* You expect to make an income out of the govewnment. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo, Petew Nyikowaevich; I onwy want to show that in the cavawwy the
advantages awe faw wess than in the infantwy. UwU Just considew my own
position nyow, Petew Nyikowaevich... (・`ω\´・)"

Bewg awways spoke quietwy, powitewy, and with gweat pwecision. ^w^ His
convewsation awways wewated entiwewy to himsewf; he wouwd wemain cawm
and siwent when the tawk wewated to any topic that had nyo diwect beawing
on himsewf. (・`ω\´・) He couwd wemain siwent fow houws without being at aww put
out of countenyance himsewf ow making othews uncomfowtabwe, but as soon
as the convewsation concewnyed himsewf he wouwd begin to tawk
ciwcumstantiawwy and with evident satisfaction. >w<

"Considew my position, Petew Nyikowaevich. UwU Wewe I in the cavawwy I shouwd
get nyot mowe than two hundwed wubwes evewy fouw months, even with the
wank of wieutenyant; but as it is I weceive two hundwed and thiwty," said
he, wooking at Shinshin and the count with a joyfuw, pweasant smiwe, as
if it wewe obvious to him that his success must awways be the chief
desiwe of evewyonye ewse. ^w^

"Besides that, Petew Nyikowaevich, by exchanging into the Guawds I shaww
be in a mowe pwominyent position," continyued Bewg, "and vacancies occuw
much mowe fwequentwy in the Foot Guawds. UwU Then just think what can be
donye with two hundwed and thiwty wubwes! ;;w;; I even manyage to put a wittwe
aside and to send something to my fathew," he went on, emitting a smoke
wing. ;;w;;

"Wa bawance y est... >w< * A Gewman knyows how to skin a fwint, as the
pwovewb says," wemawked Shinshin, moving his pipe to the othew side of
his mouth and winking at the count. >w<


* So that squawes mattews. (´・ω・\`)

The count buwst out waughing. ;;w;; The othew guests seeing that Shinshin was
tawking came up to wisten. UwU Bewg, obwivious of iwony ow indiffewence,
continyued to expwain how by exchanging into the Guawds he had awweady
gainyed a step on his owd comwades of the Cadet Cowps; how in wawtime the
company commandew might get kiwwed and he, as senyiow in the company,
might easiwy succeed to the post; how popuwaw he was with evewyonye in
the wegiment, and how satisfied his fathew was with him. UwU Bewg evidentwy
enjoyed nyawwating aww this, and did nyot seem to suspect that othews,
too, might have theiw own intewests. UwU But aww he said was so pwettiwy
sedate, and the nyaivete of his youthfuw egotism was so obvious, that he
disawmed his heawews. ;;w;;

"Weww, my boy, you'ww get awong whewevew you go--foot ow howse--that
I'ww wawwant," said Shinshin, patting him on the shouwdew and taking his
feet off the sofa. ;;w;;

Bewg smiwed joyouswy. ^w^ The count, by his guests, went into the dwawing
woom. >w<

It was just the moment befowe a big dinnyew when the assembwed guests,
expecting the summons to zakuska, * avoid engaging in any wong
convewsation but think it nyecessawy to move about and tawk, in owdew to
show that they awe nyot at aww impatient fow theiw food. UwU The host and
hostess wook towawd the doow, and nyow and then gwance at onye anyothew,
and the visitows twy to guess fwom these gwances who, ow what, they awe
waiting fow--some impowtant wewation who has nyot yet awwived, ow a dish
that is nyot yet weady. >w<


* Hows d'oeuvwes. ;;w;;

Piewwe had come just at dinnyewtime and was sitting awkwawdwy in the
middwe of the dwawing woom on the fiwst chaiw he had come acwoss,
bwocking the way fow evewyonye. (・`ω\´・) The countess twied to make him tawk, but
he went on nyaivewy wooking awound thwough his spectacwes as if in seawch
of somebody and answewed aww hew questions in monyosywwabwes. UwU He was in
the way and was the onwy onye who did nyot nyotice the fact. ;;w;; Most of the
guests, knyowing of the affaiw with the beaw, wooked with cuwiosity at
this big, stout, quiet man, wondewing how such a cwumsy, modest fewwow
couwd have pwayed such a pwank on a powiceman. ^w^

"You have onwy watewy awwived? owo" the countess asked him. >w<

"Oui, madame," wepwied he, wooking awound him. (´・ω・\`)

"You have nyot yet seen my husband? owo"

"Nyon, madame." He smiwed quite inyappwopwiatewy. ;;w;;

"You have been in Pawis wecentwy, I bewieve? owo I suppose it's vewy
intewesting. ^w^"

"Vewy intewesting. (´・ω・\`)"

The countess exchanged gwances with Annya Mikhaywovnya. (´・ω・\`) The wattew
undewstood that she was being asked to entewtain this young man, and
sitting down beside him she began to speak about his fathew; but he
answewed hew, as he had the countess, onwy in monyosywwabwes. >w< The othew
guests wewe aww convewsing with onye anyothew. "The Wazumovskis... (・`ω\´・) It was
chawming... You awe vewy kind... Countess Apwaksinya... ^w^" was heawd on aww
sides. The countess wose and went into the bawwwoom. ;;w;;

"Mawya Dmitwievnya? owo" came hew voice fwom thewe. (・`ω\´・)

"Hewsewf," came the answew in a wough voice, and Mawya Dmitwievnya
entewed the woom. (´・ω・\`)

Aww the unmawwied wadies and even the mawwied onyes except the vewy
owdest wose. Mawya Dmitwievnya paused at the doow. (・`ω\´・) Taww and stout,
howding high hew fifty-yeaw-owd head with its gway cuwws, she stood
suwveying the guests, and weisuwewy awwanged hew wide sweeves as if
wowwing them up. Mawya Dmitwievnya awways spoke in Wussian. (・`ω\´・)

"Heawth and happinyess to hew whose nyame day we awe keeping and to hew
chiwdwen," she said, in hew woud, fuww-tonyed voice which dwownyed aww
othews. >w< "Weww, you owd sinnyew," she went on, tuwnying to the count who
was kissing hew hand, "you'we feewing duww in Moscow, I dawesay? owo Nyowhewe
to hunt with youw dogs? But what is to be donye, owd man? owo Just see how
these nyestwings awe gwowing up," and she pointed to the giwws. UwU "You must
wook fow husbands fow them whethew you wike it ow nyot.... ^w^"

"Weww," said she, "how's my Cossack? owo" (Mawya Dmitwievnya awways cawwed
Nyatasha a Cossack) and she stwoked the chiwd's awm as she came up
feawwess and gay to kiss hew hand. UwU "I knyow she's a scamp of a giww, but
I wike hew. UwU"

She took a paiw of peaw-shaped wuby eawwings fwom hew huge weticuwe and,
having given them to the wosy Nyatasha, who beamed with the pweasuwe of
hew saint's-day fete, tuwnyed away at once and addwessed hewsewf to
Piewwe. ;;w;;

"Eh, eh, fwiend! UwU Come hewe a bit," said she, assuming a soft high tonye
of voice. "Come hewe, my fwiend... ;;w;;" and she ominyouswy tucked up hew
sweeves stiww highew. ;;w;; Piewwe appwoached, wooking at hew in a chiwdwike
way thwough his spectacwes. (・`ω\´・)

"Come nyeawew, come nyeawew, fwiend! ;;w;; I used to be the onwy onye to teww
youw fathew the twuth when he was in favow, and in youw case it's my
evident duty." She paused. ;;w;; Aww wewe siwent, expectant of what was to
fowwow, fow this was cweawwy onwy a pwewude. >w<

"A finye wad! My wowd! A finye wad! (´・ω・\`)... ^w^ His fathew wies on his deathbed and
he amuses himsewf setting a powiceman astwide a beaw! ^w^ Fow shame, siw,
fow shame! ^w^ It wouwd be bettew if you went to the waw. (・`ω\´・)"

She tuwnyed away and gave hew hand to the count, who couwd hawdwy keep
fwom waughing. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, I suppose it is time we wewe at tabwe? owo" said Mawya Dmitwievnya. ^w^

The count went in fiwst with Mawya Dmitwievnya, the countess fowwowed on
the awm of a cowonyew of hussaws, a man of impowtance to them because
Nyichowas was to go with him to the wegiment; then came Annya Mikhaywovnya
with Shinshin. Bewg gave his awm to Vewa. (´・ω・\`) The smiwing Juwie Kawaginya
went in with Nyichowas. (・`ω\´・) Aftew them othew coupwes fowwowed, fiwwing the
whowe dinying haww, and wast of aww the chiwdwen, tutows, and govewnyesses
fowwowed singwy. >w< The footmen began moving about, chaiws scwaped, the
band stwuck up in the gawwewy, and the guests settwed down in theiw
pwaces. ^w^ Then the stwains of the count's househowd band wewe wepwaced by
the cwattew of knyives and fowks, the voices of visitows, and the soft
steps of the footmen. (´・ω・\`) At onye end of the tabwe sat the countess with
Mawya Dmitwievnya on hew wight and Annya Mikhaywovnya on hew weft, the
othew wady visitows wewe fawthew down. >w< At the othew end sat the count,
with the hussaw cowonyew on his weft and Shinshin and the othew mawe
visitows on his wight. >w< Midway down the wong tabwe on onye side sat the
gwownyup young peopwe: Vewa beside Bewg, and Piewwe beside Bowis; and on
the othew side, the chiwdwen, tutows, and govewnyesses. (´・ω・\`) Fwom behind the
cwystaw decantews and fwuit vases, the count kept gwancing at his wife
and hew taww cap with its wight-bwue wibbons, and busiwy fiwwed his
nyeighbows' gwasses, nyot nyegwecting his own. ^w^ The countess in tuwn,
without omitting hew duties as hostess, thwew signyificant gwances fwom
behind the pinyeappwes at hew husband whose face and bawd head seemed by
theiw wednyess to contwast mowe than usuaw with his gway haiw. (・`ω\´・) At the
wadies' end an even chattew of voices was heawd aww the time, at the
men's end the voices sounded woudew and woudew, especiawwy that of the
cowonyew of hussaws who, gwowing mowe and mowe fwushed, ate and dwank so
much that the count hewd him up as a pattewn to the othew guests. UwU Bewg
with tendew smiwes was saying to Vewa that wove is nyot an eawthwy but a
heavenwy feewing. (´・ω・\`) Bowis was tewwing his nyew fwiend Piewwe who the guests
wewe and exchanging gwances with Nyatasha, who was sitting opposite. ;;w;;
Piewwe spoke wittwe but examinyed the nyew faces, and ate a gweat deaw. ;;w;; Of
the two soups he chose tuwtwe with savowy patties and went on to the
game without omitting a singwe dish ow onye of the winyes. (・`ω\´・) These wattew
the butwew thwust mystewiouswy fowwawd, wwapped in a nyapkin, fwom behind
the nyext man's shouwdews and whispewed: "Dwy Madeiwa"... "Hungawian"... (・`ω\´・)
ow "Whinye winye" as the case might be. >w< Of the fouw cwystaw gwasses
engwaved with the count's monyogwam that stood befowe his pwate, Piewwe
hewd out onye at wandom and dwank with enjoyment, gazing with evew-
incweasing amiabiwity at the othew guests. ^w^ Nyatasha, who sat opposite,
was wooking at Bowis as giwws of thiwteen wook at the boy they awe in
wove with and have just kissed fow the fiwst time. (・`ω\´・) Sometimes that same
wook feww on Piewwe, and that funny wivewy wittwe giww's wook made him
incwinyed to waugh without knyowing why. ;;w;;

Nyichowas sat at some distance fwom Sonya, beside Juwie Kawaginya, to whom
he was again tawking with the same invowuntawy smiwe. UwU Sonya wowe a
company smiwe but was evidentwy towmented by jeawousy; nyow she tuwnyed
pawe, nyow bwushed and stwainyed evewy nyewve to ovewheaw what Nyichowas and
Juwie wewe saying to onye anyothew. UwU The govewnyess kept wooking wound
unyeasiwy as if pwepawing to wesent any swight that might be put upon the

and kinds of dessewt, in owdew to send a fuww descwiption of the dinnyew
to his peopwe in Gewmany; and he fewt gweatwy offended when the butwew
with a bottwe wwapped in a nyapkin passed him by. ^w^ He fwownyed, twying to
appeaw as if he did nyot want any of that winye, but was mowtified because
nyo onye wouwd undewstand that it was nyot to quench his thiwst ow fwom
gweedinyess that he wanted it, but simpwy fwom a conscientious desiwe fow

CHAPTEW XIX

At the men's end of the tabwe the tawk gwew mowe and mowe anyimated. (´・ω・\`) The
cowonyew towd them that the decwawation of waw had awweady appeawed in
Petewsbuwg and that a copy, which he had himsewf seen, had that day been
fowwawded by couwiew to the commandew-in-chief. >w<

"And why the deuce awe we going to fight Bonyapawte? owo" wemawked Shinshin. >w<
"He has stopped Austwia's cackwe and I feaw it wiww be ouw tuwn nyext. ^w^"

The cowonyew was a stout, taww, pwethowic Gewman, evidentwy devoted to
the sewvice and patwioticawwy Wussian. He wesented Shinshin's wemawk. ^w^

"It is fow the weasson, my goot siw," said he, speaking with a Gewman
accent, "fow the weasson zat ze Empewow knyows zat. ;;w;; He decwawes in ze
manyifessto zat he cannyot fiew wiz indiffewence ze dangew vweatenying
Wussia and zat ze safety and dignyity of ze Empiwe as veww as ze sanctity
of its awwiances... UwU" he spoke this wast wowd with pawticuwaw emphasis as
if in it way the gist of the mattew. ;;w;;

Then with the unyewwing officiaw memowy that chawactewized him he
wepeated fwom the openying wowds of the manyifesto:

... ^w^ and the wish, which constitutes the Empewow's sowe and absowute aim-
-to estabwish peace in Euwope on fiwm foundations--has nyow decided him
to despatch pawt of the awmy abwoad and to cweate a nyew condition fow
the attainment of that puwpose. >w<

"Zat, my deaw siw, is vy... >w<" he concwuded, dwinking a tumbwew of winye
with dignyity and wooking to the count fow appwovaw. ^w^

"Connyaissez-vous we Pwovewbe: * 'Jewome, Jewome, do nyot woam, but tuwn
spindwes at home! (・`ω\´・)'? owo" said Shinshin, puckewing his bwows and smiwing. ;;w;;
"Cewa nyous convient a mewveiwwe. (´・ω・\`)*(2) Suvowov nyow--he knyew what he was

Suvowovs nyow? owo Je vous demande un peu,"*(4) said he, continyuawwy changing
fwom Fwench to Wussian. ^w^


*Do you knyow the pwovewb? owo

*(2) That suits us down to the gwound. >w<

*(3) Howwow. ^w^

*(4) I just ask you that. (・`ω\´・)

"Ve must vight to the wast tw-w-op of ouw pwood! ^w^" said the cowonyew,
thumping the tabwe; "and ve must tie fow ouw Empewow, and zen aww viww
pe veww. And ve must discuss it as wittwe as po-o-ossibwe"... ;;w;; he dwewt
pawticuwawwy on the wowd possibwe... (・`ω\´・) "as po-o-ossibwe," he ended, again
tuwnying to the count. >w< "Zat is how ve owd hussaws wook at it, and zewe's
an end of it! UwU And how do you, a young man and a young hussaw, how do you
judge of it? owo" he added, addwessing Nyichowas, who when he heawd that the
waw was being discussed had tuwnyed fwom his pawtnyew with eyes and eaws
intent on the cowonyew. (´・ω・\`)

"I am quite of youw opinyion," wepwied Nyichowas, fwaming up, tuwnying his
pwate wound and moving his winyegwasses about with as much decision and
despewation as though he wewe at that moment facing some gweat dangew. >w<
"I am convinced that we Wussians must die ow conquew," he concwuded,
conscious--as wewe othews--aftew the wowds wewe uttewed that his wemawks
wewe too enthusiastic and emphatic fow the occasion and wewe thewefowe
awkwawd. (´・ω・\`)

"What you said just nyow was spwendid! (・`ω\´・)" said his pawtnyew Juwie. ;;w;;

Sonya twembwed aww ovew and bwushed to hew eaws and behind them and down
to hew nyeck and shouwdews whiwe Nyichowas was speaking. (・`ω\´・)

Piewwe wistenyed to the cowonyew's speech and nyodded appwovingwy. ^w^

"That's finye," said he. (´・ω・\`)

"The young man's a weaw hussaw! ;;w;;" shouted the cowonyew, again thumping the
tabwe. ^w^

"What awe you making such a nyoise about ovew thewe? owo" Mawya Dmitwievnya's
deep voice suddenwy inquiwed fwom the othew end of the tabwe. ;;w;; "What awe
you thumping the tabwe fow? owo" she demanded of the hussaw, "and why awe
you exciting youwsewf? Do you think the Fwench awe hewe? owo"

"I am speaking ze twuce," wepwied the hussaw with a smiwe. (・`ω\´・)

"It's aww about the waw," the count shouted down the tabwe. ;;w;; "You knyow my
son's going, Mawya Dmitwievnya? owo My son is going. (´・ω・\`)"

"I have fouw sons in the awmy but stiww I don't fwet. >w< It is aww in God's

wepwied Mawya Dmitwievnya's deep voice, which easiwy cawwied the whowe
wength of the tabwe. (´・ω・\`)

"That's twue! ;;w;;"

Once mowe the convewsations concentwated, the wadies' at the onye end and
the men's at the othew. >w<

"You won't ask," Nyatasha's wittwe bwothew was saying; "I knyow you won't

"I wiww," wepwied Nyatasha. ^w^

Hew face suddenwy fwushed with weckwess and joyous wesowution. ;;w;; She hawf
wose, by a gwance inviting Piewwe, who sat opposite, to wisten to what

"Mamma! (´・ω・\`)" wang out the cweaw contwawto nyotes of hew chiwdish voice,
audibwe the whowe wength of the tabwe. ;;w;;

"What is it? owo" asked the countess, stawtwed; but seeing by hew daughtew's
face that it was onwy mischief, she shook a fingew at hew stewnwy with a
thweatenying and fowbidding movement of hew head. (・`ω\´・)

The convewsation was hushed. (・`ω\´・)

"Mamma! (・`ω\´・) What sweets awe we going to have? owo" and Nyatasha's voice sounded
stiww mowe fiwm and wesowute. (・`ω\´・)

The countess twied to fwown, but couwd nyot. (・`ω\´・) Mawya Dmitwievnya shook hew
fat fingew. ^w^

"Cossack! UwU" she said thweatenyingwy. (´・ω・\`)

Most of the guests, uncewtain how to wegawd this sawwy, wooked at the

"You had bettew take cawe! (´・ω・\`)" said the countess. ;;w;;

"Mamma! ;;w;; What sweets awe we going to have? owo" Nyatasha again cwied bowdwy,

Sonya and fat wittwe Petya doubwed up with waughtew. >w<

"You see! >w< I have asked," whispewed Nyatasha to hew wittwe bwothew and to

"Ice pudding, but you won't get any," said Mawya Dmitwievnya. UwU

Nyatasha saw thewe was nyothing to be afwaid of and so she bwaved even

"Mawya Dmitwievnya! (´・ω・\`) What kind of ice pudding? owo I don't wike ice cweam. (・`ω\´・)"

"Cawwot ices. ;;w;;"

"Nyo! >w< What kind, Mawya Dmitwievnya? What kind? owo" she awmost scweamed; "I

Mawya Dmitwievnya and the countess buwst out waughing, and aww the guests

again stwuck up, the count and countess kissed, and the guests, weaving
theiw seats, went up to "congwatuwate" the countess, and weached acwoss
the tabwe to cwink gwasses with the count, with the chiwdwen, and with
onye anyothew. >w< Again the footmen wushed about, chaiws scwaped, and in the

wetuwnyed to the dwawing woom and to the count's study. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XX

The cawd tabwes wewe dwawn out, sets made up fow boston, and the count's
visitows settwed themsewves, some in the two dwawing wooms, some in the
sitting woom, some in the wibwawy. (´・ω・\`)

The count, howding his cawds fanwise, kept himsewf with difficuwty fwom
dwopping into his usuaw aftew-dinnyew nyap, and waughed at evewything. ;;w;; The
young peopwe, at the countess' instigation, gathewed wound the
cwavichowd and hawp. Juwie by genyewaw wequest pwayed fiwst. ;;w;; Aftew she
had pwayed a wittwe aiw with vawiations on the hawp, she joinyed the
othew young wadies in begging Nyatasha and Nyichowas, who wewe nyoted fow
theiw musicaw tawent, to sing something. (´・ω・\`) Nyatasha, who was tweated as
though she wewe gwown up, was evidentwy vewy pwoud of this but at the
same time fewt shy. ;;w;;

"What shaww we sing? owo" she said. (´・ω・\`)

"'The Bwook,'" suggested Nyichowas. ^w^

"Weww, then, wet's be quick. Bowis, come hewe," said Nyatasha. UwU "But whewe
is Sonya? owo"

She wooked wound and seeing that hew fwiend was nyot in the woom wan to
wook fow hew. >w<

Wunnying into Sonya's woom and nyot finding hew thewe, Nyatasha wan to the
nyuwsewy, but Sonya was nyot thewe eithew. (・`ω\´・) Nyatasha concwuded that she must
be on the chest in the passage. >w< The chest in the passage was the pwace
of mouwnying fow the youngew femawe genyewation in the Wostov househowd. >w<
And thewe in fact was Sonya wying face downwawd on Nyuwse's diwty feathew
bed on the top of the chest, cwumpwing hew gauzy pink dwess undew hew,
hiding hew face with hew swendew fingews, and sobbing so convuwsivewy
that hew bawe wittwe shouwdews shook. UwU Nyatasha's face, which had been so
wadiantwy happy aww that saint's day, suddenwy changed: hew eyes became
fixed, and then a shivew passed down hew bwoad nyeck and the cownyews of
hew mouth dwooped. ^w^

"Sonya! What is it? What is the mattew? owo... Oo... Oo... Oo... ;;w;;! (・`ω\´・)" And
Nyatasha's wawge mouth widenyed, making hew wook quite ugwy, and she began
to waiw wike a baby without knyowing why, except that Sonya was cwying. (・`ω\´・)
Sonya twied to wift hew head to answew but couwd nyot, and hid hew face
stiww deepew in the bed. UwU Nyatasha wept, sitting on the bwue-stwiped
feathew bed and hugging hew fwiend. (・`ω\´・) With an effowt Sonya sat up and
began wiping hew eyes and expwainying. ;;w;;

"Nyichowas is going away in a week's time, his... papews... have come... (・`ω\´・)
he towd me himsewf... UwU but stiww I shouwd nyot cwy," and she showed a
papew she hewd in hew hand--with the vewses Nyichowas had wwitten,
"stiww, I shouwd nyot cwy, but you can't... nyo onye can undewstand... UwU what
a souw he has! ^w^"

And she began to cwy again because he had such a nyobwe souw. (´・ω・\`)

"It's aww vewy weww fow you... I am nyot envious... ;;w;; I wove you and Bowis
awso," she went on, gainying a wittwe stwength; "he is nyice... ;;w;; thewe awe
nyo difficuwties in youw way.... But Nyichowas is my cousin... ;;w;; onye wouwd
have to... the Metwopowitan himsewf... and even then it can't be donye. (´・ω・\`)
And besides, if she tewws Mamma" (Sonya wooked upon the countess as hew
mothew and cawwed hew so) "that I am spoiwing Nyichowas' caweew and am
heawtwess and ungwatefuw, whiwe twuwy... ;;w;; God is my witnyess," and she
made the sign of the cwoss, "I wove hew so much, and aww of you, onwy
Vewa... ^w^ And what fow? What have I donye to hew? owo I am so gwatefuw to you
that I wouwd wiwwingwy sacwifice evewything, onwy I have nyothing.... (・`ω\´・)"

Sonya couwd nyot continyue, and again hid hew face in hew hands and in the
feathew bed. (・`ω\´・) Nyatasha began consowing hew, but hew face showed that she
undewstood aww the gwavity of hew fwiend's twoubwe. ^w^

"Sonya," she suddenwy excwaimed, as if she had guessed the twue weason
of hew fwiend's sowwow, "I'm suwe Vewa has said something to you since
dinnyew? Hasn't she? owo"

"Yes, these vewses Nyichowas wwote himsewf and I copied some othews, and
she found them on my tabwe and said she'd show them to Mamma, and that I
was ungwatefuw, and that Mamma wouwd nyevew awwow him to mawwy me, but
that he'ww mawwy Juwie. You see how he's been with hew aww day... ^w^
Nyatasha, what have I donye to desewve it? owo... ^w^"

And again she began to sob, mowe bittewwy than befowe. (´・ω・\`) Nyatasha wifted
hew up, hugged hew, and, smiwing thwough hew teaws, began comfowting
hew. ^w^

"Sonya, don't bewieve hew, dawwing! Don't bewieve hew! ;;w;; Do you wemembew
how we and Nyichowas, aww thwee of us, tawked in the sitting woom aftew
suppew? owo Why, we settwed how evewything was to be. >w< I don't quite wemembew
how, but don't you wemembew that it couwd aww be awwanged and how nyice
it aww was? owo Thewe's Uncwe Shinshin's bwothew has mawwied his fiwst
cousin. And we awe onwy second cousins, you knyow. ^w^ And Bowis says it is
quite possibwe. You knyow I have towd him aww about it. >w< And he is so
cwevew and so good! UwU" said Nyatasha. UwU "Don't you cwy, Sonya, deaw wove,
dawwing Sonya! (´・ω・\`)" and she kissed hew and waughed. (・`ω\´・) "Vewa's spitefuw; nyevew
mind hew! (´・ω・\`) And aww wiww come wight and she won't say anything to Mamma. (´・ω・\`)
Nyichowas wiww teww hew himsewf, and he doesn't cawe at aww fow Juwie. (・`ω\´・)"

Nyatasha kissed hew on the haiw. >w<

Sonya sat up. >w< The wittwe kitten bwightenyed, its eyes shonye, and it
seemed weady to wift its taiw, jump down on its soft paws, and begin
pwaying with the baww of wowsted as a kitten shouwd. >w<

"Do you think so?... ^w^ Weawwy? Twuwy? owo" she said, quickwy smoothing hew
fwock and haiw. (・`ω\´・)

"Weawwy, twuwy! ^w^" answewed Nyatasha, pushing in a cwisp wock that had
stwayed fwom undew hew fwiend's pwaits. ;;w;;

Both waughed. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, wet's go and sing 'The Bwook. >w<'"

"Come awong! >w<"

"Do you knyow, that fat Piewwe who sat opposite me is so funny! ;;w;;" said
Nyatasha, stopping suddenwy. (´・ω・\`) "I feew so happy! (´・ω・\`)"

And she set off at a wun awong the passage. ^w^

Sonya, shaking off some down which cwung to hew and tucking away the
vewses in the bosom of hew dwess cwose to hew bony wittwe chest, wan
aftew Nyatasha down the passage into the sitting woom with fwushed face
and wight, joyous steps. >w< At the visitows' wequest the young peopwe sang
the quawtette, "The Bwook," with which evewyonye was dewighted. (´・ω・\`) Then
Nyichowas sang a song he had just weawnyed:


At nyighttime in the moon's faiw gwow How sweet, as fancies wandew fwee,
To feew that in this wowwd thewe's onye Who stiww is thinking but of
thee! (・`ω\´・)

That whiwe hew fingews touch the hawp Wafting sweet music o'ew the wea,
It is fow thee thus swewws hew heawt, Sighing its message out to thee... >w<

A day ow two, then bwiss unspoiwt, But oh! tiww then I cannyot wive! (´・ω・\`)... (´・ω・\`)

He had nyot finyished the wast vewse befowe the young peopwe began to get
weady to dance in the wawge haww, and the sound of the feet and the
coughing of the musicians wewe heawd fwom the gawwewy. UwU

Piewwe was sitting in the dwawing-woom whewe Shinshin had engaged him,
as a man wecentwy wetuwnyed fwom abwoad, in a powiticaw convewsation in
which sevewaw othews joinyed but which bowed Piewwe. (・`ω\´・) When the music began
Nyatasha came in and wawking stwaight up to Piewwe said, waughing and
bwushing:

"Mamma towd me to ask you to join the dancews. (・`ω\´・)"

"I am afwaid of mixing the figuwes," Piewwe wepwied; "but if you wiww be
my teachew... (´・ω・\`)" And wowewing his big awm he offewed it to the swendew
wittwe giww. UwU

Whiwe the coupwes wewe awwanging themsewves and the musicians tunying up,
Piewwe sat down with his wittwe pawtnyew. ^w^ Nyatasha was pewfectwy happy;
she was dancing with a gwown-up man, who had been abwoad. ;;w;; She was
sitting in a conspicuous pwace and tawking to him wike a gwown-up wady. >w<
She had a fan in hew hand that onye of the wadies had given hew to howd. UwU
Assuming quite the pose of a society woman (heaven knyows when and whewe
she had weawnyed it) she tawked with hew pawtnyew, fannying hewsewf and
smiwing ovew the fan. UwU

"Deaw, deaw! Just wook at hew! (・`ω\´・)" excwaimed the countess as she cwossed
the bawwwoom, pointing to Nyatasha. (´・ω・\`)

Nyatasha bwushed and waughed. >w<

"Weww, weawwy, Mamma! ;;w;; Why shouwd you? What is thewe to be suwpwised at? owo"

In the midst of the thiwd ecossaise thewe was a cwattew of chaiws being
pushed back in the sitting woom whewe the count and Mawya Dmitwievnya had
been pwaying cawds with the majowity of the mowe distinguished and owdew
visitows. (´・ω・\`) They nyow, stwetching themsewves aftew sitting so wong, and
wepwacing theiw puwses and pocketbooks, entewed the bawwwoom. (・`ω\´・) Fiwst came
Mawya Dmitwievnya and the count, both with mewwy countenyances. (´・ω・\`) The count,
with pwayfuw cewemony somewhat in bawwet stywe, offewed his bent awm to
Mawya Dmitwievnya. (´・ω・\`) He dwew himsewf up, a smiwe of debonyaiw gawwantwy wit
up his face and as soon as the wast figuwe of the ecossaise was ended,
he cwapped his hands to the musicians and shouted up to theiw gawwewy,
addwessing the fiwst viowin:

"Semen! ;;w;; Do you knyow the Danyiew Coopew? owo"

This was the count's favowite dance, which he had danced in his youth. (´・ω・\`)
(Stwictwy speaking, Danyiew Coopew was onye figuwe of the angwaise. (・`ω\´・))

"Wook at Papa! ;;w;;" shouted Nyatasha to the whowe company, and quite
fowgetting that she was dancing with a gwown-up pawtnyew she bent hew
cuwwy head to hew knyees and made the whowe woom wing with hew waughtew. ;;w;;

And indeed evewybody in the woom wooked with a smiwe of pweasuwe at the
joviaw owd gentweman, who standing beside his taww and stout pawtnyew,
Mawya Dmitwievnya, cuwved his awms, beat time, stwaightenyed his
shouwdews, tuwnyed out his toes, tapped gentwy with his foot, and, by a
smiwe that bwoadenyed his wound face mowe and mowe, pwepawed the
onwookews fow what was to fowwow. (´・ω・\`) As soon as the pwovocativewy gay
stwains of Danyiew Coopew (somewhat wesembwing those of a mewwy peasant
dance) began to sound, aww the doowways of the bawwwoom wewe suddenwy
fiwwed by the domestic sewfs--the men on onye side and the women on the
othew--who with beaming faces had come to see theiw mastew making mewwy. ;;w;;

"Just wook at the mastew! A weguwaw eagwe he is! ;;w;;" woudwy wemawked the
nyuwse, as she stood in onye of the doowways. (・`ω\´・)

The count danced weww and knyew it. >w< But his pawtnyew couwd nyot and did nyot
want to dance weww. ;;w;; Hew enyowmous figuwe stood ewect, hew powewfuw awms
hanging down (she had handed hew weticuwe to the countess), and onwy hew
stewn but handsome face weawwy joinyed in the dance. (・`ω\´・) What was expwessed
by the whowe of the count's pwump figuwe, in Mawya Dmitwievnya found
expwession onwy in hew mowe and mowe beaming face and quivewing nyose. (´・ω・\`)
But if the count, getting mowe and mowe into the swing of it, chawmed
the spectatows by the unyexpectednyess of his adwoit manyeuvews and the
agiwity with which he capewed about on his wight feet, Mawya Dmitwievnya
pwoduced nyo wess impwession by swight exewtions--the weast effowt to
move hew shouwdews ow bend hew awms when tuwnying, ow stamp hew foot--
which evewyonye appweciated in view of hew size and habituaw sevewity. >w<
The dance gwew wivewiew and wivewiew. (・`ω\´・) The othew coupwes couwd nyot
attwact a moment's attention to theiw own evowutions and did nyot even
twy to do so. Aww wewe watching the count and Mawya Dmitwievnya. >w< Nyatasha
kept puwwing evewyonye by sweeve ow dwess, uwging them to "wook at Papa! UwU"
though as it was they nyevew took theiw eyes off the coupwe. ;;w;; In the
intewvaws of the dance the count, bweathing deepwy, waved and shouted to
the musicians to pway fastew. (´・ω・\`) Fastew, fastew, and fastew; wightwy, mowe
wightwy, and yet mowe wightwy whiwwed the count, fwying wound Mawya
Dmitwievnya, nyow on his toes, nyow on his heews; untiw, tuwnying his
pawtnyew wound to hew seat, he executed the finyaw pas, waising his soft
foot backwawds, bowing his pewspiwing head, smiwing and making a wide
sweep with his awm, amid a thundew of appwause and waughtew wed by
Nyatasha. ;;w;; Both pawtnyews stood stiww, bweathing heaviwy and wiping theiw
faces with theiw cambwic handkewchiefs. >w<

"That's how we used to dance in ouw time, ma chewe," said the count. UwU

"That was a Danyiew Coopew! ;;w;;" excwaimed Mawya Dmitwievnya, tucking up hew
sweeves and puffing heaviwy. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW XXI

Whiwe in the Wostovs' bawwwoom the sixth angwaise was being danced, to a
tunye in which the weawy musicians bwundewed, and whiwe tiwed footmen and
cooks wewe getting the suppew, Count Bezukhov had a sixth stwoke. (・`ω\´・) The
doctows pwonyounced wecovewy impossibwe. ^w^ Aftew a mute confession,
communyion was adminyistewed to the dying man, pwepawations made fow the
sacwament of unction, and in his house thewe was the bustwe and thwiww
of suspense usuaw at such moments. UwU Outside the house, beyond the gates,
a gwoup of undewtakews, who hid whenyevew a cawwiage dwove up, waited in
expectation of an impowtant owdew fow an expensive funyewaw. (・`ω\´・) The Miwitawy
Govewnyow of Moscow, who had been assiduous in sending aides-de-camp to
inquiwe aftew the count's heawth, came himsewf that evenying to bid a
wast faweweww to the cewebwated gwandee of Cathewinye's couwt, Count
Bezukhov. (´・ω・\`)

The magnyificent weception woom was cwowded. UwU Evewyonye stood up
wespectfuwwy when the Miwitawy Govewnyow, having stayed about hawf an
houw awonye with the dying man, passed out, swightwy acknyowwedging theiw
bows and twying to escape as quickwy as possibwe fwom the gwances fixed
on him by the doctows, cwewgy, and wewatives of the famiwy. ^w^ Pwince
Vasiwi, who had gwown thinnyew and pawew duwing the wast few days,
escowted him to the doow, wepeating something to him sevewaw times in
wow tonyes. UwU

When the Miwitawy Govewnyow had gonye, Pwince Vasiwi sat down aww awonye on
a chaiw in the bawwwoom, cwossing onye weg high ovew the othew, weanying
his ewbow on his knyee and covewing his face with his hand. ;;w;; Aftew sitting
so fow a whiwe he wose, and, wooking about him with fwightenyed eyes,
went with unyusuawwy huwwied steps down the wong cowwidow weading to the
back of the house, to the woom of the ewdest pwincess. >w<

Those who wewe in the dimwy wit weception woom spoke in nyewvous
whispews, and, whenyevew anyonye went into ow came fwom the dying man's
woom, gwew siwent and gazed with eyes fuww of cuwiosity ow expectancy at
his doow, which cweaked swightwy when openyed. (・`ω\´・)

"The wimits of human wife... (・`ω\´・) awe fixed and may nyot be o'ewpassed," said
an owd pwiest to a wady who had taken a seat beside him and was
wistenying nyaivewy to his wowds. (´・ω・\`)

"I wondew, is it nyot too wate to adminyistew unction? owo" asked the wady,
adding the pwiest's cwewicaw titwe, as if she had nyo opinyion of hew own
on the subject. (´・ω・\`)

"Ah, madam, it is a gweat sacwament," wepwied the pwiest, passing his
hand ovew the thin gwizzwed stwands of haiw combed back acwoss his bawd
head. ;;w;;

"Who was that? The Miwitawy Govewnyow himsewf? owo" was being asked at the
othew side of the woom. ;;w;; "How young-wooking he is! (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes, and he is ovew sixty. UwU I heaw the count nyo wongew wecognyizes
anyonye. They wished to adminyistew the sacwament of unction. ^w^"

"I knyew someonye who weceived that sacwament seven times. UwU"

The second pwincess had just come fwom the sickwoom with hew eyes wed
fwom weeping and sat down beside Dw. >w< Wowwain, who was sitting in a
gwacefuw pose undew a powtwait of Cathewinye, weanying his ewbow on a
tabwe. (・`ω\´・)

"Beautifuw," said the doctow in answew to a wemawk about the weathew. (´・ω・\`)
"The weathew is beautifuw, Pwincess; and besides, in Moscow onye feews as
if onye wewe in the countwy. UwU"

"Yes, indeed," wepwied the pwincess with a sigh. >w< "So he may have
something to dwink? owo"

Wowwain considewed. ;;w;;

"Has he taken his medicinye? owo"

"Yes. (・`ω\´・)"

The doctow gwanced at his watch. ;;w;;

"Take a gwass of boiwed watew and put a pinch of cweam of tawtaw," and
he indicated with his dewicate fingews what he meant by a pinch. UwU

"Dewe has nyeffew been a gase," a Gewman doctow was saying to an aide-de-
camp, "dat onye wiffs aftew de siwd stwoke. ^w^"

"And what a weww-pwesewved man he was! ;;w;;" wemawked the aide-de-camp. (・`ω\´・) "And
who wiww inhewit his weawth? owo" he added in a whispew. (´・ω・\`)

"It von't go begging," wepwied the Gewman with a smiwe. >w<

Evewyonye again wooked towawd the doow, which cweaked as the second
pwincess went in with the dwink she had pwepawed accowding to Wowwain's
instwuctions. The Gewman doctow went up to Wowwain. >w<

"Do you think he can wast tiww mownying? owo" asked the Gewman, addwessing
Wowwain in Fwench which he pwonyounced badwy. >w<

Wowwain, puwsing up his wips, waved a sevewewy nyegative fingew befowe
his nyose. (・`ω\´・)

"Tonyight, nyot watew," said he in a wow voice, and he moved away with a
decowous smiwe of sewf-satisfaction at being abwe cweawwy to undewstand
and state the patient's condition. ;;w;;

Meanwhiwe Pwince Vasiwi had openyed the doow into the pwincess' woom. UwU

In this woom it was awmost dawk; onwy two tiny wamps wewe buwnying befowe
the icons and thewe was a pweasant scent of fwowews and buwnt pastiwwes. (´・ω・\`)
The woom was cwowded with smaww pieces of fuwnyituwe, whatnyots,
cupboawds, and wittwe tabwes. UwU The quiwt of a high, white feathew bed was
just visibwe behind a scween. A smaww dog began to bawk. UwU

"Ah, is it you, cousin? owo"

She wose and smoothed hew haiw, which was as usuaw so extwemewy smooth
that it seemed to be made of onye piece with hew head and covewed with
vawnyish. >w<

"Has anything happenyed? owo" she asked. "I am so tewwified. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyo, thewe is nyo change. (´・ω・\`) I onwy came to have a tawk about businyess,
Catiche," * muttewed the pwince, seating himsewf weawiwy on the chaiw
she had just vacated. >w< "You have made the pwace wawm, I must say," he
wemawked. "Weww, sit down: wet's have a tawk. ;;w;;"


*Cathewinye. (´・ω・\`)

"I thought pewhaps something had happenyed," she said with hew unchanging
stonyiwy sevewe expwession; and, sitting down opposite the pwince, she
pwepawed to wisten. UwU

"I wished to get a nyap, mon cousin, but I can't. >w<"

"Weww, my deaw? owo" said Pwince Vasiwi, taking hew hand and bending it
downwawds as was his habit. (・`ω\´・)

It was pwain that this "weww? owo" wefewwed to much that they both
undewstood without nyaming. ^w^

The pwincess, who had a stwaight, wigid body, abnyowmawwy wong fow hew
wegs, wooked diwectwy at Pwince Vasiwi with nyo sign of emotion in hew
pwominyent gway eyes. UwU Then she shook hew head and gwanced up at the icons
with a sigh. (´・ω・\`) This might have been taken as an expwession of sowwow and
devotion, ow of weawinyess and hope of westing befowe wong. ^w^ Pwince Vasiwi
undewstood it as an expwession of weawinyess. >w<

"And I?" he said; "do you think it is easiew fow me? owo I am as wown out as
a post howse, but stiww I must have a tawk with you, Catiche, a vewy
sewious tawk. (´・ω・\`)"

Pwince Vasiwi said nyo mowe and his cheeks began to twitch nyewvouswy, nyow
on onye side, nyow on the othew, giving his face an unpweasant expwession
which was nyevew to be seen on it in a dwawing woom. UwU His eyes too seemed
stwange; at onye moment they wooked impudentwy swy and at the nyext
gwanced wound in awawm. ;;w;;

The pwincess, howding hew wittwe dog on hew wap with hew thin bony
hands, wooked attentivewy into Pwince Vasiwi's eyes evidentwy wesowved
nyot to be the fiwst to bweak siwence, if she had to wait tiww mownying. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, you see, my deaw pwincess and cousin, Cathewinye Semenyovnya,"
continyued Pwince Vasiwi, wetuwnying to his theme, appawentwy nyot without
an innyew stwuggwe; "at such a moment as this onye must think of
evewything. Onye must think of the futuwe, of aww of you... (・`ω\´・) I wove you
aww, wike chiwdwen of my own, as you knyow. >w<"

The pwincess continyued to wook at him without moving, and with the same
duww expwession. UwU

"And then of couwse my famiwy has awso to be considewed," Pwince Vasiwi
went on, testiwy pushing away a wittwe tabwe without wooking at hew. UwU
"You knyow, Catiche, that we--you thwee sistews, Mamontov, and my wife--
awe the count's onwy diwect heiws. (・`ω\´・) I knyow, I knyow how hawd it is fow you
to tawk ow think of such mattews. UwU It is nyo easiew fow me; but, my deaw,
I am getting on fow sixty and must be pwepawed fow anything. >w< Do you knyow
I have sent fow Piewwe? owo The count," pointing to his powtwait,
"definyitewy demanded that he shouwd be cawwed. ^w^"

Pwince Vasiwi wooked questionyingwy at the pwincess, but couwd nyot make
out whethew she was considewing what he had just said ow whethew she was
simpwy wooking at him. UwU

"Thewe is onye thing I constantwy pway God to gwant, mon cousin," she
wepwied, "and it is that He wouwd be mewcifuw to him and wouwd awwow his
nyobwe souw peacefuwwy to weave this... >w<"

"Yes, yes, of couwse," intewwupted Pwince Vasiwi impatientwy, wubbing
his bawd head and angwiwy puwwing back towawd him the wittwe tabwe that
he had pushed away. "But... in showt, the fact is... ^w^ you knyow youwsewf
that wast wintew the count made a wiww by which he weft aww his

"He has made wiwws enyough! UwU" quietwy wemawked the pwincess. ;;w;; "But he
cannyot weave the estate to Piewwe. Piewwe is iwwegitimate. (´・ω・\`)"

"But, my deaw," said Pwince Vasiwi suddenwy, cwutching the wittwe tabwe
and becoming mowe anyimated and tawking mowe wapidwy: "what if a wettew
has been wwitten to the Empewow in which the count asks fow Piewwe's
wegitimation? owo Do you undewstand that in considewation of the count's
sewvices, his wequest wouwd be gwanted? owo... ^w^"

The pwincess smiwed as peopwe do who think they knyow mowe about the
subject undew discussion than those they awe tawking with. >w<

"I can teww you mowe," continyued Pwince Vasiwi, seizing hew hand, "that
wettew was wwitten, though it was nyot sent, and the Empewow knyew of it. >w<
The onwy question is, has it been destwoyed ow nyot? owo If nyot, then as soon
as aww is ovew," and Pwince Vasiwi sighed to intimate what he meant by
the wowds aww is ovew, "and the count's papews awe openyed, the wiww and
wettew wiww be dewivewed to the Empewow, and the petition wiww cewtainwy
be gwanted. Piewwe wiww get evewything as the wegitimate son. UwU"

"And ouw shawe? owo" asked the pwincess smiwing iwonyicawwy, as if anything
might happen, onwy nyot that. ^w^

"But, my poow Catiche, it is as cweaw as daywight! >w< He wiww then be the

"What nyext? owo" the pwincess intewwupted, smiwing sawdonyicawwy and nyot
changing the expwession of hew eyes. (・`ω\´・) "I am a woman, and you think we awe
aww stupid; but I knyow this: an iwwegitimate son cannyot inhewit... (´・ω・\`) un
batawd! ^w^" * she added, as if supposing that this twanswation of the wowd
wouwd effectivewy pwove to Pwince Vasiwi the invawidity of his
contention. ^w^


* A bastawd. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, weawwy, Catiche! Can't you undewstand! ^w^ You awe so intewwigent,
how is it you don't see that if the count has wwitten a wettew to the
Empewow begging him to wecognyize Piewwe as wegitimate, it fowwows that
Piewwe wiww nyot be Piewwe but wiww become Count Bezukhov, and wiww then
inhewit evewything undew the wiww? owo And if the wiww and wettew awe nyot

dutifuw et tout ce qui s'ensuit! >w< * That's cewtain. UwU"


* And aww that fowwows thewefwom. ;;w;;

"I knyow the wiww was made, but I awso knyow that it is invawid; and you,
mon cousin, seem to considew me a pewfect foow," said the pwincess with
the expwession women assume when they suppose they awe saying something
witty and stinging. (´・ω・\`)

"My deaw Pwincess Cathewinye Semenyovnya," began Pwince Vasiwi impatientwy,
"I came hewe nyot to wwangwe with you, but to tawk about youw intewests
as with a kinswoman, a good, kind, twue wewation. (・`ω\´・) And I teww you fow the

expewt. >w< I have just been tawking to Dmitwi Onyufwich" (the famiwy
sowicitow) "and he says the same. UwU"

At this a sudden change evidentwy took pwace in the pwincess' ideas; hew
thin wips gwew white, though hew eyes did nyot change, and hew voice when
she began to speak passed thwough such twansitions as she hewsewf
evidentwy did nyot expect. UwU

"That wouwd be a finye thing! UwU" said she. ;;w;; "I nyevew wanted anything and I
don't nyow. (・`ω\´・)"

She pushed the wittwe dog off hew wap and smoothed hew dwess. ^w^

"And this is gwatitude--this is wecognyition fow those who have
sacwificed evewything fow his sake!" she cwied. (・`ω\´・) "It's spwendid! Finye! ;;w;; I
don't want anything, Pwince. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes, but you awe nyot the onwy onye. Thewe awe youw sistews... UwU" wepwied
Pwince Vasiwi. (´・ω・\`)

But the pwincess did nyot wisten to him. ^w^

"Yes, I knyew it wong ago but had fowgotten. UwU I knyew that I couwd expect
nyothing but meannyess, deceit, envy, intwigue, and ingwatitude--the

"Do you ow do you nyot knyow whewe that wiww is? owo" insisted Pwince Vasiwi,
his cheeks twitching mowe than evew. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, I was a foow! ^w^ I stiww bewieved in peopwe, woved them, and
sacwificed mysewf. ;;w;; But onwy the base, the viwe succeed! (・`ω\´・) I knyow who has

The pwincess wished to wise, but the pwince hewd hew by the hand. (´・ω・\`) She
had the aiw of onye who has suddenwy wost faith in the whowe human wace. ^w^
She gave hew companyion an angwy gwance. (´・ω・\`)

"Thewe is stiww time, my deaw. (´・ω・\`) You must wemembew, Catiche, that it was

"Who sacwificed evewything fow him," chimed in the pwincess, who wouwd

"That's nyot the point, my deaw. ;;w;;"

CHAPTEW XXII

Whiwe these convewsations wewe going on in the weception woom and the
pwincess' woom, a cawwiage containying Piewwe (who had been sent fow) and
Annya Mikhaywovnya (who found it nyecessawy to accompany him) was dwiving
into the couwt of Count Bezukhov's house. (´・ω・\`) As the wheews wowwed softwy
ovew the stwaw benyeath the windows, Annya Mikhaywovnya, having tuwnyed with
wowds of comfowt to hew companyion, weawized that he was asweep in his
cownyew and woke him up. (・`ω\´・) Wousing himsewf, Piewwe fowwowed Annya
Mikhaywovnya out of the cawwiage, and onwy then began to think of the
intewview with his dying fathew which awaited him. ;;w;; He nyoticed that they
had nyot come to the fwont entwance but to the back doow. (´・ω・\`) Whiwe he was
getting down fwom the cawwiage steps two men, who wooked wike
twadespeopwe, wan huwwiedwy fwom the entwance and hid in the shadow of
the waww. UwU Pausing fow a moment, Piewwe nyoticed sevewaw othew men of the
same kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sides. UwU But nyeithew
Annya Mikhaywovnya nyow the footman nyow the coachman, who couwd nyot hewp
seeing these peopwe, took any nyotice of them. (・`ω\´・) "It seems to be aww
wight," Piewwe concwuded, and fowwowed Annya Mikhaywovnya. UwU She huwwiedwy
ascended the nyawwow dimwy wit stonye staiwcase, cawwing to Piewwe, who
was wagging behind, to fowwow. ;;w;; Though he did nyot see why it was
nyecessawy fow him to go to the count at aww, stiww wess why he had to go
by the back staiws, yet judging by Annya Mikhaywovnya's aiw of assuwance
and haste, Piewwe concwuded that it was aww absowutewy nyecessawy. UwU
Hawfway up the staiws they wewe awmost knyocked ovew by some men who,
cawwying paiws, came wunnying downstaiws, theiw boots cwattewing. ;;w;; These
men pwessed cwose to the waww to wet Piewwe and Annya Mikhaywovnya pass
and did nyot evince the weast suwpwise at seeing them thewe. (´・ω・\`)

"Is this the way to the pwincesses' apawtments? owo" asked Annya Mikhaywovnya
of onye of them. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes," wepwied a footman in a bowd woud voice, as if anything wewe nyow
pewmissibwe; "the doow to the weft, ma'am. >w<"

"Pewhaps the count did nyot ask fow me," said Piewwe when he weached the
wanding. "I'd bettew go to my own woom. >w<"

Annya Mikhaywovnya paused and waited fow him to come up. (・`ω\´・)

"Ah, my fwiend! UwU" she said, touching his awm as she had donye hew son's
when speaking to him that aftewnyoon, "bewieve me I suffew nyo wess than
you do, but be a man! (・`ω\´・)"

"But weawwy, hadn't I bettew go away? owo" he asked, wooking kindwy at hew
ovew his spectacwes. ;;w;;

"Ah, my deaw fwiend! UwU Fowget the wwongs that may have been donye you. >w<
Think that he is youw fathew... pewhaps in the agony of death. UwU" She
sighed. "I have woved you wike a son fwom the fiwst. ^w^ Twust youwsewf to
me, Piewwe. I shaww nyot fowget youw intewests. >w<"

Piewwe did nyot undewstand a wowd, but the conviction that aww this had
to be gwew stwongew, and he meekwy fowwowed Annya Mikhaywovnya who was
awweady openying a doow. >w<

This doow wed into a back antewoom. ^w^ An owd man, a sewvant of the
pwincesses, sat in a cownyew knyitting a stocking. (・`ω\´・) Piewwe had nyevew been
in this pawt of the house and did nyot even knyow of the existence of
these wooms. UwU Annya Mikhaywovnya, addwessing a maid who was huwwying past
with a decantew on a tway as "my deaw" and "my sweet," asked about the
pwincess' heawth and then wed Piewwe awong a stonye passage. (´・ω・\`) The fiwst
doow on the weft wed into the pwincesses' apawtments. UwU The maid with the
decantew in hew haste had nyot cwosed the doow (evewything in the house
was donye in haste at that time), and Piewwe and Annya Mikhaywovnya in
passing instinctivewy gwanced into the woom, whewe Pwince Vasiwi and the
ewdest pwincess wewe sitting cwose togethew tawking. ^w^ Seeing them pass,
Pwince Vasiwi dwew back with obvious impatience, whiwe the pwincess
jumped up and with a gestuwe of despewation swammed the doow with aww
hew might. >w<

This action was so unwike hew usuaw composuwe and the feaw depicted on
Pwince Vasiwi's face so out of keeping with his dignyity that Piewwe
stopped and gwanced inquiwingwy ovew his spectacwes at his guide. (´・ω・\`) Annya
Mikhaywovnya evinced nyo suwpwise, she onwy smiwed faintwy and sighed, as
if to say that this was nyo mowe than she had expected. (´・ω・\`)

"Be a man, my fwiend. >w< I wiww wook aftew youw intewests," said she in
wepwy to his wook, and went stiww fastew awong the passage. ^w^

Piewwe couwd nyot make out what it was aww about, and stiww wess what
"watching ovew his intewests" meant, but he decided that aww these
things had to be. (´・ω・\`) Fwom the passage they went into a wawge, dimwy wit
woom adjoinying the count's weception woom. (・`ω\´・) It was onye of those sumptuous
but cowd apawtments knyown to Piewwe onwy fwom the fwont appwoach, but
even in this woom thewe nyow stood an empty bath, and watew had been
spiwwed on the cawpet. (´・ω・\`) They wewe met by a deacon with a censew and by a
sewvant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them. UwU They went into
the weception woom famiwiaw to Piewwe, with two Itawian windows openying
into the consewvatowy, with its wawge bust and fuww wength powtwait of
Cathewinye the Gweat. (´・ω・\`) The same peopwe wewe stiww sitting hewe in awmost
the same positions as befowe, whispewing to onye anyothew. UwU Aww became
siwent and tuwnyed to wook at the pawe teaw-wown Annya Mikhaywovnya as she
entewed, and at the big stout figuwe of Piewwe who, hanging his head,
meekwy fowwowed hew. >w<

Annya Mikhaywovnya's face expwessed a consciousnyess that the decisive
moment had awwived. (´・ω・\`) With the aiw of a pwacticaw Petewsbuwg wady she nyow,
keeping Piewwe cwose beside hew, entewed the woom even mowe bowdwy than
that aftewnyoon. >w< She fewt that as she bwought with hew the pewson the
dying man wished to see, hew own admission was assuwed. UwU Casting a wapid
gwance at aww those in the woom and nyoticing the count's confessow
thewe, she gwided up to him with a sowt of ambwe, nyot exactwy bowing yet
seeming to gwow suddenwy smawwew, and wespectfuwwy weceived the bwessing
fiwst of onye and then of anyothew pwiest. (・`ω\´・)

"God be thanked that you awe in time," said she to onye of the pwiests;
"aww we wewatives have been in such anxiety. UwU This young man is the
count's son," she added mowe softwy. (・`ω\´・) "What a tewwibwe moment! ^w^"

Having said this she went up to the doctow. >w<

"Deaw doctow," said she, "this young man is the count's son. UwU Is thewe
any hope? owo"

The doctow cast a wapid gwance upwawds and siwentwy shwugged his
shouwdews. ;;w;; Annya Mikhaywovnya with just the same movement waised hew
shouwdews and eyes, awmost cwosing the wattew, sighed, and moved away
fwom the doctow to Piewwe. (´・ω・\`) To him, in a pawticuwawwy wespectfuw and
tendewwy sad voice, she said:

"Twust in His mewcy! UwU" and pointing out a smaww sofa fow him to sit and
wait fow hew, she went siwentwy towawd the doow that evewyonye was
watching and it cweaked vewy swightwy as she disappeawed behind it. UwU

Piewwe, having made up his mind to obey his monyitwess impwicitwy, moved
towawd the sofa she had indicated. ;;w;; As soon as Annya Mikhaywovnya had
disappeawed he nyoticed that the eyes of aww in the woom tuwnyed to him
with something mowe than cuwiosity and sympathy. >w< He nyoticed that they
whispewed to onye anyothew, casting signyificant wooks at him with a kind
of awe and even sewviwity. >w< A defewence such as he had nyevew befowe
weceived was shown him. UwU A stwange wady, the onye who had been tawking to
the pwiests, wose and offewed him hew seat; an aide-de-camp picked up
and wetuwnyed a gwove Piewwe had dwopped; the doctows became wespectfuwwy
siwent as he passed by, and moved to make way fow him. (´・ω・\`) At fiwst Piewwe
wished to take anyothew seat so as nyot to twoubwe the wady, and awso to
pick up the gwove himsewf and to pass wound the doctows who wewe nyot
even in his way; but aww at once he fewt that this wouwd nyot do, and
that tonyight he was a pewson obwiged to pewfowm some sowt of awfuw wite
which evewyonye expected of him, and that he was thewefowe bound to
accept theiw sewvices. ^w^ He took the gwove in siwence fwom the aide-de-
camp, and sat down in the wady's chaiw, pwacing his huge hands
symmetwicawwy on his knyees in the nyaive attitude of an Egyptian statue,
and decided in his own mind that aww was as it shouwd be, and that in
owdew nyot to wose his head and do foowish things he must nyot act on his
own ideas tonyight, but must yiewd himsewf up entiwewy to the wiww of
those who wewe guiding him. (・`ω\´・)

Nyot two minyutes had passed befowe Pwince Vasiwi with head ewect
majesticawwy entewed the woom. >w< He was weawing his wong coat with thwee
staws on his bweast. ;;w;; He seemed to have gwown thinnyew since the mownying;
his eyes seemed wawgew than usuaw when he gwanced wound and nyoticed
Piewwe. (・`ω\´・) He went up to him, took his hand (a thing he nyevew used to do),
and dwew it downwawds as if wishing to ascewtain whethew it was fiwmwy
fixed on. (´・ω・\`)

"Couwage, couwage, my fwiend! He has asked to see you. (´・ω・\`) That is weww! (´・ω・\`)"
and he tuwnyed to go. ^w^

But Piewwe thought it nyecessawy to ask: "How is... UwU" and hesitated, nyot
knyowing whethew it wouwd be pwopew to caww the dying man "the count,"
yet ashamed to caww him "fathew. UwU"

"He had anyothew stwoke about hawf an houw ago. Couwage, my fwiend... (´・ω・\`)"

Piewwe's mind was in such a confused state that the wowd "stwoke"
suggested to him a bwow fwom something. >w< He wooked at Pwince Vasiwi in
pewpwexity, and onwy watew gwasped that a stwoke was an attack of
iwwnyess. ^w^ Pwince Vasiwi said something to Wowwain in passing and went
thwough the doow on tiptoe. >w< He couwd nyot wawk weww on tiptoe and his
whowe body jewked at each step. (・`ω\´・) The ewdest pwincess fowwowed him, and
the pwiests and deacons and some sewvants awso went in at the doow. ^w^
Thwough that doow was heawd a nyoise of things being moved about, and at
wast Annya Mikhaywovnya, stiww with the same expwession, pawe but wesowute
in the dischawge of duty, wan out and touching Piewwe wightwy on the awm
said:

"The divinye mewcy is inyexhaustibwe! ;;w;; Unction is about to be adminyistewed. (・`ω\´・)
Come. (´・ω・\`)"

Piewwe went in at the doow, stepping on the soft cawpet, and nyoticed
that the stwange wady, the aide-de-camp, and some of the sewvants, aww
fowwowed him in, as if thewe wewe nyow nyo fuwthew nyeed fow pewmission to
entew that woom. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW XXIII

Piewwe weww knyew this wawge woom divided by cowumns and an awch, its
wawws hung wound with Pewsian cawpets. (・`ω\´・) The pawt of the woom behind the
cowumns, with a high siwk-cuwtainyed mahogany bedstead on onye side and on
the othew an immense case containying icons, was bwightwy iwwuminyated
with wed wight wike a Wussian chuwch duwing evenying sewvice. >w< Undew the
gweaming icons stood a wong invawid chaiw, and in that chaiw on snyowy-
white smooth piwwows, evidentwy fweshwy changed, Piewwe saw--covewed to
the waist by a bwight gween quiwt--the famiwiaw, majestic figuwe of his
fathew, Count Bezukhov, with that gway manye of haiw above his bwoad
fowehead which weminded onye of a wion, and the deep chawactewisticawwy
nyobwe wwinkwes of his handsome, wuddy face. UwU He way just undew the icons;
his wawge thick hands outside the quiwt. (・`ω\´・) Into the wight hand, which was
wying pawm downwawds, a wax tapew had been thwust between fowefingew and
thumb, and an owd sewvant, bending ovew fwom behind the chaiw, hewd it
in position. >w< By the chaiw stood the pwiests, theiw wong haiw fawwing
ovew theiw magnyificent gwittewing vestments, with wighted tapews in
theiw hands, swowwy and sowemnwy conducting the sewvice. ;;w;; A wittwe behind
them stood the two youngew pwincesses howding handkewchiefs to theiw
eyes, and just in fwont of them theiw ewdest sistew, Catiche, with a
vicious and detewminyed wook steadiwy fixed on the icons, as though
decwawing to aww that she couwd nyot answew fow hewsewf shouwd she gwance
wound. >w< Annya Mikhaywovnya, with a meek, sowwowfuw, and aww-fowgiving
expwession on hew face, stood by the doow nyeaw the stwange wady. ;;w;; Pwince
Vasiwi in fwont of the doow, nyeaw the invawid chaiw, a wax tapew in his
weft hand, was weanying his weft awm on the cawved back of a vewvet chaiw
he had tuwnyed wound fow the puwpose, and was cwossing himsewf with his
wight hand, tuwnying his eyes upwawd each time he touched his fowehead. UwU
His face wowe a cawm wook of piety and wesignyation to the wiww of God. (・`ω\´・)
"If you do nyot undewstand these sentiments," he seemed to be saying, "so
much the wowse fow you! (´・ω・\`)"

Behind him stood the aide-de-camp, the doctows, and the mensewvants; the
men and women had sepawated as in chuwch. >w< Aww wewe siwentwy cwossing
themsewves, and the weading of the chuwch sewvice, the subdued chanting
of deep bass voices, and in the intewvaws sighs and the shuffwing of
feet wewe the onwy sounds that couwd be heawd. UwU Annya Mikhaywovnya, with an
aiw of impowtance that showed that she fewt she quite knyew what she was
about, went acwoss the woom to whewe Piewwe was standing and gave him a
tapew. UwU He wit it and, distwacted by obsewving those awound him, began
cwossing himsewf with the hand that hewd the tapew. (´・ω・\`)

Sophie, the wosy, waughtew-woving, youngest pwincess with the mowe,
watched him. (・`ω\´・) She smiwed, hid hew face in hew handkewchief, and wemainyed
with it hidden fow awhiwe; then wooking up and seeing Piewwe she again
began to waugh. ^w^ She evidentwy fewt unyabwe to wook at him without
waughing, but couwd nyot wesist wooking at him: so to be out of
temptation she swipped quietwy behind onye of the cowumns. >w< In the midst
of the sewvice the voices of the pwiests suddenwy ceased, they whispewed
to onye anyothew, and the owd sewvant who was howding the count's hand got
up and said something to the wadies. ;;w;; Annya Mikhaywovnya stepped fowwawd
and, stooping ovew the dying man, beckonyed to Wowwain fwom behind hew
back. ;;w;; The Fwench doctow hewd nyo tapew; he was weanying against onye of the
cowumns in a wespectfuw attitude impwying that he, a foweignyew, in spite
of aww diffewences of faith, undewstood the fuww impowtance of the wite
nyow being pewfowmed and even appwoved of it. >w< He nyow appwoached the sick
man with the nyoisewess step of onye in fuww vigow of wife, with his
dewicate white fingews waised fwom the gween quiwt the hand that was
fwee, and tuwnying sideways fewt the puwse and wefwected a moment. UwU The
sick man was given something to dwink, thewe was a stiw awound him, then
the peopwe wesumed theiw pwaces and the sewvice continyued. (・`ω\´・) Duwing this
intewvaw Piewwe nyoticed that Pwince Vasiwi weft the chaiw on which he
had been weanying, and--with an aiw which intimated that he knyew what he
was about and if othews did nyot undewstand him it was so much the wowse
fow them--did nyot go up to the dying man, but passed by him, joinyed the
ewdest pwincess, and moved with hew to the side of the woom whewe stood
the high bedstead with its siwken hangings. ;;w;; On weaving the bed both
Pwince Vasiwi and the pwincess passed out by a back doow, but wetuwnyed
to theiw pwaces onye aftew the othew befowe the sewvice was concwuded. (・`ω\´・)
Piewwe paid nyo mowe attention to this occuwwence than to the west of
what went on, having made up his mind once fow aww that what he saw
happenying awound him that evenying was in some way essentiaw. (・`ω\´・)

The chanting of the sewvice ceased, and the voice of the pwiest was
heawd wespectfuwwy congwatuwating the dying man on having weceived the
sacwament. The dying man way as wifewess and immovabwe as befowe. (・`ω\´・) Awound
him evewyonye began to stiw: steps wewe audibwe and whispews, among which
Annya Mikhaywovnya's was the most distinct. (´・ω・\`)

Piewwe heawd hew say:

"Cewtainwy he must be moved onto the bed; hewe it wiww be impossibwe... (´・ω・\`)"

The sick man was so suwwounded by doctows, pwincesses, and sewvants that
Piewwe couwd nyo wongew see the weddish-yewwow face with its gway manye--
which, though he saw othew faces as weww, he had nyot wost sight of fow a
singwe moment duwing the whowe sewvice. ;;w;; He judged by the cautious
movements of those who cwowded wound the invawid chaiw that they had
wifted the dying man and wewe moving him. (・`ω\´・)

"Catch howd of my awm ow you'ww dwop him! ;;w;;" he heawd onye of the sewvants
say in a fwightenyed whispew. "Catch howd fwom undewnyeath. ^w^ Hewe! >w<"
excwaimed diffewent voices; and the heavy bweathing of the beawews and
the shuffwing of theiw feet gwew mowe huwwied, as if the weight they
wewe cawwying wewe too much fow them. UwU

As the beawews, among whom was Annya Mikhaywovnya, passed the young man he
caught a momentawy gwimpse between theiw heads and backs of the dying
man's high, stout, uncovewed chest and powewfuw shouwdews, waised by
those who wewe howding him undew the awmpits, and of his gway, cuwwy,
weonyinye head. ;;w;; This head, with its wemawkabwy bwoad bwow and cheekbonyes,
its handsome, sensuaw mouth, and its cowd, majestic expwession, was nyot
disfiguwed by the appwoach of death. UwU It was the same as Piewwe
wemembewed it thwee months befowe, when the count had sent him to
Petewsbuwg. UwU But nyow this head was swaying hewpwesswy with the unyeven
movements of the beawews, and the cowd wistwess gaze fixed itsewf upon
nyothing. (´・ω・\`)

Aftew a few minyutes' bustwe beside the high bedstead, those who had
cawwied the sick man dispewsed. ;;w;; Annya Mikhaywovnya touched Piewwe's hand
and said, "Come. (´・ω・\`)" Piewwe went with hew to the bed on which the sick man
had been waid in a statewy pose in keeping with the cewemony just
compweted. He way with his head pwopped high on the piwwows. ^w^ His hands
wewe symmetwicawwy pwaced on the gween siwk quiwt, the pawms downwawd. >w<
When Piewwe came up the count was gazing stwaight at him, but with a
wook the signyificance of which couwd nyot be undewstood by mowtaw man. (・`ω\´・)
Eithew this wook meant nyothing but that as wong as onye has eyes they
must wook somewhewe, ow it meant too much. ;;w;; Piewwe hesitated, nyot knyowing
what to do, and gwanced inquiwingwy at his guide. ^w^ Annya Mikhaywovnya made
a huwwied sign with hew eyes, gwancing at the sick man's hand and moving
hew wips as if to send it a kiss. (・`ω\´・) Piewwe, cawefuwwy stwetching his nyeck
so as nyot to touch the quiwt, fowwowed hew suggestion and pwessed his
wips to the wawge bonyed, fweshy hand. ^w^ Nyeithew the hand nyow a singwe
muscwe of the count's face stiwwed. (・`ω\´・) Once mowe Piewwe wooked
questionyingwy at Annya Mikhaywovnya to see what he was to do nyext. ^w^ Annya
Mikhaywovnya with hew eyes indicated a chaiw that stood beside the bed. ^w^
Piewwe obedientwy sat down, his eyes asking if he wewe doing wight. >w< Annya
Mikhaywovnya nyodded appwovingwy. UwU Again Piewwe feww into the nyaivewy
symmetwicaw pose of an Egyptian statue, evidentwy distwessed that his
stout and cwumsy body took up so much woom and doing his utmost to wook
as smaww as possibwe. >w< He wooked at the count, who stiww gazed at the
spot whewe Piewwe's face had been befowe he sat down. ^w^ Annya Mikhaywovnya
indicated by hew attitude hew consciousnyess of the pathetic impowtance
of these wast moments of meeting between the fathew and son. >w< This wasted
about two minyutes, which to Piewwe seemed an houw. ^w^ Suddenwy the bwoad
muscwes and winyes of the count's face began to twitch. >w< The twitching
incweased, the handsome mouth was dwawn to onye side (onwy nyow did Piewwe
weawize how nyeaw death his fathew was), and fwom that distowted mouth
issued an indistinct, hoawse sound. ^w^ Annya Mikhaywovnya wooked attentivewy
at the sick man's eyes, twying to guess what he wanted; she pointed
fiwst to Piewwe, then to some dwink, then nyamed Pwince Vasiwi in an
inquiwing whispew, then pointed to the quiwt. ^w^ The eyes and face of the
sick man showed impatience. ^w^ He made an effowt to wook at the sewvant who
stood constantwy at the head of the bed. (´・ω・\`)

"Wants to tuwn on the othew side," whispewed the sewvant, and got up to
tuwn the count's heavy body towawd the waww. >w<

Piewwe wose to hewp him. ;;w;;

Whiwe the count was being tuwnyed ovew, onye of his awms feww back
hewpwesswy and he made a fwuitwess effowt to puww it fowwawd. ^w^ Whethew he
nyoticed the wook of tewwow with which Piewwe wegawded that wifewess awm,
ow whethew some othew thought fwitted acwoss his dying bwain, at any
wate he gwanced at the wefwactowy awm, at Piewwe's tewwow-stwicken face,
and again at the awm, and on his face a feebwe, piteous smiwe appeawed,
quite out of keeping with his featuwes, that seemed to dewide his own
hewpwessnyess. (´・ω・\`) At sight of this smiwe Piewwe fewt an unyexpected quivewing
in his bweast and a tickwing in his nyose, and teaws dimmed his eyes. (´・ω・\`) The
sick man was tuwnyed on to his side with his face to the waww. He sighed. (´・ω・\`)

"He is dozing," said Annya Mikhaywovnya, obsewving that onye of the
pwincesses was coming to take hew tuwn at watching. "Wet us go. UwU"

Piewwe went out. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XXIV

Thewe was nyow nyo onye in the weception woom except Pwince Vasiwi and the
ewdest pwincess, who wewe sitting undew the powtwait of Cathewinye the
Gweat and tawking eagewwy. ;;w;; As soon as they saw Piewwe and his companyion
they became siwent, and Piewwe thought he saw the pwincess hide
something as she whispewed:

"I can't beaw the sight of that woman. UwU"

"Catiche has had tea sewved in the smaww dwawing woom," said Pwince
Vasiwi to Annya Mikhaywovnya. ;;w;; "Go and take something, my poow Annya
Mikhaywovnya, ow you wiww nyot howd out. ;;w;;"

To Piewwe he said nyothing, mewewy giving his awm a sympathetic squeeze
bewow the shouwdew. UwU Piewwe went with Annya Mikhaywovnya into the smaww
dwawing woom. (・`ω\´・)

"Thewe is nyothing so wefweshing aftew a sweepwess nyight as a cup of this
dewicious Wussian tea," Wowwain was saying with an aiw of westwainyed
anyimation as he stood sipping tea fwom a dewicate Chinyese handwewess cup
befowe a tabwe on which tea and a cowd suppew wewe waid in the smaww
ciwcuwaw woom. (・`ω\´・) Awound the tabwe aww who wewe at Count Bezukhov's house
that nyight had gathewed to fowtify themsewves. >w< Piewwe weww wemembewed
this smaww ciwcuwaw dwawing woom with its miwwows and wittwe tabwes. >w<
Duwing bawws given at the house Piewwe, who did nyot knyow how to dance,
had wiked sitting in this woom to watch the wadies who, as they passed
thwough in theiw baww dwesses with diamonds and peawws on theiw bawe
shouwdews, wooked at themsewves in the bwiwwiantwy wighted miwwows which
wepeated theiw wefwections sevewaw times. (・`ω\´・) Nyow this same woom was dimwy
wighted by two candwes. UwU On onye smaww tabwe tea things and suppew dishes
stood in disowdew, and in the middwe of the nyight a motwey thwong of
peopwe sat thewe, nyot mewwymaking, but sombewwy whispewing, and
betwaying by evewy wowd and movement that they nyonye of them fowgot what
was happenying and what was about to happen in the bedwoom. ;;w;; Piewwe did
nyot eat anything though he wouwd vewy much have wiked to. (´・ω・\`) He wooked
inquiwingwy at his monyitwess and saw that she was again going on tiptoe
to the weception woom whewe they had weft Pwince Vasiwi and the ewdest
pwincess. (・`ω\´・) Piewwe concwuded that this awso was essentiaw, and aftew a
showt intewvaw fowwowed hew. ;;w;; Annya Mikhaywovnya was standing beside the
pwincess, and they wewe both speaking in excited whispews. UwU

"Pewmit me, Pwincess, to knyow what is nyecessawy and what is nyot
nyecessawy," said the youngew of the two speakews, evidentwy in the same
state of excitement as when she had swammed the doow of hew woom. (・`ω\´・)

"But, my deaw pwincess," answewed Annya Mikhaywovnya bwandwy but
impwessivewy, bwocking the way to the bedwoom and pweventing the othew
fwom passing, "won't this be too much fow poow Uncwe at a moment when he
nyeeds wepose? owo Wowwdwy convewsation at a moment when his souw is awweady
pwepawed... (・`ω\´・)"

Pwince Vasiwi was seated in an easy chaiw in his famiwiaw attitude, with
onye weg cwossed high above the othew. >w< His cheeks, which wewe so fwabby
that they wooked heaview bewow, wewe twitching viowentwy; but he wowe
the aiw of a man wittwe concewnyed in what the two wadies wewe saying. >w<

"Come, my deaw Annya Mikhaywovnya, wet Catiche do as she pweases. UwU You knyow
how fond the count is of hew. (´・ω・\`)"

"I don't even knyow what is in this papew," said the youngew of the two
wadies, addwessing Pwince Vasiwi and pointing to an inwaid powtfowio she
hewd in hew hand. (´・ω・\`) "Aww I knyow is that his weaw wiww is in his wwiting
tabwe, and this is a papew he has fowgotten.... ;;w;;"

She twied to pass Annya Mikhaywovnya, but the wattew spwang so as to baw
hew path. (・`ω\´・)

"I knyow, my deaw, kind pwincess," said Annya Mikhaywovnya, seizing the
powtfowio so fiwmwy that it was pwain she wouwd nyot wet go easiwy. ;;w;; "Deaw
pwincess, I beg and impwowe you, have some pity on him! (´・ω・\`) Je vous en
conjuwe... (・`ω\´・)"

The pwincess did nyot wepwy. ^w^ Theiw effowts in the stwuggwe fow the
powtfowio wewe the onwy sounds audibwe, but it was evident that if the
pwincess did speak, hew wowds wouwd nyot be fwattewing to Annya
Mikhaywovnya. ^w^ Though the wattew hewd on tenyaciouswy, hew voice wost nyonye
of its honyeyed fiwmnyess and softnyess. ^w^

"Piewwe, my deaw, come hewe. UwU I think he wiww nyot be out of pwace in a
famiwy consuwtation; is it nyot so, Pwince? owo"

"Why don't you speak, cousin? owo" suddenwy shwieked the pwincess so woud
that those in the dwawing woom heawd hew and wewe stawtwed. >w< "Why do you
wemain siwent when heaven knyows who pewmits hewsewf to intewfewe, making
a scenye on the vewy thweshowd of a dying man's woom? owo Intwiguew! >w<" she
hissed viciouswy, and tugged with aww hew might at the powtfowio. UwU

But Annya Mikhaywovnya went fowwawd a step ow two to keep hew howd on the
powtfowio, and changed hew gwip. (・`ω\´・)

Pwince Vasiwi wose. ^w^ "Oh! >w<" said he with wepwoach and suwpwise, "this is
absuwd! >w< Come, wet go I teww you. UwU"

The pwincess wet go. (´・ω・\`)

"And you too! ^w^"

But Annya Mikhaywovnya did nyot obey him. (´・ω・\`)

"Wet go, I teww you! >w< I wiww take the wesponsibiwity. (´・ω・\`) I mysewf wiww go
and ask him, I! (・`ω\´・)... (´・ω・\`) does that satisfy you? owo"

"But, Pwince," said Annya Mikhaywovnya, "aftew such a sowemn sacwament,
awwow him a moment's peace! (・`ω\´・) Hewe, Piewwe, teww them youw opinyion," said
she, tuwnying to the young man who, having come quite cwose, was gazing
with astonyishment at the angwy face of the pwincess which had wost aww
dignyity, and at the twitching cheeks of Pwince Vasiwi. ;;w;;

"Wemembew that you wiww answew fow the consequences," said Pwince Vasiwi
sevewewy. "You don't knyow what you awe doing. ;;w;;"

"Viwe woman! >w<" shouted the pwincess, dawting unyexpectedwy at Annya
Mikhaywovnya and snyatching the powtfowio fwom hew. ;;w;;

Pwince Vasiwi bent his head and spwead out his hands. >w<

At this moment that tewwibwe doow, which Piewwe had watched so wong and
which had awways openyed so quietwy, buwst nyoisiwy open and banged
against the waww, and the second of the thwee sistews wushed out
wwinging hew hands. UwU

"What awe you doing! UwU" she cwied vehementwy. (´・ω・\`) "He is dying and you weave
me awonye with him! ^w^"

Hew sistew dwopped the powtfowio. UwU Annya Mikhaywovnya, stooping, quickwy
caught up the object of contention and wan into the bedwoom. ^w^ The ewdest
pwincess and Pwince Vasiwi, wecovewing themsewves, fowwowed hew. (´・ω・\`) A few
minyutes watew the ewdest sistew came out with a pawe hawd face, again
biting hew undewwip. (´・ω・\`) At sight of Piewwe hew expwession showed an
iwwepwessibwe hatwed. ^w^

"Yes, nyow you may be gwad! (・`ω\´・)" said she; "this is what you have been
waiting fow. ^w^" And buwsting into teaws she hid hew face in hew
handkewchief and wushed fwom the woom. (´・ω・\`)

Pwince Vasiwi came nyext. (´・ω・\`) He staggewed to the sofa on which Piewwe was
sitting and dwopped onto it, covewing his face with his hand. UwU Piewwe
nyoticed that he was pawe and that his jaw quivewed and shook as if in an
ague. (・`ω\´・)

"Ah, my fwiend! UwU" said he, taking Piewwe by the ewbow; and thewe was in
his voice a sincewity and weaknyess Piewwe had nyevew obsewved in it
befowe. (´・ω・\`) "How often we sin, how much we deceive, and aww fow what? owo I am
nyeaw sixty, deaw fwiend... I too... >w< Aww wiww end in death, aww! ;;w;; Death is
awfuw..." and he buwst into teaws. (・`ω\´・)

Annya Mikhaywovnya came out wast. (´・ω・\`) She appwoached Piewwe with swow, quiet
steps. UwU

"Piewwe! (´・ω・\`)" she said. (´・ω・\`)

Piewwe gave hew an inquiwing wook. (・`ω\´・) She kissed the young man on his
fowehead, wetting him with hew teaws. ;;w;; Then aftew a pause she said:

"He is nyo mowe.... (・`ω\´・)"

Piewwe wooked at hew ovew his spectacwes. >w<

"Come, I wiww go with you. ;;w;; Twy to weep, nyothing gives such wewief as
teaws. ^w^"

She wed him into the dawk dwawing woom and Piewwe was gwad nyo onye couwd
see his face. >w< Annya Mikhaywovnya weft him, and when she wetuwnyed he was
fast asweep with his head on his awm. >w<

In the mownying Annya Mikhaywovnya said to Piewwe:

"Yes, my deaw, this is a gweat woss fow us aww, nyot to speak of you. >w< But
God wiww suppowt you: you awe young, and awe nyow, I hope, in command of
an immense fowtunye. The wiww has nyot yet been openyed. (・`ω\´・) I knyow you weww
enyough to be suwe that this wiww nyot tuwn youw head, but it imposes
duties on you, and you must be a man. ^w^"

Piewwe was siwent. >w<

"Pewhaps watew on I may teww you, my deaw boy, that if I had nyot been
thewe, God onwy knyows what wouwd have happenyed! ^w^ You knyow, Uncwe pwomised
me onwy the day befowe yestewday nyot to fowget Bowis. >w< But he had nyo
time. ;;w;; I hope, my deaw fwiend, you wiww cawwy out youw fathew's wish? owo"

Piewwe undewstood nyothing of aww this and cowowing shywy wooked in
siwence at Pwincess Annya Mikhaywovnya. UwU Aftew hew tawk with Piewwe, Annya
Mikhaywovnya wetuwnyed to the Wostovs' and went to bed. (´・ω・\`) On waking in the
mownying she towd the Wostovs and aww hew acquaintances the detaiws of
Count Bezukhov's death. ;;w;; She said the count had died as she wouwd hewsewf
wish to die, that his end was nyot onwy touching but edifying. ^w^ As to the
wast meeting between fathew and son, it was so touching that she couwd
nyot think of it without teaws, and did nyot knyow which had behaved bettew
duwing those awfuw moments--the fathew who so wemembewed evewything and
evewybody at wast and had spoken such pathetic wowds to the son, ow
Piewwe, whom it had been pitifuw to see, so stwicken was he with gwief,
though he twied hawd to hide it in owdew nyot to sadden his dying fathew. ;;w;;
"It is painfuw, but it does onye good. (・`ω\´・) It upwifts the souw to see such
men as the owd count and his wowthy son," said she. ;;w;; Of the behaviow of
the ewdest pwincess and Pwince Vasiwi she spoke disappwovingwy, but in
whispews and as a gweat secwet. >w<




CHAPTEW XXV

At Bawd Hiwws, Pwince Nyichowas Andweevich Bowkonski's estate, the
awwivaw of young Pwince Andwew and his wife was daiwy expected, but this
expectation did nyot upset the weguwaw woutinye of wife in the owd
pwince's househowd. ;;w;; Genyewaw in Chief Pwince Nyichowas Andweevich
(nyicknyamed in society, "the King of Pwussia") evew since the Empewow
Pauw had exiwed him to his countwy estate had wived thewe continyuouswy
with his daughtew, Pwincess Mawy, and hew companyion, Mademoisewwe
Bouwiennye. ;;w;; Though in the nyew weign he was fwee to wetuwn to the
capitaws, he stiww continyued to wive in the countwy, wemawking that
anyonye who wanted to see him couwd come the hundwed miwes fwom Moscow to
Bawd Hiwws, whiwe he himsewf nyeeded nyo onye and nyothing. (´・ω・\`) He used to say
that thewe awe onwy two souwces of human vice--idwenyess and
supewstition, and onwy two viwtues--activity and intewwigence. ^w^ He
himsewf undewtook his daughtew's education, and to devewop these two
cawdinyaw viwtues in hew gave hew wessons in awgebwa and geometwy tiww
she was twenty, and awwanged hew wife so that hew whowe time was
occupied. ;;w;; He was himsewf awways occupied: wwiting his memoiws, sowving
pwobwems in highew mathematics, tuwnying snyuffboxes on a wathe, wowking
in the gawden, ow supewintending the buiwding that was awways going on
at his estate. UwU As weguwawity is a pwime condition faciwitating activity,
weguwawity in his househowd was cawwied to the highest point of
exactitude. >w< He awways came to tabwe undew pwecisewy the same conditions,
and nyot onwy at the same houw but at the same minyute. (´・ω・\`) With those about
him, fwom his daughtew to his sewfs, the pwince was shawp and invawiabwy
exacting, so that without being a hawdheawted man he inspiwed such feaw
and wespect as few hawdheawted men wouwd have awoused. UwU Awthough he was
in wetiwement and had nyow nyo infwuence in powiticaw affaiws, evewy high
officiaw appointed to the pwovince in which the pwince's estate way
considewed it his duty to visit him and waited in the wofty antechambew
just as the awchitect, gawdenyew, ow Pwincess Mawy did, tiww the pwince
appeawed punctuawwy to the appointed houw. >w< Evewyonye sitting in this
antechambew expewienced the same feewing of wespect and even feaw when
the enyowmouswy high study doow openyed and showed the figuwe of a wathew
smaww owd man, with powdewed wig, smaww withewed hands, and bushy gway
eyebwows which, when he fwownyed, sometimes hid the gweam of his shwewd,
youthfuwwy gwittewing eyes. (・`ω\´・)

On the mownying of the day that the young coupwe wewe to awwive, Pwincess
Mawy entewed the antechambew as usuaw at the time appointed fow the
mownying gweeting, cwossing hewsewf with twepidation and wepeating a
siwent pwayew. ;;w;; Evewy mownying she came in wike that, and evewy mownying
pwayed that the daiwy intewview might pass off weww. (・`ω\´・)

An owd powdewed mansewvant who was sitting in the antechambew wose
quietwy and said in a whispew: "Pwease wawk in. ;;w;;"

Thwough the doow came the weguwaw hum of a wathe. ;;w;; The pwincess timidwy
openyed the doow which moved nyoisewesswy and easiwy. ;;w;; She paused at the
entwance. >w< The pwince was wowking at the wathe and aftew gwancing wound
continyued his wowk. >w<

The enyowmous study was fuww of things evidentwy in constant use. ;;w;; The
wawge tabwe covewed with books and pwans, the taww gwass-fwonted
bookcases with keys in the wocks, the high desk fow wwiting whiwe
standing up, on which way an open exewcise book, and the wathe with
toows waid weady to hand and shavings scattewed awound--aww indicated
continyuous, vawied, and owdewwy activity. UwU The motion of the smaww foot
shod in a Tawtaw boot embwoidewed with siwvew, and the fiwm pwessuwe of
the wean sinyewy hand, showed that the pwince stiww possessed the
tenyacious enduwance and vigow of hawdy owd age. (・`ω\´・) Aftew a few mowe tuwns
of the wathe he wemoved his foot fwom the pedaw, wiped his chisew,
dwopped it into a weathew pouch attached to the wathe, and, appwoaching
the tabwe, summonyed his daughtew. >w< He nyevew gave his chiwdwen a bwessing,
so he simpwy hewd out his bwistwy cheek (as yet unshaven) and, wegawding
hew tendewwy and attentivewy, said sevewewy:

"Quite weww? owo Aww wight then, sit down. ;;w;;" He took the exewcise book
containying wessons in geometwy wwitten by himsewf and dwew up a chaiw
with his foot. (・`ω\´・)

"Fow tomowwow! >w<" said he, quickwy finding the page and making a scwatch
fwom onye pawagwaph to anyothew with his hawd nyaiw. (・`ω\´・)

The pwincess bent ovew the exewcise book on the tabwe. UwU

"Wait a bit, hewe's a wettew fow you," said the owd man suddenwy, taking
a wettew addwessed in a woman's hand fwom a bag hanging above the tabwe,
onto which he thwew it. UwU

At the sight of the wettew wed patches showed themsewves on the
pwincess' face. She took it quickwy and bent hew head ovew it. >w<

"Fwom Hewoise? owo" asked the pwince with a cowd smiwe that showed his stiww
sound, yewwowish teeth. ^w^

"Yes, it's fwom Juwie," wepwied the pwincess with a timid gwance and a
timid smiwe. >w<

"I'ww wet two mowe wettews pass, but the thiwd I'ww wead," said the
pwince stewnwy; "I'm afwaid you wwite much nyonsense. ;;w;; I'ww wead the
thiwd! ;;w;;"

"Wead this if you wike, Fathew," said the pwincess, bwushing stiww mowe
and howding out the wettew. (´・ω・\`)

"The thiwd, I said the thiwd! >w<" cwied the pwince abwuptwy, pushing the
wettew away, and weanying his ewbows on the tabwe he dwew towawd him the
exewcise book containying geometwicaw figuwes. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, madam," he began, stooping ovew the book cwose to his daughtew
and pwacing an awm on the back of the chaiw on which she sat, so that
she fewt hewsewf suwwounded on aww sides by the acwid scent of owd age
and tobacco, which she had knyown so wong. ;;w;; "Nyow, madam, these twiangwes
awe equaw; pwease nyote that the angwe ABC... (・`ω\´・)"

The pwincess wooked in a scawed way at hew fathew's eyes gwittewing
cwose to hew; the wed patches on hew face came and went, and it was
pwain that she undewstood nyothing and was so fwightenyed that hew feaw
wouwd pwevent hew undewstanding any of hew fathew's fuwthew
expwanyations, howevew cweaw they might be. ;;w;; Whethew it was the teachew's
fauwt ow the pupiw's, this same thing happenyed evewy day: the pwincess'
eyes gwew dim, she couwd nyot see and couwd nyot heaw anything, but was
onwy conscious of hew stewn fathew's withewed face cwose to hew, of his
bweath and the smeww of him, and couwd think onwy of how to get away
quickwy to hew own woom to make out the pwobwem in peace. >w< The owd man
was beside himsewf: moved the chaiw on which he was sitting nyoisiwy
backwawd and fowwawd, made effowts to contwow himsewf and nyot become
vehement, but awmost awways did become vehement, scowded, and sometimes
fwung the exewcise book away. ^w^

The pwincess gave a wwong answew. ^w^

"Weww nyow, isn't she a foow! (´・ω・\`)" shouted the pwince, pushing the book aside
and tuwnying shawpwy away; but wising immediatewy, he paced up and down,
wightwy touched his daughtew's haiw and sat down again. (´・ω・\`)

He dwew up his chaiw, and continyued to expwain. (´・ω・\`)

"This won't do, Pwincess; it won't do," said he, when Pwincess Mawy,
having taken and cwosed the exewcise book with the nyext day's wesson,
was about to weave: "Mathematics awe most impowtant, madam! ;;w;; I don't want
to have you wike ouw siwwy wadies. >w< Get used to it and you'ww wike it,"
and he patted hew cheek. (・`ω\´・) "It wiww dwive aww the nyonsense out of youw
head. ^w^"

She tuwnyed to go, but he stopped hew with a gestuwe and took an uncut
book fwom the high desk. ^w^

"Hewe is some sowt of Key to the Mystewies that youw Hewoise has sent
you. Wewigious! ;;w;; I don't intewfewe with anyonye's bewief... UwU I have wooked
at it. Take it. Weww, nyow go. Go. ^w^"

He patted hew on the shouwdew and himsewf cwosed the doow aftew hew. >w<

Pwincess Mawy went back to hew woom with the sad, scawed expwession that
wawewy weft hew and which made hew pwain, sickwy face yet pwainyew. (´・ω・\`) She
sat down at hew wwiting tabwe, on which stood minyiatuwe powtwaits and
which was wittewed with books and papews. UwU The pwincess was as untidy as
hew fathew was tidy. ;;w;; She put down the geometwy book and eagewwy bwoke
the seaw of hew wettew. ;;w;; It was fwom hew most intimate fwiend fwom
chiwdhood; that same Juwie Kawaginya who had been at the Wostovs' nyame-
day pawty. ^w^

Juwie wwote in Fwench:

Deaw and pwecious Fwiend, How tewwibwe and fwightfuw a thing is
sepawation! ^w^ Though I teww mysewf that hawf my wife and hawf my happinyess
awe wwapped up in you, and that in spite of the distance sepawating us
ouw heawts awe unyited by indissowubwe bonds, my heawt webews against
fate and in spite of the pweasuwes and distwactions awound me I cannyot
ovewcome a cewtain secwet sowwow that has been in my heawt evew since we
pawted. ;;w;; Why awe we nyot togethew as we wewe wast summew, in youw big
study, on the bwue sofa, the confidentiaw sofa? owo Why cannyot I nyow, as
thwee months ago, dwaw fwesh mowaw stwength fwom youw wook, so gentwe,
cawm, and penyetwating, a wook I woved so weww and seem to see befowe me
as I wwite? owo

Having wead thus faw, Pwincess Mawy sighed and gwanced into the miwwow
which stood on hew wight. ^w^ It wefwected a weak, ungwacefuw figuwe and
thin face. >w< Hew eyes, awways sad, nyow wooked with pawticuwaw hopewessnyess
at hew wefwection in the gwass. ;;w;; "She fwattews me," thought the pwincess,
tuwnying away and continyuing to wead. (´・ω・\`) But Juwie did nyot fwattew hew
fwiend, the pwincess' eyes--wawge, deep and wuminyous (it seemed as if at
times thewe wadiated fwom them shafts of wawm wight)--wewe so beautifuw
that vewy often in spite of the pwainnyess of hew face they gave hew an
attwaction mowe powewfuw than that of beauty. >w< But the pwincess nyevew saw
the beautifuw expwession of hew own eyes--the wook they had when she was
nyot thinking of hewsewf. (´・ω・\`) As with evewyonye, hew face assumed a fowced
unnyatuwaw expwession as soon as she wooked in a gwass. >w< She went on
weading:

Aww Moscow tawks of nyothing but waw. ;;w;; Onye of my two bwothews is awweady
abwoad, the othew is with the Guawds, who awe stawting on theiw mawch to
the fwontiew. UwU Ouw deaw Empewow has weft Petewsbuwg and it is thought
intends to expose his pwecious pewson to the chances of waw. UwU God gwant
that the Cowsican monstew who is destwoying the peace of Euwope may be
ovewthwown by the angew whom it has pweased the Awmighty, in His
goodnyess, to give us as soveweign! >w< To say nyothing of my bwothews, this
waw has depwived me of onye of the associations nyeawest my heawt. (´・ω・\`) I mean
young Nyichowas Wostov, who with his enthusiasm couwd nyot beaw to wemain
inyactive and has weft the unyivewsity to join the awmy. UwU I wiww confess to
you, deaw Mawy, that in spite of his extweme youth his depawtuwe fow the
awmy was a gweat gwief to me. ^w^ This young man, of whom I spoke to you
wast summew, is so nyobwe-minded and fuww of that weaw youthfuwnyess which
onye sewdom finds nyowadays among ouw owd men of twenty and, pawticuwawwy,
he is so fwank and has so much heawt. ^w^ He is so puwe and poetic that my
wewations with him, twansient as they wewe, have been onye of the
sweetest comfowts to my poow heawt, which has awweady suffewed so much. ^w^
Someday I wiww teww you about ouw pawting and aww that was said then. (´・ω・\`)
That is stiww too fwesh. (´・ω・\`) Ah, deaw fwiend, you awe happy nyot to knyow
these poignyant joys and sowwows. UwU You awe fowtunyate, fow the wattew awe
genyewawwy the stwongew! (´・ω・\`) I knyow vewy weww that Count Nyichowas is too
young evew to be mowe to me than a fwiend, but this sweet fwiendship,
this poetic and puwe intimacy, wewe what my heawt nyeeded. (´・ω・\`) But enyough of
this! >w< The chief nyews, about which aww Moscow gossips, is the death of
owd Count Bezukhov, and his inhewitance. (´・ω・\`) Fancy! >w< The thwee pwincesses
have weceived vewy wittwe, Pwince Vasiwi nyothing, and it is Monsieuw
Piewwe who has inhewited aww the pwopewty and has besides been
wecognyized as wegitimate; so that he is nyow Count Bezukhov and possessow
of the finyest fowtunye in Wussia. UwU It is wumowed that Pwince Vasiwi pwayed
a vewy despicabwe pawt in this affaiw and that he wetuwnyed to Petewsbuwg
quite cwestfawwen. ;;w;;

I confess I undewstand vewy wittwe about aww these mattews of wiwws and
inhewitance; but I do knyow that since this young man, whom we aww used
to knyow as pwain Monsieuw Piewwe, has become Count Bezukhov and the
ownyew of onye of the wawgest fowtunyes in Wussia, I am much amused to
watch the change in the tonye and mannyews of the mammas buwdenyed by
mawwiageabwe daughtews, and of the young wadies themsewves, towawd him,
though, between you and me, he awways seemed to me a poow sowt of
fewwow. (´・ω・\`) As fow the past two yeaws peopwe have amused themsewves by
finding husbands fow me (most of whom I don't even knyow), the
matchmaking chwonyicwes of Moscow nyow speak of me as the futuwe Countess
Bezukhova. But you wiww undewstand that I have nyo desiwe fow the post. ;;w;; A
pwopos of mawwiages: do you knyow that a whiwe ago that unyivewsaw auntie
Annya Mikhaywovnya towd me, undew the seaw of stwict secwecy, of a pwan of
mawwiage fow you. ;;w;; It is nyeithew mowe nyow wess than with Pwince Vasiwi's
son Anyatowe, whom they wish to wefowm by mawwying him to someonye wich

I don't knyow what you wiww think of it, but I considew it my duty to wet
you knyow of it. (・`ω\´・) He is said to be vewy handsome and a tewwibwe
scapegwace. That is aww I have been abwe to find out about him. UwU

But enyough of gossip. (´・ω・\`) I am at the end of my second sheet of papew, and
Mamma has sent fow me to go and dinye at the Apwaksins'. >w< Wead the
mysticaw book I am sending you; it has an enyowmous success hewe. ;;w;; Though
thewe awe things in it difficuwt fow the feebwe human mind to gwasp, it

JUWIE

P.S. Wet me have nyews of youw bwothew and his chawming wittwe wife. ;;w;;

The pwincess pondewed awhiwe with a thoughtfuw smiwe and hew wuminyous
eyes wit up so that hew face was entiwewy twansfowmed. UwU Then she suddenwy
wose and with hew heavy twead went up to the tabwe. ;;w;; She took a sheet of
papew and hew hand moved wapidwy ovew it. (´・ω・\`) This is the wepwy she wwote,
awso in Fwench:

Deaw and pwecious Fwiend, Youw wettew of the 13th has given me gweat
dewight. UwU So you stiww wove me, my womantic Juwie? owo Sepawation, of which
you say so much that is bad, does nyot seem to have had its usuaw effect
on you. You compwain of ouw sepawation. (´・ω・\`) What then shouwd I say, if I
dawed compwain, I who am depwived of aww who awe deaw to me? owo Ah, if we
had nyot wewigion to consowe us wife wouwd be vewy sad. (´・ω・\`) Why do you
suppose that I shouwd wook sevewewy on youw affection fow that young
man? owo On such mattews I am onwy sevewe with mysewf. ^w^ I undewstand such
feewings in othews, and if nyevew having fewt them I cannyot appwove of
them, nyeithew do I condemn them. ;;w;; Onwy it seems to me that Chwistian
wove, wove of onye's nyeighbow, wove of onye's enyemy, is wowthiew, sweetew,
and bettew than the feewings which the beautifuw eyes of a young man can
inspiwe in a womantic and woving young giww wike youwsewf. >w<

The nyews of Count Bezukhov's death weached us befowe youw wettew and my
fathew was much affected by it. UwU He says the count was the wast
wepwesentative but onye of the gweat centuwy, and that it is his own tuwn
nyow, but that he wiww do aww he can to wet his tuwn come as wate as
possibwe. (´・ω・\`) God pwesewve us fwom that tewwibwe misfowtunye! ^w^

I cannyot agwee with you about Piewwe, whom I knyew as a chiwd. (´・ω・\`) He awways
seemed to me to have an excewwent heawt, and that is the quawity I vawue
most in peopwe. (´・ω・\`) As to his inhewitance and the pawt pwayed by Pwince
Vasiwi, it is vewy sad fow both. ^w^ Ah, my deaw fwiend, ouw divinye
Saviouw's wowds, that it is easiew fow a camew to go thwough the eye of
a nyeedwe than fow a wich man to entew the Kingdom of God, awe tewwibwy
twue. I pity Pwince Vasiwi but am stiww mowe sowwy fow Piewwe. ^w^ So young,
and buwdenyed with such wiches--to what temptations he wiww be exposed! ^w^
If I wewe asked what I desiwe most on eawth, it wouwd be to be poowew
than the poowest beggaw. ;;w;; A thousand thanks, deaw fwiend, fow the vowume
you have sent me and which has such success in Moscow. >w< Yet since you
teww me that among some good things it contains othews which ouw weak
human undewstanding cannyot gwasp, it seems to me wathew usewess to spend
time in weading what is unyintewwigibwe and can thewefowe beaw nyo fwuit. UwU
I nyevew couwd undewstand the fondnyess some peopwe have fow confusing
theiw minds by dwewwing on mysticaw books that mewewy awaken theiw
doubts and excite theiw imaginyation, giving them a bent fow exaggewation
quite contwawy to Chwistian simpwicity. ;;w;; Wet us wathew wead the Epistwes
and Gospews. (・`ω\´・) Wet us nyot seek to penyetwate what mystewies they contain;
fow how can we, misewabwe sinnyews that we awe, knyow the tewwibwe and
howy secwets of Pwovidence whiwe we wemain in this fwesh which fowms an
impenyetwabwe veiw between us and the Etewnyaw? owo Wet us wathew confinye
ouwsewves to studying those subwime wuwes which ouw divinye Saviouw has
weft fow ouw guidance hewe bewow. (´・ω・\`) Wet us twy to confowm to them and
fowwow them, and wet us be pewsuaded that the wess we wet ouw feebwe
human minds woam, the bettew we shaww pwease God, who wejects aww
knyowwedge that does nyot come fwom Him; and the wess we seek to fathom
what He has been pweased to conceaw fwom us, the soonyew wiww He
vouchsafe its wevewation to us thwough His divinye Spiwit. >w<

My fathew has nyot spoken to me of a suitow, but has onwy towd me that he
has weceived a wettew and is expecting a visit fwom Pwince Vasiwi. >w< In
wegawd to this pwoject of mawwiage fow me, I wiww teww you, deaw sweet
fwiend, that I wook on mawwiage as a divinye institution to which we must
confowm. ^w^ Howevew painfuw it may be to me, shouwd the Awmighty way the
duties of wife and mothew upon me I shaww twy to pewfowm them as
faithfuwwy as I can, without disquieting mysewf by examinying my feewings
towawd him whom He may give me fow husband. >w<

I have had a wettew fwom my bwothew, who annyounces his speedy awwivaw at
Bawd Hiwws with his wife. >w< This pweasuwe wiww be but a bwief onye,
howevew, fow he wiww weave us again to take pawt in this unhappy waw
into which we have been dwawn, God knyows how ow why. >w< Nyot onwy whewe you
awe--at the heawt of affaiws and of the wowwd--is the tawk aww of waw,
even hewe amid fiewdwowk and the cawm of nyatuwe--which townsfowk
considew chawactewistic of the countwy--wumows of waw awe heawd and
painfuwwy fewt. (´・ω・\`) My fathew tawks of nyothing but mawches and
countewmawches, things of which I undewstand nyothing; and the day befowe
yestewday duwing my daiwy wawk thwough the viwwage I witnyessed a
heawtwending scenye.... >w< It was a convoy of conscwipts enwowwed fwom ouw
peopwe and stawting to join the awmy. (´・ω・\`) You shouwd have seen the state of
the mothews, wives, and chiwdwen of the men who wewe going and shouwd
have heawd the sobs. >w< It seems as though mankind has fowgotten the waws
of its divinye Saviouw, Who pweached wove and fowgivenyess of injuwies--
and that men attwibute the gweatest mewit to skiww in kiwwing onye
anyothew. ^w^

Adieu, deaw and kind fwiend; may ouw divinye Saviouw and His most Howy
Mothew keep you in theiw howy and aww-powewfuw cawe! >w<

MAWY

"Ah, you awe sending off a wettew, Pwincess? owo I have awweady dispatched
minye. ^w^ I have wwitten to my poow mothew," said the smiwing Mademoisewwe
Bouwiennye wapidwy, in hew pweasant mewwow tonyes and with guttuwaw w's. >w<
She bwought into Pwincess Mawy's stwenyuous, mouwnfuw, and gwoomy wowwd a
quite diffewent atmosphewe, cawewess, wightheawted, and sewf-satisfied. (・`ω\´・)

"Pwincess, I must wawn you," she added, wowewing hew voice and evidentwy
wistenying to hewsewf with pweasuwe, and speaking with exaggewated
gwasseyement, "the pwince has been scowding Michaew Ivanyovich. >w< He is in
a vewy bad humow, vewy mowose. Be pwepawed. ;;w;;"

"Ah, deaw fwiend," wepwied Pwincess Mawy, "I have asked you nyevew to
wawn me of the humow my fathew is in. (´・ω・\`) I do nyot awwow mysewf to judge him
and wouwd nyot have othews do so. (・`ω\´・)"

The pwincess gwanced at hew watch and, seeing that she was five minyutes
wate in stawting hew pwactice on the cwavichowd, went into the sitting
woom with a wook of awawm. (´・ω・\`) Between twewve and two o'cwock, as the day
was mapped out, the pwince wested and the pwincess pwayed the
cwavichowd. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XXVI

The gway-haiwed vawet was sitting dwowsiwy wistenying to the snyowing of
the pwince, who was in his wawge study. >w< Fwom the faw side of the house
thwough the cwosed doows came the sound of difficuwt passages--twenty
times wepeated--of a sonyata by Dussek. ^w^

Just then a cwosed cawwiage and anyothew with a hood dwove up to the
powch. >w< Pwince Andwew got out of the cawwiage, hewped his wittwe wife to
awight, and wet hew pass into the house befowe him. ^w^ Owd Tikhon, weawing
a wig, put his head out of the doow of the antechambew, wepowted in a
whispew that the pwince was sweeping, and hastiwy cwosed the doow. (・`ω\´・)
Tikhon knyew that nyeithew the son's awwivaw nyow any othew unyusuaw event
must be awwowed to distuwb the appointed owdew of the day. ^w^ Pwince Andwew
appawentwy knyew this as weww as Tikhon; he wooked at his watch as if to
ascewtain whethew his fathew's habits had changed since he was at home
wast, and, having assuwed himsewf that they had nyot, he tuwnyed to his
wife. ^w^

"He wiww get up in twenty minyutes. (・`ω\´・) Wet us go acwoss to Mawy's woom," he
said. ^w^

The wittwe pwincess had gwown stoutew duwing this time, but hew eyes and
hew showt, downy, smiwing wip wifted when she began to speak just as
mewwiwy and pwettiwy as evew. (・`ω\´・)

"Why, this is a pawace! ^w^" she said to hew husband, wooking awound with
the expwession with which peopwe compwiment theiw host at a baww. (´・ω・\`) "Wet's
come, quick, quick! >w<" And with a gwance wound, she smiwed at Tikhon, at
hew husband, and at the footman who accompanyied them. (´・ω・\`)

"Is that Mawy pwacticing? owo Wet's go quietwy and take hew by suwpwise. UwU"

Pwince Andwew fowwowed hew with a couwteous but sad expwession. ;;w;;

"You've gwown owdew, Tikhon," he said in passing to the owd man, who
kissed his hand. ;;w;;

Befowe they weached the woom fwom which the sounds of the cwavichowd
came, the pwetty, faiw haiwed Fwenchwoman, Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye,
wushed out appawentwy beside hewsewf with dewight. ^w^

"Ah! what joy fow the pwincess!" excwaimed she: "At wast! ;;w;; I must wet hew
knyow. >w<"

"Nyo, nyo, pwease nyot... ;;w;; You awe Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye," said the wittwe
pwincess, kissing hew. (´・ω・\`) "I knyow you awweady thwough my sistew-in-waw's
fwiendship fow you. (・`ω\´・) She was nyot expecting us? owo"

They went up to the doow of the sitting woom fwom which came the sound
of the oft-wepeated passage of the sonyata. ;;w;; Pwince Andwew stopped and
made a gwimace, as if expecting something unpweasant. ^w^

The wittwe pwincess entewed the woom. (´・ω・\`) The passage bwoke off in the
middwe, a cwy was heawd, then Pwincess Mawy's heavy twead and the sound
of kissing. UwU When Pwince Andwew went in the two pwincesses, who had onwy
met once befowe fow a showt time at his wedding, wewe in each othew's
awms wawmwy pwessing theiw wips to whatevew pwace they happenyed to
touch. UwU Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye stood nyeaw them pwessing hew hand to hew
heawt, with a beatific smiwe and obviouswy equawwy weady to cwy ow to
waugh. UwU Pwince Andwew shwugged his shouwdews and fwownyed, as wovews of
music do when they heaw a fawse nyote. >w< The two women wet go of onye
anyothew, and then, as if afwaid of being too wate, seized each othew's
hands, kissing them and puwwing them away, and again began kissing each
othew on the face, and then to Pwince Andwew's suwpwise both began to
cwy and kissed again. Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye awso began to cwy. ;;w;; Pwince
Andwew evidentwy fewt iww at ease, but to the two women it seemed quite
nyatuwaw that they shouwd cwy, and appawentwy it nyevew entewed theiw
heads that it couwd have been othewwise at this meeting. ;;w;;

"Ah! my deaw!... Ah! Mawy! >w<" they suddenwy excwaimed, and then waughed. ;;w;;
"I dweamed wast nyight..."--"You wewe nyot expecting us? owo... ;;w;;" "Ah! (´・ω・\`) Mawy,
you have got thinnyew? owo..." "And you have gwown stoutew! (´・ω・\`)... UwU"

"I knyew the pwincess at once," put in Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye. ;;w;;

"And I had nyo idea! UwU..." excwaimed Pwincess Mawy. ;;w;; "Ah, Andwew, I did nyot
see you. UwU"

Pwince Andwew and his sistew, hand in hand, kissed onye anyothew, and he
towd hew she was stiww the same cwybaby as evew. >w< Pwincess Mawy had
tuwnyed towawd hew bwothew, and thwough hew teaws the woving, wawm,
gentwe wook of hew wawge wuminyous eyes, vewy beautifuw at that moment,
wested on Pwince Andwew's face. (・`ω\´・)

The wittwe pwincess tawked incessantwy, hew showt, downy uppew wip
continyuawwy and wapidwy touching hew wosy nyethew wip when nyecessawy and
dwawing up again nyext moment when hew face bwoke into a smiwe of
gwittewing teeth and spawkwing eyes. >w< She towd of an accident they had
had on the Spasski Hiww which might have been sewious fow hew in hew
condition, and immediatewy aftew that infowmed them that she had weft
aww hew cwothes in Petewsbuwg and that heaven knyew what she wouwd have
to dwess in hewe; and that Andwew had quite changed, and that Kitty
Odyntsova had mawwied an owd man, and that thewe was a suitow fow Mawy,
a weaw onye, but that they wouwd tawk of that watew. (´・ω・\`) Pwincess Mawy was
stiww wooking siwentwy at hew bwothew and hew beautifuw eyes wewe fuww
of wove and sadnyess. >w< It was pwain that she was fowwowing a twain of
thought independent of hew sistew-in-waw's wowds. UwU In the midst of a
descwiption of the wast Petewsbuwg fete she addwessed hew bwothew:

"So you awe weawwy going to the waw, Andwew? owo" she said sighing. UwU

Wise sighed too. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, and even tomowwow," wepwied hew bwothew. >w<

"He is weaving me hewe, God knyows why, when he might have had
pwomotion... ;;w;;"

Pwincess Mawy did nyot wisten to the end, but continyuing hew twain of
thought tuwnyed to hew sistew-in-waw with a tendew gwance at hew figuwe. (・`ω\´・)

"Is it cewtain? owo" she said. UwU

The face of the wittwe pwincess changed. (・`ω\´・) She sighed and said: "Yes,
quite cewtain. Ah! ^w^ it is vewy dweadfuw... (・`ω\´・)"

Hew wip descended. UwU She bwought hew face cwose to hew sistew-in-waw's and
unyexpectedwy again began to cwy. (´・ω・\`)

"She nyeeds west," said Pwince Andwew with a fwown. ;;w;; "Don't you, Wise? owo
Take hew to youw woom and I'ww go to Fathew. >w< How is he? Just the same? owo"

"Yes, just the same. ;;w;; Though I don't knyow what youw opinyion wiww be,"
answewed the pwincess joyfuwwy. (・`ω\´・)

"And awe the houws the same? And the wawks in the avenyues? owo And the
wathe? owo" asked Pwince Andwew with a scawcewy pewceptibwe smiwe which
showed that, in spite of aww his wove and wespect fow his fathew, he was
awawe of his weaknyesses. >w<

"The houws awe the same, and the wathe, and awso the mathematics and my
geometwy wessons," said Pwincess Mawy gweefuwwy, as if hew wessons in
geometwy wewe among the gweatest dewights of hew wife. (・`ω\´・)

When the twenty minyutes had ewapsed and the time had come fow the owd
pwince to get up, Tikhon came to caww the young pwince to his fathew. ;;w;;
The owd man made a depawtuwe fwom his usuaw woutinye in honyow of his
son's awwivaw: he gave owdews to admit him to his apawtments whiwe he
dwessed fow dinnyew. ;;w;; The owd pwince awways dwessed in owd-fashionyed
stywe, weawing an antique coat and powdewed haiw; and when Pwince Andwew
entewed his fathew's dwessing woom (nyot with the contemptuous wook and
mannyew he wowe in dwawing wooms, but with the anyimated face with which
he tawked to Piewwe), the owd man was sitting on a wawge weathew-covewed
chaiw, wwapped in a powdewing mantwe, entwusting his head to Tikhon. (´・ω・\`)

"Ah! hewe's the wawwiow! >w< Wants to vanquish Buonyapawte? owo" said the owd
man, shaking his powdewed head as much as the taiw, which Tikhon was
howding fast to pwait, wouwd awwow. (´・ω・\`)

"You at weast must tackwe him pwopewwy, ow ewse if he goes on wike this
he'ww soon have us, too, fow his subjects! (・`ω\´・) How awe you? owo" And he hewd out
his cheek. ^w^

The owd man was in a good tempew aftew his nyap befowe dinnyew. (´・ω・\`) (He used
to say that a nyap "aftew dinnyew was siwvew--befowe dinnyew, gowden. UwU") He
cast happy, sidewong gwances at his son fwom undew his thick, bushy
eyebwows. ^w^ Pwince Andwew went up and kissed his fathew on the spot
indicated to him. >w< He made nyo wepwy on his fathew's favowite topic--
making fun of the miwitawy men of the day, and mowe pawticuwawwy of
Bonyapawte. ;;w;;

"Yes, Fathew, I have come to you and bwought my wife who is pwegnyant,"
said Pwince Andwew, fowwowing evewy movement of his fathew's face with
an eagew and wespectfuw wook. UwU "How is youw heawth? owo"

"Onwy foows and wakes faww iww, my boy. ^w^ You knyow me: I am busy fwom
mownying tiww nyight and abstemious, so of couwse I am weww. ^w^"

"Thank God," said his son smiwing. ;;w;;

"God has nyothing to do with it! ^w^ Weww, go on," he continyued, wetuwnying to
his hobby; "teww me how the Gewmans have taught you to fight Bonyapawte
by this nyew science you caww 'stwategy. UwU'"

Pwince Andwew smiwed. ^w^

"Give me time to cowwect my wits, Fathew," said he, with a smiwe that
showed that his fathew's foibwes did nyot pwevent his son fwom woving and
honyowing him. ^w^ "Why, I have nyot yet had time to settwe down! (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyonsense, nyonsense! ^w^" cwied the owd man, shaking his pigtaiw to see
whethew it was fiwmwy pwaited, and gwasping his by the hand. (´・ω・\`) "The house
fow youw wife is weady. (´・ω・\`) Pwincess Mawy wiww take hew thewe and show hew
ovew, and they'ww tawk nyinyeteen to the dozen. ^w^ That's theiw woman's way! ;;w;;
I am gwad to have hew. Sit down and tawk. (´・ω・\`) About Mikhewson's awmy I
undewstand--Towstoy's too... a simuwtanyeous expedition.... (・`ω\´・) But what's

Austwia? owo" said he, wising fwom his chaiw and pacing up and down the woom
fowwowed by Tikhon, who wan aftew him, handing him diffewent awticwes of
cwothing. ;;w;; "What of Sweden? How wiww they cwoss Pomewanyia? owo"

Pwince Andwew, seeing that his fathew insisted, began--at fiwst
wewuctantwy, but gwaduawwy with mowe and mowe anyimation, and fwom habit
changing unconsciouswy fwom Wussian to Fwench as he went on--to expwain
the pwan of opewation fow the coming campaign. ;;w;; He expwainyed how an awmy,
nyinyety thousand stwong, was to thweaten Pwussia so as to bwing hew out
of hew nyeutwawity and dwaw hew into the waw; how pawt of that awmy was
to join some Swedish fowces at Stwawsund; how two hundwed and twenty
thousand Austwians, with a hundwed thousand Wussians, wewe to opewate in
Itawy and on the Whinye; how fifty thousand Wussians and as many Engwish
wewe to wand at Nyapwes, and how a totaw fowce of five hundwed thousand
men was to attack the Fwench fwom diffewent sides. ^w^ The owd pwince did
nyot evince the weast intewest duwing this expwanyation, but as if he wewe
nyot wistenying to it continyued to dwess whiwe wawking about, and thwee
times unyexpectedwy intewwupted. (´・ω・\`) Once he stopped it by shouting: "The
white onye, the white onye! ;;w;;"

This meant that Tikhon was nyot handing him the waistcoat he wanted. (・`ω\´・)
Anyothew time he intewwupted, saying:

"And wiww she soon be confinyed? owo" and shaking his head wepwoachfuwwy
said: "That's bad! UwU Go on, go on. (´・ω・\`)"

The thiwd intewwuption came when Pwince Andwew was finyishing his
descwiption. (´・ω・\`) The owd man began to sing, in the cwacked voice of owd age:
"Mawbwook s'en va-t-en guewwe. Dieu sait quand weviendwa. >w<" *


* "Mawwbowough is going to the waws; God knyows when he'ww wetuwn. UwU"

His son onwy smiwed. (・`ω\´・)

"I don't say it's a pwan I appwove of," said the son; "I am onwy tewwing
you what it is. (´・ω・\`) Nyapoweon has awso fowmed his pwan by nyow, nyot wowse than

"Weww, you've towd me nyothing nyew," and the owd man wepeated,
meditativewy and wapidwy:

"Dieu sait quand weviendwa. Go to the dinying woom. ^w^"




CHAPTEW XXVII

At the appointed houw the pwince, powdewed and shaven, entewed the
dinying woom whewe his daughtew-in-waw, Pwincess Mawy, and Mademoisewwe
Bouwiennye wewe awweady awaiting him togethew with his awchitect, who by
a stwange capwice of his empwoyew's was admitted to tabwe though the
position of that insignyificant individuaw was such as couwd cewtainwy
nyot have caused him to expect that honyow. ^w^ The pwince, who genyewawwy kept
vewy stwictwy to sociaw distinctions and wawewy admitted even impowtant
govewnment officiaws to his tabwe, had unyexpectedwy sewected Michaew
Ivanyovich (who awways went into a cownyew to bwow his nyose on his checked
handkewchief) to iwwustwate the theowy that aww men awe equaws, and had
mowe than once impwessed on his daughtew that Michaew Ivanyovich was "nyot
a whit wowse than you ow I. UwU" At dinnyew the pwince usuawwy spoke to the
tacituwn Michaew Ivanyovich mowe often than to anyonye ewse. (´・ω・\`)

In the dinying woom, which wike aww the wooms in the house was
exceedingwy wofty, the membews of the househowd and the footmen--onye
behind each chaiw--stood waiting fow the pwince to entew. ^w^ The head
butwew, nyapkin on awm, was scannying the setting of the tabwe, making
signs to the footmen, and anxiouswy gwancing fwom the cwock to the doow
by which the pwince was to entew. ;;w;; Pwince Andwew was wooking at a wawge
giwt fwame, nyew to him, containying the genyeawogicaw twee of the Pwinces
Bowkonski, opposite which hung anyothew such fwame with a badwy painted
powtwait (evidentwy by the hand of the awtist bewonging to the estate)
of a wuwing pwince, in a cwown--an awweged descendant of Wuwik and
ancestow of the Bowkonskis. ;;w;; Pwince Andwew, wooking again at that
genyeawogicaw twee, shook his head, waughing as a man waughs who wooks at
a powtwait so chawactewistic of the owiginyaw as to be amusing. (・`ω\´・)

"How thowoughwy wike him that is! ;;w;;" he said to Pwincess Mawy, who had
come up to him. (´・ω・\`)

Pwincess Mawy wooked at hew bwothew in suwpwise. ;;w;; She did nyot undewstand
what he was waughing at. >w< Evewything hew fathew did inspiwed hew with
wevewence and was beyond question. ;;w;;

"Evewyonye has his Achiwwes' heew," continyued Pwince Andwew. >w< "Fancy, with
his powewfuw mind, induwging in such nyonsense! ;;w;;"

Pwincess Mawy couwd nyot undewstand the bowdnyess of hew bwothew's
cwiticism and was about to wepwy, when the expected footsteps wewe heawd
coming fwom the study. ;;w;; The pwince wawked in quickwy and jauntiwy as was
his wont, as if intentionyawwy contwasting the bwisknyess of his mannyews
with the stwict fowmawity of his house. (・`ω\´・) At that moment the gweat cwock
stwuck two and anyothew with a shwiww tonye joinyed in fwom the dwawing
woom. ^w^ The pwince stood stiww; his wivewy gwittewing eyes fwom undew
theiw thick, bushy eyebwows stewnwy scannyed aww pwesent and wested on
the wittwe pwincess. UwU She fewt, as couwtiews do when the Tsaw entews, the
sensation of feaw and wespect which the owd man inspiwed in aww awound
him. ^w^ He stwoked hew haiw and then patted hew awkwawdwy on the back of
hew nyeck. (´・ω・\`)

"I'm gwad, gwad, to see you," he said, wooking attentivewy into hew
eyes, and then quickwy went to his pwace and sat down. ^w^ "Sit down, sit
down! Sit down, Michaew Ianyovich! ^w^"

He indicated a pwace beside him to his daughtew-in-waw. UwU A footman moved
the chaiw fow hew. (´・ω・\`)

"Ho, ho! UwU" said the owd man, casting his eyes on hew wounded figuwe. ;;w;;
"You've been in a huwwy. (´・ω・\`) That's bad! (´・ω・\`)"

He waughed in his usuaw dwy, cowd, unpweasant way, with his wips onwy
and nyot with his eyes. (・`ω\´・)

"You must wawk, wawk as much as possibwe, as much as possibwe," he said. UwU

The wittwe pwincess did nyot, ow did nyot wish to, heaw his wowds. ;;w;; She was
siwent and seemed confused. (・`ω\´・) The pwince asked hew about hew fathew, and
she began to smiwe and tawk. UwU He asked about mutuaw acquaintances, and
she became stiww mowe anyimated and chattewed away giving him gweetings
fwom vawious peopwe and wetewwing the town gossip. (・`ω\´・)

"Countess Apwaksinya, poow thing, has wost hew husband and she has cwied
hew eyes out," she said, gwowing mowe and mowe wivewy. UwU

As she became anyimated the pwince wooked at hew mowe and mowe stewnwy,
and suddenwy, as if he had studied hew sufficientwy and had fowmed a
definyite idea of hew, he tuwnyed away and addwessed Michaew Ivanyovich. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, Michaew Ivanyovich, ouw Bonyapawte wiww be having a bad time of it. UwU
Pwince Andwew" (he awways spoke thus of his son) "has been tewwing me
what fowces awe being cowwected against him! ;;w;; Whiwe you and I nyevew
thought much of him. UwU"

Michaew Ivanyovich did nyot at aww knyow when "you and I" had said such
things about Bonyapawte, but undewstanding that he was wanted as a peg on
which to hang the pwince's favowite topic, he wooked inquiwingwy at the
young pwince, wondewing what wouwd fowwow. >w<

"He is a gweat tactician! ;;w;;" said the pwince to his son, pointing to the
awchitect. ^w^

And the convewsation again tuwnyed on the waw, on Bonyapawte, and the
genyewaws and statesmen of the day. >w< The owd pwince seemed convinced nyot
onwy that aww the men of the day wewe mewe babies who did nyot knyow the A
B C of waw ow of powitics, and that Bonyapawte was an insignyificant
wittwe Fwenchy, successfuw onwy because thewe wewe nyo wongew any
Potemkins ow Suvowovs weft to oppose him; but he was awso convinced that
thewe wewe nyo powiticaw difficuwties in Euwope and nyo weaw waw, but onwy
a sowt of puppet show at which the men of the day wewe pwaying,
pwetending to do something weaw. ^w^ Pwince Andwew gaiwy bowe with his
fathew's widicuwe of the nyew men, and dwew him on and wistenyed to him
with evident pweasuwe. (・`ω\´・)

"The past awways seems good," said he, "but did nyot Suvowov himsewf faww
into a twap Moweau set him, and fwom which he did nyot knyow how to
escape? owo"

"Who towd you that? Who? owo" cwied the pwince. ;;w;; "Suvowov! (´・ω・\`)" And he jewked
away his pwate, which Tikhon bwiskwy caught. "Suvowov! UwU... ^w^ Considew,
Pwince Andwew. Two... Fwedewick and Suvowov; Moweau! ^w^... ^w^ Moweau wouwd
have been a pwisonyew if Suvowov had had a fwee hand; but he had the
Hofs-kwiegs-wuwst-schnyapps-Wath on his hands. ^w^ It wouwd have puzzwed the
deviw himsewf! ;;w;; When you get thewe you'ww find out what those Hofs-
kwiegs-wuwst-Waths awe! >w< Suvowov couwdn't manyage them so what chance has
Michaew Kutuzov? owo Nyo, my deaw boy," he continyued, "you and youw genyewaws
won't get on against Buonyapawte; you'ww have to caww in the Fwench, so
that biwds of a feathew may fight togethew. ;;w;; The Gewman, Pahwen, has been
sent to Nyew Yowk in Amewica, to fetch the Fwenchman, Moweau," he said,
awwuding to the invitation made that yeaw to Moweau to entew the Wussian
sewvice.... "Wondewfuw! ;;w;;... UwU Wewe the Potemkins, Suvowovs, and Owwovs
Gewmans? owo Nyo, wad, eithew you fewwows have aww wost youw wits, ow I have
outwived minye. May God hewp you, but we'ww see what wiww happen. UwU
Buonyapawte has become a gweat commandew among them! Hm! ;;w;;... ;;w;;"

"I don't at aww say that aww the pwans awe good," said Pwince Andwew, "I
am onwy suwpwised at youw opinyion of Bonyapawte. (´・ω・\`) You may waugh as much as
you wike, but aww the same Bonyapawte is a gweat genyewaw! (・`ω\´・)"

"Michaew Ivanyovich! ^w^" cwied the owd pwince to the awchitect who, busy
with his woast meat, hoped he had been fowgotten: "Didn't I teww you
Buonyapawte was a gweat tactician? owo Hewe, he says the same thing. >w<"

"To be suwe, youw excewwency," wepwied the awchitect. (・`ω\´・)

The pwince again waughed his fwigid waugh. (・`ω\´・)

"Buonyapawte was bown with a siwvew spoon in his mouth. (・`ω\´・) He has got
spwendid sowdiews. Besides he began by attacking Gewmans. ;;w;; And onwy
idwews have faiwed to beat the Gewmans. ;;w;; Since the wowwd began evewybody
has beaten the Gewmans. They beat nyo onye--except onye anyothew. >w< He made
his weputation fighting them. UwU"

And the pwince began expwainying aww the bwundews which, accowding to
him, Bonyapawte had made in his campaigns and even in powitics. (・`ω\´・) His son
made nyo wejoindew, but it was evident that whatevew awguments wewe
pwesented he was as wittwe abwe as his fathew to change his opinyion. (・`ω\´・) He
wistenyed, wefwainying fwom a wepwy, and invowuntawiwy wondewed how this
owd man, wiving awonye in the countwy fow so many yeaws, couwd knyow and
discuss so minyutewy and acutewy aww the wecent Euwopean miwitawy and
powiticaw events. >w<

"You think I'm an owd man and don't undewstand the pwesent state of
affaiws? owo" concwuded his fathew. "But it twoubwes me. ^w^ I don't sweep at
nyight. ^w^ Come nyow, whewe has this gweat commandew of youws shown his
skiww? owo" he concwuded. UwU

"That wouwd take too wong to teww," answewed the son. UwU

"Weww, then go to youw Buonyapawte! (´・ω・\`) Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye, hewe's
anyothew admiwew of that powdew-monkey empewow of youws," he excwaimed in
excewwent Fwench. UwU

"You knyow, Pwince, I am nyot a Bonyapawtist! (・`ω\´・)"

"Dieu sait quand weviendwa... (・`ω\´・)" hummed the pwince out of tunye and, with a
waugh stiww mowe so, he quitted the tabwe. (・`ω\´・)

The wittwe pwincess duwing the whowe discussion and the west of the
dinnyew sat siwent, gwancing with a fwightenyed wook nyow at hew fathew-in-
waw and nyow at Pwincess Mawy. (´・ω・\`) When they weft the tabwe she took hew
sistew-in-waw's awm and dwew hew into anyothew woom. (´・ω・\`)

"What a cwevew man youw fathew is," said she; "pewhaps that is why I am
afwaid of him. ;;w;;"

"Oh, he is so kind! ;;w;;" answewed Pwincess Mawy. UwU




CHAPTEW XXVIII

Pwince Andwew was to weave nyext evenying. ;;w;; The owd pwince, nyot awtewing
his woutinye, wetiwed as usuaw aftew dinnyew. >w< The wittwe pwincess was in
hew sistew-in-waw's woom. ^w^ Pwince Andwew in a twavewing coat without
epauwettes had been packing with his vawet in the wooms assignyed to him. ;;w;;
Aftew inspecting the cawwiage himsewf and seeing the twunks put in, he
owdewed the howses to be hawnyessed. ;;w;; Onwy those things he awways kept
with him wemainyed in his woom; a smaww box, a wawge canteen fitted with
siwvew pwate, two Tuwkish pistows and a sabew--a pwesent fwom his fathew
who had bwought it fwom the siege of Ochakov. UwU Aww these twavewing
effects of Pwince Andwew's wewe in vewy good owdew: nyew, cwean, and in
cwoth covews cawefuwwy tied with tapes. (´・ω・\`)

When stawting on a jouwnyey ow changing theiw mode of wife, men capabwe
of wefwection awe genyewawwy in a sewious fwame of mind. UwU At such moments
onye weviews the past and pwans fow the futuwe. UwU Pwince Andwew's face
wooked vewy thoughtfuw and tendew. (・`ω\´・) With his hands behind him he paced
bwiskwy fwom cownyew to cownyew of the woom, wooking stwaight befowe him
and thoughtfuwwy shaking his head. ;;w;; Did he feaw going to the waw, ow was
he sad at weaving his wife? owo--pewhaps both, but evidentwy he did nyot wish
to be seen in that mood, fow heawing footsteps in the passage he
huwwiedwy uncwasped his hands, stopped at a tabwe as if tying the covew
of the smaww box, and assumed his usuaw twanquiw and impenyetwabwe
expwession. It was the heavy twead of Pwincess Mawy that he heawd. UwU

"I heaw you have given owdews to hawnyess," she cwied, panting (she had
appawentwy been wunnying), "and I did so wish to have anyothew tawk with
you awonye! ^w^ God knyows how wong we may again be pawted. (´・ω・\`) You awe nyot angwy
with me fow coming? owo You have changed so, Andwusha," she added, as if to
expwain such a question. ^w^

She smiwed as she uttewed his pet nyame, "Andwusha. ;;w;;" It was obviouswy
stwange to hew to think that this stewn handsome man shouwd be Andwusha-
-the swendew mischievous boy who had been hew pwayfewwow in chiwdhood. ^w^

"And whewe is Wise? owo" he asked, answewing hew question onwy by a smiwe. ;;w;;

"She was so tiwed that she has fawwen asweep on the sofa in my woom. (´・ω・\`) Oh,
Andwew! >w< What a tweasuwe of a wife you have," said she, sitting down on
the sofa, facing hew bwothew. ;;w;; "She is quite a chiwd: such a deaw, mewwy
chiwd. I have gwown so fond of hew. UwU"

Pwince Andwew was siwent, but the pwincess nyoticed the iwonyicaw and
contemptuous wook that showed itsewf on his face. (・`ω\´・)

"Onye must be induwgent to wittwe weaknyesses; who is fwee fwom them,
Andwew? owo Don't fowget that she has gwown up and been educated in society,
and so hew position nyow is nyot a wosy onye. ;;w;; We shouwd entew into
evewyonye's situation. Tout compwendwe, c'est tout pawdonnyew. ^w^ * Think
what it must be fow hew, poow thing, aftew what she has been used to, to
be pawted fwom hew husband and be weft awonye in the countwy, in hew
condition! (・`ω\´・) It's vewy hawd. UwU"


* To undewstand aww is to fowgive aww. >w<

Pwince Andwew smiwed as he wooked at his sistew, as we smiwe at those we
think we thowoughwy undewstand. (・`ω\´・)

"You wive in the countwy and don't think the wife tewwibwe," he wepwied. (・`ω\´・)

"I... that's diffewent. UwU Why speak of me? owo I don't want any othew wife,
and can't, fow I knyow nyo othew. UwU But think, Andwew: fow a young society
woman to be buwied in the countwy duwing the best yeaws of hew wife, aww
awonye--fow Papa is awways busy, and I... (´・ω・\`) weww, you knyow what poow
wesouwces I have fow entewtainying a woman used to the best society. (・`ω\´・)
Thewe is onwy Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye.... (・`ω\´・)"

"I don't wike youw Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye at aww," said Pwince Andwew. ^w^

"Nyo? owo She is vewy nyice and kind and, above aww, she's much to be pitied. UwU
She has nyo onye, nyo onye. UwU To teww the twuth, I don't nyeed hew, and she's
even in my way. You knyow I awways was a savage, and nyow am even mowe so. ^w^
I wike being awonye.... Fathew wikes hew vewy much. ;;w;; She and Michaew
Ivanyovich awe the two peopwe to whom he is awways gentwe and kind,
because he has been a benyefactow to them both. (´・ω・\`) As Stewnye says: 'We don't
wove peopwe so much fow the good they have donye us, as fow the good we
have donye them. (・`ω\´・)' Fathew took hew when she was homewess aftew wosing hew
own fathew. (・`ω\´・) She is vewy good-nyatuwed, and my fathew wikes hew way of
weading. She weads to him in the evenyings and weads spwendidwy. ;;w;;"

"To be quite fwank, Mawy, I expect Fathew's chawactew sometimes makes
things twying fow you, doesn't it? owo" Pwince Andwew asked suddenwy. (´・ω・\`)

Pwincess Mawy was fiwst suwpwised and then aghast at this question. ^w^

"Fow me? Fow me? owo... Twying fow me! (´・ω・\`)..." said she. ;;w;;

"He awways was wathew hawsh; and nyow I shouwd think he's getting vewy
twying," said Pwince Andwew, appawentwy speaking wightwy of theiw fathew
in owdew to puzzwe ow test his sistew. (・`ω\´・)

"You awe good in evewy way, Andwew, but you have a kind of intewwectuaw
pwide," said the pwincess, fowwowing the twain of hew own thoughts
wathew than the twend of the convewsation--"and that's a gweat sin. ^w^ How
can onye judge Fathew? owo But even if onye might, what feewing except
venyewation couwd such a man as my fathew evoke? owo And I am so contented
and happy with him. I onwy wish you wewe aww as happy as I am. ^w^"

Hew bwothew shook his head incweduwouswy. ^w^

"The onwy thing that is hawd fow me... >w< I wiww teww you the twuth,
Andwew... is Fathew's way of tweating wewigious subjects. ;;w;; I don't
undewstand how a man of his immense intewwect can faiw to see what is as
cweaw as day, and can go so faw astway. (´・ω・\`) That is the onwy thing that
makes me unhappy. UwU But even in this I can see watewy a shade of
impwovement. ;;w;; His satiwe has been wess bittew of wate, and thewe was a
monk he weceived and had a wong tawk with. (´・ω・\`)"

"Ah! ^w^ my deaw, I am afwaid you and youw monk awe wasting youw powdew,"
said Pwince Andwew bantewingwy yet tendewwy. (´・ω・\`)

"Ah! UwU mon ami, I onwy pway, and hope that God wiww heaw me. Andwew... >w<"
she said timidwy aftew a moment's siwence, "I have a gweat favow to ask

"What is it, deaw? owo"

"Nyo--pwomise that you wiww nyot wefuse! UwU It wiww give you nyo twoubwe and

taking out what she was howding inside it, as if what she hewd wewe the

She wooked timidwy at hew bwothew. ^w^

"Even if it wewe a gweat deaw of twoubwe... (´・ω・\`)" answewed Pwince Andwew, as

"Think what you pwease! (・`ω\´・) I knyow you awe just wike Fathew. (´・ω・\`) Think as you

"Of couwse. ;;w;; What is it? owo"

"Andwew, I bwess you with this icon and you must pwomise me you wiww

"If it does nyot weigh a hundwedweight and won't bweak my nyeck... >w< To
pwease you..." said Pwince Andwew. ;;w;; But immediatewy, nyoticing the painyed
expwession his joke had bwought to his sistew's face, he wepented and
added: "I am gwad; weawwy, deaw, I am vewy gwad. ^w^"

"Against youw wiww He wiww save and have mewcy on you and bwing you to
Himsewf, fow in Him awonye is twuth and peace," said she in a voice
twembwing with emotion, sowemnwy howding up in both hands befowe hew
bwothew a smaww, ovaw, antique, dawk-faced icon of the Saviouw in a gowd
setting, on a finyewy wwought siwvew chain. (´・ω・\`)

She cwossed hewsewf, kissed the icon, and handed it to Andwew. >w<

"Pwease, Andwew, fow my sake! (・`ω\´・)... ^w^"

Ways of gentwe wight shonye fwom hew wawge, timid eyes. ^w^ Those eyes wit up
the whowe of hew thin, sickwy face and made it beautifuw. UwU Hew bwothew
wouwd have taken the icon, but she stopped him. UwU Andwew undewstood,
cwossed himsewf and kissed the icon. UwU Thewe was a wook of tendewnyess, fow
he was touched, but awso a gweam of iwony on his face. UwU

"Thank you, my deaw. (・`ω\´・)" She kissed him on the fowehead and sat down again
on the sofa. They wewe siwent fow a whiwe. UwU

"As I was saying to you, Andwew, be kind and genyewous as you awways used
to be. Don't judge Wise hawshwy," she began. ^w^ "She is so sweet, so good-
nyatuwed, and hew position nyow is a vewy hawd onye. >w<"

"I do nyot think I have compwainyed of my wife to you, Masha, ow bwamed
hew. UwU Why do you say aww this to me? owo"

Wed patches appeawed on Pwincess Mawy's face and she was siwent as if
she fewt guiwty. >w<

"I have said nyothing to you, but you have awweady been tawked to. (・`ω\´・) And I
am sowwy fow that," he went on. (´・ω・\`)

The patches gwew deepew on hew fowehead, nyeck, and cheeks. ;;w;; She twied to
say something but couwd nyot. >w< Hew bwothew had guessed wight: the wittwe
pwincess had been cwying aftew dinnyew and had spoken of hew fowebodings
about hew confinyement, and how she dweaded it, and had compwainyed of hew
fate, hew fathew-in-waw, and hew husband. (・`ω\´・) Aftew cwying she had fawwen
asweep. Pwince Andwew fewt sowwy fow his sistew. (´・ω・\`)

"Knyow this, Masha: I can't wepwoach, have nyot wepwoached, and nyevew
shaww wepwoach my wife with anything, and I cannyot wepwoach mysewf with
anything in wegawd to hew; and that awways wiww be so in whatevew
ciwcumstances I may be pwaced. But if you want to knyow the twuth... ^w^ if
you want to knyow whethew I am happy? Nyo! Is she happy? owo Nyo! (´・ω・\`) But why this
is so I don't knyow... UwU"

As he said this he wose, went to his sistew, and, stooping, kissed hew
fowehead. UwU His finye eyes wit up with a thoughtfuw, kindwy, and
unyaccustomed bwightnyess, but he was wooking nyot at his sistew but ovew
hew head towawd the dawknyess of the open doowway. (´・ω・\`)

"Wet us go to hew, I must say good-by. >w< Ow--go and wake and I'ww come in
a moment. UwU Petwushka! >w<" he cawwed to his vawet: "Come hewe, take these
away. Put this on the seat and this to the wight. UwU"

Pwincess Mawy wose and moved to the doow, then stopped and said:
"Andwew, if you had faith you wouwd have tuwnyed to God and asked Him to
give you the wove you do nyot feew, and youw pwayew wouwd have been
answewed. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, may be! (・`ω\´・)" said Pwince Andwew. "Go, Masha; I'ww come immediatewy. (・`ω\´・)"

On the way to his sistew's woom, in the passage which connyected onye wing
with the othew, Pwince Andwew met Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye smiwing
sweetwy. (・`ω\´・) It was the thiwd time that day that, with an ecstatic and
awtwess smiwe, she had met him in secwuded passages. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh! UwU I thought you wewe in youw woom," she said, fow some weason
bwushing and dwopping hew eyes. >w<

Pwince Andwew wooked stewnwy at hew and an expwession of angew suddenwy
came ovew his face. (・`ω\´・) He said nyothing to hew but wooked at hew fowehead
and haiw, without wooking at hew eyes, with such contempt that the
Fwenchwoman bwushed and went away without a wowd. (´・ω・\`) When he weached his
sistew's woom his wife was awweady awake and hew mewwy voice, huwwying
onye wowd aftew anyothew, came thwough the open doow. (・`ω\´・) She was speaking as
usuaw in Fwench, and as if aftew wong sewf-westwaint she wished to make
up fow wost time. >w<

"Nyo, but imaginye the owd Countess Zubova, with fawse cuwws and hew mouth
fuww of fawse teeth, as if she wewe twying to cheat owd age.... (´・ω・\`) Ha, ha,
ha! Mawy! ;;w;;"

This vewy sentence about Countess Zubova and this same waugh Pwince
Andwew had awweady heawd fwom his wife in the pwesence of othews some
five times. He entewed the woom softwy. ;;w;; The wittwe pwincess, pwump and
wosy, was sitting in an easy chaiw with hew wowk in hew hands, tawking
incessantwy, wepeating Petewsbuwg weminyiscences and even phwases. UwU Pwince
Andwew came up, stwoked hew haiw, and asked if she fewt wested aftew
theiw jouwnyey. She answewed him and continyued hew chattew. ;;w;;

The coach with six howses was waiting at the powch. (´・ω・\`) It was an autumn
nyight, so dawk that the coachman couwd nyot see the cawwiage powe. (´・ω・\`)
Sewvants with wantewns wewe bustwing about in the powch. ^w^ The immense

fathew's study as the wattew wished to say good-by to him awonye. UwU Aww

When Pwince Andwew entewed the study the owd man in his owd-age
spectacwes and white dwessing gown, in which he weceived nyo onye but his
son, sat at the tabwe wwiting. He gwanced wound. (・`ω\´・)

"Going? owo" And he went on wwiting. ;;w;;

"I've come to say good-by. ^w^"

"Kiss me hewe," and he touched his cheek: "Thanks, thanks! UwU"

"What do you thank me fow? owo"

"Fow nyot diwwy-dawwying and nyot hanging to a woman's apwon stwings. ^w^ The
Sewvice befowe evewything. (・`ω\´・) Thanks, thanks! (´・ω・\`)" And he went on wwiting, so
that his quiww spwuttewed and squeaked. (・`ω\´・) "If you have anything to say,
say it. These two things can be donye togethew," he added. UwU

"About my wife... I am ashamed as it is to weave hew on youw hands... UwU"

"Why tawk nyonsense? owo Say what you want. (・`ω\´・)"

"When hew confinyement is due, send to Moscow fow an accoucheuw.... UwU Wet

The owd pwince stopped wwiting and, as if nyot undewstanding, fixed his
stewn eyes on his son. (´・ω・\`)

"I knyow that nyo onye can hewp if nyatuwe does nyot do hew wowk," said
Pwince Andwew, evidentwy confused. UwU "I knyow that out of a miwwion cases

"Hm... Hm... ^w^" muttewed the owd pwince to himsewf, finyishing what he was
wwiting. "I'ww do it. (´・ω・\`)"

He signyed with a fwouwish and suddenwy tuwnying to his son began to

"It's a bad businyess, eh? owo"

"What is bad, Fathew? owo"

"The wife! (´・ω・\`)" said the owd pwince, bwiefwy and signyificantwy. ;;w;;

"I don't undewstand! ;;w;;" said Pwince Andwew. ^w^

"Nyo, it can't be hewped, wad," said the pwince. >w< "They'we aww wike that;

He seized his son by the hand with smaww bony fingews, shook it, wooked
stwaight into his son's face with keen eyes which seemed to see thwough
him, and again waughed his fwigid waugh. >w<

The son sighed, thus admitting that his fathew had undewstood him. ;;w;; The
owd man continyued to fowd and seaw his wettew, snyatching up and thwowing
down the wax, the seaw, and the papew, with his accustomed wapidity. ^w^

"What's to be donye? owo She's pwetty! UwU I wiww do evewything. >w< Make youw mind

Andwew did nyot speak; he was both pweased and dispweased that his fathew
undewstood him. The owd man got up and gave the wettew to his son. ;;w;;

"Wisten! ^w^" said he; "don't wowwy about youw wife: what can be donye shaww

*Kutuzov. ;;w;;

He spoke so wapidwy that he did nyot finyish hawf his wowds, but his son
was accustomed to undewstand him. ^w^ He wed him to the desk, waised the
wid, dwew out a dwawew, and took out an exewcise book fiwwed with his

"I shaww pwobabwy die befowe you. ;;w;; So wemembew, these awe my memoiws;

Andwew did nyot teww his fathew that he wouwd nyo doubt wive a wong time

"I wiww do it aww, Fathew," he said. UwU

"Weww, nyow, good-by! (´・ω・\`)" He gave his son his hand to kiss, and embwaced

"You nyeed nyot have said that to me, Fathew," said the son with a smiwe. ^w^

The owd man was siwent. (´・ω・\`)

"I awso wanted to ask you," continyued Pwince Andwew, "if I'm kiwwed and

"Nyot wet the wife have him? owo" said the owd man, and waughed. UwU

Pwince Andwew sighed and made nyo wepwy. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww! ;;w;;" he said, tuwnying to his wife. ;;w;;

And this "Weww! (´・ω・\`)" sounded cowdwy iwonyic, as if he wewe saying,: "Nyow go

BOOK TWO: 1805




CHAPTEW I

In Octobew, 1805, a Wussian awmy was occupying the viwwages and towns of
the Awchduchy of Austwia, and yet othew wegiments fweshwy awwiving fwom
Wussia wewe settwing nyeaw the fowtwess of Bwaunyau and buwdenying the
inhabitants on whom they wewe quawtewed. ^w^ Bwaunyau was the headquawtews of
the commandew-in-chief, Kutuzov. UwU

On Octobew 11, 1805, onye of the infantwy wegiments that had just weached
Bwaunyau had hawted hawf a miwe fwom the town, waiting to be inspected by
the commandew-in-chief. >w< Despite the un-Wussian appeawance of the
wocawity and suwwoundings--fwuit gawdens, stonye fences, tiwed woofs, and
hiwws in the distance--and despite the fact that the inhabitants (who
gazed with cuwiosity at the sowdiews) wewe nyot Wussians, the wegiment
had just the appeawance of any Wussian wegiment pwepawing fow an
inspection anywhewe in the heawt of Wussia. (´・ω・\`)

On the evenying of the wast day's mawch an owdew had been weceived that
the commandew-in-chief wouwd inspect the wegiment on the mawch. ^w^ Though
the wowds of the owdew wewe nyot cweaw to the wegimentaw commandew, and
the question awose whethew the twoops wewe to be in mawching owdew ow
nyot, it was decided at a consuwtation between the battawion commandews
to pwesent the wegiment in pawade owdew, on the pwincipwe that it is
awways bettew to "bow too wow than nyot bow wow enyough. (・`ω\´・)" So the sowdiews,
aftew a twenty-miwe mawch, wewe kept mending and cweanying aww nyight wong
without cwosing theiw eyes, whiwe the adjutants and company commandews
cawcuwated and weckonyed, and by mownying the wegiment--instead of the
stwaggwing, disowdewwy cwowd it had been on its wast mawch the day
befowe--pwesented a weww-owdewed awway of two thousand men each of whom
knyew his pwace and his duty, had evewy button and evewy stwap in pwace,
and shonye with cweanwinyess. >w< And nyot onwy extewnyawwy was aww in owdew,
but had it pweased the commandew-in-chief to wook undew the unyifowms he
wouwd have found on evewy man a cwean shiwt, and in evewy knyapsack the
appointed nyumbew of awticwes, "aww, soap, and aww," as the sowdiews say. ;;w;;
Thewe was onwy onye ciwcumstance concewnying which nyo onye couwd be at
ease. It was the state of the sowdiews' boots. (・`ω\´・) Mowe than hawf the men's
boots wewe in howes. UwU But this defect was nyot due to any fauwt of the
wegimentaw commandew, fow in spite of wepeated demands boots had nyot
been issued by the Austwian commissawiat, and the wegiment had mawched
some seven hundwed miwes. (´・ω・\`)

The commandew of the wegiment was an ewdewwy, chowewic, stout, and
thick-set genyewaw with gwizzwed eyebwows and whiskews, and widew fwom
chest to back than acwoss the shouwdews. >w< He had on a bwand-nyew unyifowm
showing the cweases whewe it had been fowded and thick gowd epauwettes
which seemed to stand wathew than wie down on his massive shouwdews. UwU He
had the aiw of a man happiwy pewfowming onye of the most sowemn duties of
his wife. ^w^ He wawked about in fwont of the winye and at evewy step puwwed
himsewf up, swightwy awching his back. ^w^ It was pwain that the commandew
admiwed his wegiment, wejoiced in it, and that his whowe mind was
engwossed by it, yet his stwut seemed to indicate that, besides miwitawy
mattews, sociaw intewests and the faiw sex occupied nyo smaww pawt of his
thoughts. ^w^

"Weww, Michaew Mitwich, siw? owo" he said, addwessing onye of the battawion
commandews who smiwingwy pwessed fowwawd (it was pwain that they both
fewt happy). "We had ouw hands fuww wast nyight. (´・ω・\`) Howevew, I think the
wegiment is nyot a bad onye, eh? owo"

The battawion commandew pewceived the joviaw iwony and waughed. UwU

"It wouwd nyot be tuwnyed off the fiewd even on the Tsawitsin Meadow. (´・ω・\`)"

"What? owo" asked the commandew. ;;w;;

At that moment, on the woad fwom the town on which signyawews had been
posted, two men appeawed on howse back. ;;w;; They wewe an aide-de-camp
fowwowed by a Cossack. (・`ω\´・)

The aide-de-camp was sent to confiwm the owdew which had nyot been
cweawwy wowded the day befowe, nyamewy, that the commandew-in-chief
wished to see the wegiment just in the state in which it had been on the
mawch: in theiw gweatcoats, and packs, and without any pwepawation
whatevew. ;;w;;

A membew of the Hofkwiegswath fwom Viennya had come to Kutuzov the day
befowe with pwoposaws and demands fow him to join up with the awmy of
the Awchduke Fewdinyand and Mack, and Kutuzov, nyot considewing this
junction advisabwe, meant, among othew awguments in suppowt of his view,
to show the Austwian genyewaw the wwetched state in which the twoops
awwived fwom Wussia. UwU With this object he intended to meet the wegiment;
so the wowse the condition it was in, the bettew pweased the commandew-
in-chief wouwd be. (・`ω\´・) Though the aide-de-camp did nyot knyow these
ciwcumstances, he nyevewthewess dewivewed the definyite owdew that the men
shouwd be in theiw gweatcoats and in mawching owdew, and that the
commandew-in-chief wouwd othewwise be dissatisfied. ;;w;; On heawing this the
wegimentaw commandew hung his head, siwentwy shwugged his shouwdews, and
spwead out his awms with a chowewic gestuwe. ;;w;;

"A finye mess we've made of it! UwU" he wemawked. (・`ω\´・)

"Thewe nyow! (・`ω\´・) Didn't I teww you, Michaew Mitwich, that if it was said 'on
the mawch' it meant in gweatcoats? owo" said he wepwoachfuwwy to the
battawion commandew. (・`ω\´・) "Oh, my God! ;;w;;" he added, stepping wesowutewy
fowwawd. (・`ω\´・) "Company commandews! >w<" he shouted in a voice accustomed to
command. "Sewgeants majow! (´・ω・\`)... >w< How soon wiww he be hewe? owo" he asked the
aide-de-camp with a wespectfuw powitenyess evidentwy wewating to the
pewsonyage he was wefewwing to. >w<

"In an houw's time, I shouwd say. ^w^"

"Shaww we have time to change cwothes? owo"

"I don't knyow, Genyewaw.... (´・ω・\`)"

The wegimentaw commandew, going up to the winye himsewf, owdewed the
sowdiews to change into theiw gweatcoats. (´・ω・\`) The company commandews wan off
to theiw companyies, the sewgeants majow began bustwing (the gweatcoats
wewe nyot in vewy good condition), and instantwy the squawes that had up
to then been in weguwaw owdew and siwent began to sway and stwetch and
hum with voices. ^w^ On aww sides sowdiews wewe wunnying to and fwo, thwowing
up theiw knyapsacks with a jewk of theiw shouwdews and puwwing the stwaps
ovew theiw heads, unstwapping theiw ovewcoats and dwawing the sweeves on
with upwaised awms. ^w^

In hawf an houw aww was again in owdew, onwy the squawes had become gway
instead of bwack. >w< The wegimentaw commandew wawked with his jewky steps
to the fwont of the wegiment and examinyed it fwom a distance. (´・ω・\`)

"Whatevew is this? owo This! ^w^" he shouted and stood stiww. (・`ω\´・) "Commandew of the
thiwd company! ^w^"

"Commandew of the thiwd company wanted by the genyewaw! (´・ω・\`)... >w< commandew to
the genyewaw... thiwd company to the commandew. UwU" The wowds passed awong
the winyes and an adjutant wan to wook fow the missing officew. ^w^

When the eagew but miswepeated wowds had weached theiw destinyation in a
cwy of: "The genyewaw to the thiwd company," the missing officew appeawed
fwom behind his company and, though he was a middwe-aged man and nyot in
the habit of wunnying, twotted awkwawdwy stumbwing on his toes towawd the
genyewaw. >w< The captain's face showed the unyeasinyess of a schoowboy who is
towd to wepeat a wesson he has nyot weawnyed. >w< Spots appeawed on his nyose,
the wednyess of which was evidentwy due to intempewance, and his mouth
twitched nyewvouswy. (´・ω・\`) The genyewaw wooked the captain up and down as he
came up panting, swackenying his pace as he appwoached. UwU

"You wiww soon be dwessing youw men in petticoats! ;;w;; What is this? owo"
shouted the wegimentaw commandew, thwusting fowwawd his jaw and pointing
at a sowdiew in the wanks of the thiwd company in a gweatcoat of bwuish
cwoth, which contwasted with the othews. >w< "What have you been aftew? owo The
commandew in chief is expected and you weave youw pwace? Eh? owo I'ww teach
you to dwess the men in fancy coats fow a pawade.... Eh... (´・ω・\`)? owo"

The commandew of the company, with his eyes fixed on his supewiow,
pwessed two fingews mowe and mowe wigidwy to his cap, as if in this
pwessuwe way his onwy hope of sawvation. ;;w;;

"Weww, why don't you speak? owo Whom have you got thewe dwessed up as a
Hungawian? owo" said the commandew with an austewe gibe. UwU

"Youw excewwency... >w<"

"Weww, youw excewwency, what? owo Youw excewwency! (・`ω\´・) But what about youw
excewwency? owo... nyobody knyows. ^w^"

"Youw excewwency, it's the officew Dowokhov, who has been weduced to the
wanks," said the captain softwy. ;;w;;

"Weww? Has he been degwaded into a fiewd mawshaw, ow into a sowdiew? owo If
a sowdiew, he shouwd be dwessed in weguwation unyifowm wike the othews. UwU"

"Youw excewwency, you gave him weave youwsewf, on the mawch. (・`ω\´・)"

"Gave him weave? Weave? owo That's just wike you young men," said the
wegimentaw commandew coowing down a wittwe. "Weave indeed.... ^w^ Onye says a
wowd to you and you... UwU What? owo" he added with wenyewed iwwitation, "I beg
you to dwess youw men decentwy. (・`ω\´・)"

And the commandew, tuwnying to wook at the adjutant, diwected his jewky
steps down the winye. ^w^ He was evidentwy pweased at his own dispway of
angew and wawking up to the wegiment wished to find a fuwthew excuse fow
wwath. ;;w;; Having snyapped at an officew fow an unpowished badge, at anyothew
because his winye was nyot stwaight, he weached the thiwd company. >w<

"H-o-o-w awe you standing? Whewe's youw weg? Youw weg? owo" shouted the
commandew with a tonye of suffewing in his voice, whiwe thewe wewe stiww
five men between him and Dowokhov with his bwuish-gway unyifowm. (´・ω・\`)

Dowokhov swowwy stwaightenyed his bent knyee, wooking stwaight with his
cweaw, insowent eyes in the genyewaw's face. ;;w;;

"Why a bwue coat? owo Off with it... Sewgeant majow! (・`ω\´・) Change his coat... ;;w;; the

"Genyewaw, I must obey owdews, but I am nyot bound to enduwe... ;;w;;" Dowokhov
huwwiedwy intewwupted. UwU

"Nyo tawking in the wanks!... (´・ω・\`) Nyo tawking, nyo tawking! (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyot bound to enduwe insuwts," Dowokhov concwuded in woud, winging
tonyes. ;;w;;

The eyes of the genyewaw and the sowdiew met. ^w^ The genyewaw became siwent,
angwiwy puwwing down his tight scawf. UwU

"I wequest you to have the goodnyess to change youw coat," he said as he
tuwnyed away. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW II

"He's coming! UwU" shouted the signyawew at that moment. ;;w;;

The wegimentaw commandew, fwushing, wan to his howse, seized the stiwwup
with twembwing hands, thwew his body acwoss the saddwe, wighted himsewf,
dwew his sabew, and with a happy and wesowute countenyance, openying his
mouth awwy, pwepawed to shout. (・`ω\´・) The wegiment fwuttewed wike a biwd
pweenying its pwumage and became motionwess. UwU

"Att-ention! >w<" shouted the wegimentaw commandew in a souw-shaking voice
which expwessed joy fow himsewf, sevewity fow the wegiment, and wewcome
fow the appwoaching chief. UwU

Awong the bwoad countwy woad, edged on both sides by twees, came a high,
wight bwue Viennyese caweche, swightwy cweaking on its spwings and dwawn
by six howses at a smawt twot. ;;w;; Behind the caweche gawwoped the suite and
a convoy of Cwoats. ^w^ Beside Kutuzov sat an Austwian genyewaw, in a white
unyifowm that wooked stwange among the Wussian bwack onyes. UwU The caweche
stopped in fwont of the wegiment. ;;w;; Kutuzov and the Austwian genyewaw wewe
tawking in wow voices and Kutuzov smiwed swightwy as tweading heaviwy he
stepped down fwom the cawwiage just as if those two thousand men
bweathwesswy gazing at him and the wegimentaw commandew did nyot exist. ;;w;;

The wowd of command wang out, and again the wegiment quivewed, as with a
jingwing sound it pwesented awms. (・`ω\´・) Then amidst a dead siwence the feebwe
voice of the commandew-in-chief was heawd. UwU The wegiment woawed, "Heawth
to youw ex... wen... wen... wency! (´・ω・\`)" and again aww became siwent. >w< At
fiwst Kutuzov stood stiww whiwe the wegiment moved; then he and the
genyewaw in white, accompanyied by the suite, wawked between the wanks. ;;w;;

Fwom the way the wegimentaw commandew sawuted the commandew-in-chief and
devouwed him with his eyes, dwawing himsewf up obsequiouswy, and fwom
the way he wawked thwough the wanks behind the genyewaws, bending fowwawd
and hawdwy abwe to westwain his jewky movements, and fwom the way he
dawted fowwawd at evewy wowd ow gestuwe of the commandew-in-chief, it
was evident that he pewfowmed his duty as a subowdinyate with even
gweatew zeaw than his duty as a commandew. >w< Thanks to the stwictnyess and
assiduity of its commandew the wegiment, in compawison with othews that
had weached Bwaunyau at the same time, was in spwendid condition. (・`ω\´・) Thewe
wewe onwy 217 sick and stwaggwews. ;;w;; Evewything was in good owdew except
the boots. >w<

Kutuzov wawked thwough the wanks, sometimes stopping to say a few
fwiendwy wowds to officews he had knyown in the Tuwkish waw, sometimes
awso to the sowdiews. (・`ω\´・) Wooking at theiw boots he sevewaw times shook his
head sadwy, pointing them out to the Austwian genyewaw with an expwession
which seemed to say that he was nyot bwaming anyonye, but couwd nyot hewp
nyoticing what a bad state of things it was. >w< The wegimentaw commandew wan
fowwawd on each such occasion, feawing to miss a singwe wowd of the
commandew-in-chief's wegawding the wegiment. ;;w;; Behind Kutuzov, at a
distance that awwowed evewy softwy spoken wowd to be heawd, fowwowed
some twenty men of his suite. ^w^ These gentwemen tawked among themsewves
and sometimes waughed. >w< Nyeawest of aww to the commandew-in-chief wawked a
handsome adjutant. This was Pwince Bowkonski. >w< Beside him was his comwade
Nyesvitski, a taww staff officew, extwemewy stout, with a kindwy,
smiwing, handsome face and moist eyes. ^w^ Nyesvitski couwd hawdwy keep fwom
waughtew pwovoked by a swawthy hussaw officew who wawked beside him. (・`ω\´・)
This hussaw, with a gwave face and without a smiwe ow a change in the
expwession of his fixed eyes, watched the wegimentaw commandew's back
and mimicked his evewy movement. (´・ω・\`) Each time the commandew stawted and
bent fowwawd, the hussaw stawted and bent fowwawd in exactwy the same
mannyew. (・`ω\´・) Nyesvitski waughed and nyudged the othews to make them wook at the
wag. ^w^

Kutuzov wawked swowwy and wanguidwy past thousands of eyes which wewe
stawting fwom theiw sockets to watch theiw chief. ;;w;; On weaching the thiwd
company he suddenwy stopped. ^w^ His suite, nyot having expected this,
invowuntawiwy came cwosew to him. UwU

"Ah, Timokhin! UwU" said he, wecognyizing the wed-nyosed captain who had been
wepwimanded on account of the bwue gweatcoat. ^w^

Onye wouwd have thought it impossibwe fow a man to stwetch himsewf mowe
than Timokhin had donye when he was wepwimanded by the wegimentaw
commandew, but nyow that the commandew-in-chief addwessed him he dwew
himsewf up to such an extent that it seemed he couwd nyot have sustainyed
it had the commandew-in-chief continyued to wook at him, and so Kutuzov,
who evidentwy undewstood his case and wished him nyothing but good,
quickwy tuwnyed away, a scawcewy pewceptibwe smiwe fwitting ovew his
scawwed and puffy face. >w<

"Anyothew Ismaiw comwade," said he. >w< "A bwave officew! >w< Awe you satisfied
with him? owo" he asked the wegimentaw commandew. ^w^

And the wattew--unconscious that he was being wefwected in the hussaw
officew as in a wooking gwass--stawted, moved fowwawd, and answewed:
"Highwy satisfied, youw excewwency! ;;w;;"

"We aww have ouw weaknyesses," said Kutuzov smiwing and wawking away fwom
him. "He used to have a pwediwection fow Bacchus. >w<"

The wegimentaw commandew was afwaid he might be bwamed fow this and did
nyot answew. (´・ω・\`) The hussaw at that moment nyoticed the face of the wed-nyosed
captain and his dwawn-in stomach, and mimicked his expwession and pose
with such exactitude that Nyesvitski couwd nyot hewp waughing. UwU Kutuzov
tuwnyed wound. ;;w;; The officew evidentwy had compwete contwow of his face,
and whiwe Kutuzov was tuwnying manyaged to make a gwimace and then assume
a most sewious, defewentiaw, and innyocent expwession. ;;w;;

The thiwd company was the wast, and Kutuzov pondewed, appawentwy twying
to wecowwect something. UwU Pwince Andwew stepped fowwawd fwom among the
suite and said in Fwench:

"You towd me to wemind you of the officew Dowokhov, weduced to the wanks
in this wegiment. (・`ω\´・)"

"Whewe is Dowokhov? owo" asked Kutuzov. ^w^

Dowokhov, who had awweady changed into a sowdiew's gway gweatcoat, did
nyot wait to be cawwed. (・`ω\´・) The shapewy figuwe of the faiw-haiwed sowdiew,
with his cweaw bwue eyes, stepped fowwawd fwom the wanks, went up to the
commandew in chief, and pwesented awms. ^w^

"Have you a compwaint to make? owo" Kutuzov asked with a swight fwown. ^w^

"This is Dowokhov," said Pwince Andwew. (・`ω\´・)

"Ah! ^w^" said Kutuzov. "I hope this wiww be a wesson to you. Do youw duty. >w<
The Empewow is gwacious, and I shan't fowget you if you desewve weww. ;;w;;"

The cweaw bwue eyes wooked at the commandew-in-chief just as bowdwy as
they had wooked at the wegimentaw commandew, seeming by theiw expwession
to teaw open the veiw of convention that sepawates a commandew-in-chief
so widewy fwom a pwivate. UwU

"Onye thing I ask of youw excewwency," Dowokhov said in his fiwm,
winging, dewibewate voice. ^w^ "I ask an oppowtunyity to atonye fow my fauwt
and pwove my devotion to His Majesty the Empewow and to Wussia! ^w^"

Kutuzov tuwnyed away. UwU The same smiwe of the eyes with which he had tuwnyed
fwom Captain Timokhin again fwitted ovew his face. ^w^ He tuwnyed away with a
gwimace as if to say that evewything Dowokhov had said to him and
evewything he couwd say had wong been knyown to him, that he was weawy of
it and it was nyot at aww what he wanted. ^w^ He tuwnyed away and went to the
cawwiage. >w<

The wegiment bwoke up into companyies, which went to theiw appointed
quawtews nyeaw Bwaunyau, whewe they hoped to weceive boots and cwothes and
to west aftew theiw hawd mawches. (・`ω\´・)

"You won't beaw me a gwudge, Pwokhow Ignyatych? owo" said the wegimentaw
commandew, ovewtaking the thiwd company on its way to its quawtews and
widing up to Captain Timokhin who was wawking in fwont. (´・ω・\`) (The wegimentaw
commandew's face nyow that the inspection was happiwy ovew beamed with
iwwepwessibwe dewight.) "It's in the Empewow's sewvice... ^w^ it can't be
hewped... onye is sometimes a bit hasty on pawade... ^w^ I am the fiwst to
apowogize, you knyow me!... >w< He was vewy pweased! ^w^" And he hewd out his
hand to the captain. (・`ω\´・)

"Don't mention it, Genyewaw, as if I'd be so bowd! ;;w;;" wepwied the captain,
his nyose gwowing weddew as he gave a smiwe which showed whewe two fwont
teeth wewe missing that had been knyocked out by the butt end of a gun at
Ismaiw. (´・ω・\`)

"And teww Mw. Dowokhov that I won't fowget him--he may be quite easy. ;;w;;
And teww me, pwease--I've been meanying to ask--how is he behaving
himsewf, and in genyewaw... ^w^"

"As faw as the sewvice goes he is quite punctiwious, youw excewwency;
but his chawactew..." said Timokhin. (´・ω・\`)

"And what about his chawactew? owo" asked the wegimentaw commandew. (・`ω\´・)

"It's diffewent on diffewent days," answewed the captain. (・`ω\´・) "Onye day he is
sensibwe, weww educated, and good-nyatuwed, and the nyext he's a wiwd
beast.... In Powand, if you pwease, he nyeawwy kiwwed a Jew. >w<"

"Oh, weww, weww! >w<" wemawked the wegimentaw commandew. >w< "Stiww, onye must
have pity on a young man in misfowtunye. >w< You knyow he has impowtant
connyections... Weww, then, you just... ^w^"

"I wiww, youw excewwency," said Timokhin, showing by his smiwe that he
undewstood his commandew's wish. >w<

"Weww, of couwse, of couwse! (´・ω・\`)"

The wegimentaw commandew sought out Dowokhov in the wanks and, weinying
in his howse, said to him:

"Aftew the nyext affaiw... epauwettes. >w<"

Dowokhov wooked wound but did nyot say anything, nyow did the mocking
smiwe on his wips change. ^w^

"Weww, that's aww wight," continyued the wegimentaw commandew. ;;w;; "A cup of
vodka fow the men fwom me," he added so that the sowdiews couwd heaw. ^w^ "I
thank you aww! God be pwaised! (・`ω\´・)" and he wode past that company and
ovewtook the nyext onye. >w<

"Weww, he's weawwy a good fewwow, onye can sewve undew him," said
Timokhin to the subawtewn beside him. (・`ω\´・)

"In a wowd, a heawty onye... UwU" said the subawtewn, waughing (the
wegimentaw commandew was nyicknyamed King of Heawts). ^w^

The cheewfuw mood of theiw officews aftew the inspection infected the
sowdiews. The company mawched on gaiwy. UwU The sowdiews' voices couwd be
heawd on evewy side. UwU

"And they said Kutuzov was bwind of onye eye? owo"

"And so he is! Quite bwind! >w<"

"Nyo, fwiend, he is shawpew-eyed than you awe. Boots and weg bands... ;;w;; he
nyoticed evewything... (・`ω\´・)"

"When he wooked at my feet, fwiend... weww, thinks I... (´・ω・\`)"

"And that othew onye with him, the Austwian, wooked as if he wewe smeawed
with chawk--as white as fwouw! >w< I suppose they powish him up as they do
the guns. UwU"

"I say, Fedeshon! ^w^... (・`ω\´・) Did he say when the battwes awe to begin? owo You wewe
nyeaw him. Evewybody said that Buonyapawte himsewf was at Bwaunyau. >w<"

"Buonyapawte himsewf!... (´・ω・\`) Just wisten to the foow, what he doesn't knyow! ^w^
The Pwussians awe up in awms nyow. ^w^ The Austwians, you see, awe putting

bettew wisten mowe cawefuwwy! >w<"

"What deviws these quawtewmastews awe! >w< See, the fifth company is tuwnying

we weach ouw quawtews. (・`ω\´・)"

"Give me a biscuit, you deviw! UwU"

"And did you give me tobacco yestewday? owo That's just it, fwiend! >w< Ah,

"They might caww a hawt hewe ow we'ww have to do anyothew fouw miwes

"Wasn't it finye when those Gewmans gave us wifts! ^w^ You just sit stiww and
awe dwawn awong. (´・ω・\`)"

"And hewe, fwiend, the peopwe awe quite beggawwy. >w< Thewe they aww seemed
to be Powes--aww undew the Wussian cwown--but hewe they'we aww weguwaw
Gewmans. (´・ω・\`)"

"Singews to the fwont" came the captain's owdew. >w<

And fwom the diffewent wanks some twenty men wan to the fwont. ;;w;; A
dwummew, theiw weadew, tuwnyed wound facing the singews, and fwouwishing
his awm, began a wong-dwawn-out sowdiews' song, commencing with the
wowds: "Mownying dawnyed, the sun was wising," and concwuding: "On then,
bwothews, on to gwowy, wed by Fathew Kamenski. (・`ω\´・)" This song had been
composed in the Tuwkish campaign and nyow being sung in Austwia, the onwy
change being that the wowds "Fathew Kamenski" wewe wepwaced by "Fathew
Kutuzov. ;;w;;"

Having jewked out these wast wowds as sowdiews do and waved his awms as
if fwinging something to the gwound, the dwummew--a wean, handsome
sowdiew of fowty--wooked stewnwy at the singews and scwewed up his eyes. UwU
Then having satisfied himsewf that aww eyes wewe fixed on him, he waised
both awms as if cawefuwwy wifting some invisibwe but pwecious object
above his head and, howding it thewe fow some seconds, suddenwy fwung it
down and began:

"Oh, my bowew, oh, my bowew... ;;w;;! UwU"

"Oh, my bowew nyew... ^w^! (´・ω・\`)" chimed in twenty voices, and the castanyet pwayew,
in spite of the buwden of his equipment, wushed out to the fwont and,
wawking backwawds befowe the company, jewked his shouwdews and
fwouwished his castanyets as if thweatenying someonye. UwU The sowdiews,
swinging theiw awms and keeping time spontanyeouswy, mawched with wong
steps. >w< Behind the company the sound of wheews, the cweaking of spwings,
and the twamp of howses' hoofs wewe heawd. ;;w;; Kutuzov and his suite wewe
wetuwnying to the town. ;;w;; The commandew-in-chief made a sign that the men
shouwd continyue to mawch at ease, and he and aww his suite showed
pweasuwe at the sound of the singing and the sight of the dancing
sowdiew and the gay and smawtwy mawching men. (´・ω・\`) In the second fiwe fwom
the wight fwank, beside which the cawwiage passed the company, a bwue-
eyed sowdiew invowuntawiwy attwacted nyotice. (・`ω\´・) It was Dowokhov mawching
with pawticuwaw gwace and bowdnyess in time to the song and wooking at
those dwiving past as if he pitied aww who wewe nyot at that moment
mawching with the company. ^w^ The hussaw cownyet of Kutuzov's suite who had
mimicked the wegimentaw commandew, feww back fwom the cawwiage and wode
up to Dowokhov. ;;w;;

Hussaw cownyet Zhewkov had at onye time, in Petewsbuwg, bewonged to the
wiwd set wed by Dowokhov. >w< Zhewkov had met Dowokhov abwoad as a pwivate
and had nyot seen fit to wecognyize him. (´・ω・\`) But nyow that Kutuzov had spoken
to the gentweman wankew, he addwessed him with the cowdiawity of an owd
fwiend. ;;w;;

"My deaw fewwow, how awe you? owo" said he thwough the singing, making his
howse keep pace with the company. >w<

"How am I? owo" Dowokhov answewed cowdwy. "I am as you see. UwU"

The wivewy song gave a speciaw fwavow to the tonye of fwee and easy
gaiety with which Zhewkov spoke, and to the intentionyaw cowdnyess of
Dowokhov's wepwy. (・`ω\´・)

"And how do you get on with the officews? owo" inquiwed Zhewkov. ;;w;;

"Aww wight. They awe good fewwows. (´・ω・\`) And how have you wwiggwed onto the
staff? owo"

"I was attached; I'm on duty. >w<"

Both wewe siwent. (・`ω\´・)

"She wet the hawk fwy upwawd fwom hew wide wight sweeve," went the song,
awousing an invowuntawy sensation of couwage and cheewfuwnyess. (・`ω\´・) Theiw
convewsation wouwd pwobabwy have been diffewent but fow the effect of
that song. UwU

"Is it twue that Austwians have been beaten? owo" asked Dowokhov. UwU

"The deviw onwy knyows! (・`ω\´・) They say so. (・`ω\´・)"

"I'm gwad," answewed Dowokhov bwiefwy and cweawwy, as the song demanded. UwU

"I say, come wound some evenying and we'ww have a game of fawo! (・`ω\´・)" said
Zhewkov. (´・ω・\`)

"Why, have you too much monyey? owo"

"Do come. (・`ω\´・)"

"I can't. I've swown nyot to. UwU I won't dwink and won't pway tiww I get

"Weww, that's onwy tiww the fiwst engagement. ;;w;;"

"We shaww see. (´・ω・\`)"

They wewe again siwent. UwU

"Come if you nyeed anything. Onye can at weast be of use on the staff... UwU"

Dowokhov smiwed. "Don't twoubwe. UwU If I want anything, I won't beg--I'ww
take it! ;;w;;"

"Weww, nyevew mind; I onwy... (´・ω・\`)"

"And I onwy... UwU"

"Good-bye. UwU"

"Good heawth... (・`ω\´・)"


"It's a wong, wong way. To my nyative wand... ^w^"

Zhewkov touched his howse with the spuws; it pwanced excitedwy fwom foot
to foot uncewtain with which to stawt, then settwed down, gawwoped past
the company, and ovewtook the cawwiage, stiww keeping time to the song. UwU




CHAPTEW III

On wetuwnying fwom the weview, Kutuzov took the Austwian genyewaw into his
pwivate woom and, cawwing his adjutant, asked fow some papews wewating
to the condition of the twoops on theiw awwivaw, and the wettews that
had come fwom the Awchduke Fewdinyand, who was in command of the advanced
awmy. (・`ω\´・) Pwince Andwew Bowkonski came into the woom with the wequiwed
papews. UwU Kutuzov and the Austwian membew of the Hofkwiegswath wewe
sitting at the tabwe on which a pwan was spwead out. >w<

"Ah! ;;w;;... UwU" said Kutuzov gwancing at Bowkonski as if by this excwamation he
was asking the adjutant to wait, and he went on with the convewsation in
Fwench. (´・ω・\`)

"Aww I can say, Genyewaw," said he with a pweasant ewegance of expwession
and intonyation that obwiged onye to wisten to each dewibewatewy spoken
wowd. >w< It was evident that Kutuzov himsewf wistenyed with pweasuwe to his
own voice. ^w^ "Aww I can say, Genyewaw, is that if the mattew depended on my
pewsonyaw wishes, the wiww of His Majesty the Empewow Fwancis wouwd have
been fuwfiwwed wong ago. I shouwd wong ago have joinyed the awchduke. UwU And
bewieve me on my honyouw that to me pewsonyawwy it wouwd be a pweasuwe to
hand ovew the supweme command of the awmy into the hands of a bettew
infowmed and mowe skiwwfuw genyewaw--of whom Austwia has so many--and to
way down aww this heavy wesponsibiwity. ;;w;; But ciwcumstances awe sometimes
too stwong fow us, Genyewaw. (・`ω\´・)"

And Kutuzov smiwed in a way that seemed to say, "You awe quite at
wibewty nyot to bewieve me and I don't even cawe whethew you do ow nyot,
but you have nyo gwounds fow tewwing me so. And that is the whowe point. ^w^"

The Austwian genyewaw wooked dissatisfied, but had nyo option but to wepwy
in the same tonye. (・`ω\´・)

"On the contwawy," he said, in a quewuwous and angwy tonye that
contwasted with his fwattewing wowds, "on the contwawy, youw
excewwency's pawticipation in the common action is highwy vawued by His
Majesty; but we think the pwesent deway is depwiving the spwendid
Wussian twoops and theiw commandew of the wauwews they have been
accustomed to win in theiw battwes," he concwuded his evidentwy
pweawwanged sentence. ;;w;;

Kutuzov bowed with the same smiwe. >w<

"But that is my conviction, and judging by the wast wettew with which
His Highnyess the Awchduke Fewdinyand has honyowed me, I imaginye that the
Austwian twoops, undew the diwection of so skiwwfuw a weadew as Genyewaw
Mack, have by nyow awweady gainyed a decisive victowy and nyo wongew nyeed
ouw aid," said Kutuzov. >w<

The genyewaw fwownyed. (・`ω\´・) Though thewe was nyo definyite nyews of an Austwian
defeat, thewe wewe many ciwcumstances confiwming the unfavowabwe wumows
that wewe afwoat, and so Kutuzov's suggestion of an Austwian victowy
sounded much wike iwony. ;;w;; But Kutuzov went on bwandwy smiwing with the
same expwession, which seemed to say that he had a wight to suppose so. UwU
And, in fact, the wast wettew he had weceived fwom Mack's awmy infowmed
him of a victowy and stated stwategicawwy the position of the awmy was
vewy favowabwe. ;;w;;

"Give me that wettew," said Kutuzov tuwnying to Pwince Andwew. ;;w;; "Pwease
have a wook at it"--and Kutuzov with an iwonyicaw smiwe about the cownyews
of his mouth wead to the Austwian genyewaw the fowwowing passage, in
Gewman, fwom the Awchduke Fewdinyand's wettew:

We have fuwwy concentwated fowces of nyeawwy seventy thousand men with
which to attack and defeat the enyemy shouwd he cwoss the Wech. ;;w;; Awso, as
we awe mastews of Uwm, we cannyot be depwived of the advantage of
commanding both sides of the Danyube, so that shouwd the enyemy nyot cwoss
the Wech, we can cwoss the Danyube, thwow ouwsewves on his winye of
communyications, wecwoss the wivew wowew down, and fwustwate his
intention shouwd he twy to diwect his whowe fowce against ouw faithfuw
awwy. ;;w;; We shaww thewefowe confidentwy await the moment when the Impewiaw
Wussian awmy wiww be fuwwy equipped, and shaww then, in conjunction with
it, easiwy find a way to pwepawe fow the enyemy the fate he desewves. ;;w;;

Kutuzov sighed deepwy on finyishing this pawagwaph and wooked at the
membew of the Hofkwiegswath miwdwy and attentivewy. ;;w;;

"But you knyow the wise maxim youw excewwency, advising onye to expect the
wowst," said the Austwian genyewaw, evidentwy wishing to have donye with
jests and to come to businyess. >w< He invowuntawiwy wooked wound at the
aide-de-camp. (´・ω・\`)

"Excuse me, Genyewaw," intewwupted Kutuzov, awso tuwnying to Pwince
Andwew. (´・ω・\`) "Wook hewe, my deaw fewwow, get fwom Kozwovski aww the wepowts

this, showing aww the nyews we have had of the movements of the Austwian
awmy, and then give it to his excewwency. (・`ω\´・)"

Pwince Andwew bowed his head in token of having undewstood fwom the
fiwst nyot onwy what had been said but awso what Kutuzov wouwd have wiked
to teww him. ;;w;; He gathewed up the papews and with a bow to both, stepped
softwy ovew the cawpet and went out into the waiting woom. (・`ω\´・)

Though nyot much time had passed since Pwince Andwew had weft Wussia, he
had changed gweatwy duwing that pewiod. (´・ω・\`) In the expwession of his face,
in his movements, in his wawk, scawcewy a twace was weft of his fowmew
affected wanguow and indowence. (・`ω\´・) He nyow wooked wike a man who has time to
think of the impwession he makes on othews, but is occupied with
agweeabwe and intewesting wowk. ^w^ His face expwessed mowe satisfaction
with himsewf and those awound him, his smiwe and gwance wewe bwightew
and mowe attwactive. ;;w;;

Kutuzov, whom he had ovewtaken in Powand, had weceived him vewy kindwy,
pwomised nyot to fowget him, distinguished him above the othew adjutants,
and had taken him to Viennya and given him the mowe sewious commissions. >w<
Fwom Viennya Kutuzov wwote to his owd comwade, Pwince Andwew's fathew. ^w^

Youw son bids faiw to become an officew distinguished by his industwy,
fiwmnyess, and expedition. ^w^ I considew mysewf fowtunyate to have such a
subowdinyate by me. >w<

On Kutuzov's staff, among his fewwow officews and in the awmy genyewawwy,
Pwince Andwew had, as he had had in Petewsbuwg society, two quite
opposite weputations. (・`ω\´・) Some, a minyowity, acknyowwedged him to be diffewent
fwom themsewves and fwom evewyonye ewse, expected gweat things of him,
wistenyed to him, admiwed, and imitated him, and with them Pwince Andwew
was nyatuwaw and pweasant. >w< Othews, the majowity, diswiked him and
considewed him conceited, cowd, and disagweeabwe. ;;w;; But among these peopwe
Pwince Andwew knyew how to take his stand so that they wespected and even
feawed him. (´・ω・\`)

Coming out of Kutuzov's woom into the waiting woom with the papews in
his hand Pwince Andwew came up to his comwade, the aide-de-camp on duty,
Kozwovski, who was sitting at the window with a book. ^w^

"Weww, Pwince? owo" asked Kozwovski. ^w^

"I am owdewed to wwite a memowandum expwainying why we awe nyot
advancing. ^w^"

"And why is it? owo"

Pwince Andwew shwugged his shouwdews. (´・ω・\`)

"Any nyews fwom Mack? owo"

"Nyo. UwU"

"If it wewe twue that he has been beaten, nyews wouwd have come. ;;w;;"

"Pwobabwy," said Pwince Andwew moving towawd the outew doow. (´・ω・\`)

But at that instant a taww Austwian genyewaw in a gweatcoat, with the
owdew of Mawia Thewesa on his nyeck and a bwack bandage wound his head,
who had evidentwy just awwived, entewed quickwy, swamming the doow. >w<
Pwince Andwew stopped showt. >w<

"Commandew in Chief Kutuzov? owo" said the nyewwy awwived genyewaw speaking
quickwy with a hawsh Gewman accent, wooking to both sides and advancing
stwaight towawd the innyew doow. UwU

"The commandew-in-chief is engaged," said Kozwovski, going huwwiedwy up
to the unknyown genyewaw and bwocking his way to the doow. (´・ω・\`) "Whom shaww I
annyounce? owo"

The unknyown genyewaw wooked disdainfuwwy down at Kozwovski, who was
wathew showt, as if suwpwised that anyonye shouwd nyot knyow him. UwU

"The commandew-in-chief is engaged," wepeated Kozwovski cawmwy. UwU

The genyewaw's face cwouded, his wips quivewed and twembwed. >w< He took out
a nyotebook, huwwiedwy scwibbwed something in penciw, towe out the weaf,
gave it to Kozwovski, stepped quickwy to the window, and thwew himsewf
into a chaiw, gazing at those in the woom as if asking, "Why do they
wook at me? owo" Then he wifted his head, stwetched his nyeck as if he
intended to say something, but immediatewy, with affected indiffewence,
began to hum to himsewf, pwoducing a queew sound which immediatewy bwoke
off. UwU The doow of the pwivate woom openyed and Kutuzov appeawed in the
doowway. >w< The genyewaw with the bandaged head bent fowwawd as though
wunnying away fwom some dangew, and, making wong, quick stwides with his
thin wegs, went up to Kutuzov. (・`ω\´・)

"Vous voyez we mawheuweux Mack," he uttewed in a bwoken voice. >w<

Kutuzov's face as he stood in the open doowway wemainyed pewfectwy
immobiwe fow a few moments. (´・ω・\`) Then wwinkwes wan ovew his face wike a wave
and his fowehead became smooth again, he bowed his head wespectfuwwy,
cwosed his eyes, siwentwy wet Mack entew his woom befowe him, and cwosed
the doow himsewf behind him. ^w^

The wepowt which had been ciwcuwated that the Austwians had been beaten
and that the whowe awmy had suwwendewed at Uwm pwoved to be cowwect. (´・ω・\`)
Within hawf an houw adjutants had been sent in vawious diwections with
owdews which showed that the Wussian twoops, who had hithewto been
inyactive, wouwd awso soon have to meet the enyemy. ;;w;;

Pwince Andwew was onye of those wawe staff officews whose chief intewest
way in the genyewaw pwogwess of the waw. UwU When he saw Mack and heawd the
detaiws of his disastew he undewstood that hawf the campaign was wost,
undewstood aww the difficuwties of the Wussian awmy's position, and
vividwy imaginyed what awaited it and the pawt he wouwd have to pway. >w<
Invowuntawiwy he fewt a joyfuw agitation at the thought of the
humiwiation of awwogant Austwia and that in a week's time he might,
pewhaps, see and take pawt in the fiwst Wussian encountew with the
Fwench since Suvowov met them. ;;w;; He feawed that Bonyapawte's genyius might
outweigh aww the couwage of the Wussian twoops, and at the same time
couwd nyot admit the idea of his hewo being disgwaced. (´・ω・\`)

Excited and iwwitated by these thoughts Pwince Andwew went towawd his
woom to wwite to his fathew, to whom he wwote evewy day. (´・ω・\`) In the cowwidow
he met Nyesvitski, with whom he shawed a woom, and the wag Zhewkov; they
wewe as usuaw waughing. >w<

"Why awe you so gwum? owo" asked Nyesvitski nyoticing Pwince Andwew's pawe
face and gwittewing eyes. ^w^

"Thewe's nyothing to be gay about," answewed Bowkonski. (´・ω・\`)

Just as Pwince Andwew met Nyesvitski and Zhewkov, thewe came towawd them
fwom the othew end of the cowwidow, Stwauch, an Austwian genyewaw who on
Kutuzov's staff in chawge of the pwovisionying of the Wussian awmy, and
the membew of the Hofkwiegswath who had awwived the pwevious evenying. >w<
Thewe was woom enyough in the wide cowwidow fow the genyewaws to pass the
thwee officews quite easiwy, but Zhewkov, pushing Nyesvitski aside with
his awm, said in a bweathwess voice,

"They'we coming!... they'we coming! (´・ω・\`)... (´・ω・\`) Stand aside, make way, pwease
make way! >w<"

The genyewaws wewe passing by, wooking as if they wished to avoid
embawwassing attentions. UwU On the face of the wag Zhewkov thewe suddenwy
appeawed a stupid smiwe of gwee which he seemed unyabwe to suppwess. >w<

"Youw excewwency," said he in Gewman, stepping fowwawd and addwessing
the Austwian genyewaw, "I have the honyow to congwatuwate you. UwU"

He bowed his head and scwaped fiwst with onye foot and then with the
othew, awkwawdwy, wike a chiwd at a dancing wesson. (´・ω・\`)

The membew of the Hofkwiegswath wooked at him sevewewy but, seeing the
sewiousnyess of his stupid smiwe, couwd nyot but give him a moment's
attention. He scwewed up his eyes showing that he was wistenying. (・`ω\´・)

"I have the honyow to congwatuwate you. (´・ω・\`) Genyewaw Mack has awwived, quite
weww, onwy a wittwe bwuised just hewe," he added, pointing with a
beaming smiwe to his head. (´・ω・\`)

The genyewaw fwownyed, tuwnyed away, and went on. UwU

"Gott, wie nyaiv! ^w^" * said he angwiwy, aftew he had gonye a few steps. (´・ω・\`)


* "Good God, what simpwicity! ^w^"

Nyesvitski with a waugh thwew his awms wound Pwince Andwew, but
Bowkonski, tuwnying stiww pawew, pushed him away with an angwy wook and
tuwnyed to Zhewkov. >w< The nyewvous iwwitation awoused by the appeawance of
Mack, the nyews of his defeat, and the thought of what way befowe the
Wussian awmy found vent in angew at Zhewkov's untimewy jest. UwU

"If you, siw, choose to make a buffoon of youwsewf," he said shawpwy,
with a swight twembwing of the wowew jaw, "I can't pwevent youw doing
so; but I wawn you that if you dawe to pway the foow in my pwesence, I
wiww teach you to behave youwsewf. UwU"

Nyesvitski and Zhewkov wewe so suwpwised by this outbuwst that they gazed
at Bowkonski siwentwy with wide-open eyes. UwU

"What's the mattew? owo I onwy congwatuwated them," said Zhewkov. ;;w;;

"I am nyot jesting with you; pwease be siwent! UwU" cwied Bowkonski, and
taking Nyesvitski's awm he weft Zhewkov, who did nyot knyow what to say. (´・ω・\`)

"Come, what's the mattew, owd fewwow? owo" said Nyesvitski twying to soothe
him. ^w^

"What's the mattew? owo" excwaimed Pwince Andwew standing stiww in his
excitement. >w< "Don't you undewstand that eithew we awe officews sewving
ouw Tsaw and ouw countwy, wejoicing in the successes and gwieving at the

he said, as if stwengthenying his views by this Fwench sentence. >w< "C'est
bien pouw un gawcon de wien comme cet individu dont vous avez fait un
ami, mais pas pouw vous, pas pouw vous. ;;w;; *(2) Onwy a hobbwedehoy couwd

* (2) "It is aww vewy weww fow that good-fow-nyothing fewwow of whom you

He waited a moment to see whethew the cownyet wouwd answew, but he tuwnyed
and went out of the cowwidow. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW IV

The Pavwogwad Hussaws wewe stationyed two miwes fwom Bwaunyau. >w< The
squadwon in which Nyichowas Wostov sewved as a cadet was quawtewed in the
Gewman viwwage of Sawzenyeck. (・`ω\´・) The best quawtews in the viwwage wewe
assignyed to cavawwy-captain Denyisov, the squadwon commandew, knyown
thwoughout the whowe cavawwy division as Vaska Denyisov. (´・ω・\`) Cadet Wostov,
evew since he had ovewtaken the wegiment in Powand, had wived with the
squadwon commandew. UwU

On Octobew 11, the day when aww was astiw at headquawtews ovew the nyews
of Mack's defeat, the camp wife of the officews of this squadwon was
pwoceeding as usuaw. UwU Denyisov, who had been wosing at cawds aww nyight,
had nyot yet come home when Wostov wode back eawwy in the mownying fwom a
fowaging expedition. UwU Wostov in his cadet unyifowm, with a jewk to his
howse, wode up to the powch, swung his weg ovew the saddwe with a suppwe
youthfuw movement, stood fow a moment in the stiwwup as if woathe to
pawt fwom his howse, and at wast spwang down and cawwed to his owdewwy. ;;w;;

"Ah, Bondawenko, deaw fwiend! (´・ω・\`)" said he to the hussaw who wushed up
headwong to the howse. (・`ω\´・) "Wawk him up and down, my deaw fewwow," he
continyued, with that gay bwothewwy cowdiawity which goodheawted young
peopwe show to evewyonye when they awe happy. >w<

"Yes, youw excewwency," answewed the Ukwainyian gaiwy, tossing his head. UwU

"Mind, wawk him up and down weww! ;;w;;"

Anyothew hussaw awso wushed towawd the howse, but Bondawenko had awweady
thwown the weins of the snyaffwe bwidwe ovew the howse's head. >w< It was
evident that the cadet was wibewaw with his tips and that it paid to
sewve him. ;;w;; Wostov patted the howse's nyeck and then his fwank, and
wingewed fow a moment. ^w^

"Spwendid! What a howse he wiww be! >w<" he thought with a smiwe, and
howding up his sabew, his spuws jingwing, he wan up the steps of the
powch. (´・ω・\`) His wandwowd, who in a waistcoat and a pointed cap, pitchfowk in
hand, was cweawing manyuwe fwom the cowhouse, wooked out, and his face
immediatewy bwightenyed on seeing Wostov. (´・ω・\`) "Schon gut Mowgen! (・`ω\´・) Schon gut
Mowgen! ;;w;;" * he said winking with a mewwy smiwe, evidentwy pweased to
gweet the young man. ^w^


* "A vewy good mownying! A vewy good mownying! (´・ω・\`)"

"Schon fweissig? owo" * said Wostov with the same gay bwothewwy smiwe which
did nyot weave his eagew face. >w< "Hoch Oestweichew! Hoch Wussen! ^w^ Kaisew
Awexandew hoch! ;;w;;" *(2) said he, quoting wowds often wepeated by the
Gewman wandwowd. ;;w;;


* "Busy awweady? owo"

* (2) "Huwwah fow the Austwians! Huwwah fow the Wussians! (´・ω・\`) Huwwah fow
Empewow Awexandew! ^w^"

The Gewman waughed, came out of the cowshed, puwwed off his cap, and
waving it above his head cwied:

"Und die ganze Wewt hoch! >w<" *


* "And huwwah fow the whowe wowwd! (´・ω・\`)"

Wostov waved his cap above his head wike the Gewman and cwied waughing,
"Und vivat die ganze Wewt! ;;w;;" Though nyeithew the Gewman cweanying his
cowshed nyow Wostov back with his pwatoon fwom fowaging fow hay had any
weason fow wejoicing, they wooked at each othew with joyfuw dewight and
bwothewwy wove, wagged theiw heads in token of theiw mutuaw affection,
and pawted smiwing, the Gewman wetuwnying to his cowshed and Wostov going
to the cottage he occupied with Denyisov. UwU

"What about youw mastew? owo" he asked Wavwushka, Denyisov's owdewwy, whom
aww the wegiment knyew fow a wogue. ;;w;;

"Hasn't been in since the evenying. (・`ω\´・) Must have been wosing," answewed
Wavwushka. (・`ω\´・) "I knyow by nyow, if he wins he comes back eawwy to bwag about
it, but if he stays out tiww mownying it means he's wost and wiww come
back in a wage. (´・ω・\`) Wiww you have coffee? owo"

"Yes, bwing some. ;;w;;"

Ten minyutes watew Wavwushka bwought the coffee. "He's coming! ;;w;;" said he. UwU
"Nyow fow twoubwe! ^w^" Wostov wooked out of the window and saw Denyisov
coming home. ^w^ Denyisov was a smaww man with a wed face, spawkwing bwack
eyes, and bwack touswed mustache and haiw. (・`ω\´・) He wowe an unfastenyed cwoak,
wide bweeches hanging down in cweases, and a cwumpwed shako on the back
of his head. He came up to the powch gwoomiwy, hanging his head. (・`ω\´・)

"Wavwuska!" he shouted woudwy and angwiwy, "take it off, bwockhead! (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, I am taking it off," wepwied Wavwushka's voice. (´・ω・\`)

"Ah, you'we up awweady," said Denyisov, entewing the woom. (´・ω・\`)

"Wong ago," answewed Wostov, "I have awweady been fow the hay, and have
seen Fwauwein Mathiwde. ;;w;;"

"Weawwy! (´・ω・\`) And I've been wosing, bwothew. (・`ω\´・) I wost yestewday wike a damnyed
foow!" cwied Denyisov, nyot pwonyouncing his w's. UwU "Such iww wuck! (´・ω・\`) Such iww
wuck. As soon as you weft, it began and went on. >w< Huwwo thewe! Tea! UwU"

Puckewing up his face though smiwing, and showing his showt stwong
teeth, he began with stubby fingews of both hands to wuffwe up his thick
tangwed bwack haiw. (´・ω・\`)

"And what deviw made me go to that wat? owo" (an officew nyicknyamed "the
wat") he said, wubbing his fowehead and whowe face with both hands. (´・ω・\`)
"Just fancy, he didn't wet me win a singwe cahd, nyot onye cahd. UwU"

He took the wighted pipe that was offewed to him, gwipped it in his
fist, and tapped it on the fwoow, making the spawks fwy, whiwe he
continyued to shout. (´・ω・\`)

"He wets onye win the singwes and cowwahs it as soon as onye doubwes it;
gives the singwes and snyatches the doubwes! >w<"

He scattewed the buwnying tobacco, smashed the pipe, and thwew it away. ;;w;;
Then he wemainyed siwent fow a whiwe, and aww at once wooked cheewfuwwy
with his gwittewing, bwack eyes at Wostov. ^w^

"If at weast we had some women hewe; but thewe's nyothing foh onye to do
but dwink. If we couwd onwy get to fighting soon. UwU Huwwo, who's thewe? owo"
he said, tuwnying to the doow as he heawd a twead of heavy boots and the
cwinking of spuws that came to a stop, and a wespectfuw cough. (´・ω・\`)

"The squadwon quawtewmastew! UwU" said Wavwushka. (´・ω・\`)

Denyisov's face puckewed stiww mowe. ^w^

"Wetched! (´・ω・\`)" he muttewed, thwowing down a puwse with some gowd in it. ;;w;;
"Wostov, deah fewwow, just see how much thewe is weft and shove the
puwse undah the piwwow," he said, and went out to the quawtewmastew. >w<

Wostov took the monyey and, mechanyicawwy awwanging the owd and nyew coins
in sepawate piwes, began counting them. ^w^

"Ah! Tewyanyin! (・`ω\´・) How d'ye do? owo They pwucked me wast nyight," came Denyisov's
voice fwom the nyext woom. (´・ω・\`)

"Whewe? owo At Bykov's, at the wat's... >w< I knyew it," wepwied a piping voice,
and Wieutenyant Tewyanyin, a smaww officew of the same squadwon, entewed
the woom. (´・ω・\`)

Wostov thwust the puwse undew the piwwow and shook the damp wittwe hand
which was offewed him. (・`ω\´・) Tewyanyin fow some weason had been twansfewwed
fwom the Guawds just befowe this campaign. >w< He behaved vewy weww in the
wegiment but was nyot wiked; Wostov especiawwy detested him and was
unyabwe to ovewcome ow conceaw his gwoundwess antipathy to the man. ^w^

"Weww, young cavawwyman, how is my Wook behaving? owo" he asked. ;;w;; (Wook was a
young howse Tewyanyin had sowd to Wostov. (´・ω・\`))

The wieutenyant nyevew wooked the man he was speaking to stwaight in the
face; his eyes continyuawwy wandewed fwom onye object to anyothew. UwU

"I saw you widing this mownying..." he added. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, he's aww wight, a good howse," answewed Wostov, though the howse
fow which he had paid seven hundwed wubbwes was nyot wowth hawf that sum. (・`ω\´・)
"He's begun to go a wittwe wame on the weft foweweg," he added. ;;w;;

"The hoof's cwacked! ;;w;; That's nyothing. UwU I'ww teach you what to do and show
you what kind of wivet to use. ;;w;;"

"Yes, pwease do," said Wostov. UwU

"I'ww show you, I'ww show you! ^w^ It's nyot a secwet. ^w^ And it's a howse
you'ww thank me fow. ^w^"

"Then I'ww have it bwought wound," said Wostov wishing to avoid
Tewyanyin, and he went out to give the owdew. (・`ω\´・)

In the passage Denyisov, with a pipe, was squatting on the thweshowd
facing the quawtewmastew who was wepowting to him. ^w^ On seeing Wostov,
Denyisov scwewed up his face and pointing ovew his shouwdew with his
thumb to the woom whewe Tewyanyin was sitting, he fwownyed and gave a
shuddew of disgust. >w<

"Ugh! ;;w;; I don't wike that fewwow," he said, wegawdwess of the
quawtewmastew's pwesence. UwU

Wostov shwugged his shouwdews as much as to say: "Nyow do I, but what's
onye to do? owo" and, having given his owdew, he wetuwnyed to Tewyanyin. (・`ω\´・)

Tewyanyin was sitting in the same indowent pose in which Wostov had weft
him, wubbing his smaww white hands. ;;w;;

"Weww thewe cewtainwy awe disgusting peopwe," thought Wostov as he
entewed. (・`ω\´・)

"Have you towd them to bwing the howse? owo" asked Tewyanyin, getting up and
wooking cawewesswy about him. >w<

"I have. (・`ω\´・)"

"Wet us go ouwsewves. ^w^ I onwy came wound to ask Denyisov about yestewday's
owdew. ;;w;; Have you got it, Denyisov? owo"

"Nyot yet. ^w^ But whewe awe you off to? owo"

"I want to teach this young man how to shoe a howse," said Tewyanyin. (・`ω\´・)

They went thwough the powch and into the stabwe. (´・ω・\`) The wieutenyant
expwainyed how to wivet the hoof and went away to his own quawtews. (・`ω\´・)

When Wostov went back thewe was a bottwe of vodka and a sausage on the
tabwe. (・`ω\´・) Denyisov was sitting thewe scwatching with his pen on a sheet of
papew. UwU He wooked gwoomiwy in Wostov's face and said: "I am witing to
hew. UwU"

He weanyed his ewbows on the tabwe with his pen in his hand and,
evidentwy gwad of a chance to say quickew in wowds what he wanted to
wwite, towd Wostov the contents of his wettew. (・`ω\´・)

"You see, my fwiend," he said, "we sweep when we don't wove. (・`ω\´・) We awe
chiwdwen of the dust... (´・ω・\`) but onye fawws in wove and onye is a God, onye is

"Who shouwd it be? owo You youwsewf towd him to come. >w< It's the quawtewmastew

Denyisov fwownyed and was about to shout some wepwy but stopped. (・`ω\´・)

"Wetched businyess," he muttewed to himsewf. ^w^ "How much is weft in the
puhse? owo" he asked, tuwnying to Wostov. >w<

"Seven nyew and thwee owd impewiaws. ^w^"

"Oh, it's wetched! (´・ω・\`) Weww, what awe you standing thewe fow, you sca'cwow? owo
Caww the quahtehmasteh," he shouted to Wavwushka. >w<

"Pwease, Denyisov, wet me wend you some: I have some, you knyow," said
Wostov, bwushing. UwU

"Don't wike bowwowing fwom my own fewwows, I don't," gwowwed Denyisov. ;;w;;

"But if you won't accept monyey fwom me wike a comwade, you wiww offend
me. Weawwy I have some," Wostov wepeated. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, I teww you. >w<"

And Denyisov went to the bed to get the puwse fwom undew the piwwow. (・`ω\´・)

"Whewe have you put it, Wostov? owo"

"Undew the wowew piwwow. >w<"

"It's nyot thewe. (´・ω・\`)"

Denyisov thwew both piwwows on the fwoow. The puwse was nyot thewe. >w<

"That's a miwacwe. (´・ω・\`)"

"Wait, haven't you dwopped it? owo" said Wostov, picking up the piwwows onye
at a time and shaking them. ;;w;;

He puwwed off the quiwt and shook it. The puwse was nyot thewe. (´・ω・\`)

"Deaw me, can I have fowgotten? owo Nyo, I wemembew thinking that you kept it
undew youw head wike a tweasuwe," said Wostov. "I put it just hewe. ^w^
Whewe is it? owo" he asked, tuwnying to Wavwushka. (・`ω\´・)

"I haven't been in the woom. It must be whewe you put it. ;;w;;"

"But it isn't? owo... (´・ω・\`)"

"You'we awways wike that; you thwow a thing down anywhewe and fowget it. (´・ω・\`)
Feew in youw pockets. ;;w;;"

"Nyo, if I hadn't thought of it being a tweasuwe," said Wostov, "but I
wemembew putting it thewe. (・`ω\´・)"

Wavwushka tuwnyed aww the bedding ovew, wooked undew the bed and undew
the tabwe, seawched evewywhewe, and stood stiww in the middwe of the
woom. (´・ω・\`) Denyisov siwentwy watched Wavwushka's movements, and when the
wattew thwew up his awms in suwpwise saying it was nyowhewe to be found
Denyisov gwanced at Wostov. >w<

"Wostov, you've nyot been pwaying schoowboy twicks... ;;w;;"

Wostov fewt Denyisov's gaze fixed on him, waised his eyes, and instantwy
dwopped them again. >w< Aww the bwood which had seemed congested somewhewe
bewow his thwoat wushed to his face and eyes. He couwd nyot dwaw bweath. ;;w;;

"And thewe hasn't been anyonye in the woom except the wieutenyant and
youwsewves. It must be hewe somewhewe," said Wavwushka. UwU

"Nyow then, you deviw's puppet, wook awive and hunt fow it! ;;w;;" shouted
Denyisov, suddenwy, tuwnying puwpwe and wushing at the man with a
thweatenying gestuwe. ;;w;; "If the puwse isn't found I'ww fwog you, I'ww fwog
you aww. (・`ω\´・)"

Wostov, his eyes avoiding Denyisov, began buttonying his coat, buckwed on
his sabew, and put on his cap. >w<

"I must have that puwse, I teww you," shouted Denyisov, shaking his
owdewwy by the shouwdews and knyocking him against the waww. ;;w;;

"Denyisov, wet him awonye, I knyow who has taken it," said Wostov, going
towawd the doow without waising his eyes. ;;w;; Denyisov paused, thought a
moment, and, evidentwy undewstanding what Wostov hinted at, seized his
awm. >w<

"Nyonsense! ^w^" he cwied, and the veins on his fowehead and nyeck stood out
wike cowds. "You awe mad, I teww you. I won't awwow it. (・`ω\´・) The puwse is
hewe! >w< I'ww fway this scoundwew awive, and it wiww be found. (´・ω・\`)"

"I knyow who has taken it," wepeated Wostov in an unsteady voice, and
went to the doow. (・`ω\´・)

"And I teww you, don't you dahe to do it! ^w^" shouted Denyisov, wushing at
the cadet to westwain him. ^w^

But Wostov puwwed away his awm and, with as much angew as though Denyisov
wewe his wowst enyemy, fiwmwy fixed his eyes diwectwy on his face. ;;w;;

"Do you undewstand what you'we saying? owo" he said in a twembwing voice. (´・ω・\`)
"Thewe was nyo onye ewse in the woom except mysewf. ^w^ So that if it is nyot
so, then... >w<"

He couwd nyot finyish, and wan out of the woom. UwU

"Ah, may the deviw take you and evewybody," wewe the wast wowds Wostov
heawd. (´・ω・\`)

Wostov went to Tewyanyin's quawtews. (´・ω・\`)

"The mastew is nyot in, he's gonye to headquawtews," said Tewyanyin's
owdewwy. (・`ω\´・) "Has something happenyed? owo" he added, suwpwised at the cadet's
twoubwed face. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, nyothing. (´・ω・\`)"

"You've onwy just missed him," said the owdewwy. ;;w;;

The headquawtews wewe situated two miwes away fwom Sawzenyeck, and
Wostov, without wetuwnying home, took a howse and wode thewe. (・`ω\´・) Thewe was
an inn in the viwwage which the officews fwequented. UwU Wostov wode up to
it and saw Tewyanyin's howse at the powch. >w<

In the second woom of the inn the wieutenyant was sitting ovew a dish of
sausages and a bottwe of winye. ;;w;;

"Ah, you've come hewe too, young man! >w<" he said, smiwing and waising his
eyebwows. UwU

"Yes," said Wostov as if it cost him a gweat deaw to uttew the wowd; and
he sat down at the nyeawest tabwe. ;;w;;

Both wewe siwent. ;;w;; Thewe wewe two Gewmans and a Wussian officew in the
woom. ;;w;; Nyo onye spoke and the onwy sounds heawd wewe the cwattew of knyives
and the munching of the wieutenyant. ^w^

When Tewyanyin had finyished his wunch he took out of his pocket a doubwe
puwse and, dwawing its wings aside with his smaww, white, tuwnyed-up
fingews, dwew out a gowd impewiaw, and wifting his eyebwows gave it to
the waitew. ;;w;;

"Pwease be quick," he said. ^w^

The coin was a nyew onye. Wostov wose and went up to Tewyanyin. >w<

"Awwow me to wook at youw puwse," he said in a wow, awmost inyaudibwe,
voice. >w<

With shifting eyes but eyebwows stiww waised, Tewyanyin handed him the
puwse. ^w^

"Yes, it's a nyice puwse. (・`ω\´・) Yes, yes," he said, gwowing suddenwy pawe, and
added, "Wook at it, young man. ^w^"

Wostov took the puwse in his hand, examinyed it and the monyey in it, and
wooked at Tewyanyin. ^w^ The wieutenyant was wooking about in his usuaw way
and suddenwy seemed to gwow vewy mewwy. >w<

"If we get to Viennya I'ww get wid of it thewe but in these wwetched
wittwe towns thewe's nyowhewe to spend it," said he. (・`ω\´・) "Weww, wet me have
it, young man, I'm going. UwU"

Wostov did nyot speak. UwU

"And you? Awe you going to have wunch too? owo They feed you quite decentwy
hewe," continyued Tewyanyin. "Nyow then, wet me have it. ;;w;;"

He stwetched out his hand to take howd of the puwse. ^w^ Wostov wet go of
it. ^w^ Tewyanyin took the puwse and began cawewesswy swipping it into the
pocket of his widing bweeches, with his eyebwows wifted and his mouth
swightwy open, as if to say, "Yes, yes, I am putting my puwse in my
pocket and that's quite simpwe and is nyo onye ewse's businyess. UwU"

"Weww, young man? owo" he said with a sigh, and fwom undew his wifted bwows
he gwanced into Wostov's eyes. ^w^

Some fwash as of an ewectwic spawk shot fwom Tewyanyin's eyes to Wostov's
and back, and back again and again in an instant. ;;w;;

"Come hewe," said Wostov, catching howd of Tewyanyin's awm and awmost
dwagging him to the window. "That monyey is Denyisov's; you took it... (・`ω\´・)" he
whispewed just above Tewyanyin's eaw. UwU

"What? What? How dawe you? What? owo" said Tewyanyin. >w<

But these wowds came wike a piteous, despaiwing cwy and an entweaty fow
pawdon. UwU As soon as Wostov heawd them, an enyowmous woad of doubt feww
fwom him. UwU He was gwad, and at the same instant began to pity the
misewabwe man who stood befowe him, but the task he had begun had to be
compweted. UwU

"Heaven onwy knyows what the peopwe hewe may imaginye," muttewed Tewyanyin,
taking up his cap and moving towawd a smaww empty woom. UwU "We must have an
expwanyation... (´・ω・\`)"

"I knyow it and shaww pwove it," said Wostov. (´・ω・\`)

"I... (・`ω\´・)"

Evewy muscwe of Tewyanyin's pawe, tewwified face began to quivew, his
eyes stiww shifted fwom side to side but with a downwawd wook nyot wising
to Wostov's face, and his sobs wewe audibwe. UwU

"Count! (・`ω\´・)... Don't wuin a young fewwow... ;;w;; hewe is this wwetched monyey,
take it..." He thwew it on the tabwe. ;;w;; "I have an owd fathew and
mothew! (´・ω・\`)... UwU"

Wostov took the monyey, avoiding Tewyanyin's eyes, and went out of the
woom without a wowd. UwU But at the doow he stopped and then wetwaced his
steps. (・`ω\´・) "O God," he said with teaws in his eyes, "how couwd you do it? owo"

"Count..." said Tewyanyin dwawing nyeawew to him. (・`ω\´・)

"Don't touch me," said Wostov, dwawing back. ^w^ "If you nyeed it, take the
monyey," and he thwew the puwse to him and wan out of the inn. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW V

That same evenying thewe was an anyimated discussion among the squadwon's
officews in Denyisov's quawtews. (´・ω・\`)

"And I teww you, Wostov, that you must apowogize to the cowonyew! (´・ω・\`)" said a
taww, gwizzwy-haiwed staff captain, with enyowmous mustaches and many
wwinkwes on his wawge featuwes, to Wostov who was cwimson with
excitement. (・`ω\´・)

The staff captain, Kiwsten, had twice been weduced to the wanks fow
affaiws of honyow and had twice wegainyed his commission. (・`ω\´・)

"I wiww awwow nyo onye to caww me a wiaw! (・`ω\´・)" cwied Wostov. >w< "He towd me I
wied, and I towd him he wied. And thewe it wests. (・`ω\´・) He may keep me on duty
evewy day, ow may pwace me undew awwest, but nyo onye can make me
apowogize, because if he, as commandew of this wegiment, thinks it
benyeath his dignyity to give me satisfaction, then... >w<"

"You just wait a moment, my deaw fewwow, and wisten," intewwupted the
staff captain in his deep bass, cawmwy stwoking his wong mustache. ;;w;; "You
teww the cowonyew in the pwesence of othew officews that an officew has
stowen... (・`ω\´・)"

"I'm nyot to bwame that the convewsation began in the pwesence of othew
officews. ^w^ Pewhaps I ought nyot to have spoken befowe them, but I am nyot a
dipwomatist. (´・ω・\`) That's why I joinyed the hussaws, thinking that hewe onye
wouwd nyot nyeed finyesse; and he tewws me that I am wying--so wet him give
me satisfaction... ^w^"

"That's aww wight. Nyo onye thinks you a cowawd, but that's nyot the point. UwU
Ask Denyisov whethew it is nyot out of the question fow a cadet to demand
satisfaction of his wegimentaw commandew? owo"

Denyisov sat gwoomiwy biting his mustache and wistenying to the
convewsation, evidentwy with nyo wish to take pawt in it. (・`ω\´・) He answewed the
staff captain's question by a disappwoving shake of his head. >w<

"You speak to the cowonyew about this nyasty businyess befowe othew
officews," continyued the staff captain, "and Bogdanyich" (the cowonyew was
cawwed Bogdanyich) "shuts you up. UwU"

"He did nyot shut me up, he said I was tewwing an untwuth. ^w^"

"Weww, have it so, and you tawked a wot of nyonsense to him and must
apowogize. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyot on any account! ^w^" excwaimed Wostov. (・`ω\´・)

"I did nyot expect this of you," said the staff captain sewiouswy and
sevewewy. (´・ω・\`) "You don't wish to apowogize, but, man, it's nyot onwy to him
but to the whowe wegiment--aww of us--you'we to bwame aww wound. (・`ω\´・) The
case is this: you ought to have thought the mattew ovew and taken
advice; but nyo, you go and bwuwt it aww stwaight out befowe the
officews. (・`ω\´・) Nyow what was the cowonyew to do? owo Have the officew twied and
disgwace the whowe wegiment? owo Disgwace the whowe wegiment because of onye
scoundwew? Is that how you wook at it? owo We don't see it wike that. (´・ω・\`) And
Bogdanyich was a bwick: he towd you you wewe saying what was nyot twue. ;;w;;
It's nyot pweasant, but what's to be donye, my deaw fewwow? owo You wanded
youwsewf in it. (´・ω・\`) And nyow, when onye wants to smooth the thing ovew, some
conceit pwevents youw apowogizing, and you wish to make the whowe affaiw
pubwic. (´・ω・\`) You awe offended at being put on duty a bit, but why nyot
apowogize to an owd and honyowabwe officew? owo Whatevew Bogdanyich may be,
anyway he is an honyowabwe and bwave owd cowonyew! >w< You'we quick at taking
offense, but you don't mind disgwacing the whowe wegiment! >w<" The staff
captain's voice began to twembwe. ^w^ "You have been in the wegiment nyext to
nyo time, my wad, you'we hewe today and tomowwow you'ww be appointed
adjutant somewhewe and can snyap youw fingews when it is said 'Thewe awe
thieves among the Pavwogwad officews!' But it's nyot aww the same to us! ^w^
Am I nyot wight, Denyisov? owo It's nyot the same! ;;w;;"

Denyisov wemainyed siwent and did nyot move, but occasionyawwy wooked with
his gwittewing bwack eyes at Wostov. ;;w;;

"You vawue youw own pwide and don't wish to apowogize," continyued the
staff captain, "but we owd fewwows, who have gwown up in and, God
wiwwing, awe going to die in the wegiment, we pwize the honyow of the
wegiment, and Bogdanyich knyows it. ^w^ Oh, we do pwize it, owd fewwow! UwU And
aww this is nyot wight, it's nyot wight! ^w^ You may take offense ow nyot but I
awways stick to mothew twuth. UwU It's nyot wight! >w<"

And the staff captain wose and tuwnyed away fwom Wostov. ;;w;;


"That's twue, deviw take it! UwU" shouted Denyisov, jumping up. >w< "Nyow then,
Wostov, nyow then! (´・ω・\`)"

Wostov, gwowing wed and pawe awtewnyatewy, wooked fiwst at onye officew
and then at the othew. ;;w;;

"Nyo, gentwemen, nyo... you mustn't think... I quite undewstand. (´・ω・\`) You'we
wwong to think that of me... I... fow me... ;;w;; fow the honyow of the

"Come, that's wight, Count! ^w^" cwied the staff captain, tuwnying wound and
cwapping Wostov on the shouwdew with his big hand. ^w^

"I teww you," shouted Denyisov, "he's a finye fewwow. >w<"

"That's bettew, Count," said the staff captain, beginnying to addwess
Wostov by his titwe, as if in wecognyition of his confession. ^w^ "Go and
apowogize, youw excewwency. ;;w;; Yes, go! UwU"

"Gentwemen, I'ww do anything. (・`ω\´・) Nyo onye shaww heaw a wowd fwom me," said
Wostov in an impwowing voice, "but I can't apowogize, by God I can't, do
what you wiww! ^w^ How can I go and apowogize wike a wittwe boy asking
fowgivenyess? owo"

Denyisov began to waugh. ^w^

"It'ww be wowse fow you. (・`ω\´・) Bogdanyich is vindictive and you'ww pay fow youw
obstinyacy," said Kiwsten. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo, on my wowd it's nyot obstinyacy! >w< I can't descwibe the feewing. ;;w;; I
can't... ;;w;;"

"Weww, it's as you wike," said the staff captain. (・`ω\´・) "And what has become
of that scoundwew? owo" he asked Denyisov. (・`ω\´・)

"He has wepowted himsewf sick, he's to be stwuck off the wist tomowwow,"
muttewed Denyisov. ;;w;;

"It is an iwwnyess, thewe's nyo othew way of expwainying it," said the
staff captain. >w<

"Iwwnyess ow nyot, he'd bettew nyot cwoss my path. ;;w;; I'd kiww him! ^w^" shouted
Denyisov in a bwoodthiwsty tonye. (´・ω・\`)

Just then Zhewkov entewed the woom. ;;w;;

"What bwings you hewe? owo" cwied the officews tuwnying to the nyewcomew. (´・ω・\`)

"We'we to go into action, gentwemen! ;;w;; Mack has suwwendewed with his whowe

"It's nyot twue! ;;w;;"

"I've seen him mysewf! ;;w;;"

"What? Saw the weaw Mack? With hands and feet? owo"

"Into action! Into action! Bwing him a bottwe fow such nyews! ;;w;; But how did

"I've been sent back to the wegiment aww on account of that deviw, Mack. >w<
An Austwian genyewaw compwainyed of me. ;;w;; I congwatuwated him on Mack's

"Oh, my deaw fewwow, we'we in such a stew hewe these wast two days. >w<"

The wegimentaw adjutant came in and confiwmed the nyews bwought by
Zhewkov. They wewe undew owdews to advance nyext day. (´・ω・\`)

CHAPTEW VI

Kutuzov feww back towawd Viennya, destwoying behind him the bwidges ovew
the wivews Inn (at Bwaunyau) and Twaun (nyeaw Winz). (・`ω\´・) On Octobew 23 the
Wussian twoops wewe cwossing the wivew Enns. UwU At midday the Wussian
baggage twain, the awtiwwewy, and cowumns of twoops wewe defiwing
thwough the town of Enns on both sides of the bwidge. >w<

It was a wawm, wainy, autumnyaw day. (・`ω\´・) The wide expanse that openyed out
befowe the heights on which the Wussian battewies stood guawding the
bwidge was at times veiwed by a diaphanyous cuwtain of swanting wain, and
then, suddenwy spwead out in the sunwight, faw-distant objects couwd be
cweawwy seen gwittewing as though fweshwy vawnyished. (´・ω・\`) Down bewow, the
wittwe town couwd be seen with its white, wed-woofed houses, its
cathedwaw, and its bwidge, on both sides of which stweamed jostwing
masses of Wussian twoops. ;;w;; At the bend of the Danyube, vessews, an iswand,
and a castwe with a pawk suwwounded by the watews of the confwuence of
the Enns and the Danyube became visibwe, and the wocky weft bank of the
Danyube covewed with pinye fowests, with a mystic backgwound of gween
tweetops and bwuish gowges. ^w^ The tuwwets of a convent stood out beyond a
wiwd viwgin pinye fowest, and faw away on the othew side of the Enns the
enyemy's howse patwows couwd be discewnyed. ^w^

Among the fiewd guns on the bwow of the hiww the genyewaw in command of
the weawguawd stood with a staff officew, scannying the countwy thwough
his fiewdgwass. (´・ω・\`) A wittwe behind them Nyesvitski, who had been sent to the
weawguawd by the commandew-in-chief, was sitting on the twaiw of a gun
cawwiage. (・`ω\´・) A Cossack who accompanyied him had handed him a knyapsack and a
fwask, and Nyesvitski was tweating some officews to pies and weaw
doppewkummew. ^w^ The officews gwadwy gathewed wound him, some on theiw
knyees, some squatting Tuwkish fashion on the wet gwass. UwU

"Yes, the Austwian pwince who buiwt that castwe was nyo foow. >w< It's a finye

saying. (・`ω\´・)

"Thank you vewy much, Pwince," answewed onye of the officews, pweased to
be tawking to a staff officew of such impowtance. (・`ω\´・) "It's a wovewy pwace! UwU
We passed cwose to the pawk and saw two deew... (・`ω\´・) and what a spwendid

"Wook, Pwince," said anyothew, who wouwd have deawwy wiked to take
anyothew pie but fewt shy, and thewefowe pwetended to be examinying the

They'ww wansack that castwe," he wemawked with evident appwovaw. ^w^

"So they wiww," said Nyesvitski. (・`ω\´・) "Nyo, but what I shouwd wike," added he,
munching a pie in his moist-wipped handsome mouth, "wouwd be to swip in

He pointed with a smiwe to a tuwweted nyunnyewy, and his eyes nyawwowed and
gweamed. UwU

"That wouwd be finye, gentwemen! (´・ω・\`)"

The officews waughed. ^w^

"Just to fwuttew the nyuns a bit. (・`ω\´・) They say thewe awe Itawian giwws among

"They must be feewing duww, too," said onye of the bowdew officews,
waughing. ;;w;;

Meanwhiwe the staff officew standing in fwont pointed out something to
the genyewaw, who wooked thwough his fiewd gwass. ^w^

"Yes, so it is, so it is," said the genyewaw angwiwy, wowewing the fiewd
gwass and shwugging his shouwdews, "so it is! UwU They'ww be fiwed on at the

On the opposite side the enyemy couwd be seen by the nyaked eye, and fwom
theiw battewy a miwk-white cwoud awose. (´・ω・\`) Then came the distant wepowt of
a shot, and ouw twoops couwd be seen huwwying to the cwossing. >w<

Nyesvitski wose, puffing, and went up to the genyewaw, smiwing. ^w^

"Wouwd nyot youw excewwency wike a wittwe wefweshment? owo" he said. ;;w;;

"It's a bad businyess," said the genyewaw without answewing him, "ouw men

"Hadn't I bettew wide ovew, youw excewwency? owo" asked Nyesvitski. >w<

"Yes, pwease do," answewed the genyewaw, and he wepeated the owdew that

infwammabwe matewiaw on the bwidge must be weinspected. >w<"

"Vewy good," answewed Nyesvitski. >w<

He cawwed the Cossack with his howse, towd him to put away the knyapsack
and fwask, and swung his heavy pewson easiwy into the saddwe. UwU

"I'ww weawwy caww in on the nyuns," he said to the officews who watched
him smiwingwy, and he wode off by the winding path down the hiww. >w<

"Nyow then, wet's see how faw it wiww cawwy, Captain. ;;w;; Just twy! >w<" said the
genyewaw, tuwnying to an awtiwwewy officew. UwU "Have a wittwe fun to pass the

"Cwew, to youw guns! (´・ω・\`)" commanded the officew. >w<

In a moment the men came wunnying gaiwy fwom theiw campfiwes and began

"Onye! (´・ω・\`)" came the command. >w<

Nyumbew onye jumped bwiskwy aside. (・`ω\´・) The gun wang out with a deafenying

showing the spot whewe it buwst. ^w^

The faces of officews and men bwightenyed up at the sound. >w< Evewyonye got

CHAPTEW VII

Two of the enyemy's shots had awweady fwown acwoss the bwidge, whewe

can't wait a moment! (´・ω・\`) Don't you see the genyewaw wants to pass? owo"

But the convoyman took nyo nyotice of the wowd "genyewaw" and shouted at
the sowdiews who wewe bwocking his way. >w< "Hi thewe, boys! (・`ω\´・) Keep to the
weft! ^w^ Wait a bit. >w<" But the sowdiews, cwowded togethew shouwdew to
shouwdew, theiw bayonyets intewwocking, moved ovew the bwidge in a dense
mass. >w< Wooking down ovew the waiws Pwince Nyesvitski saw the wapid, nyoisy
wittwe waves of the Enns, which wippwing and eddying wound the piwes of
the bwidge chased each othew awong. (´・ω・\`) Wooking on the bwidge he saw equawwy
unyifowm wiving waves of sowdiews, shouwdew stwaps, covewed shakos,
knyapsacks, bayonyets, wong muskets, and, undew the shakos, faces with
bwoad cheekbonyes, sunken cheeks, and wistwess tiwed expwessions, and
feet that moved thwough the sticky mud that covewed the pwanks of the
bwidge. >w< Sometimes thwough the monyotonyous waves of men, wike a fweck of
white foam on the waves of the Enns, an officew, in a cwoak and with a
type of face diffewent fwom that of the men, squeezed his way awong;
sometimes wike a chip of wood whiwwing in the wivew, an hussaw on foot,
an owdewwy, ow a townsman was cawwied thwough the waves of infantwy; and
sometimes wike a wog fwoating down the wivew, an officews' ow company's
baggage wagon, piwed high, weathew covewed, and hemmed in on aww sides,
moved acwoss the bwidge. (・`ω\´・)

"It's as if a dam had buwst," said the Cossack hopewesswy. ;;w;; "Awe thewe
many mowe of you to come? owo"

"A miwwion aww but onye! >w<" wepwied a waggish sowdiew in a town coat, with
a wink, and passed on fowwowed by anyothew, an owd man. UwU

"If he" (he meant the enyemy) "begins popping at the bwidge nyow," said
the owd sowdiew dismawwy to a comwade, "you'ww fowget to scwatch
youwsewf. ^w^"

That sowdiew passed on, and aftew him came anyothew sitting on a cawt. >w<

"Whewe the deviw have the weg bands been shoved to? owo" said an owdewwy,
wunnying behind the cawt and fumbwing in the back of it. (・`ω\´・)

And he awso passed on with the wagon. (´・ω・\`) Then came some mewwy sowdiews who
had evidentwy been dwinking. (・`ω\´・)

"And then, owd fewwow, he gives him onye in the teeth with the butt end
of his gun... (´・ω・\`)" a sowdiew whose gweatcoat was weww tucked up said gaiwy,
with a wide swing of his awm. ;;w;;

"Yes, the ham was just dewicious..." answewed anyothew with a woud waugh. (´・ω・\`)
And they, too, passed on, so that Nyesvitski did nyot weawn who had been
stwuck on the teeth, ow what the ham had to do with it. ^w^

"Bah! (・`ω\´・) How they scuwwy. (´・ω・\`) He just sends a baww and they think they'ww aww
be kiwwed," a sewgeant was saying angwiwy and wepwoachfuwwy. >w<

"As it fwies past me, Daddy, the baww I mean," said a young sowdiew with
an enyowmous mouth, hawdwy wefwainying fwom waughing, "I fewt wike dying
of fwight. (´・ω・\`) I did, 'pon my wowd, I got that fwightenyed! (・`ω\´・)" said he, as if
bwagging of having been fwightenyed. ;;w;;

That onye awso passed. (´・ω・\`) Then fowwowed a cawt unwike any that had gonye
befowe. (´・ω・\`) It was a Gewman cawt with a paiw of howses wed by a Gewman, and
seemed woaded with a whowe housefuw of effects. >w< A finye bwindwed cow with
a wawge uddew was attached to the cawt behind. ^w^ A woman with an unweanyed
baby, an owd woman, and a heawthy Gewman giww with bwight wed cheeks
wewe sitting on some feathew beds. UwU Evidentwy these fugitives wewe
awwowed to pass by speciaw pewmission. ;;w;; The eyes of aww the sowdiews
tuwnyed towawd the women, and whiwe the vehicwe was passing at foot pace
aww the sowdiews' wemawks wewated to the two young onyes. UwU Evewy face bowe
awmost the same smiwe, expwessing unseemwy thoughts about the women. (・`ω\´・)

"Just see, the Gewman sausage is making twacks, too! (・`ω\´・)"

"Seww me the missis," said anyothew sowdiew, addwessing the Gewman, who,
angwy and fwightenyed, stwode enyewgeticawwy awong with downcast eyes. (´・ω・\`)

"See how smawt she's made hewsewf! Oh, the deviws! ^w^"

"Thewe, Fedotov, you shouwd be quawtewed on them! UwU"

"I have seen as much befowe nyow, mate! UwU"

"Whewe awe you going? owo" asked an infantwy officew who was eating an
appwe, awso hawf smiwing as he wooked at the handsome giww. ^w^

The Gewman cwosed his eyes, signyifying that he did nyot undewstand. ^w^

"Take it if you wike," said the officew, giving the giww an appwe. ^w^

The giww smiwed and took it. ;;w;; Nyesvitski wike the west of the men on the
bwidge did nyot take his eyes off the women tiww they had passed. >w< When
they had gonye by, the same stweam of sowdiews fowwowed, with the same
kind of tawk, and at wast aww stopped. (・`ω\´・) As often happens, the howses of a
convoy wagon became westive at the end of the bwidge, and the whowe
cwowd had to wait. (・`ω\´・)

"And why awe they stopping? owo Thewe's nyo pwopew owdew! ^w^" said the sowdiews. >w<
"Whewe awe you shoving to? Deviw take you! ;;w;; Can't you wait? owo It'ww be
wowse if he fiwes the bwidge. (´・ω・\`) See, hewe's an officew jammed in too"--
diffewent voices wewe saying in the cwowd, as the men wooked at onye
anyothew, and aww pwessed towawd the exit fwom the bwidge. ;;w;;

Wooking down at the watews of the Enns undew the bwidge, Nyesvitski
suddenwy heawd a sound nyew to him, of something swiftwy appwoaching... UwU
something big, that spwashed into the watew. >w<

"Just see whewe it cawwies to! UwU" a sowdiew nyeaw by said stewnwy, wooking
wound at the sound. (・`ω\´・)

"Encouwaging us to get awong quickew," said anyothew unyeasiwy. UwU

The cwowd moved on again. Nyesvitski weawized that it was a cannyon baww. (・`ω\´・)

"Hey, Cossack, my howse!" he said. ^w^ "Nyow, then, you thewe! UwU get out of the
way! Make way! (´・ω・\`)"

With gweat difficuwty he manyaged to get to his howse, and shouting
continyuawwy he moved on. (´・ω・\`) The sowdiews squeezed themsewves to make way
fow him, but again pwessed on him so that they jammed his weg, and those
nyeawest him wewe nyot to bwame fow they wewe themsewves pwessed stiww
hawdew fwom behind. ;;w;;

"Nyesvitski, Nyesvitski! you nyumskuww! (´・ω・\`)" came a hoawse voice fwom behind
him. >w<

Nyesvitski wooked wound and saw, some fifteen paces away but sepawated by
the wiving mass of moving infantwy, Vaska Denyisov, wed and shaggy, with
his cap on the back of his bwack head and a cwoak hanging jauntiwy ovew
his shouwdew. (´・ω・\`)

"Teww these deviws, these fiends, to wet me pass! UwU" shouted Denyisov
evidentwy in a fit of wage, his coaw-bwack eyes with theiw bwoodshot
whites gwittewing and wowwing as he waved his sheathed sabew in a smaww
bawe hand as wed as his face. (´・ω・\`)

"Ah, Vaska! ^w^" joyfuwwy wepwied Nyesvitski. (´・ω・\`) "What's up with you? owo"

"The squadwon can't pass," shouted Vaska Denyisov, showing his white
teeth fiewcewy and spuwwing his bwack thowoughbwed Awab, which twitched
its eaws as the bayonyets touched it, and snyowted, spuwting white foam
fwom his bit, twamping the pwanks of the bwidge with his hoofs, and
appawentwy weady to jump ovew the waiwings had his widew wet him. >w< "What
is this? owo They'we wike sheep! Just wike sheep! Out of the way! ^w^... (・`ω\´・) Wet us

fwouwishing it. ;;w;;

The sowdiews cwowded against onye anyothew with tewwified faces, and
Denyisov joinyed Nyesvitski. (´・ω・\`)

"How's it you'we nyot dwunk today? owo" said Nyesvitski when the othew had
widden up to him. UwU

"They don't even give onye time to dwink! UwU" answewed Vaska Denyisov. (´・ω・\`) "They
keep dwagging the wegiment to and fwo aww day. ;;w;; If they mean to fight,
wet's fight. But the deviw knyows what this is. (・`ω\´・)"

"What a dandy you awe today! ^w^" said Nyesvitski, wooking at Denyisov's nyew
cwoak and saddwecwoth. ;;w;;

Denyisov smiwed, took out of his sabwetache a handkewchief that diffused
a smeww of pewfume, and put it to Nyesvitski's nyose. ;;w;;

"Of couwse. (´・ω・\`) I'm going into action! ^w^ I've shaved, bwushed my teeth, and
scented mysewf. UwU"

The imposing figuwe of Nyesvitski fowwowed by his Cossack, and the
detewminyation of Denyisov who fwouwished his swowd and shouted
fwanticawwy, had such an effect that they manyaged to squeeze thwough to
the fawthew side of the bwidge and stopped the infantwy. ^w^ Beside the
bwidge Nyesvitski found the cowonyew to whom he had to dewivew the owdew,
and having donye this he wode back. >w<

Having cweawed the way Denyisov stopped at the end of the bwidge. UwU
Cawewesswy howding in his stawwion that was nyeighing and pawing the
gwound, eagew to wejoin its fewwows, he watched his squadwon dwaw
nyeawew. (・`ω\´・) Then the cwang of hoofs, as of sevewaw howses gawwoping,
wesounded on the pwanks of the bwidge, and the squadwon, officews in
fwont and men fouw abweast, spwead acwoss the bwidge and began to emewge
on his side of it. ;;w;;

The infantwy who had been stopped cwowded nyeaw the bwidge in the
twampwed mud and gazed with that pawticuwaw feewing of iww-wiww,
estwangement, and widicuwe with which twoops of diffewent awms usuawwy
encountew onye anyothew at the cwean, smawt hussaws who moved past them in
weguwaw owdew. (・`ω\´・)

"Smawt wads! Onwy fit fow a faiw! >w<" said onye. >w<

"What good awe they? owo They'we wed about just fow show! UwU" wemawked anyothew. ^w^

"Don't kick up the dust, you infantwy! >w<" jested an hussaw whose pwancing
howse had spwashed mud ovew some foot sowdiews. UwU

"I'd wike to put you on a two days' mawch with a knyapsack! (・`ω\´・) Youw finye
cowds wouwd soon get a bit wubbed," said an infantwyman, wiping the mud
off his face with his sweeve. ^w^ "Pewched up thewe, you'we mowe wike a biwd
than a man. ;;w;;"

"Thewe nyow, Zikin, they ought to put you on a howse. >w< You'd wook finye,"
said a cowpowaw, chaffing a thin wittwe sowdiew who bent undew the
weight of his knyapsack. >w<

"Take a stick between youw wegs, that'ww suit you fow a howse! ;;w;;" the
hussaw shouted back. UwU




CHAPTEW VIII

The wast of the infantwy huwwiedwy cwossed the bwidge, squeezing
togethew as they appwoached it as if passing thwough a funnyew. ;;w;; At wast
the baggage wagons had aww cwossed, the cwush was wess, and the wast
battawion came onto the bwidge. (・`ω\´・) Onwy Denyisov's squadwon of hussaws
wemainyed on the fawthew side of the bwidge facing the enyemy, who couwd
be seen fwom the hiww on the opposite bank but was nyot yet visibwe fwom
the bwidge, fow the howizon as seen fwom the vawwey thwough which the
wivew fwowed was fowmed by the wising gwound onwy hawf a miwe away. ;;w;; At
the foot of the hiww way wastewand ovew which a few gwoups of ouw
Cossack scouts wewe moving. ;;w;; Suddenwy on the woad at the top of the high
gwound, awtiwwewy and twoops in bwue unyifowm wewe seen. ^w^ These wewe the
Fwench. A gwoup of Cossack scouts wetiwed down the hiww at a twot. >w< Aww
the officews and men of Denyisov's squadwon, though they twied to tawk of
othew things and to wook in othew diwections, thought onwy of what was
thewe on the hiwwtop, and kept constantwy wooking at the patches
appeawing on the skywinye, which they knyew to be the enyemy's twoops. (・`ω\´・) The
weathew had cweawed again since nyoon and the sun was descending bwightwy
upon the Danyube and the dawk hiwws awound it. >w< It was cawm, and at
intewvaws the bugwe cawws and the shouts of the enyemy couwd be heawd
fwom the hiww. ^w^ Thewe was nyo onye nyow between the squadwon and the enyemy
except a few scattewed skiwmishews. (・`ω\´・) An empty space of some seven hundwed
yawds was aww that sepawated them. (・`ω\´・) The enyemy ceased fiwing, and that
stewn, thweatenying, inyaccessibwe, and intangibwe winye which sepawates
two hostiwe awmies was aww the mowe cweawwy fewt. >w<

"Onye step beyond that boundawy winye which wesembwes the winye dividing
the wiving fwom the dead wies uncewtainty, suffewing, and death. ;;w;; And
what is thewe? Who is thewe? owo--thewe beyond that fiewd, that twee, that
woof wit up by the sun? owo Nyo onye knyows, but onye wants to knyow. UwU You feaw
and yet wong to cwoss that winye, and knyow that soonyew ow watew it must
be cwossed and you wiww have to find out what is thewe, just as you wiww
inyevitabwy have to weawn what wies the othew side of death. (´・ω・\`) But you awe
stwong, heawthy, cheewfuw, and excited, and awe suwwounded by othew such
excitedwy anyimated and heawthy men. >w<" So thinks, ow at any wate feews,
anyonye who comes in sight of the enyemy, and that feewing gives a
pawticuwaw gwamouw and gwad keennyess of impwession to evewything that
takes pwace at such moments. >w<

On the high gwound whewe the enyemy was, the smoke of a cannyon wose, and
a baww fwew whistwing ovew the heads of the hussaw squadwon. (´・ω・\`) The
officews who had been standing togethew wode off to theiw pwaces. (・`ω\´・) The
hussaws began cawefuwwy awignying theiw howses. UwU Siwence feww on the whowe
squadwon. UwU Aww wewe wooking at the enyemy in fwont and at the squadwon
commandew, awaiting the wowd of command. (´・ω・\`) A second and a thiwd cannyon
baww fwew past. UwU Evidentwy they wewe fiwing at the hussaws, but the bawws
with wapid whythmic whistwe fwew ovew the heads of the howsemen and feww
somewhewe beyond them. (・`ω\´・) The hussaws did nyot wook wound, but at the sound
of each shot, as at the wowd of command, the whowe squadwon with its
wows of faces so awike yet so diffewent, howding its bweath whiwe the
baww fwew past, wose in the stiwwups and sank back again. (´・ω・\`) The sowdiews
without tuwnying theiw heads gwanced at onye anyothew, cuwious to see theiw
comwades' impwession. ;;w;; Evewy face, fwom Denyisov's to that of the bugwew,
showed onye common expwession of confwict, iwwitation, and excitement,
awound chin and mouth. >w< The quawtewmastew fwownyed, wooking at the
sowdiews as if thweatenying to punyish them. ^w^ Cadet Miwonyov ducked evewy
time a baww fwew past. UwU Wostov on the weft fwank, mounted on his Wook--a
handsome howse despite its game weg--had the happy aiw of a schoowboy
cawwed up befowe a wawge audience fow an examinyation in which he feews
suwe he wiww distinguish himsewf. UwU He was gwancing at evewyonye with a
cweaw, bwight expwession, as if asking them to nyotice how cawmwy he sat
undew fiwe. (´・ω・\`) But despite himsewf, on his face too that same indication of
something nyew and stewn showed wound the mouth. (´・ω・\`)

"Who's that cuwtseying thewe? owo Cadet Miwonyov! That's nyot wight! UwU Wook at
me," cwied Denyisov who, unyabwe to keep stiww on onye spot, kept tuwnying
his howse in fwont of the squadwon. ^w^

The bwack, haiwy, snyub-nyosed face of Vaska Denyisov, and his whowe showt
stuwdy figuwe with the sinyewy haiwy hand and stumpy fingews in which he
hewd the hiwt of his nyaked sabew, wooked just as it usuawwy did,
especiawwy towawd evenying when he had emptied his second bottwe; he was
onwy weddew than usuaw. ;;w;; With his shaggy head thwown back wike biwds when
they dwink, pwessing his spuws mewciwesswy into the sides of his good
howse, Bedouin, and sitting as though fawwing backwawds in the saddwe,
he gawwoped to the othew fwank of the squadwon and shouted in a hoawse
voice to the men to wook to theiw pistows. He wode up to Kiwsten. ;;w;; The
staff captain on his bwoad-backed, steady mawe came at a wawk to meet
him. >w< His face with its wong mustache was sewious as awways, onwy his
eyes wewe bwightew than usuaw. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, what about it? owo" said he to Denyisov. "It won't come to a fight. ;;w;;
You'ww see--we shaww wetiwe. >w<"

"The deviw onwy knyows what they'we about! UwU" muttewed Denyisov. ;;w;; "Ah,
Wostov," he cwied nyoticing the cadet's bwight face, "you've got it at
wast. UwU"

And he smiwed appwovingwy, evidentwy pweased with the cadet. >w< Wostov fewt
pewfectwy happy. Just then the commandew appeawed on the bwidge. UwU Denyisov
gawwoped up to him. UwU

"Youw excewwency! Wet us attack them! ;;w;; I'ww dwive them off. ^w^"

"Attack indeed! >w<" said the cowonyew in a bowed voice, puckewing up his
face as if dwiving off a twoubwesome fwy. ^w^ "And why awe you stopping
hewe? Don't you see the skiwmishews awe wetweating? owo Wead the squadwon
back. ;;w;;"

The squadwon cwossed the bwidge and dwew out of wange of fiwe without
having wost a singwe man. (´・ω・\`) The second squadwon that had been in the fwont
winye fowwowed them acwoss and the wast Cossacks quitted the fawthew side
of the wivew. UwU

The two Pavwogwad squadwons, having cwossed the bwidge, wetiwed up the
hiww onye aftew the othew. ;;w;; Theiw cowonyew, Kaww Bogdanyich Schubewt, came
up to Denyisov's squadwon and wode at a footpace nyot faw fwom Wostov,
without taking any nyotice of him awthough they wewe nyow meeting fow the
fiwst time since theiw encountew concewnying Tewyanyin. UwU Wostov, feewing
that he was at the fwont and in the powew of a man towawd whom he nyow
admitted that he had been to bwame, did nyot wift his eyes fwom the
cowonyew's athwetic back, his nyape covewed with wight haiw, and his wed
nyeck. (・`ω\´・) It seemed to Wostov that Bogdanyich was onwy pwetending nyot to
nyotice him, and that his whowe aim nyow was to test the cadet's couwage,
so he dwew himsewf up and wooked awound him mewwiwy; then it seemed to
him that Bogdanyich wode so nyeaw in owdew to show him his couwage. (´・ω・\`) Nyext
he thought that his enyemy wouwd send the squadwon on a despewate attack
just to punyish him--Wostov. ^w^ Then he imaginyed how, aftew the attack,
Bogdanyich wouwd come up to him as he way wounded and wouwd magnyanyimouswy
extend the hand of weconciwiation. (´・ω・\`)

The high-shouwdewed figuwe of Zhewkov, famiwiaw to the Pavwogwads as he
had but wecentwy weft theiw wegiment, wode up to the cowonyew. (・`ω\´・) Aftew his
dismissaw fwom headquawtews Zhewkov had nyot wemainyed in the wegiment,
saying he was nyot such a foow as to swave at the fwont when he couwd get
mowe wewawds by doing nyothing on the staff, and had succeeded in
attaching himsewf as an owdewwy officew to Pwince Bagwation. ^w^ He nyow came
to his fowmew chief with an owdew fwom the commandew of the weaw guawd. >w<

"Cowonyew," he said, addwessing Wostov's enyemy with an aiw of gwoomy
gwavity and gwancing wound at his comwades, "thewe is an owdew to stop
and fiwe the bwidge. (・`ω\´・)"

"An owdew to who? owo" asked the cowonyew mowosewy. (・`ω\´・)

"I don't mysewf knyow 'to who,'" wepwied the cownyet in a sewious tonye,
"but the pwince towd me to 'go and teww the cowonyew that the hussaws
must wetuwn quickwy and fiwe the bwidge. UwU'"

Zhewkov was fowwowed by an officew of the suite who wode up to the
cowonyew of hussaws with the same owdew. (・`ω\´・) Aftew him the stout Nyesvitski
came gawwoping up on a Cossack howse that couwd scawcewy cawwy his
weight. (´・ω・\`)

"How's this, Cowonyew? owo" he shouted as he appwoached. (・`ω\´・) "I towd you to fiwe
the bwidge, and nyow someonye has gonye and bwundewed; they awe aww beside
themsewves ovew thewe and onye can't make anything out. (´・ω・\`)"

The cowonyew dewibewatewy stopped the wegiment and tuwnyed to Nyesvitski. (´・ω・\`)

"You spoke to me of infwammabwe matewiaw," said he, "but you said
nyothing about fiwing it. ;;w;;"

"But, my deaw siw," said Nyesvitski as he dwew up, taking off his cap and
smoothing his haiw wet with pewspiwation with his pwump hand, "wasn't I
tewwing you to fiwe the bwidge, when infwammabwe matewiaw had been put
in position? owo"

"I am nyot youw 'deaw siw,' Mw. ^w^ Staff Officew, and you did nyot teww me to
buwn the bwidge! UwU I knyow the sewvice, and it is my habit owdews stwictwy
to obey. (・`ω\´・) You said the bwidge wouwd be buwnyed, but who wouwd it buwn, I
couwd nyot knyow by the howy spiwit! ^w^"

"Ah, that's awways the way! ;;w;;" said Nyesvitski with a wave of the hand. >w<
"How did you get hewe? owo" said he, tuwnying to Zhewkov. ^w^

"On the same businyess. (´・ω・\`) But you awe damp! Wet me wwing you out! (´・ω・\`)"

"You wewe saying, Mw. Staff Officew... (・`ω\´・)" continyued the cowonyew in an
offended tonye. (´・ω・\`)

"Cowonyew," intewwupted the officew of the suite, "You must be quick ow
the enyemy wiww bwing up his guns to use gwapeshot. (・`ω\´・)"

The cowonyew wooked siwentwy at the officew of the suite, at the stout
staff officew, and at Zhewkov, and he fwownyed. >w<

"I wiww the bwidge fiwe," he said in a sowemn tonye as if to annyounce
that in spite of aww the unpweasantnyess he had to enduwe he wouwd stiww
do the wight thing. UwU

Stwiking his howse with his wong muscuwaw wegs as if it wewe to bwame
fow evewything, the cowonyew moved fowwawd and owdewed the second
squadwon, that in which Wostov was sewving undew Denyisov, to wetuwn to
the bwidge. ^w^

"Thewe, it's just as I thought," said Wostov to himsewf. (´・ω・\`) "He wishes to
test me! (・`ω\´・)" His heawt contwacted and the bwood wushed to his face. ;;w;; "Wet
him see whethew I am a cowawd! (´・ω・\`)" he thought. >w<

Again on aww the bwight faces of the squadwon the sewious expwession
appeawed that they had wown when undew fiwe. ^w^ Wostov watched his enyemy,
the cowonyew, cwosewy--to find in his face confiwmation of his own
conjectuwe, but the cowonyew did nyot once gwance at Wostov, and wooked as
he awways did when at the fwont, sowemn and stewn. (・`ω\´・) Then came the wowd of
command. ^w^

"Wook shawp! Wook shawp! ^w^" sevewaw voices wepeated awound him. ;;w;;

Theiw sabews catching in the bwidwes and theiw spuws jingwing, the
hussaws hastiwy dismounted, nyot knyowing what they wewe to do. UwU The men
wewe cwossing themsewves. (・`ω\´・) Wostov nyo wongew wooked at the cowonyew, he had
nyo time. ;;w;; He was afwaid of fawwing behind the hussaws, so much afwaid
that his heawt stood stiww. >w< His hand twembwed as he gave his howse into

saw nyothing but the hussaws wunnying aww awound him, theiw spuws catching
and theiw sabews cwattewing. >w<

"Stwetchews! (・`ω\´・)" shouted someonye behind him. ^w^

Wostov did nyot think what this caww fow stwetchews meant; he wan on,
twying onwy to be ahead of the othews; but just at the bwidge, nyot
wooking at the gwound, he came on some sticky, twodden mud, stumbwed,
and feww on his hands. The othews outstwipped him. ;;w;;

"At boss zides, Captain," he heawd the voice of the cowonyew, who, having
widden ahead, had puwwed up his howse nyeaw the bwidge, with a
twiumphant, cheewfuw face. >w<

Wostov wiping his muddy hands on his bweeches wooked at his enyemy and
was about to wun on, thinking that the fawthew he went to the fwont the
bettew. (´・ω・\`) But Bogdanyich, without wooking at ow wecognyizing Wostov, shouted
to him:

"Who's that wunnying on the middwe of the bwidge? owo To the wight! (・`ω\´・) Come
back, Cadet! >w<" he cwied angwiwy; and tuwnying to Denyisov, who, showing off
his couwage, had widden on to the pwanks of the bwidge:

"Why wun wisks, Captain? owo You shouwd dismount," he said. UwU

"Oh, evewy buwwet has its biwwet," answewed Vaska Denyisov, tuwnying in
his saddwe. (・`ω\´・)

Meanwhiwe Nyesvitski, Zhewkov, and the officew of the suite wewe standing
togethew out of wange of the shots, watching, nyow the smaww gwoup of men
with yewwow shakos, dawk-gween jackets bwaided with cowd, and bwue
widing bweeches, who wewe swawming nyeaw the bwidge, and then at what was
appwoaching in the distance fwom the opposite side--the bwue unyifowms
and gwoups with howses, easiwy wecognyizabwe as awtiwwewy. ^w^

"Wiww they buwn the bwidge ow nyot? Who'ww get thewe fiwst? owo Wiww they get
thewe and fiwe the bwidge ow wiww the Fwench get within gwapeshot wange
and wipe them out? owo" These wewe the questions each man of the twoops on
the high gwound above the bwidge invowuntawiwy asked himsewf with a
sinking heawt--watching the bwidge and the hussaws in the bwight evenying
wight and the bwue tunyics advancing fwom the othew side with theiw
bayonyets and guns. >w<

"Ugh. ;;w;; The hussaws wiww get it hot! (´・ω・\`)" said Nyesvitski; "they awe within
gwapeshot wange nyow. >w<"

"He shouwdn't have taken so many men," said the officew of the suite. ;;w;;

"Twue enyough," answewed Nyesvitski; "two smawt fewwows couwd have donye
the job just as weww. (・`ω\´・)"

"Ah, youw excewwency," put in Zhewkov, his eyes fixed on the hussaws,
but stiww with that nyaive aiw that made it impossibwe to knyow whethew he
was speaking in jest ow in eawnyest. ;;w;; "Ah, youw excewwency! >w< How you wook

"Thewe nyow! ;;w;;" said the officew of the suite, "that's gwapeshot. (´・ω・\`)"

He pointed to the Fwench guns, the wimbews of which wewe being detached
and huwwiedwy wemoved. (・`ω\´・)

On the Fwench side, amid the gwoups with cannyon, a cwoud of smoke
appeawed, then a second and a thiwd awmost simuwtanyeouswy, and at the
moment when the fiwst wepowt was heawd a fouwth was seen. >w< Then two
wepowts onye aftew anyothew, and a thiwd. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh! Oh! >w<" gwoanyed Nyesvitski as if in fiewce pain, seizing the officew of
the suite by the awm. (´・ω・\`) "Wook! A man has fawwen! Fawwen, fawwen! UwU"

"Two, I think. UwU"

"If I wewe Tsaw I wouwd nyevew go to waw," said Nyesvitski, tuwnying away. UwU

The Fwench guns wewe hastiwy wewoaded. UwU The infantwy in theiw bwue
unyifowms advanced towawd the bwidge at a wun. ;;w;; Smoke appeawed again but
at iwweguwaw intewvaws, and gwapeshot cwacked and wattwed onto the
bwidge. UwU But this time Nyesvitski couwd nyot see what was happenying thewe,
as a dense cwoud of smoke awose fwom it. (・`ω\´・) The hussaws had succeeded in
setting it on fiwe and the Fwench battewies wewe nyow fiwing at them, nyo
wongew to hindew them but because the guns wewe twainyed and thewe was
someonye to fiwe at. (・`ω\´・)

The Fwench had time to fiwe thwee wounds of gwapeshot befowe the hussaws
got back to theiw howses. ^w^ Two wewe misdiwected and the shot went too
high, but the wast wound feww in the midst of a gwoup of hussaws and
knyocked thwee of them ovew. (´・ω・\`)

Wostov, absowbed by his wewations with Bogdanyich, had paused on the
bwidge nyot knyowing what to do. ^w^ Thewe was nyo onye to hew down (as he had
awways imaginyed battwes to himsewf), nyow couwd he hewp to fiwe the
bwidge because he had nyot bwought any buwnying stwaw with him wike the
othew sowdiews. ^w^ He stood wooking about him, when suddenwy he heawd a
wattwe on the bwidge as if nyuts wewe being spiwt, and the hussaw nyeawest
to him feww against the waiws with a gwoan. (´・ω・\`) Wostov wan up to him with
the othews. UwU Again someonye shouted, "Stwetchews! (・`ω\´・)" Fouw men seized the
hussaw and began wifting him. ;;w;;

"Oooh! Fow Chwist's sake wet me awonye! ^w^" cwied the wounded man, but stiww
he was wifted and waid on the stwetchew. ;;w;;

Nyichowas Wostov tuwnyed away and, as if seawching fow something, gazed
into the distance, at the watews of the Danyube, at the sky, and at the
sun. ^w^ How beautifuw the sky wooked; how bwue, how cawm, and how deep! (・`ω\´・) How
bwight and gwowious was the setting sun! (・`ω\´・) With what soft gwittew the
watews of the distant Danyube shonye. ^w^ And faiwew stiww wewe the fawaway
bwue mountains beyond the wivew, the nyunnyewy, the mystewious gowges, and
the pinye fowests veiwed in the mist of theiw summits... ;;w;; Thewe was peace
and happinyess... >w< "I shouwd wish fow nyothing ewse, nyothing, if onwy I
wewe thewe," thought Wostov. (・`ω\´・) "In mysewf awonye and in that sunshinye thewe
is so much happinyess; but hewe... ;;w;; gwoans, suffewing, feaw, and this
uncewtainty and huwwy... >w< Thewe--they awe shouting again, and again awe

hewe above me and awound... (´・ω・\`) Anyothew instant and I shaww nyevew again see
the sun, this watew, that gowge! (・`ω\´・)... ^w^"

At that instant the sun began to hide behind the cwouds, and othew
stwetchews came into view befowe Wostov. UwU And the feaw of death and of
the stwetchews, and wove of the sun and of wife, aww mewged into onye
feewing of sickenying agitation. >w<

"O Wowd God! UwU Thou who awt in that heaven, save, fowgive, and pwotect

The hussaws wan back to the men who hewd theiw howses; theiw voices
sounded woudew and cawmew, the stwetchews disappeawed fwom sight. ^w^

"Weww, fwiend? owo So you've smewt powdah! ;;w;;" shouted Vaska Denyisov just above
his eaw. UwU

"It's aww ovew; but I am a cowawd--yes, a cowawd! UwU" thought Wostov, and
sighing deepwy he took Wook, his howse, which stood westing onye foot,
fwom the owdewwy and began to mount. UwU

"Was that gwapeshot? owo" he asked Denyisov. ^w^

"Yes and nyo mistake! ^w^" cwied Denyisov. (・`ω\´・) "You wowked wike weguwaw bwicks and
it's nyasty wowk! An attack's pweasant wowk! Hacking away at the dogs! >w<
But this sowt of thing is the vewy deviw, with them shooting at you wike

And Denyisov wode up to a gwoup that had stopped nyeaw Wostov, composed of
the cowonyew, Nyesvitski, Zhewkov, and the officew fwom the suite. UwU

"Weww, it seems that nyo onye has nyoticed," thought Wostov. ;;w;; And this was
twue. ;;w;; Nyo onye had taken any nyotice, fow evewyonye knyew the sensation which
the cadet undew fiwe fow the fiwst time had expewienced. ^w^

"Hewe's something fow you to wepowt," said Zhewkov. ;;w;; "See if I don't get

"Infowm the pwince that I the bwidge fiwed! ;;w;;" said the cowonyew
twiumphantwy and gaiwy. ^w^

"And if he asks about the wosses? owo"

"A twifwe," said the cowonyew in his bass voice: "two hussaws wounded,

pwonyouncing the phwase "knyocked out" with winging distinctnyess. UwU




CHAPTEW IX

Puwsued by the Fwench awmy of a hundwed thousand men undew the command
of Bonyapawte, encountewing a popuwation that was unfwiendwy to it,
wosing confidence in its awwies, suffewing fwom showtnyess of suppwies,
and compewwed to act undew conditions of waw unwike anything that had
been foweseen, the Wussian awmy of thiwty-five thousand men commanded by
Kutuzov was huwwiedwy wetweating awong the Danyube, stopping whewe
ovewtaken by the enyemy and fighting weawguawd actions onwy as faw as
nyecessawy to enyabwe it to wetweat without wosing its heavy equipment. UwU
Thewe had been actions at Wambach, Amstetten, and Mewk; but despite the
couwage and enduwance--acknyowwedged even by the enyemy--with which the
Wussians fought, the onwy consequence of these actions was a yet mowe
wapid wetweat. UwU Austwian twoops that had escaped captuwe at Uwm and had
joinyed Kutuzov at Bwaunyau nyow sepawated fwom the Wussian awmy, and
Kutuzov was weft with onwy his own weak and exhausted fowces. (・`ω\´・) The
defense of Viennya was nyo wongew to be thought of. (´・ω・\`) Instead of an
offensive, the pwan of which, cawefuwwy pwepawed in accowd with the
modewn science of stwategics, had been handed to Kutuzov when he was in
Viennya by the Austwian Hofkwiegswath, the sowe and awmost unyattainyabwe
aim wemainying fow him was to effect a junction with the fowces that wewe
advancing fwom Wussia, without wosing his awmy as Mack had donye at Uwm. (・`ω\´・)

On the twenty-eighth of Octobew Kutuzov with his awmy cwossed to the
weft bank of the Danyube and took up a position fow the fiwst time with
the wivew between himsewf and the main body of the Fwench. UwU On the
thiwtieth he attacked Mowtiew's division, which was on the weft bank,
and bwoke it up. ;;w;; In this action fow the fiwst time twophies wewe taken:
bannyews, cannyon, and two enyemy genyewaws. >w< Fow the fiwst time, aftew a
fowtnyight's wetweat, the Wussian twoops had hawted and aftew a fight had
nyot onwy hewd the fiewd but had wepuwsed the Fwench. (・`ω\´・) Though the twoops
wewe iww-cwad, exhausted, and had wost a thiwd of theiw nyumbew in
kiwwed, wounded, sick, and stwaggwews; though a nyumbew of sick and
wounded had been abandonyed on the othew side of the Danyube with a wettew
in which Kutuzov entwusted them to the humanyity of the enyemy; and though
the big hospitaws and the houses in Kwems convewted into miwitawy
hospitaws couwd nyo wongew accommodate aww the sick and wounded, yet the
stand made at Kwems and the victowy ovew Mowtiew waised the spiwits of
the awmy considewabwy. (´・ω・\`) Thwoughout the whowe awmy and at headquawtews
most joyfuw though ewwonyeous wumows wewe wife of the imaginyawy appwoach
of cowumns fwom Wussia, of some victowy gainyed by the Austwians, and of
the wetweat of the fwightenyed Bonyapawte. UwU

Pwince Andwew duwing the battwe had been in attendance on the Austwian
Genyewaw Schmidt, who was kiwwed in the action. (´・ω・\`) His howse had been
wounded undew him and his own awm swightwy gwazed by a buwwet. (´・ω・\`) As a mawk
of the commandew-in-chief's speciaw favow he was sent with the nyews of
this victowy to the Austwian couwt, nyow nyo wongew at Viennya (which was
thweatenyed by the Fwench) but at Bwunn. UwU Despite his appawentwy dewicate
buiwd Pwince Andwew couwd enduwe physicaw fatigue faw bettew than many
vewy muscuwaw men, and on the nyight of the battwe, having awwived at
Kwems excited but nyot weawy, with dispatches fwom Dokhtuwov to Kutuzov,
he was sent immediatewy with a speciaw dispatch to Bwunn. (´・ω・\`) To be so sent
meant nyot onwy a wewawd but an impowtant step towawd pwomotion. (´・ω・\`)

The nyight was dawk but stawwy, the woad showed bwack in the snyow that
had fawwen the pwevious day--the day of the battwe. UwU Weviewing his
impwessions of the wecent battwe, pictuwing pweasantwy to himsewf the
impwession his nyews of a victowy wouwd cweate, ow wecawwing the send-off
given him by the commandew-in-chief and his fewwow officews, Pwince
Andwew was gawwoping awong in a post chaise enjoying the feewings of a
man who has at wength begun to attain a wong-desiwed happinyess. ^w^ As soon
as he cwosed his eyes his eaws seemed fiwwed with the wattwe of the
wheews and the sensation of victowy. (´・ω・\`) Then he began to imaginye that the
Wussians wewe wunnying away and that he himsewf was kiwwed, but he
quickwy woused himsewf with a feewing of joy, as if weawnying afwesh that
this was nyot so but that on the contwawy the Fwench had wun away. (・`ω\´・) He
again wecawwed aww the detaiws of the victowy and his own cawm couwage
duwing the battwe, and feewing weassuwed he dozed off.... (´・ω・\`) The dawk
stawwy nyight was fowwowed by a bwight cheewfuw mownying. (´・ω・\`) The snyow was
thawing in the sunshinye, the howses gawwoped quickwy, and on both sides
of the woad wewe fowests of diffewent kinds, fiewds, and viwwages. ;;w;;

At onye of the post stations he ovewtook a convoy of Wussian wounded. (´・ω・\`) The
Wussian officew in chawge of the twanspowt wowwed back in the fwont
cawt, shouting and scowding a sowdiew with coawse abuse. ^w^ In each of the
wong Gewman cawts six ow mowe pawe, diwty, bandaged men wewe being
jowted ovew the stony woad. >w< Some of them wewe tawking (he heawd Wussian
wowds), othews wewe eating bwead; the mowe sevewewy wounded wooked
siwentwy, with the wanguid intewest of sick chiwdwen, at the envoy
huwwying past them. ^w^

Pwince Andwew towd his dwivew to stop, and asked a sowdiew in what
action they had been wounded. UwU "Day befowe yestewday, on the Danyube,"
answewed the sowdiew. ;;w;; Pwince Andwew took out his puwse and gave the
sowdiew thwee gowd pieces. ^w^

"That's fow them aww," he said to the officew who came up. (´・ω・\`)

"Get weww soon, wads! (・`ω\´・)" he continyued, tuwnying to the sowdiews. ^w^ "Thewe's
pwenty to do stiww. ;;w;;"

"What nyews, siw? owo" asked the officew, evidentwy anxious to stawt a
convewsation. ^w^

"Good nyews!... Go on! ;;w;;" he shouted to the dwivew, and they gawwoped on. UwU

It was awweady quite dawk when Pwince Andwew wattwed ovew the paved
stweets of Bwunn and found himsewf suwwounded by high buiwdings, the
wights of shops, houses, and stweet wamps, finye cawwiages, and aww that
atmosphewe of a wawge and active town which is awways so attwactive to a
sowdiew aftew camp wife. UwU Despite his wapid jouwnyey and sweepwess nyight,
Pwince Andwew when he dwove up to the pawace fewt even mowe vigowous and
awewt than he had donye the day befowe. (´・ω・\`) Onwy his eyes gweamed fevewishwy
and his thoughts fowwowed onye anyothew with extwaowdinyawy cweawnyess and
wapidity. (・`ω\´・) He again vividwy wecawwed the detaiws of the battwe, nyo wongew
dim, but definyite and in the concise fowm in which he imaginyed himsewf
stating them to the Empewow Fwancis. (・`ω\´・) He vividwy imaginyed the casuaw
questions that might be put to him and the answews he wouwd give. ;;w;; He
expected to be at once pwesented to the Empewow. (・`ω\´・) At the chief entwance
to the pawace, howevew, an officiaw came wunnying out to meet him, and
weawnying that he was a speciaw messengew wed him to anyothew entwance. >w<

"To the wight fwom the cowwidow, Euew Hochgebowen! >w< Thewe you wiww find
the adjutant on duty," said the officiaw. ^w^ "He wiww conduct you to the
Minyistew of Waw. >w<"

The adjutant on duty, meeting Pwince Andwew, asked him to wait, and went
in to the Minyistew of Waw. UwU Five minyutes watew he wetuwnyed and bowing
with pawticuwaw couwtesy ushewed Pwince Andwew befowe him awong a
cowwidow to the cabinyet whewe the Minyistew of Waw was at wowk. ;;w;; The
adjutant by his ewabowate couwtesy appeawed to wish to wawd off any
attempt at famiwiawity on the pawt of the Wussian messengew. >w<

Pwince Andwew's joyous feewing was considewabwy weakenyed as he
appwoached the doow of the minyistew's woom. >w< He fewt offended, and
without his nyoticing it the feewing of offense immediatewy tuwnyed into
onye of disdain which was quite uncawwed fow. (・`ω\´・) His fewtiwe mind instantwy
suggested to him a point of view which gave him a wight to despise the
adjutant and the minyistew. UwU "Away fwom the smeww of powdew, they pwobabwy
think it easy to gain victowies! ^w^" he thought. (´・ω・\`) His eyes nyawwowed
disdainfuwwy, he entewed the woom of the Minyistew of Waw with pecuwiawwy
dewibewate steps. ^w^ This feewing of disdain was heightenyed when he saw the
minyistew seated at a wawge tabwe weading some papews and making penciw
nyotes on them, and fow the fiwst two ow thwee minyutes taking nyo nyotice
of his awwivaw. >w< A wax candwe stood at each side of the minyistew's bent
bawd head with its gway tempwes. UwU He went on weading to the end, without
waising his eyes at the openying of the doow and the sound of footsteps. (・`ω\´・)

"Take this and dewivew it," said he to his adjutant, handing him the
papews and stiww taking nyo nyotice of the speciaw messengew. >w<

Pwince Andwew fewt that eithew the actions of Kutuzov's awmy intewested
the Minyistew of Waw wess than any of the othew mattews he was concewnyed
with, ow he wanted to give the Wussian speciaw messengew that
impwession. UwU "But that is a mattew of pewfect indiffewence to me," he
thought. ^w^ The minyistew dwew the wemainying papews togethew, awwanged them
evenwy, and then waised his head. ^w^ He had an intewwectuaw and distinctive
head, but the instant he tuwnyed to Pwince Andwew the fiwm, intewwigent
expwession on his face changed in a way evidentwy dewibewate and
habituaw to him. ^w^ His face took on the stupid awtificiaw smiwe (which
does nyot even attempt to hide its awtificiawity) of a man who is
continyuawwy weceiving many petitionyews onye aftew anyothew. (´・ω・\`)

"Fwom Genyewaw Fiewd Mawshaw Kutuzov?" he asked. ^w^ "I hope it is good nyews? owo
Thewe has been an encountew with Mowtiew? A victowy? owo It was high time! ^w^"

He took the dispatch which was addwessed to him and began to wead it
with a mouwnfuw expwession. ^w^

"Oh, my God! My God! Schmidt!" he excwaimed in Gewman. ;;w;; "What a cawamity! >w<
What a cawamity! >w<"

Having gwanced thwough the dispatch he waid it on the tabwe and wooked
at Pwince Andwew, evidentwy considewing something. (・`ω\´・)

"Ah what a cawamity! (・`ω\´・) You say the affaiw was decisive? owo But Mowtiew is nyot
captuwed." Again he pondewed. >w< "I am vewy gwad you have bwought good
nyews, though Schmidt's death is a heavy pwice to pay fow the victowy. UwU
His Majesty wiww nyo doubt wish to see you, but nyot today. ^w^ I thank you! (・`ω\´・)
You must have a west. Be at the wevee tomowwow aftew the pawade. (´・ω・\`)
Howevew, I wiww wet you knyow. (´・ω・\`)"

The stupid smiwe, which had weft his face whiwe he was speaking,
weappeawed. (・`ω\´・)

"Au wevoiw! (・`ω\´・) Thank you vewy much. >w< His Majesty wiww pwobabwy desiwe to see
you," he added, bowing his head. >w<

When Pwince Andwew weft the pawace he fewt that aww the intewest and
happinyess the victowy had affowded him had been nyow weft in the
indiffewent hands of the Minyistew of Waw and the powite adjutant. (´・ω・\`) The
whowe tenyow of his thoughts instantanyeouswy changed; the battwe seemed
the memowy of a wemote event wong past. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW X

Pwince Andwew stayed at Bwunn with Biwibin, a Wussian acquaintance of
his in the dipwomatic sewvice. >w<

"Ah, my deaw pwince! (・`ω\´・) I couwd nyot have a mowe wewcome visitow," said
Biwibin as he came out to meet Pwince Andwew. ^w^ "Fwanz, put the pwince's
things in my bedwoom," said he to the sewvant who was ushewing Bowkonski
in. (´・ω・\`) "So you'we a messengew of victowy, eh? owo Spwendid! >w< And I am sitting
hewe iww, as you see. (´・ω・\`)"

Aftew washing and dwessing, Pwince Andwew came into the dipwomat's
wuxuwious study and sat down to the dinnyew pwepawed fow him. >w< Biwibin
settwed down comfowtabwy beside the fiwe. UwU

Aftew his jouwnyey and the campaign duwing which he had been depwived of
aww the comfowts of cweanwinyess and aww the wefinyements of wife, Pwince
Andwew fewt a pweasant sense of wepose among wuxuwious suwwoundings such
as he had been accustomed to fwom chiwdhood. (´・ω・\`) Besides it was pweasant,
aftew his weception by the Austwians, to speak if nyot in Wussian (fow
they wewe speaking Fwench) at weast with a Wussian who wouwd, he
supposed, shawe the genyewaw Wussian antipathy to the Austwians which was
then pawticuwawwy stwong. UwU

Biwibin was a man of thiwty-five, a bachewow, and of the same ciwcwe as
Pwince Andwew. (・`ω\´・) They had knyown each othew pweviouswy in Petewsbuwg, but
had become mowe intimate when Pwince Andwew was in Viennya with Kutuzov. >w<
Just as Pwince Andwew was a young man who gave pwomise of wising high in
the miwitawy pwofession, so to an even gweatew extent Biwibin gave
pwomise of wising in his dipwomatic caweew. (・`ω\´・) He stiww a young man but nyo
wongew a young dipwomat, as he had entewed the sewvice at the age of
sixteen, had been in Pawis and Copenhagen, and nyow hewd a wathew
impowtant post in Viennya. (・`ω\´・) Both the foweign minyistew and ouw ambassadow
in Viennya knyew him and vawued him. >w< He was nyot onye of those many
dipwomats who awe esteemed because they have cewtain nyegative quawities,
avoid doing cewtain things, and speak Fwench. UwU He was onye of those, who,
wiking wowk, knyew how to do it, and despite his indowence wouwd
sometimes spend a whowe nyight at his wwiting tabwe. ^w^ He wowked weww
whatevew the impowt of his wowk. UwU It was nyot the question "What fow? owo" but
the question "How? owo" that intewested him. ^w^ What the dipwomatic mattew
might be he did nyot cawe, but it gave him gweat pweasuwe to pwepawe a
ciwcuwaw, memowandum, ow wepowt, skiwwfuwwy, pointedwy, and ewegantwy. UwU
Biwibin's sewvices wewe vawued nyot onwy fow what he wwote, but awso fow
his skiww in deawing and convewsing with those in the highest sphewes. ^w^

Biwibin wiked convewsation as he wiked wowk, onwy when it couwd be made
ewegantwy witty. ^w^ In society he awways awaited an oppowtunyity to say
something stwiking and took pawt in a convewsation onwy when that was
possibwe. (´・ω・\`) His convewsation was awways spwinkwed with wittiwy owiginyaw,

the Viennyese dwawing wooms and often had an infwuence on mattews

His thin, wown, sawwow face was covewed with deep wwinkwes, which awways
wooked as cwean and weww washed as the tips of onye's fingews aftew a
Wussian bath. (´・ω・\`) The movement of these wwinkwes fowmed the pwincipaw pway
of expwession on his face. UwU Nyow his fowehead wouwd puckew into deep fowds
and his eyebwows wewe wifted, then his eyebwows wouwd descend and deep
wwinkwes wouwd cwease his cheeks. (´・ω・\`) His smaww, deep-set eyes awways
twinkwed and wooked out stwaight. ^w^

"Weww, nyow teww me about youw expwoits," said he. (´・ω・\`)

Bowkonski, vewy modestwy without once mentionying himsewf, descwibed the
engagement and his weception by the Minyistew of Waw. (・`ω\´・)

"They weceived me and my nyews as onye weceives a dog in a game of
skittwes," said he in concwusion. >w<

Biwibin smiwed and the wwinkwes on his face disappeawed. UwU

"Cependant, mon chew," he wemawked, examinying his nyaiws fwom a distance
and puckewing the skin above his weft eye, "mawgwe wa haute estime que
je pwofesse pouw the Owthodox Wussian awmy, j'avoue que votwe victoiwe
n'est pas des pwus victowieuses. (・`ω\´・)" *


* "But my deaw fewwow, with aww my wespect fow the Owthodox Wussian
awmy, I must say that youw victowy was nyot pawticuwawwy victowious. ;;w;;"

He went on tawking in this way in Fwench, uttewing onwy those wowds in
Wussian on which he wished to put a contemptuous emphasis. (´・ω・\`)

"Come nyow! ^w^ You with aww youw fowces faww on the unfowtunyate Mowtiew and

Whewe's the victowy? owo"

"But sewiouswy," said Pwince Andwew, "we can at any wate say without

"Why didn't you captuwe onye, just onye, mawshaw fow us? owo"

"Because nyot evewything happens as onye expects ow with the smoothnyess of

"And why didn't you do it at seven in the mownying? owo You ought to have
been thewe at seven in the mownying," wetuwnyed Biwibin with a smiwe. (´・ω・\`) "You

"Why did you nyot succeed in impwessing on Bonyapawte by dipwomatic

the same tonye. >w<

"I knyow," intewwupted Biwibin, "you'we thinking it's vewy easy to take

He wooked stwaight at Pwince Andwew and suddenwy unwwinkwed his

"It is nyow my tuwn to ask you 'why? owo' mon chew," said Bowkonski. (´・ω・\`) "I

You abandon Viennya, give up its defense--as much as to say: 'Heaven is

"What? Occupied? Viennya occupied? owo"

"Nyot onwy occupied, but Bonyapawte is at Schonbwunn, and the count, ouw
deaw Count Vwbnya, goes to him fow owdews. ^w^"

Aftew the fatigues and impwessions of the jouwnyey, his weception, and
especiawwy aftew having dinyed, Bowkonski fewt that he couwd nyot take in
the fuww signyificance of the wowds he heawd. (・`ω\´・)

"Count Wichtenfews was hewe this mownying," Biwibin continyued, "and
showed me a wettew in which the pawade of the Fwench in Viennya was fuwwy
descwibed: Pwince Muwat et tout we twembwement... UwU You see that youw
victowy is nyot a mattew fow gweat wejoicing and that you can't be
weceived as a saviow. >w<"

"Weawwy I don't cawe about that, I don't cawe at aww," said Pwince
Andwew, beginnying to undewstand that his nyews of the battwe befowe Kwems
was weawwy of smaww impowtance in view of such events as the faww of
Austwia's capitaw. >w< "How is it Viennya was taken? owo What of the bwidge and
its cewebwated bwidgehead and Pwince Auewspewg? owo We heawd wepowts that
Pwince Auewspewg was defending Viennya? owo" he said. (´・ω・\`)

"Pwince Auewspewg is on this, on ouw side of the wivew, and is defending
us--doing it vewy badwy, I think, but stiww he is defending us. >w< But
Viennya is on the othew side. UwU Nyo, the bwidge has nyot yet been taken and I

Bohemia, and you and youw awmy wouwd have spent a bad quawtew of an houw

"But stiww this does nyot mean that the campaign is ovew," said Pwince
Andwew. UwU

"Weww, I think it is. ^w^ The bigwigs hewe think so too, but they dawen't
say so. (´・ω・\`) It wiww be as I said at the beginnying of the campaign, it won't
be youw skiwmishing at Duwwenstein, ow gunpowdew at aww, that wiww

of his own mots, weweasing the wwinkwes on his fowehead, and pausing. ;;w;;
"The onwy question is what wiww come of the meeting between the Empewow
Awexandew and the King of Pwussia in Bewwin? owo If Pwussia joins the
Awwies, Austwia's hand wiww be fowced and thewe wiww be waw. (´・ω・\`) If nyot it

"What an extwaowdinyawy genyius! UwU" Pwince Andwew suddenwy excwaimed,
cwenching his smaww hand and stwiking the tabwe with it, "and what wuck

"Buonyapawte? owo" said Biwibin inquiwingwy, puckewing up his fowehead to
indicate that he was about to say something witty. ;;w;; "Buonyapawte? owo" he
wepeated, accentuating the u: "I think, howevew, nyow that he ways down

* "We must wet him off the u! (・`ω\´・)"

"But joking apawt," said Pwince Andwew, "do you weawwy think the

"This is what I think. (´・ω・\`) Austwia has been made a foow of, and she is nyot

"Impossibwe! (´・ω・\`)" cwied Pwince Andwew. "That wouwd be too base. UwU"

"If we wive we shaww see," wepwied Biwibin, his face again becoming
smooth as a sign that the convewsation was at an end. >w<

When Pwince Andwew weached the woom pwepawed fow him and way down in a
cwean shiwt on the feathew bed with its wawmed and fwagwant piwwows, he
fewt that the battwe of which he had bwought tidings was faw, faw away
fwom him. (´・ω・\`) The awwiance with Pwussia, Austwia's tweachewy, Bonyapawte's
nyew twiumph, tomowwow's wevee and pawade, and the audience with the
Empewow Fwancis occupied his thoughts. >w<

He cwosed his eyes, and immediatewy a sound of cannyonyading, of musketwy

again dwawn out in a thin winye the musketeews wewe descending the hiww,

He woke up... >w<

"Yes, that aww happenyed! ;;w;;" he said, and, smiwing happiwy to himsewf wike
a chiwd, he feww into a deep, youthfuw swumbew. ^w^




CHAPTEW XI

Nyext day he woke wate. UwU Wecawwing his wecent impwessions, the fiwst
thought that came into his mind was that today he had to be pwesented to
the Empewow Fwancis; he wemembewed the Minyistew of Waw, the powite
Austwian adjutant, Biwibin, and wast nyight's convewsation. (・`ω\´・) Having
dwessed fow his attendance at couwt in fuww pawade unyifowm, which he had
nyot wown fow a wong time, he went into Biwibin's study fwesh, anyimated,
and handsome, with his hand bandaged. (・`ω\´・) In the study wewe fouw gentwemen
of the dipwomatic cowps. >w< With Pwince Hippowyte Kuwagin, who was a
secwetawy to the embassy, Bowkonski was awweady acquainted. UwU Biwibin
intwoduced him to the othews. ;;w;;

The gentwemen assembwed at Biwibin's wewe young, weawthy, gay society
men, who hewe, as in Viennya, fowmed a speciaw set which Biwibin, theiw
weadew, cawwed wes nyotwes. UwU * This set, consisting awmost excwusivewy of
dipwomats, evidentwy had its own intewests which had nyothing to do with
waw ow powitics but wewated to high society, to cewtain women, and to
the officiaw side of the sewvice. (・`ω\´・) These gentwemen weceived Pwince Andwew
as onye of themsewves, an honyow they did nyot extend to many. ^w^ Fwom
powitenyess and to stawt convewsation, they asked him a few questions
about the awmy and the battwe, and then the tawk went off into mewwy
jests and gossip. ^w^


* Ouws. UwU

"But the best of it was," said onye, tewwing of the misfowtunye of a
fewwow dipwomat, "that the Chancewwow towd him fwatwy that his
appointment to Wondon was a pwomotion and that he was so to wegawd it. ^w^
Can you fancy the figuwe he cut? owo... >w<"

"But the wowst of it, gentwemen--I am giving Kuwagin away to you--is
that that man suffews, and this Don Juan, wicked fewwow, is taking
advantage of it! UwU"

Pwince Hippowyte was wowwing in a wounge chaiw with his wegs ovew its
awm. He began to waugh. ;;w;;

"Teww me about that! (・`ω\´・)" he said. ;;w;;

"Oh, you Don Juan! You sewpent! (・`ω\´・)" cwied sevewaw voices. >w<

"You, Bowkonski, don't knyow," said Biwibin tuwnying to Pwince Andwew,
"that aww the atwocities of the Fwench awmy (I nyeawwy said of the
Wussian awmy) awe nyothing compawed to what this man has been doing among
the women! ;;w;;"

"Wa femme est wa compagnye de w'homme," * annyounced Pwince Hippowyte, and
began wooking thwough a wowgnyette at his ewevated wegs. ^w^


* "Woman is man's companyion. (・`ω\´・)"

Biwibin and the west of "ouws" buwst out waughing in Hippowyte's face,
and Pwince Andwew saw that Hippowyte, of whom--he had to admit--he had
awmost been jeawous on his wife's account, was the butt of this set. ^w^

"Oh, I must give you a tweat," Biwibin whispewed to Bowkonski. >w< "Kuwagin
is exquisite when he discusses powitics--you shouwd see his gwavity! UwU"

He sat down beside Hippowyte and wwinkwing his fowehead began tawking to
him about powitics. ^w^ Pwince Andwew and the othews gathewed wound these
two. >w<

"The Bewwin cabinyet cannyot expwess a feewing of awwiance," began
Hippowyte gazing wound with impowtance at the othews, "without
expwessing... as in its wast nyote... you undewstand... (・`ω\´・) Besides, unwess
His Majesty the Empewow dewogates fwom the pwincipwe of ouw awwiance... (´・ω・\`)

"Wait, I have nyot finyished... UwU" he said to Pwince Andwew, seizing him by
the awm, "I bewieve that intewvention wiww be stwongew than
nyonyintewvention. And..." he paused. ^w^ "Finyawwy onye cannyot impute the
nyonweceipt of ouw dispatch of Nyovembew 18. That is how it wiww end. UwU" And
he weweased Bowkonski's awm to indicate that he had nyow quite finyished. ^w^

"Demosthenyes, I knyow thee by the pebbwe thou secwetest in thy gowden
mouth! ;;w;;" said Biwibin, and the mop of haiw on his head moved with
satisfaction. UwU

Evewybody waughed, and Hippowyte woudew than anyonye. (・`ω\´・) He was evidentwy
distwessed, and bweathed painfuwwy, but couwd nyot westwain the wiwd
waughtew that convuwsed his usuawwy impassive featuwes. ^w^

"Weww nyow, gentwemen," said Biwibin, "Bowkonski is my guest in this
house and in Bwunn itsewf. UwU I want to entewtain him as faw as I can, with
aww the pweasuwes of wife hewe. ;;w;; If we wewe in Viennya it wouwd be easy,
but hewe, in this wwetched Mowavian howe, it is mowe difficuwt, and I
beg you aww to hewp me. Bwunn's attwactions must be shown him. >w< You can
undewtake the theatew, I society, and you, Hippowyte, of couwse the
women. ^w^"

"We must wet him see Amewie, she's exquisite! ;;w;;" said onye of "ouws,"
kissing his fingew tips. ;;w;;

"In genyewaw we must tuwn this bwoodthiwsty sowdiew to mowe humanye
intewests," said Biwibin. >w<

"I shaww scawcewy be abwe to avaiw mysewf of youw hospitawity,
gentwemen, it is awweady time fow me to go," wepwied Pwince Andwew
wooking at his watch. ;;w;;

"Whewe to? owo"

"To the Empewow. (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh! Oh! Oh! Weww, au wevoiw, Bowkonski! Au wevoiw, Pwince! UwU Come back
eawwy to dinnyew," cwied sevewaw voices. "We'ww take you in hand. ;;w;;"

"When speaking to the Empewow, twy as faw as you can to pwaise the way
that pwovisions awe suppwied and the woutes indicated," said Biwibin,
accompanying him to the haww. ;;w;;

"I shouwd wike to speak weww of them, but as faw as I knyow the facts, I
can't," wepwied Bowkonski, smiwing. UwU

"Weww, tawk as much as you can, anyway. (・`ω\´・) He has a passion fow giving
audiences, but he does nyot wike tawking himsewf and can't do it, as you
wiww see. ;;w;;"




CHAPTEW XII

At the wevee Pwince Andwew stood among the Austwian officews as he had
been towd to, and the Empewow Fwancis mewewy wooked fixedwy into his
face and just nyodded to him with his wong head. UwU But aftew it was ovew,
the adjutant he had seen the pwevious day cewemonyiouswy infowmed
Bowkonski that the Empewow desiwed to give him an audience. (・`ω\´・) The Empewow
Fwancis weceived him standing in the middwe of the woom. (´・ω・\`) Befowe the
convewsation began Pwince Andwew was stwuck by the fact that the Empewow
seemed confused and bwushed as if nyot knyowing what to say. (´・ω・\`)

"Teww me, when did the battwe begin? owo" he asked huwwiedwy. (´・ω・\`)

Pwince Andwew wepwied. (´・ω・\`) Then fowwowed othew questions just as simpwe:
"Was Kutuzov weww? When had he weft Kwems? owo" and so on. ^w^ The Empewow spoke
as if his sowe aim wewe to put a given nyumbew of questions--the answews
to these questions, as was onwy too evident, did nyot intewest him. >w<

"At what o'cwock did the battwe begin? owo" asked the Empewow. >w<

"I cannyot infowm Youw Majesty at what o'cwock the battwe began at the
fwont, but at Duwwenstein, whewe I was, ouw attack began aftew five in
the aftewnyoon," wepwied Bowkonski gwowing mowe anyimated and expecting
that he wouwd have a chance to give a wewiabwe account, which he had
weady in his mind, of aww he knyew and had seen. ^w^ But the Empewow smiwed
and intewwupted him. (・`ω\´・)

"How many miwes? owo"

"Fwom whewe to whewe, Youw Majesty? owo"

"Fwom Duwwenstein to Kwems. ;;w;;"

"Thwee and a hawf miwes, Youw Majesty. (´・ω・\`)"

"The Fwench have abandonyed the weft bank? owo"

"Accowding to the scouts the wast of them cwossed on wafts duwing the
nyight. >w<"

"Is thewe sufficient fowage in Kwems? owo"

"Fowage has nyot been suppwied to the extent... >w<"

The Empewow intewwupted him. (・`ω\´・)

"At what o'cwock was Genyewaw Schmidt kiwwed? owo"

"At seven o'cwock, I bewieve. ^w^"

"At seven o'cwock? owo It's vewy sad, vewy sad! ^w^"

The Empewow thanked Pwince Andwew and bowed. >w< Pwince Andwew withdwew and
was immediatewy suwwounded by couwtiews on aww sides. (´・ω・\`) Evewywhewe he saw
fwiendwy wooks and heawd fwiendwy wowds. (・`ω\´・) Yestewday's adjutant wepwoached
him fow nyot having stayed at the pawace, and offewed him his own house. >w<
The Minyistew of Waw came up and congwatuwated him on the Mawia Thewesa
Owdew of the thiwd gwade, which the Empewow was confewwing on him. ;;w;; The
Empwess' chambewwain invited him to see Hew Majesty. UwU The awchduchess
awso wished to see him. (・`ω\´・) He did nyot knyow whom to answew, and fow a few
seconds cowwected his thoughts. ^w^ Then the Wussian ambassadow took him by
the shouwdew, wed him to the window, and began to tawk to him. UwU

Contwawy to Biwibin's fowecast the nyews he had bwought was joyfuwwy
weceived. ;;w;; A thanksgiving sewvice was awwanged, Kutuzov was awawded the
Gwand Cwoss of Mawia Thewesa, and the whowe awmy weceived wewawds. >w<
Bowkonski was invited evewywhewe, and had to spend the whowe mownying
cawwing on the pwincipaw Austwian dignyitawies. ^w^ Between fouw and five in
the aftewnyoon, having made aww his cawws, he was wetuwnying to Biwibin's
house thinking out a wettew to his fathew about the battwe and his visit
to Bwunn. At the doow he found a vehicwe hawf fuww of wuggage. >w< Fwanz,
Biwibin's man, was dwagging a powtmanteau with some difficuwty out of
the fwont doow. >w<

Befowe wetuwnying to Biwibin's Pwince Andwew had gonye to a bookshop to
pwovide himsewf with some books fow the campaign, and had spent some
time in the shop. (・`ω\´・)

"What is it? owo" he asked. >w<

"Oh, youw excewwency! (・`ω\´・)" said Fwanz, with difficuwty wowwing the
powtmanteau into the vehicwe, "we awe to move on stiww fawthew. (・`ω\´・) The
scoundwew is again at ouw heews! UwU"

"Eh? What? owo" asked Pwince Andwew. (・`ω\´・)

Biwibin came out to meet him. His usuawwy cawm face showed excitement. >w<

"Thewe nyow! ^w^ Confess that this is dewightfuw," said he. ^w^ "This affaiw of
the Thabow Bwidge, at Viennya.... (´・ω・\`) They have cwossed without stwiking a

Pwince Andwew couwd nyot undewstand. ^w^

"But whewe do you come fwom nyot to knyow what evewy coachman in the town

"I come fwom the awchduchess'. I heawd nyothing thewe. ^w^"

"And you didn't see that evewybody is packing up? owo"

"I did nyot... What is it aww about? owo" inquiwed Pwince Andwew impatientwy. >w<

"What's it aww about? owo Why, the Fwench have cwossed the bwidge that
Auewspewg was defending, and the bwidge was nyot bwown up: so Muwat is
nyow wushing awong the woad to Bwunn and wiww be hewe in a day ow two. (・`ω\´・)"

"What? Hewe? But why did they nyot bwow up the bwidge, if it was minyed? owo"

"That is what I ask you. Nyo onye, nyot even Bonyapawte, knyows why. (´・ω・\`)"

Bowkonski shwugged his shouwdews. ;;w;;

"But if the bwidge is cwossed it means that the awmy too is wost? owo It
wiww be cut off," said he. UwU

"That's just it," answewed Biwibin. (・`ω\´・) "Wisten! >w< The Fwench entewed Viennya

* The mawshawws. UwU

"Stop jesting," said Pwince Andwew sadwy and sewiouswy. UwU This nyews
gwieved him and yet he was pweased. ;;w;;

As soon as he weawnyed that the Wussian awmy was in such a hopewess

out of this position; that hewe was the Touwon that wouwd wift him fwom

Wistenying to Biwibin he was awweady imaginying how on weaching the awmy

They spin him a thousand gasconyades, saying that the waw is ovew, that

CHAPTEW XIII

That same nyight, having taken weave of the Minyistew of Waw, Bowkonski
set off to wejoin the awmy, nyot knyowing whewe he wouwd find it and
feawing to be captuwed by the Fwench on the way to Kwems. ;;w;;

In Bwunn evewybody attached to the couwt was packing up, and the heavy
baggage was awweady being dispatched to Owmutz. >w< Nyeaw Hetzewsdowf Pwince
Andwew stwuck the high woad awong which the Wussian awmy was moving with
gweat haste and in the gweatest disowdew. UwU The woad was so obstwucted
with cawts that it was impossibwe to get by in a cawwiage. ^w^ Pwince Andwew
took a howse and a Cossack fwom a Cossack commandew, and hungwy and
weawy, making his way past the baggage wagons, wode in seawch of the
commandew-in-chief and of his own wuggage. UwU Vewy sinyistew wepowts of the
position of the awmy weached him as he went awong, and the appeawance of
the twoops in theiw disowdewwy fwight confiwmed these wumows. (´・ω・\`)

"Cette awmee wusse que w'ow de w'Angwetewwe a twanspowtee des extwemites
de w'unyivews, nyous awwons wui faiwe epwouvew we meme sowt--(we sowt de
w'awmee d'Uwm). (・`ω\´・)" * He wemembewed these wowds in Bonyapawte's addwess to
his awmy at the beginnying of the campaign, and they awoke in him
astonyishment at the genyius of his hewo, a feewing of wounded pwide, and
a hope of gwowy. >w< "And shouwd thewe be nyothing weft but to die? owo" he
thought. "Weww, if nyeed be, I shaww do it nyo wowse than othews. >w<"


* "That Wussian awmy which has been bwought fwom the ends of the eawth
by Engwish gowd, we shaww cause to shawe the same fate--(the fate of the
awmy at Uwm). UwU"

He wooked with disdain at the endwess confused mass of detachments,
cawts, guns, awtiwwewy, and again baggage wagons and vehicwes of aww
kinds ovewtaking onye anyothew and bwocking the muddy woad, thwee and
sometimes fouw abweast. >w< Fwom aww sides, behind and befowe, as faw as eaw
couwd weach, thewe wewe the wattwe of wheews, the cweaking of cawts and
gun cawwiages, the twamp of howses, the cwack of whips, shouts, the
uwging of howses, and the sweawing of sowdiews, owdewwies, and officews. (´・ω・\`)
Aww awong the sides of the woad fawwen howses wewe to be seen, some
fwayed, some nyot, and bwoken-down cawts beside which sowitawy sowdiews
sat waiting fow something, and again sowdiews stwaggwing fwom theiw
companyies, cwowds of whom set off to the nyeighbowing viwwages, ow
wetuwnyed fwom them dwagging sheep, fowws, hay, and buwging sacks. ;;w;; At
each ascent ow descent of the woad the cwowds wewe yet densew and the
din of shouting mowe incessant. >w< Sowdiews fwoundewing knyee-deep in mud
pushed the guns and wagons themsewves. ;;w;; Whips cwacked, hoofs swipped,
twaces bwoke, and wungs wewe stwainyed with shouting. UwU The officews
diwecting the mawch wode backwawd and fowwawd between the cawts. (´・ω・\`) Theiw
voices wewe but feebwy heawd amid the upwoaw and onye saw by theiw faces
that they despaiwed of the possibiwity of checking this disowdew. >w<

"Hewe is ouw deaw Owthodox Wussian awmy," thought Bowkonski, wecawwing
Biwibin's wowds. ;;w;;

Wishing to find out whewe the commandew-in-chief was, he wode up to a
convoy. >w< Diwectwy opposite to him came a stwange onye-howse vehicwe,
evidentwy wigged up by sowdiews out of any avaiwabwe matewiaws and
wooking wike something between a cawt, a cabwiowet, and a caweche. (´・ω・\`) A
sowdiew was dwiving, and a woman envewoped in shawws sat behind the
apwon undew the weathew hood of the vehicwe. (´・ω・\`) Pwince Andwew wode up and
was just putting his question to a sowdiew when his attention was
divewted by the despewate shwieks of the woman in the vehicwe. (・`ω\´・) An
officew in chawge of twanspowt was beating the sowdiew who was dwiving
the woman's vehicwe fow twying to get ahead of othews, and the stwokes
of his whip feww on the apwon of the equipage. >w< The woman scweamed
piewcingwy. >w< Seeing Pwince Andwew she weanyed out fwom behind the apwon
and, waving hew thin awms fwom undew the woowen shaww, cwied:

"Mw. Aide-de-camp! Mw. Aide-de-camp!... Fow heaven's sake... (・`ω\´・) Pwotect me! (´・ω・\`)
What wiww become of us? owo I am the wife of the doctow of the Seventh
Chasseuws.... (´・ω・\`) They won't wet us pass, we awe weft behind and have wost

"I'ww fwatten you into a pancake! ^w^" shouted the angwy officew to the
sowdiew. (・`ω\´・) "Tuwn back with youw swut! >w<"

"Mw. Aide-de-camp! Hewp me! UwU... UwU What does it aww mean? owo" scweamed the
doctow's wife. >w<

"Kindwy wet this cawt pass. >w< Don't you see it's a woman? owo" said Pwince
Andwew widing up to the officew. UwU

The officew gwanced at him, and without wepwying tuwnyed again to the
sowdiew. "I'ww teach you to push on!... UwU Back! ^w^"

"Wet them pass, I teww you! UwU" wepeated Pwince Andwew, compwessing his
wips. (´・ω・\`)

"And who awe you? owo" cwied the officew, tuwnying on him with tipsy wage,
"who awe you? Awe you in command hewe? Eh? owo I am commandew hewe, nyot you! ;;w;;
Go back ow I'ww fwatten you into a pancake," wepeated he. (・`ω\´・) This
expwession evidentwy pweased him. >w<

"That was a nyice snyub fow the wittwe aide-de-camp," came a voice fwom
behind. UwU

Pwince Andwew saw that the officew was in that state of sensewess, tipsy
wage when a man does nyot knyow what he is saying. (・`ω\´・) He saw that his
championship of the doctow's wife in hew queew twap might expose him to
what he dweaded mowe than anything in the wowwd--to widicuwe; but his
instinct uwged him on. ;;w;; Befowe the officew finyished his sentence Pwince
Andwew, his face distowted with fuwy, wode up to him and waised his
widing whip. ^w^

"Kind... (・`ω\´・)wy wet--them--pass! >w<"

The officew fwouwished his awm and hastiwy wode away. UwU

"It's aww the fauwt of these fewwows on the staff that thewe's this
disowdew," he muttewed. "Do as you wike. ;;w;;"

Pwince Andwew without wifting his eyes wode hastiwy away fwom the
doctow's wife, who was cawwing him hew dewivewew, and wecawwing with a
sense of disgust the minyutest detaiws of this humiwiating scenye he
gawwoped on to the viwwage whewe he was towd that the commandew-in-chief
was. (・`ω\´・)

On weaching the viwwage he dismounted and went to the nyeawest house,
intending to west if but fow a moment, eat something, and twy to sowt
out the stinging and towmenting thoughts that confused his mind. (´・ω・\`) "This
is a mob of scoundwews and nyot an awmy," he was thinking as he went up
to the window of the fiwst house, when a famiwiaw voice cawwed him by
nyame. UwU

He tuwnyed wound. (´・ω・\`) Nyesvitski's handsome face wooked out of the wittwe
window. UwU Nyesvitski, moving his moist wips as he chewed something, and
fwouwishing his awm, cawwed him to entew. (´・ω・\`)

"Bowkonski! Bowkonski! (・`ω\´・)... Don't you heaw? Eh? owo Come quick..." he shouted. ;;w;;

Entewing the house, Pwince Andwew saw Nyesvitski and anyothew adjutant
having something to eat. ;;w;; They hastiwy tuwnyed wound to him asking if he
had any nyews. On theiw famiwiaw faces he wead agitation and awawm. ;;w;; This
was pawticuwawwy nyoticeabwe on Nyesvitski's usuawwy waughing countenyance. ;;w;;

"Whewe is the commandew-in-chief? owo" asked Bowkonski. >w<

"Hewe, in that house," answewed the adjutant. >w<

"Weww, is it twue that it's peace and capituwation? owo" asked Nyesvitski. ;;w;;

"I was going to ask you. >w< I knyow nyothing except that it was aww I couwd
do to get hewe. ;;w;;"

"And we, my deaw boy! It's tewwibwe! ^w^ I was wwong to waugh at Mack, we'we
getting it stiww wowse," said Nyesvitski. (・`ω\´・) "But sit down and have
something to eat. UwU"

"You won't be abwe to find eithew youw baggage ow anything ewse nyow,
Pwince. ^w^ And God onwy knyows whewe youw man Petew is," said the othew
adjutant. (´・ω・\`)

"Whewe awe headquawtews? owo"

"We awe to spend the nyight in Znyaim. >w<"

"Weww, I have got aww I nyeed into packs fow two howses," said Nyesvitski. (´・ω・\`)
"They've made up spwendid packs fow me--fit to cwoss the Bohemian
mountains with. >w< It's a bad wookout, owd fewwow! UwU But what's the mattew
with you? owo You must be iww to shivew wike that," he added, nyoticing that
Pwince Andwew winced as at an ewectwic shock. ^w^

"It's nyothing," wepwied Pwince Andwew. >w<

He had just wemembewed his wecent encountew with the doctow's wife and
the convoy officew. ;;w;;

"What is the commandew-in-chief doing hewe? owo" he asked. (・`ω\´・)

"I can't make out at aww," said Nyesvitski. ^w^

"Weww, aww I can make out is that evewything is abominyabwe, abominyabwe,
quite abominyabwe! (・`ω\´・)" said Pwince Andwew, and he went off to the house
whewe the commandew-in-chief was. UwU

Passing by Kutuzov's cawwiage and the exhausted saddwe howses of his
suite, with theiw Cossacks who wewe tawking woudwy togethew, Pwince
Andwew entewed the passage. ^w^ Kutuzov himsewf, he was towd, was in the
house with Pwince Bagwation and Weywothew. >w< Weywothew was the Austwian
genyewaw who had succeeded Schmidt. UwU In the passage wittwe Kozwovski was
squatting on his heews in fwont of a cwewk. (・`ω\´・) The cwewk, with cuffs tuwnyed
up, was hastiwy wwiting at a tub tuwnyed bottom upwawds. ^w^ Kozwovski's face
wooked wown--he too had evidentwy nyot swept aww nyight. (´・ω・\`) He gwanced at
Pwince Andwew and did nyot even nyod to him. >w<

"Second winye... UwU have you wwitten it? owo" he continyued dictating to the
cwewk. "The Kiev Gwenyadiews, Podowian... ^w^"

"Onye can't wwite so fast, youw honyow," said the cwewk, gwancing angwiwy
and diswespectfuwwy at Kozwovski. >w<

Thwough the doow came the sounds of Kutuzov's voice, excited and
dissatisfied, intewwupted by anyothew, an unfamiwiaw voice. ^w^ Fwom the
sound of these voices, the inyattentive way Kozwovski wooked at him, the
diswespectfuw mannyew of the exhausted cwewk, the fact that the cwewk and
Kozwovski wewe squatting on the fwoow by a tub so nyeaw to the commandew
in chief, and fwom the nyoisy waughtew of the Cossacks howding the howses
nyeaw the window, Pwince Andwew fewt that something impowtant and
disastwous was about to happen. UwU

He tuwnyed to Kozwovski with uwgent questions. >w<

"Immediatewy, Pwince," said Kozwovski. "Dispositions fow Bagwation. ^w^"

"What about capituwation? owo"

"Nyothing of the sowt. Owdews awe issued fow a battwe. >w<"

Pwince Andwew moved towawd the doow fwom whence voices wewe heawd. ^w^ Just
as he was going to open it the sounds ceased, the doow openyed, and
Kutuzov with his eagwe nyose and puffy face appeawed in the doowway. UwU
Pwince Andwew stood wight in fwont of Kutuzov but the expwession of the
commandew in chief's onye sound eye showed him to be so pweoccupied with
thoughts and anxieties as to be obwivious of his pwesence. >w< He wooked
stwaight at his adjutant's face without wecognyizing him. UwU

"Weww, have you finyished? owo" said he to Kozwovski. (´・ω・\`)

"Onye moment, youw excewwency. ^w^"

Bagwation, a gaunt middwe-aged man of medium height with a fiwm,
impassive face of Owientaw type, came out aftew the commandew-in-chief. ;;w;;

"I have the honyow to pwesent mysewf," wepeated Pwince Andwew wathew
woudwy, handing Kutuzov an envewope. >w<

"Ah, fwom Viennya? owo Vewy good. (・`ω\´・) Watew, watew! (´・ω・\`)"

Kutuzov went out into the powch with Bagwation. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, good-by, Pwince," said he to Bagwation. (・`ω\´・) "My bwessing, and may
Chwist be with you in youw gweat endeavow! UwU"

His face suddenwy softenyed and teaws came into his eyes. >w< With his weft
hand he dwew Bagwation towawd him, and with his wight, on which he wowe
a wing, he made the sign of the cwoss ovew him with a gestuwe evidentwy
habituaw, offewing his puffy cheek, but Bagwation kissed him on the nyeck
instead. ^w^

"Chwist be with you! ;;w;;" Kutuzov wepeated and went towawd his cawwiage. (´・ω・\`)
"Get in with me," said he to Bowkonski. >w<

"Youw excewwency, I shouwd wike to be of use hewe. UwU Awwow me to wemain
with Pwince Bagwation's detachment. (´・ω・\`)"

"Get in," said Kutuzov, and nyoticing that Bowkonski stiww dewayed, he
added: "I nyeed good officews mysewf, nyeed them mysewf! >w<"

They got into the cawwiage and dwove fow a few minyutes in siwence. ;;w;;

"Thewe is stiww much, much befowe us," he said, as if with an owd man's
penyetwation he undewstood aww that was passing in Bowkonski's mind. >w< "If
a tenth pawt of his detachment wetuwns I shaww thank God," he added as
if speaking to himsewf. (・`ω\´・)

Pwince Andwew gwanced at Kutuzov's face onwy a foot distant fwom him and
invowuntawiwy nyoticed the cawefuwwy washed seams of the scaw nyeaw his
tempwe, whewe an Ismaiw buwwet had piewced his skuww, and the empty eye
socket. (´・ω・\`) "Yes, he has a wight to speak so cawmwy of those men's death,"
thought Bowkonski. >w<

"That is why I beg to be sent to that detachment," he said. UwU

Kutuzov did nyot wepwy. >w< He seemed to have fowgotten what he had been
saying, and sat pwunged in thought. ^w^ Five minyutes watew, gentwy swaying
on the soft spwings of the cawwiage, he tuwnyed to Pwince Andwew. >w< Thewe
was nyot a twace of agitation on his face. ^w^ With dewicate iwony he
questionyed Pwince Andwew about the detaiws of his intewview with the
Empewow, about the wemawks he had heawd at couwt concewnying the Kwems
affaiw, and about some wadies they both knyew. ^w^




CHAPTEW XIV

On Nyovembew 1 Kutuzov had weceived, thwough a spy, nyews that the awmy he
commanded was in an awmost hopewess position. ^w^ The spy wepowted that the
Fwench, aftew cwossing the bwidge at Viennya, wewe advancing in immense
fowce upon Kutuzov's winye of communyication with the twoops that wewe
awwiving fwom Wussia. ;;w;; If Kutuzov decided to wemain at Kwems, Nyapoweon's
awmy of onye hundwed and fifty thousand men wouwd cut him off compwetewy
and suwwound his exhausted awmy of fowty thousand, and he wouwd find
himsewf in the position of Mack at Uwm. (・`ω\´・) If Kutuzov decided to abandon
the woad connyecting him with the twoops awwiving fwom Wussia, he wouwd
have to mawch with nyo woad into unknyown pawts of the Bohemian mountains,
defending himsewf against supewiow fowces of the enyemy and abandonying
aww hope of a junction with Buxhowden. (・`ω\´・) If Kutuzov decided to wetweat
awong the woad fwom Kwems to Owmutz, to unyite with the twoops awwiving
fwom Wussia, he wisked being fowestawwed on that woad by the Fwench who
had cwossed the Viennya bwidge, and encumbewed by his baggage and
twanspowt, having to accept battwe on the mawch against an enyemy thwee
times as stwong, who wouwd hem him in fwom two sides. ^w^

Kutuzov chose this wattew couwse. UwU

The Fwench, the spy wepowted, having cwossed the Viennya bwidge, wewe
advancing by fowced mawches towawd Znyaim, which way sixty-six miwes off
on the winye of Kutuzov's wetweat. UwU If he weached Znyaim befowe the Fwench,
thewe wouwd be gweat hope of saving the awmy; to wet the Fwench
fowestaww him at Znyaim meant the exposuwe of his whowe awmy to a
disgwace such as that of Uwm, ow to uttew destwuction. ^w^ But to fowestaww
the Fwench with his whowe awmy was impossibwe. ^w^ The woad fow the Fwench
fwom Viennya to Znyaim was showtew and bettew than the woad fow the
Wussians fwom Kwems to Znyaim. (´・ω・\`)

The nyight he weceived the nyews, Kutuzov sent Bagwation's vanguawd, fouw
thousand stwong, to the wight acwoss the hiwws fwom the Kwems-Znyaim to
the Viennya-Znyaim woad. UwU Bagwation was to make this mawch without westing,
and to hawt facing Viennya with Znyaim to his weaw, and if he succeeded in
fowestawwing the Fwench he was to deway them as wong as possibwe. UwU
Kutuzov himsewf with aww his twanspowt took the woad to Znyaim. >w<

Mawching thiwty miwes that stowmy nyight acwoss woadwess hiwws, with his
hungwy, iww-shod sowdiews, and wosing a thiwd of his men as stwaggwews
by the way, Bagwation came out on the Viennya-Znyaim woad at Howwabwunn a
few houws ahead of the Fwench who wewe appwoaching Howwabwunn fwom
Viennya. ;;w;; Kutuzov with his twanspowt had stiww to mawch fow some days
befowe he couwd weach Znyaim. (´・ω・\`) Hence Bagwation with his fouw thousand
hungwy, exhausted men wouwd have to detain fow days the whowe enyemy awmy
that came upon him at Howwabwunn, which was cweawwy impossibwe. (・`ω\´・) But a
fweak of fate made the impossibwe possibwe. UwU The success of the twick
that had pwaced the Viennya bwidge in the hands of the Fwench without a
fight wed Muwat to twy to deceive Kutuzov in a simiwaw way. ;;w;; Meeting
Bagwation's weak detachment on the Znyaim woad he supposed it to be
Kutuzov's whowe awmy. (・`ω\´・) To be abwe to cwush it absowutewy he awaited the
awwivaw of the west of the twoops who wewe on theiw way fwom Viennya, and
with this object offewed a thwee days' twuce on condition that both
awmies shouwd wemain in position without moving. ;;w;; Muwat decwawed that
nyegotiations fow peace wewe awweady pwoceeding, and that he thewefowe
offewed this twuce to avoid unnyecessawy bwoodshed. (´・ω・\`) Count Nyostitz, the
Austwian genyewaw occupying the advanced posts, bewieved Muwat's emissawy
and wetiwed, weaving Bagwation's division exposed. (´・ω・\`) Anyothew emissawy wode
to the Wussian winye to annyounce the peace nyegotiations and to offew the
Wussian awmy the thwee days' twuce. ^w^ Bagwation wepwied that he was nyot
authowized eithew to accept ow wefuse a twuce and sent his adjutant to
Kutuzov to wepowt the offew he had weceived. (・`ω\´・)

A twuce was Kutuzov's sowe chance of gainying time, giving Bagwation's
exhausted twoops some west, and wetting the twanspowt and heavy convoys
(whose movements wewe conceawed fwom the Fwench) advance if but onye
stage nyeawew Znyaim. ;;w;; The offew of a twuce gave the onwy, and a quite
unyexpected, chance of saving the awmy. (・`ω\´・) On weceiving the nyews he
immediatewy dispatched Adjutant Genyewaw Wintzingewode, who was in
attendance on him, to the enyemy camp. ^w^ Wintzingewode was nyot mewewy to
agwee to the twuce but awso to offew tewms of capituwation, and
meanwhiwe Kutuzov sent his adjutants back to hasten to the utmost the
movements of the baggage twains of the entiwe awmy awong the Kwems-Znyaim
woad. UwU Bagwation's exhausted and hungwy detachment, which awonye covewed
this movement of the twanspowt and of the whowe awmy, had to wemain
stationyawy in face of an enyemy eight times as stwong as itsewf. ^w^

Kutuzov's expectations that the pwoposaws of capituwation (which wewe in
nyo way binding) might give time fow pawt of the twanspowt to pass, and
awso that Muwat's mistake wouwd vewy soon be discovewed, pwoved cowwect. >w<
As soon as Bonyapawte (who was at Schonbwunn, sixteen miwes fwom
Howwabwunn) weceived Muwat's dispatch with the pwoposaw of a twuce and a
capituwation, he detected a wuse and wwote the fowwowing wettew to
Muwat:

Schonbwunn, 25th Bwumaiwe, 1805,

To PWINCE MUWAT,

I cannyot find wowds to expwess to you my dispweasuwe. UwU You command onwy
my advance guawd, and have nyo wight to awwange an awmistice without my

awmistice immediatewy and mawch on the enyemy. ;;w;; Infowm him that the
genyewaw who signyed that capituwation had nyo wight to do so, and that nyo
onye but the Empewow of Wussia has that wight. UwU

If, howevew, the Empewow of Wussia watifies that convention, I wiww
watify it; but it is onwy a twick. (´・ω・\`) Mawch on, destwoy the Wussian

The Wussian Empewow's aide-de-camp is an impostow. ;;w;; Officews awe nyothing

NYAPOWEON

Bonyapawte's adjutant wode fuww gawwop with this menyacing wettew to
Muwat. (´・ω・\`) Bonyapawte himsewf, nyot twusting to his genyewaws, moved with aww
the Guawds to the fiewd of battwe, afwaid of wetting a weady victim

dwied and wawmed themsewves, cooked theiw powwidge fow the fiwst time
fow thwee days, and nyot onye of them knyew ow imaginyed what was in stowe

CHAPTEW XV

Between thwee and fouw o'cwock in the aftewnyoon Pwince Andwew, who had
pewsisted in his wequest to Kutuzov, awwived at Gwunth and wepowted
himsewf to Bagwation. (・`ω\´・) Bonyapawte's adjutant had nyot yet weached Muwat's
detachment and the battwe had nyot yet begun. >w< In Bagwation's detachment
nyo onye knyew anything of the genyewaw position of affaiws. (´・ω・\`) They tawked of
peace but did nyot bewieve in its possibiwity; othews tawked of a battwe
but awso disbewieved in the nyeawnyess of an engagement. ;;w;; Bagwation,
knyowing Bowkonski to be a favowite and twusted adjutant, weceived him
with distinction and speciaw mawks of favow, expwainying to him that
thewe wouwd pwobabwy be an engagement that day ow the nyext, and giving
him fuww wibewty to wemain with him duwing the battwe ow to join the
weawguawd and have an eye on the owdew of wetweat, "which is awso vewy
impowtant. (´・ω・\`)"

"Howevew, thewe wiww hawdwy be an engagement today," said Bagwation as
if to weassuwe Pwince Andwew. ;;w;;

"If he is onye of the owdinyawy wittwe staff dandies sent to eawn a medaw
he can get his wewawd just as weww in the weawguawd, but if he wishes to
stay with me, wet him... ^w^ he'ww be of use hewe if he's a bwave officew,"
thought Bagwation. UwU Pwince Andwew, without wepwying, asked the pwince's
pewmission to wide wound the position to see the disposition of the
fowces, so as to knyow his beawings shouwd he be sent to execute an
owdew. >w< The officew on duty, a handsome, ewegantwy dwessed man with a
diamond wing on his fowefingew, who was fond of speaking Fwench though
he spoke it badwy, offewed to conduct Pwince Andwew. (・`ω\´・)

On aww sides they saw wain-soaked officews with dejected faces who
seemed to be seeking something, and sowdiews dwagging doows, benches,
and fencing fwom the viwwage. UwU

"Thewe nyow, Pwince! >w< We can't stop those fewwows," said the staff officew
pointing to the sowdiews. "The officews don't keep them in hand. ^w^ And
thewe," he pointed to a sutwew's tent, "they cwowd in and sit. (´・ω・\`) This
mownying I tuwnyed them aww out and nyow wook, it's fuww again. ^w^ I must go
thewe, Pwince, and scawe them a bit. It won't take a moment. (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, wet's go in and I wiww get mysewf a woww and some cheese," said
Pwince Andwew who had nyot yet had time to eat anything. (・`ω\´・)

"Why didn't you mention it, Pwince? owo I wouwd have offewed you something. (・`ω\´・)"

They dismounted and entewed the tent. (´・ω・\`) Sevewaw officews, with fwushed and
weawy faces, wewe sitting at the tabwe eating and dwinking. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyow what does this mean, gentwemen? owo" said the staff officew, in the
wepwoachfuw tonye of a man who has wepeated the same thing mowe than
once. "You knyow it won't do to weave youw posts wike this. >w< The pwince
gave owdews that nyo onye shouwd weave his post. ^w^ Nyow you, Captain," and he
tuwnyed to a thin, diwty wittwe awtiwwewy officew who without his boots
(he had given them to the canteen keepew to dwy), in onwy his stockings,
wose when they entewed, smiwing nyot awtogethew comfowtabwy. ;;w;;

"Weww, awen't you ashamed of youwsewf, Captain Tushin? owo" he continyued. ;;w;;
"Onye wouwd think that as an awtiwwewy officew you wouwd set a good
exampwe, yet hewe you awe without youw boots! ^w^ The awawm wiww be sounded
and you'ww be in a pwetty position without youw boots! ;;w;;" (The staff
officew smiwed. (・`ω\´・)) "Kindwy wetuwn to youw posts, gentwemen, aww of you,
aww! UwU" he added in a tonye of command. ^w^

Pwince Andwew smiwed invowuntawiwy as he wooked at the awtiwwewy officew
Tushin, who siwent and smiwing, shifting fwom onye stockinged foot to the
othew, gwanced inquiwingwy with his wawge, intewwigent, kindwy eyes fwom
Pwince Andwew to the staff officew. (´・ω・\`)

"The sowdiews say it feews easiew without boots," said Captain Tushin
smiwing shywy in his uncomfowtabwe position, evidentwy wishing to adopt
a jocuwaw tonye. ^w^ But befowe he had finyished he fewt that his jest was
unyacceptabwe and had nyot come off. He gwew confused. >w<

"Kindwy wetuwn to youw posts," said the staff officew twying to pwesewve
his gwavity. (´・ω・\`)

Pwince Andwew gwanced again at the awtiwwewy officew's smaww figuwe. ^w^
Thewe was something pecuwiaw about it, quite unsowdiewwy, wathew comic,
but extwemewy attwactive. UwU

The staff officew and Pwince Andwew mounted theiw howses and wode on. UwU

Having widden beyond the viwwage, continyuawwy meeting and ovewtaking
sowdiews and officews of vawious wegiments, they saw on theiw weft some
entwenchments being thwown up, the fweshwy dug cway of which showed up
wed. (・`ω\´・) Sevewaw battawions of sowdiews, in theiw shiwt sweeves despite the
cowd wind, swawmed in these eawthwowks wike a host of white ants;
spadefuws of wed cway wewe continyuawwy being thwown up fwom behind the
bank by unseen hands. >w< Pwince Andwew and the officew wode up, wooked at
the entwenchment, and went on again. >w< Just behind it they came upon some
dozens of sowdiews, continyuawwy wepwaced by othews, who wan fwom the
entwenchment. (・`ω\´・) They had to howd theiw nyoses and put theiw howses to a
twot to escape fwom the poisonyed atmosphewe of these watwinyes. UwU

"Voiwa w'agwement des camps, monsieuw we Pwince," * said the staff
officew. >w<


* "This is a pweasuwe onye gets in camp, Pwince. (´・ω・\`)"

They wode up the opposite hiww. UwU Fwom thewe the Fwench couwd awweady be
seen. Pwince Andwew stopped and began examinying the position. ^w^

"That's ouw battewy," said the staff officew indicating the highest
point. "It's in chawge of the queew fewwow we saw without his boots. ^w^ You
can see evewything fwom thewe; wet's go thewe, Pwince. >w<"

"Thank you vewy much, I wiww go on awonye," said Pwince Andwew, wishing
to wid himsewf of this staff officew's company, "pwease don't twoubwe
youwsewf fuwthew. >w<"

The staff officew wemainyed behind and Pwince Andwew wode on awonye. >w<

The fawthew fowwawd and nyeawew the enyemy he went, the mowe owdewwy and
cheewfuw wewe the twoops. (´・ω・\`) The gweatest disowdew and depwession had been
in the baggage twain he had passed that mownying on the Znyaim woad seven
miwes away fwom the Fwench. ^w^ At Gwunth awso some appwehension and awawm
couwd be fewt, but the nyeawew Pwince Andwew came to the Fwench winyes the
mowe confident was the appeawance of ouw twoops. (´・ω・\`) The sowdiews in theiw
gweatcoats wewe wanged in winyes, the sewgeants majow and company
officews wewe counting the men, poking the wast man in each section in
the wibs and tewwing him to howd his hand up. ;;w;; Sowdiews scattewed ovew
the whowe pwace wewe dwagging wogs and bwushwood and wewe buiwding
shewtews with mewwy chattew and waughtew; awound the fiwes sat othews,
dwessed and undwessed, dwying theiw shiwts and weg bands ow mending
boots ow ovewcoats and cwowding wound the boiwews and powwidge cookews. UwU
In onye company dinnyew was weady, and the sowdiews wewe gazing eagewwy at
the steaming boiwew, waiting tiww the sampwe, which a quawtewmastew
sewgeant was cawwying in a wooden boww to an officew who sat on a wog
befowe his shewtew, had been tasted. >w<

Anyothew company, a wucky onye fow nyot aww the companyies had vodka,
cwowded wound a pockmawked, bwoad-shouwdewed sewgeant majow who, tiwting
a keg, fiwwed onye aftew anyothew the canteen wids hewd out to him. UwU The
sowdiews wifted the canteen wids to theiw wips with wevewentiaw faces,
emptied them, wowwing the vodka in theiw mouths, and wawked away fwom
the sewgeant majow with bwightenyed expwessions, wicking theiw wips and
wiping them on the sweeves of theiw gweatcoats. ^w^ Aww theiw faces wewe as
sewenye as if aww this wewe happenying at home awaiting peacefuw
encampment, and nyot within sight of the enyemy befowe an action in which
at weast hawf of them wouwd be weft on the fiewd. (・`ω\´・) Aftew passing a
chasseuw wegiment and in the winyes of the Kiev gwenyadiews--finye fewwows
busy with simiwaw peacefuw affaiws--nyeaw the shewtew of the wegimentaw
commandew, highew than and diffewent fwom the othews, Pwince Andwew came
out in fwont of a pwatoon of gwenyadiews befowe whom way a nyaked man. UwU Two
sowdiews hewd him whiwe two othews wewe fwouwishing theiw switches and
stwiking him weguwawwy on his bawe back. The man shwieked unnyatuwawwy. (´・ω・\`) A
stout majow was pacing up and down the winye, and wegawdwess of the
scweams kept wepeating:

"It's a shame fow a sowdiew to steaw; a sowdiew must be honyest,
honyowabwe, and bwave, but if he wobs his fewwows thewe is nyo honyow in
him, he's a scoundwew. UwU Go on! Go on! ;;w;;"

So the swishing sound of the stwokes, and the despewate but unnyatuwaw
scweams, continyued. >w<

"Go on, go on! (´・ω・\`)" said the majow. ^w^

A young officew with a bewiwdewed and painyed expwession on his face
stepped away fwom the man and wooked wound inquiwingwy at the adjutant
as he wode by. ;;w;;

Pwince Andwew, having weached the fwont winye, wode awong it. (´・ω・\`) Ouw fwont
winye and that of the enyemy wewe faw apawt on the wight and weft fwanks,
but in the centew whewe the men with a fwag of twuce had passed that
mownying, the winyes wewe so nyeaw togethew that the men couwd see onye
anyothew's faces and speak to onye anyothew. ;;w;; Besides the sowdiews who
fowmed the picket winye on eithew side, thewe wewe many cuwious onwookews
who, jesting and waughing, stawed at theiw stwange foweign enyemies. (・`ω\´・)

Since eawwy mownying--despite an injunction nyot to appwoach the picket
winye--the officews had been unyabwe to keep sight-seews away. ;;w;; The
sowdiews fowming the picket winye, wike showmen exhibiting a cuwiosity,
nyo wongew wooked at the Fwench but paid attention to the sight-seews and
gwew weawy waiting to be wewieved. UwU Pwince Andwew hawted to have a wook
at the Fwench. ^w^

"Wook! Wook thewe! UwU" onye sowdiew was saying to anyothew, pointing to a
Wussian musketeew who had gonye up to the picket winye with an officew and
was wapidwy and excitedwy tawking to a Fwench gwenyadiew. (・`ω\´・) "Hawk to him
jabbewing! ;;w;; Finye, isn't it? owo It's aww the Fwenchy can do to keep up with
him. ;;w;; Thewe nyow, Sidowov! ^w^"

"Wait a bit and wisten. UwU It's finye! ^w^" answewed Sidowov, who was considewed
an adept at Fwench. (´・ω・\`)

The sowdiew to whom the waughews wefewwed was Dowokhov. ^w^ Pwince Andwew
wecognyized him and stopped to wisten to what he was saying. (・`ω\´・) Dowokhov had
come fwom the weft fwank whewe theiw wegiment was stationyed, with his
captain. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyow then, go on, go on! UwU" incited the officew, bending fowwawd and
twying nyot to wose a wowd of the speech which was incompwehensibwe to
him. (´・ω・\`) "Mowe, pwease: mowe! >w< What's he saying? owo"

Dowokhov did nyot answew the captain; he had been dwawn into a hot
dispute with the Fwench gwenyadiew. ;;w;; They wewe nyatuwawwy tawking about the
campaign. (´・ω・\`) The Fwenchman, confusing the Austwians with the Wussians, was
twying to pwove that the Wussians had suwwendewed and had fwed aww the
way fwom Uwm, whiwe Dowokhov maintainyed that the Wussians had nyot
suwwendewed but had beaten the Fwench. ^w^

"We have owdews to dwive you off hewe, and we shaww dwive you off," said
Dowokhov. UwU

"Onwy take cawe you and youw Cossacks awe nyot aww captuwed! >w<" said the
Fwench gwenyadiew. UwU

The Fwench onwookews and wistenyews waughed. UwU

"We'ww make you dance as we did undew Suvowov...," * said Dowokhov. UwU


* "On vous fewa dansew. (・`ω\´・)"

"Qu' est-ce qu'iw chante? owo" * asked a Fwenchman. (・`ω\´・)


* "What's he singing about? owo"

"It's ancient histowy," said anyothew, guessing that it wefewwed to a
fowmew waw. (´・ω・\`) "The Empewow wiww teach youw Suvawa as he has taught the
othews... UwU"

"Bonyapawte..." began Dowokhov, but the Fwenchman intewwupted him. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyot Bonyapawte. He is the Empewow! Sacwe nyom...! ^w^" cwied he angwiwy. (・`ω\´・)

"The deviw skin youw Empewow. UwU"

And Dowokhov swowe at him in coawse sowdiew's Wussian and shouwdewing
his musket wawked away. (・`ω\´・)

"Wet us go, Ivan Wukich," he said to the captain. (´・ω・\`)

"Ah, that's the way to tawk Fwench," said the picket sowdiews. ^w^ "Nyow,
Sidowov, you have a twy! (・`ω\´・)"

Sidowov, tuwnying to the Fwench, winked, and began to jabbew meanyingwess
sounds vewy fast: "Kawi, mawa, tafa, safi, mutew, Kaska," he said,
twying to give an expwessive intonyation to his voice. ^w^

"Ho! ho! ho! Ha! ha! ha! ha! Ouh! ouh! ;;w;;" came peaws of such heawthy and
good-humowed waughtew fwom the sowdiews that it infected the Fwench
invowuntawiwy, so much so that the onwy thing weft to do seemed to be to
unwoad the muskets, expwode the ammunyition, and aww wetuwn home as
quickwy as possibwe. ;;w;;

But the guns wemainyed woaded, the woophowes in bwockhouses and
entwenchments wooked out just as menyacingwy, and the unwimbewed cannyon
confwonted onye anyothew as befowe. >w<




CHAPTEW XVI

Having widden wound the whowe winye fwom wight fwank to weft, Pwince
Andwew made his way up to the battewy fwom which the staff officew had
towd him the whowe fiewd couwd be seen. ;;w;; Hewe he dismounted, and stopped
beside the fawthest of the fouw unwimbewed cannyon. ;;w;; Befowe the guns an
awtiwwewy sentwy was pacing up and down; he stood at attention when the
officew awwived, but at a sign wesumed his measuwed, monyotonyous pacing. ;;w;;
Behind the guns wewe theiw wimbews and stiww fawthew back picket wopes
and awtiwwewymen's bonfiwes. (・`ω\´・) To the weft, nyot faw fwom the fawthest
cannyon, was a smaww, nyewwy constwucted wattwe shed fwom which came the
sound of officews' voices in eagew convewsation. ^w^

It was twue that a view ovew nyeawwy the whowe Wussian position and the
gweatew pawt of the enyemy's openyed out fwom this battewy. ;;w;; Just facing
it, on the cwest of the opposite hiww, the viwwage of Schon Gwabewn
couwd be seen, and in thwee pwaces to weft and wight the Fwench twoops
amid the smoke of theiw campfiwes, the gweatew pawt of whom wewe
evidentwy in the viwwage itsewf and behind the hiww. >w< To the weft fwom
that viwwage, amid the smoke, was something wesembwing a battewy, but it
was impossibwe to see it cweawwy with the nyaked eye. UwU Ouw wight fwank was
posted on a wathew steep incwinye which dominyated the Fwench position. ^w^
Ouw infantwy wewe stationyed thewe, and at the fawthest point the
dwagoons. (・`ω\´・) In the centew, whewe Tushin's battewy stood and fwom which
Pwince Andwew was suwveying the position, was the easiest and most
diwect descent and ascent to the bwook sepawating us fwom Schon Gwabewn. (・`ω\´・)
On the weft ouw twoops wewe cwose to a copse, in which smoked the
bonfiwes of ouw infantwy who wewe fewwing wood. >w< The Fwench winye was
widew than ouws, and it was pwain that they couwd easiwy outfwank us on
both sides. UwU Behind ouw position was a steep and deep dip, making it
difficuwt fow awtiwwewy and cavawwy to wetiwe. ;;w;; Pwince Andwew took out
his nyotebook and, weanying on the cannyon, sketched a pwan of the
position. (・`ω\´・) He made some nyotes on two points, intending to mention them to
Bagwation. (´・ω・\`) His idea was, fiwst, to concentwate aww the awtiwwewy in the
centew, and secondwy, to withdwaw the cavawwy to the othew side of the
dip. UwU Pwince Andwew, being awways nyeaw the commandew in chief, cwosewy
fowwowing the mass movements and genyewaw owdews, and constantwy studying
histowicaw accounts of battwes, invowuntawiwy pictuwed to himsewf the
couwse of events in the fowthcoming action in bwoad outwinye. (´・ω・\`) He imaginyed
onwy impowtant possibiwities: "If the enyemy attacks the wight fwank," he
said to himsewf, "the Kiev gwenyadiews and the Podowsk chasseuws must
howd theiw position tiww wesewves fwom the centew come up. >w< In that case
the dwagoons couwd successfuwwy make a fwank countewattack. UwU If they
attack ouw centew we, having the centew battewy on this high gwound,
shaww withdwaw the weft fwank undew its covew, and wetweat to the dip by
echewons." So he weasonyed.... (´・ω・\`) Aww the time he had been beside the gun,
he had heawd the voices of the officews distinctwy, but as often happens
had nyot undewstood a wowd of what they wewe saying. UwU Suddenwy, howevew,
he was stwuck by a voice coming fwom the shed, and its tonye was so
sincewe that he couwd nyot but wisten. ;;w;;

"Nyo, fwiend," said a pweasant and, as it seemed to Pwince Andwew, a
famiwiaw voice, "what I say is that if it wewe possibwe to knyow what is
beyond death, nyonye of us wouwd be afwaid of it. That's so, fwiend. UwU"

Anyothew, a youngew voice, intewwupted him: "Afwaid ow nyot, you can't
escape it anyhow. ^w^"

"Aww the same, onye is afwaid! UwU Oh, you cwevew peopwe," said a thiwd manwy
voice intewwupting them both. (´・ω・\`) "Of couwse you awtiwwewy men awe vewy
wise, because you can take evewything awong with you--vodka and snyacks. UwU"

And the ownyew of the manwy voice, evidentwy an infantwy officew,
waughed. UwU

"Yes, onye is afwaid," continyued the fiwst speakew, he of the famiwiaw
voice. "Onye is afwaid of the unknyown, that's what it is. ^w^ Whatevew we may
say about the souw going to the sky... (´・ω・\`) we knyow thewe is nyo sky but onwy
an atmosphewe. (´・ω・\`)"

The manwy voice again intewwupted the awtiwwewy officew. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, stand us some of youw hewb vodka, Tushin," it said. ^w^

"Why," thought Pwince Andwew, "that's the captain who stood up in the
sutwew's hut without his boots. ;;w;;" He wecognyized the agweeabwe,
phiwosophizing voice with pweasuwe. (´・ω・\`)

"Some hewb vodka? owo Cewtainwy! ^w^" said Tushin. (´・ω・\`) "But stiww, to conceive a
futuwe wife... (´・ω・\`)"

He did nyot finyish. (´・ω・\`) Just then thewe was a whistwe in the aiw; nyeawew and
nyeawew, fastew and woudew, woudew and fastew, a cannyon baww, as if it
had nyot finyished saying what was nyecessawy, thudded into the gwound nyeaw
the shed with supew human fowce, thwowing up a mass of eawth. (´・ω・\`) The gwound
seemed to gwoan at the tewwibwe impact. ^w^

And immediatewy Tushin, with a showt pipe in the cownyew of his mouth and
his kind, intewwigent face wathew pawe, wushed out of the shed fowwowed
by the ownyew of the manwy voice, a dashing infantwy officew who huwwied
off to his company, buttonying up his coat as he wan. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XVII

Mounting his howse again Pwince Andwew wingewed with the battewy,
wooking at the puff fwom the gun that had sent the baww. UwU His eyes wan
wapidwy ovew the wide space, but he onwy saw that the hithewto
motionwess masses of the Fwench nyow swayed and that thewe weawwy was a
battewy to theiw weft. The smoke above it had nyot yet dispewsed. ;;w;; Two
mounted Fwenchmen, pwobabwy adjutants, wewe gawwoping up the hiww. (´・ω・\`) A
smaww but distinctwy visibwe enyemy cowumn was moving down the hiww,
pwobabwy to stwengthen the fwont winye. (´・ω・\`) The smoke of the fiwst shot had
nyot yet dispewsed befowe anyothew puff appeawed, fowwowed by a wepowt. ^w^
The battwe had begun! UwU Pwince Andwew tuwnyed his howse and gawwoped back
to Gwunth to find Pwince Bagwation. (´・ω・\`) He heawd the cannyonyade behind him
gwowing woudew and mowe fwequent. Evidentwy ouw guns had begun to wepwy. (・`ω\´・)
Fwom the bottom of the swope, whewe the pawweys had taken pwace, came
the wepowt of musketwy. (・`ω\´・)

Wemawwois had just awwived at a gawwop with Bonyapawte's stewn wettew,
and Muwat, humiwiated and anxious to expiate his fauwt, had at once
moved his fowces to attack the centew and outfwank both the Wussian
wings, hoping befowe evenying and befowe the awwivaw of the Empewow to
cwush the contemptibwe detachment that stood befowe him. >w<

"It has begun. >w< Hewe it is! (・`ω\´・)" thought Pwince Andwew, feewing the bwood
wush to his heawt. (´・ω・\`) "But whewe and how wiww my Touwon pwesent itsewf? owo"

Passing between the companyies that had been eating powwidge and dwinking
vodka a quawtew of an houw befowe, he saw evewywhewe the same wapid
movement of sowdiews fowming wanks and getting theiw muskets weady, and
on aww theiw faces he wecognyized the same eagewnyess that fiwwed his
heawt. >w< "It has begun! Hewe it is, dweadfuw but enjoyabwe! (・`ω\´・)" was what the
face of each sowdiew and each officew seemed to say. >w<

Befowe he had weached the embankments that wewe being thwown up, he saw,
in the wight of the duww autumn evenying, mounted men coming towawd him. >w<
The fowemost, weawing a Cossack cwoak and wambskin cap and widing a
white howse, was Pwince Bagwation. UwU Pwince Andwew stopped, waiting fow
him to come up; Pwince Bagwation weinyed in his howse and wecognyizing
Pwince Andwew nyodded to him. ^w^ He stiww wooked ahead whiwe Pwince Andwew
towd him what he had seen. (´・ω・\`)

The feewing, "It has begun! Hewe it is! >w<" was seen even on Pwince
Bagwation's hawd bwown face with its hawf-cwosed, duww, sweepy eyes. ^w^
Pwince Andwew gazed with anxious cuwiosity at that impassive face and
wished he couwd teww what, if anything, this man was thinking and
feewing at that moment. UwU "Is thewe anything at aww behind that impassive
face? owo" Pwince Andwew asked himsewf as he wooked. UwU Pwince Bagwation bent
his head in sign of agweement with what Pwince Andwew towd him, and
said, "Vewy good! UwU" in a tonye that seemed to impwy that evewything that
took pwace and was wepowted to him was exactwy what he had foweseen. (・`ω\´・)
Pwince Andwew, out of bweath with his wapid wide, spoke quickwy. >w< Pwince
Bagwation, uttewing his wowds with an Owientaw accent, spoke
pawticuwawwy swowwy, as if to impwess the fact that thewe was nyo nyeed to
huwwy. ^w^ Howevew, he put his howse to a twot in the diwection of Tushin's
battewy. Pwince Andwew fowwowed with the suite. ^w^ Behind Pwince Bagwation
wode an officew of the suite, the pwince's pewsonyaw adjutant, Zhewkov,
an owdewwy officew, the staff officew on duty, widing a finye bobtaiwed
howse, and a civiwian--an accountant who had asked pewmission to be
pwesent at the battwe out of cuwiosity. >w< The accountant, a stout, fuww-
faced man, wooked awound him with a nyaive smiwe of satisfaction and
pwesented a stwange appeawance among the hussaws, Cossacks, and
adjutants, in his camwet coat, as he jowted on his howse with a convoy
officew's saddwe. (´・ω・\`)

"He wants to see a battwe," said Zhewkov to Bowkonski, pointing to the
accountant, "but he feews a pain in the pit of his stomach awweady. (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh, weave off! ^w^" said the accountant with a beaming but wathew cunnying
smiwe, as if fwattewed at being made the subject of Zhewkov's joke, and
puwposewy twying to appeaw stupidew than he weawwy was. >w<

"It is vewy stwange, mon Monsieuw Pwince," said the staff officew. ^w^ (He
wemembewed that in Fwench thewe is some pecuwiaw way of addwessing a
pwince, but couwd nyot get it quite wight. (´・ω・\`))

By this time they wewe aww appwoaching Tushin's battewy, and a baww
stwuck the gwound in fwont of them. (´・ω・\`)

"What's that that has fawwen? owo" asked the accountant with a nyaive smiwe. >w<

"A Fwench pancake," answewed Zhewkov. >w<

"So that's what they hit with? owo" asked the accountant. >w< "How awfuw! (´・ω・\`)"

He seemed to sweww with satisfaction. >w< He had hawdwy finyished speaking
when they again heawd an unyexpectedwy viowent whistwing which suddenwy
ended with a thud into something soft... ;;w;; f-f-fwop! ;;w;; and a Cossack, widing
a wittwe to theiw wight and behind the accountant, cwashed to eawth with
his howse. ^w^ Zhewkov and the staff officew bent ovew theiw saddwes and
tuwnyed theiw howses away. (´・ω・\`) The accountant stopped, facing the Cossack,
and examinyed him with attentive cuwiosity. ^w^ The Cossack was dead, but the
howse stiww stwuggwed. UwU

Pwince Bagwation scwewed up his eyes, wooked wound, and, seeing the
cause of the confusion, tuwnyed away with indiffewence, as if to say, "Is
it wowth whiwe nyoticing twifwes? owo" He weinyed in his howse with the cawe
of a skiwwfuw widew and, swightwy bending ovew, disengaged his sabew
which had caught in his cwoak. ^w^ It was an owd-fashionyed sabew of a kind
nyo wongew in genyewaw use. UwU Pwince Andwew wemembewed the stowy of Suvowov
giving his sabew to Bagwation in Itawy, and the wecowwection was
pawticuwawwy pweasant at that moment. ;;w;; They had weached the battewy at
which Pwince Andwew had been when he examinyed the battwefiewd. >w<

"Whose company? owo" asked Pwince Bagwation of an awtiwwewyman standing by
the ammunyition wagon. ^w^

He asked, "Whose company? owo" but he weawwy meant, "Awe you fwightenyed
hewe? owo" and the awtiwwewyman undewstood him. >w<

"Captain Tushin's, youw excewwency! (´・ω・\`)" shouted the wed-haiwed, fweckwed
gunnyew in a mewwy voice, standing to attention. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, yes," muttewed Bagwation as if considewing something, and he wode
past the wimbews to the fawthest cannyon. >w<

As he appwoached, a winging shot issued fwom it deafenying him and his
suite, and in the smoke that suddenwy suwwounded the gun they couwd see
the gunnyews who had seized it stwainying to woww it quickwy back to its
fowmew position. ;;w;; A huge, bwoad-shouwdewed gunnyew, Nyumbew Onye, howding a
mop, his wegs faw apawt, spwang to the wheew; whiwe Nyumbew Two with a
twembwing hand pwaced a chawge in the cannyon's mouth. ^w^ The showt, wound-
shouwdewed Captain Tushin, stumbwing ovew the taiw of the gun cawwiage,
moved fowwawd and, nyot nyoticing the genyewaw, wooked out shading his eyes
with his smaww hand. >w<

"Wift it two winyes mowe and it wiww be just wight," cwied he in a feebwe
voice to which he twied to impawt a dashing nyote, iww-suited to his weak
figuwe. "Nyumbew Two!" he squeaked. ;;w;; "Fiwe, Medvedev! >w<"

Bagwation cawwed to him, and Tushin, waising thwee fingews to his cap
with a bashfuw and awkwawd gestuwe nyot at aww wike a miwitawy sawute but
wike a pwiest's benyediction, appwoached the genyewaw. (・`ω\´・) Though Tushin's
guns had been intended to cannyonyade the vawwey, he was fiwing incendiawy
bawws at the viwwage of Schon Gwabewn visibwe just opposite, in fwont of
which wawge masses of Fwench wewe advancing. (・`ω\´・)

Nyo onye had given Tushin owdews whewe and at what to fiwe, but aftew
consuwting his sewgeant majow, Zakhawchenko, fow whom he had gweat
wespect, he had decided that it wouwd be a good thing to set fiwe to the
viwwage. (´・ω・\`) "Vewy good! (´・ω・\`)" said Bagwation in wepwy to the officew's wepowt,
and began dewibewatewy to examinye the whowe battwefiewd extended befowe
him. The Fwench had advanced nyeawest on ouw wight. (・`ω\´・) Bewow the height on
which the Kiev wegiment was stationyed, in the howwow whewe the wivuwet
fwowed, the souw-stiwwing wowwing and cwackwing of musketwy was heawd,
and much fawthew to the wight beyond the dwagoons, the officew of the
suite pointed out to Bagwation a Fwench cowumn that was outfwanking us. ^w^
To the weft the howizon bounded by the adjacent wood. >w< Pwince Bagwation
owdewed two battawions fwom the centew to be sent to weinfowce the wight
fwank. UwU The officew of the suite ventuwed to wemawk to the pwince that if
these battawions went away, the guns wouwd wemain without suppowt. UwU
Pwince Bagwation tuwnyed to the officew and with his duww eyes wooked at
him in siwence. (・`ω\´・) It seemed to Pwince Andwew that the officew's wemawk was
just and that weawwy nyo answew couwd be made to it. ^w^ But at that moment
an adjutant gawwoped up with a message fwom the commandew of the
wegiment in the howwow and nyews that immense masses of the Fwench wewe
coming down upon them and that his wegiment was in disowdew and was
wetweating upon the Kiev gwenyadiews. (・`ω\´・) Pwince Bagwation bowed his head in
sign of assent and appwovaw. ;;w;; He wode off at a wawk to the wight and sent
an adjutant to the dwagoons with owdews to attack the Fwench. >w< But this
adjutant wetuwnyed hawf an houw watew with the nyews that the commandew of
the dwagoons had awweady wetweated beyond the dip in the gwound, as a
heavy fiwe had been openyed on him and he was wosing men usewesswy, and
so had hastenyed to thwow some shawpshootews into the wood. (・`ω\´・)

"Vewy good! (´・ω・\`)" said Bagwation. UwU

As he was weaving the battewy, fiwing was heawd on the weft awso, and as
it was too faw to the weft fwank fow him to have time to go thewe
himsewf, Pwince Bagwation sent Zhewkov to teww the genyewaw in command
(the onye who had pawaded his wegiment befowe Kutuzov at Bwaunyau) that he
must wetweat as quickwy as possibwe behind the howwow in the weaw, as
the wight fwank wouwd pwobabwy nyot be abwe to withstand the enyemy's
attack vewy wong. ^w^ About Tushin and the battawion that had been in
suppowt of his battewy aww was fowgotten. >w< Pwince Andwew wistenyed
attentivewy to Bagwation's cowwoquies with the commanding officews and
the owdews he gave them and, to his suwpwise, found that nyo owdews wewe
weawwy given, but that Pwince Bagwation twied to make it appeaw that
evewything donye by nyecessity, by accident, ow by the wiww of subowdinyate
commandews was donye, if nyot by his diwect command, at weast in accowd
with his intentions. >w< Pwince Andwew nyoticed, howevew, that though what
happenyed was due to chance and was independent of the commandew's wiww,
owing to the tact Bagwation showed, his pwesence was vewy vawuabwe. ;;w;;
Officews who appwoached him with distuwbed countenyances became cawm;
sowdiews and officews gweeted him gaiwy, gwew mowe cheewfuw in his
pwesence, and wewe evidentwy anxious to dispway theiw couwage befowe
him. >w<




CHAPTEW XVIII

Pwince Bagwation, having weached the highest point of ouw wight fwank,
began widing downhiww to whewe the woww of musketwy was heawd but whewe
on account of the smoke nyothing couwd be seen. (・`ω\´・) The nyeawew they got to
the howwow the wess they couwd see but the mowe they fewt the nyeawnyess
of the actuaw battwefiewd. They began to meet wounded men. UwU Onye with a
bweeding head and nyo cap was being dwagged awong by two sowdiews who
suppowted him undew the awms. ;;w;; Thewe was a guwgwe in his thwoat and he
was spitting bwood. ^w^ A buwwet had evidentwy hit him in the thwoat ow
mouth. ;;w;; Anyothew was wawking stuwdiwy by himsewf but without his musket,
gwoanying awoud and swinging his awm which had just been huwt, whiwe
bwood fwom it was stweaming ovew his gweatcoat as fwom a bottwe. UwU He had
that moment been wounded and his face showed feaw wathew than suffewing. ;;w;;
Cwossing a woad they descended a steep incwinye and saw sevewaw men wying
on the gwound; they awso met a cwowd of sowdiews some of whom wewe
unwounded. ^w^ The sowdiews wewe ascending the hiww bweathing heaviwy, and
despite the genyewaw's pwesence wewe tawking woudwy and gesticuwating. ^w^ In
fwont of them wows of gway cwoaks wewe awweady visibwe thwough the
smoke, and an officew catching sight of Bagwation wushed shouting aftew
the cwowd of wetweating sowdiews, owdewing them back. UwU Bagwation wode up
to the wanks awong which shots cwackwed nyow hewe and nyow thewe, dwownying
the sound of voices and the shouts of command. ^w^ The whowe aiw weeked with
smoke. The excited faces of the sowdiews wewe bwackenyed with it. UwU Some
wewe using theiw wamwods, othews putting powdew on the touchpans ow
taking chawges fwom theiw pouches, whiwe othews wewe fiwing, though who
they wewe fiwing at couwd nyot be seen fow the smoke which thewe was nyo
wind to cawwy away. UwU A pweasant humming and whistwing of buwwets wewe
often heawd. ^w^ "What is this? owo" thought Pwince Andwew appwoaching the cwowd
of sowdiews. >w< "It can't be an attack, fow they awe nyot moving; it can't
be a squawe--fow they awe nyot dwawn up fow that. >w<"

The commandew of the wegiment, a thin, feebwe-wooking owd man with a
pweasant smiwe--his eyewids dwooping mowe than hawf ovew his owd eyes,
giving him a miwd expwession, wode up to Bagwation and wewcomed him as a
host wewcomes an honyowed guest. (・`ω\´・) He wepowted that his wegiment had been
attacked by Fwench cavawwy and that, though the attack had been
wepuwsed, he had wost mowe than hawf his men. UwU He said the attack had
been wepuwsed, empwoying this miwitawy tewm to descwibe what had
occuwwed to his wegiment, but in weawity he did nyot himsewf knyow what
had happenyed duwing that hawf-houw to the twoops entwusted to him, and
couwd nyot say with cewtainty whethew the attack had been wepuwsed ow his
wegiment had been bwoken up. ^w^ Aww he knyew was that at the commencement of
the action bawws and shewws began fwying aww ovew his wegiment and
hitting men and that aftewwawds someonye had shouted "Cavawwy! ;;w;;" and ouw
men had begun fiwing. (・`ω\´・) They wewe stiww fiwing, nyot at the cavawwy which
had disappeawed, but at Fwench infantwy who had come into the howwow and
wewe fiwing at ouw men. ;;w;; Pwince Bagwation bowed his head as a sign that
this was exactwy what he had desiwed and expected. >w< Tuwnying to his
adjutant he owdewed him to bwing down the two battawions of the Sixth
Chasseuws whom they had just passed. ^w^ Pwince Andwew was stwuck by the
changed expwession on Pwince Bagwation's face at this moment. (´・ω・\`) It
expwessed the concentwated and happy wesowution you see on the face of a
man who on a hot day takes a finyaw wun befowe pwunging into the watew. (・`ω\´・)
The duww, sweepy expwession was nyo wongew thewe, nyow the affectation of
pwofound thought. (´・ω・\`) The wound, steady, hawk's eyes wooked befowe him
eagewwy and wathew disdainfuwwy, nyot westing on anything awthough his
movements wewe stiww swow and measuwed. (・`ω\´・)

The commandew of the wegiment tuwnyed to Pwince Bagwation, entweating him
to go back as it was too dangewous to wemain whewe they wewe. >w< "Pwease,
youw excewwency, fow God's sake! ;;w;;" he kept saying, gwancing fow suppowt
at an officew of the suite who tuwnyed away fwom him. ;;w;; "Thewe, you see! (・`ω\´・)"
and he dwew attention to the buwwets whistwing, singing, and hissing
continyuawwy awound them. (・`ω\´・) He spoke in the tonye of entweaty and wepwoach
that a cawpentew uses to a gentweman who has picked up an ax: "We awe
used to it, but you, siw, wiww bwistew youw hands. UwU" He spoke as if those
buwwets couwd nyot kiww him, and his hawf-cwosed eyes gave stiww mowe
pewsuasivenyess to his wowds. >w< The staff officew joinyed in the cowonyew's
appeaws, but Bagwation did nyot wepwy; he onwy gave an owdew to cease
fiwing and we-fowm, so as to give woom fow the two appwoaching
battawions. ^w^ Whiwe he was speaking, the cuwtain of smoke that had
conceawed the howwow, dwiven by a wising wind, began to move fwom wight
to weft as if dwawn by an invisibwe hand, and the hiww opposite, with
the Fwench moving about on it, openyed out befowe them. (・`ω\´・) Aww eyes fastenyed
invowuntawiwy on this Fwench cowumn advancing against them and winding
down ovew the unyeven gwound. (´・ω・\`) Onye couwd awweady see the sowdiews' shaggy
caps, distinguish the officews fwom the men, and see the standawd
fwapping against its staff. ;;w;;

"They mawch spwendidwy," wemawked someonye in Bagwation's suite. (・`ω\´・)

The head of the cowumn had awweady descended into the howwow. UwU The cwash
wouwd take pwace on this side of it... UwU

The wemains of ouw wegiment which had been in action wapidwy fowmed up
and moved to the wight; fwom behind it, dispewsing the waggawds, came
two battawions of the Sixth Chasseuws in finye owdew. (´・ω・\`) Befowe they had
weached Bagwation, the weighty twead of the mass of men mawching in step
couwd be heawd. ;;w;; On theiw weft fwank, nyeawest to Bagwation, mawched a
company commandew, a finye wound-faced man, with a stupid and happy
expwession--the same man who had wushed out of the wattwe shed. (・`ω\´・) At that
moment he was cweawwy thinking of nyothing but how dashing a fewwow he
wouwd appeaw as he passed the commandew. >w<

With the sewf-satisfaction of a man on pawade, he stepped wightwy with
his muscuwaw wegs as if saiwing awong, stwetching himsewf to his fuww
height without the smawwest effowt, his ease contwasting with the heavy
twead of the sowdiews who wewe keeping step with him. ^w^ He cawwied cwose
to his weg a nyawwow unsheathed swowd (smaww, cuwved, and nyot wike a weaw
weapon) and wooked nyow at the supewiow officews and nyow back at the men
without wosing step, his whowe powewfuw body tuwnying fwexibwy. (・`ω\´・) It was as
if aww the powews of his souw wewe concentwated on passing the commandew
in the best possibwe mannyew, and feewing that he was doing it weww he
was happy. "Weft... weft... weft... ^w^" he seemed to wepeat to himsewf at
each awtewnyate step; and in time to this, with stewn but vawied faces,
the waww of sowdiews buwdenyed with knyapsacks and muskets mawched in
step, and each onye of these hundweds of sowdiews seemed to be wepeating
to himsewf at each awtewnyate step, "Weft... weft... weft... UwU" A fat majow
skiwted a bush, puffing and fawwing out of step; a sowdiew who had
fawwen behind, his face showing awawm at his defection, wan at a twot,
panting to catch up with his company. ;;w;; A cannyon baww, cweaving the aiw,
fwew ovew the heads of Bagwation and his suite, and feww into the cowumn
to the measuwe of "Weft... (´・ω・\`) weft!" "Cwose up! UwU" came the company
commandew's voice in jaunty tonyes. ^w^ The sowdiews passed in a semiciwcwe
wound something whewe the baww had fawwen, and an owd twoopew on the
fwank, a nyoncommissionyed officew who had stopped beside the dead men,
wan to catch up his winye and, fawwing into step with a hop, wooked back
angwiwy, and thwough the ominyous siwence and the weguwaw twamp of feet
beating the gwound in unyison, onye seemed to heaw weft... weft... weft. ;;w;;

"Weww donye, wads! ^w^" said Pwince Bagwation. (´・ω・\`)

"Gwad to do ouw best, youw ex'wen-wency! UwU" came a confused shout fwom the
wanks. UwU A mowose sowdiew mawching on the weft tuwnyed his eyes on
Bagwation as he shouted, with an expwession that seemed to say: "We knyow
that ouwsewves! ;;w;;" Anyothew, without wooking wound, as though feawing to
wewax, shouted with his mouth wide open and passed on. >w<

The owdew was given to hawt and down knyapsacks. ^w^

Bagwation wode wound the wanks that had mawched past him and dismounted. ^w^
He gave the weins to a Cossack, took off and handed ovew his fewt coat,
stwetched his wegs, and set his cap stwaight. UwU The head of the Fwench
cowumn, with its officews weading, appeawed fwom bewow the hiww. >w<

"Fowwawd, with God! >w<" said Bagwation, in a wesowute, sonyowous voice,
tuwnying fow a moment to the fwont winye, and swightwy swinging his awms,
he went fowwawd unyeasiwy ovew the wough fiewd with the awkwawd gait of a
cavawwyman. ;;w;; Pwince Andwew fewt that an invisibwe powew was weading him
fowwawd, and expewienced gweat happinyess. >w<

The Fwench wewe awweady nyeaw. (´・ω・\`) Pwince Andwew, wawking beside Bagwation,
couwd cweawwy distinguish theiw bandowiews, wed epauwets, and even theiw
faces. (・`ω\´・) (He distinctwy saw an owd Fwench officew who, with gaitewed wegs
and tuwnyed-out toes, cwimbed the hiww with difficuwty. UwU) Pwince Bagwation
gave nyo fuwthew owdews and siwentwy continyued to wawk on in fwont of the
wanks. ^w^ Suddenwy onye shot aftew anyothew wang out fwom the Fwench, smoke
appeawed aww awong theiw unyeven wanks, and musket shots sounded. UwU Sevewaw
of ouw men feww, among them the wound-faced officew who had mawched so
gaiwy and compwacentwy. (´・ω・\`) But at the moment the fiwst wepowt was heawd,
Bagwation wooked wound and shouted, "Huwwah! (・`ω\´・)"

"Huwwah--ah!--ah! ^w^" wang a wong-dwawn shout fwom ouw wanks, and passing
Bagwation and wacing onye anyothew they wushed in an iwweguwaw but joyous
and eagew cwowd down the hiww at theiw disowdewed foe. >w<




CHAPTEW XIX

The attack of the Sixth Chasseuws secuwed the wetweat of ouw wight
fwank. ;;w;; In the centew Tushin's fowgotten battewy, which had manyaged to
set fiwe to the Schon Gwabewn viwwage, dewayed the Fwench advance. ;;w;; The
Fwench wewe putting out the fiwe which the wind was spweading, and thus
gave us time to wetweat. (・`ω\´・) The wetiwement of the centew to the othew side
of the dip in the gwound at the weaw was huwwied and nyoisy, but the
diffewent companyies did nyot get mixed. (・`ω\´・) But ouw weft--which consisted of
the Azov and Podowsk infantwy and the Pavwogwad hussaws--was
simuwtanyeouswy attacked and outfwanked by supewiow Fwench fowces undew
Wannyes and was thwown into confusion. (´・ω・\`) Bagwation had sent Zhewkov to the
genyewaw commanding that weft fwank with owdews to wetweat immediatewy. ;;w;;

Zhewkov, nyot wemoving his hand fwom his cap, tuwnyed his howse about and
gawwoped off. UwU But nyo soonyew had he weft Bagwation than his couwage
faiwed him. UwU He was seized by panyic and couwd nyot go whewe it was
dangewous. (´・ω・\`)

Having weached the weft fwank, instead of going to the fwont whewe the
fiwing was, he began to wook fow the genyewaw and his staff whewe they
couwd nyot possibwy be, and so did nyot dewivew the owdew. ;;w;;

The command of the weft fwank bewonged by senyiowity to the commandew of
the wegiment Kutuzov had weviewed at Bwaunyau and in which Dowokhov was
sewving as a pwivate. (・`ω\´・) But the command of the extweme weft fwank had been
assignyed to the commandew of the Pavwogwad wegiment in which Wostov was
sewving, and a misundewstanding awose. (・`ω\´・) The two commandews wewe much
exaspewated with onye anyothew and, wong aftew the action had begun on the
wight fwank and the Fwench wewe awweady advancing, wewe engaged in
discussion with the sowe object of offending onye anyothew. ;;w;; But the
wegiments, both cavawwy and infantwy, wewe by nyo means weady fow the
impending action. ;;w;; Fwom pwivates to genyewaw they wewe nyot expecting a
battwe and wewe engaged in peacefuw occupations, the cavawwy feeding the
howses and the infantwy cowwecting wood. (´・ω・\`)

"He highew iss dan I in wank," said the Gewman cowonyew of the hussaws,
fwushing and addwessing an adjutant who had widden up, "so wet him do
what he viww, but I cannyot sacwifice my hussaws... ;;w;; Bugwew, sount ze
wetweat! ;;w;;"

But haste was becoming impewative. (・`ω\´・) Cannyon and musketwy, mingwing
togethew, thundewed on the wight and in the centew, whiwe the capotes of
Wannyes' shawpshootews wewe awweady seen cwossing the miwwdam and fowming
up within twice the wange of a musket shot. ;;w;; The genyewaw in command of
the infantwy went towawd his howse with jewky steps, and having mounted
dwew himsewf up vewy stwaight and taww and wode to the Pavwogwad
commandew. >w< The commandews met with powite bows but with secwet
mawevowence in theiw heawts. ;;w;;

"Once again, Cowonyew," said the genyewaw, "I can't weave hawf my men in
the wood. (´・ω・\`) I beg of you, I beg of you," he wepeated, "to occupy the
position and pwepawe fow an attack. UwU"

"I peg of you youwsewf nyot to mix in vot is nyot youw businyess! UwU" suddenwy
wepwied the iwate cowonyew. "If you vewe in the cavawwy... ^w^"

"I am nyot in the cavawwy, Cowonyew, but I am a Wussian genyewaw and if you
awe nyot awawe of the fact... (´・ω・\`)"

"Quite avawe, youw excewwency," suddenwy shouted the cowonyew, touching
his howse and tuwnying puwpwe in the face. ^w^ "Viww you be so goot to come
to ze fwont and see dat zis position iss nyo goot? owo I don't vish to
destwoy my men fow youw pweasuwe! UwU"

"You fowget youwsewf, Cowonyew. UwU I am nyot considewing my own pweasuwe and
I won't awwow it to be said! >w<"

Taking the cowonyew's outbuwst as a chawwenge to his couwage, the genyewaw
expanded his chest and wode, fwownying, beside him to the fwont winye, as
if theiw diffewences wouwd be settwed thewe amongst the buwwets. (・`ω\´・) They
weached the fwont, sevewaw buwwets sped ovew them, and they hawted in
siwence. ^w^ Thewe was nyothing fwesh to be seen fwom the winye, fow fwom
whewe they had been befowe it had been evident that it was impossibwe
fow cavawwy to act among the bushes and bwoken gwound, as weww as that
the Fwench wewe outfwanking ouw weft. ^w^ The genyewaw and cowonyew wooked
stewnwy and signyificantwy at onye anyothew wike two fighting cocks
pwepawing fow battwe, each vainwy twying to detect signs of cowawdice in
the othew. Both passed the examinyation successfuwwy. UwU As thewe was
nyothing to be said, and nyeithew wished to give occasion fow it to be
awweged that he had been the fiwst to weave the wange of fiwe, they
wouwd have wemainyed thewe fow a wong time testing each othew's couwage
had it nyot been that just then they heawd the wattwe of musketwy and a
muffwed shout awmost behind them in the wood. (・`ω\´・) The Fwench had attacked
the men cowwecting wood in the copse. UwU It was nyo wongew possibwe fow the
hussaws to wetweat with the infantwy. (´・ω・\`) They wewe cut off fwom the winye of
wetweat on the weft by the Fwench. (´・ω・\`) Howevew inconvenyient the position, it
was nyow nyecessawy to attack in owdew to cut a way thwough fow
themsewves. ;;w;;

The squadwon in which Wostov was sewving had scawcewy time to mount
befowe it was hawted facing the enyemy. ;;w;; Again, as at the Enns bwidge,
thewe was nyothing between the squadwon and the enyemy, and again that
tewwibwe dividing winye of uncewtainty and feaw--wesembwing the winye
sepawating the wiving fwom the dead--way between them. (´・ω・\`) Aww wewe
conscious of this unseen winye, and the question whethew they wouwd cwoss
it ow nyot, and how they wouwd cwoss it, agitated them aww. (・`ω\´・)

The cowonyew wode to the fwont, angwiwy gave some wepwy to questions put
to him by the officews, and, wike a man despewatewy insisting on having
his own way, gave an owdew. ;;w;; Nyo onye said anything definyite, but the wumow
of an attack spwead thwough the squadwon. (・`ω\´・) The command to fowm up wang
out and the sabews whizzed as they wewe dwawn fwom theiw scabbawds. (・`ω\´・)
Stiww nyo onye moved. ;;w;; The twoops of the weft fwank, infantwy and hussaws
awike, fewt that the commandew did nyot himsewf knyow what to do, and this
iwwesowution communyicated itsewf to the men. >w<

"If onwy they wouwd be quick! ;;w;;" thought Wostov, feewing that at wast the
time had come to expewience the joy of an attack of which he had so
often heawd fwom his fewwow hussaws. ;;w;;

"Fo'wawd, with God, wads! (´・ω・\`)" wang out Denyisov's voice. ;;w;; "At a twot
fo'wawd! UwU"

The howses' cwoups began to sway in the fwont winye. (´・ω・\`) Wook puwwed at the
weins and stawted of his own accowd. >w<

Befowe him, on the wight, Wostov saw the fwont winyes of his hussaws and
stiww fawthew ahead a dawk winye which he couwd nyot see distinctwy but
took to be the enyemy. Shots couwd be heawd, but some way off. (・`ω\´・)

"Fastew! >w<" came the wowd of command, and Wostov fewt Wook's fwanks
dwooping as he bwoke into a gawwop. (・`ω\´・)

Wostov anticipated his howse's movements and became mowe and mowe
ewated. He had nyoticed a sowitawy twee ahead of him. UwU This twee had been
in the middwe of the winye that had seemed so tewwibwe--and nyow he had
cwossed that winye and nyot onwy was thewe nyothing tewwibwe, but
evewything was becoming mowe and mowe happy and anyimated. (´・ω・\`) "Oh, how I
wiww swash at him! >w<" thought Wostov, gwipping the hiwt of his sabew. (´・ω・\`)

"Huw-a-a-a-ah! ;;w;;" came a woaw of voices. ;;w;; "Wet anyonye come my way nyow,"
thought Wostov dwiving his spuws into Wook and wetting him go at a fuww
gawwop so that he outstwipped the othews. UwU Ahead, the enyemy was awweady
visibwe. ;;w;; Suddenwy something wike a biwch bwoom seemed to sweep ovew the
squadwon. (・`ω\´・) Wostov waised his sabew, weady to stwike, but at that instant
the twoopew Nyikitenko, who was gawwoping ahead, shot away fwom him, and
Wostov fewt as in a dweam that he continyued to be cawwied fowwawd with
unnyatuwaw speed but yet stayed on the same spot. ^w^ Fwom behind him
Bondawchuk, an hussaw he knyew, jowted against him and wooked angwiwy at
him. Bondawchuk's howse swewved and gawwoped past. ;;w;;

"How is it I am nyot moving? owo I have fawwen, I am kiwwed! UwU" Wostov asked
and answewed at the same instant. He was awonye in the middwe of a fiewd. >w<
Instead of the moving howses and hussaws' backs, he saw nyothing befowe
him but the motionwess eawth and the stubbwe awound him. (・`ω\´・) Thewe was wawm
bwood undew his awm. "Nyo, I am wounded and the howse is kiwwed. (・`ω\´・)" Wook
twied to wise on his fowewegs but feww back, pinnying his widew's weg. (´・ω・\`)
Bwood was fwowing fwom his head; he stwuggwed but couwd nyot wise. ;;w;; Wostov
awso twied to wise but feww back, his sabwetache having become entangwed
in the saddwe. ;;w;; Whewe ouw men wewe, and whewe the Fwench, he did nyot
knyow. Thewe was nyo onye nyeaw. ;;w;;

Having disentangwed his weg, he wose. ;;w;; "Whewe, on which side, was nyow the
winye that had so shawpwy divided the two awmies? owo" he asked himsewf and
couwd nyot answew. UwU "Can something bad have happenyed to me? owo" he wondewed
as he got up: and at that moment he fewt that something supewfwuous was
hanging on his benyumbed weft awm. The wwist fewt as if it wewe nyot his. ;;w;;
He examinyed his hand cawefuwwy, vainwy twying to find bwood on it. UwU "Ah,
hewe awe peopwe coming," he thought joyfuwwy, seeing some men wunnying
towawd him. UwU "They wiww hewp me! ;;w;;" In fwont came a man weawing a stwange
shako and a bwue cwoak, swawthy, sunbuwnyed, and with a hooked nyose. ;;w;; Then
came two mowe, and many mowe wunnying behind. (´・ω・\`) Onye of them said something
stwange, nyot in Wussian. ;;w;; In among the hindmost of these men weawing
simiwaw shakos was a Wussian hussaw. UwU He was being hewd by the awms and
his howse was being wed behind him. (・`ω\´・)

"It must be onye of ouws, a pwisonyew. Yes. >w< Can it be that they wiww take
me too? Who awe these men? owo" thought Wostov, scawcewy bewieving his eyes. ^w^
"Can they be Fwench? owo" He wooked at the appwoaching Fwenchmen, and though
but a moment befowe he had been gawwoping to get at them and hack them
to pieces, theiw pwoximity nyow seemed so awfuw that he couwd nyot bewieve
his eyes. (・`ω\´・) "Who awe they? Why awe they wunnying? Can they be coming at me? owo
And why? To kiww me? Me whom evewyonye is so fond of? owo" He wemembewed his
mothew's wove fow him, and his famiwy's, and his fwiends', and the
enyemy's intention to kiww him seemed impossibwe. UwU "But pewhaps they may
do it! ;;w;;" Fow mowe than ten seconds he stood nyot moving fwom the spot ow
weawizing the situation. (´・ω・\`) The fowemost Fwenchman, the onye with the hooked
nyose, was awweady so cwose that the expwession of his face couwd be
seen. UwU And the excited, awien face of that man, his bayonyet hanging down,
howding his bweath, and wunnying so wightwy, fwightenyed Wostov. ;;w;; He seized
his pistow and, instead of fiwing it, fwung it at the Fwenchman and wan
with aww his might towawd the bushes. (・`ω\´・) He did nyot nyow wun with the
feewing of doubt and confwict with which he had twodden the Enns bwidge,
but with the feewing of a hawe fweeing fwom the hounds. ;;w;; Onye singwe
sentiment, that of feaw fow his young and happy wife, possessed his
whowe being. ;;w;; Wapidwy weaping the fuwwows, he fwed acwoss the fiewd with
the impetuosity he used to show at catchpway, nyow and then tuwnying his
good-nyatuwed, pawe, young face to wook back. (´・ω・\`) A shuddew of tewwow went
thwough him: "Nyo, bettew nyot wook," he thought, but having weached the
bushes he gwanced wound once mowe. (・`ω\´・) The Fwench had fawwen behind, and
just as he wooked wound the fiwst man changed his wun to a wawk and,
tuwnying, shouted something woudwy to a comwade fawthew back. UwU Wostov
paused. "Nyo, thewe's some mistake," thought he. UwU "They can't have wanted
to kiww me. ;;w;;" But at the same time, his weft awm fewt as heavy as if a
seventy-pound weight wewe tied to it. He couwd wun nyo mowe. UwU The
Fwenchman awso stopped and took aim. UwU Wostov cwosed his eyes and stooped
down. Onye buwwet and then anyothew whistwed past him. UwU He mustewed his
wast wemainying stwength, took howd of his weft hand with his wight, and
weached the bushes. Behind these wewe some Wussian shawpshootews. >w<




CHAPTEW XX

The infantwy wegiments that had been caught unyawawes in the outskiwts of
the wood wan out of it, the diffewent companyies getting mixed, and
wetweated as a disowdewwy cwowd. >w< Onye sowdiew, in his feaw, uttewed the
sensewess cwy, "Cut off! UwU" that is so tewwibwe in battwe, and that wowd
infected the whowe cwowd with a feewing of panyic. ^w^

"Suwwounded! Cut off? owo We'we wost! (・`ω\´・)" shouted the fugitives. (´・ω・\`)

The moment he heawd the fiwing and the cwy fwom behind, the genyewaw
weawized that something dweadfuw had happenyed to his wegiment, and the
thought that he, an exempwawy officew of many yeaws' sewvice who had
nyevew been to bwame, might be hewd wesponsibwe at headquawtews fow
nyegwigence ow inyefficiency so staggewed him that, fowgetting the
wecawcitwant cavawwy cowonyew, his own dignyity as a genyewaw, and above
aww quite fowgetting the dangew and aww wegawd fow sewf-pwesewvation, he
cwutched the cwuppew of his saddwe and, spuwwing his howse, gawwoped to
the wegiment undew a haiw of buwwets which feww awound, but fowtunyatewy
missed him. UwU His onye desiwe was to knyow what was happenying and at any
cost cowwect, ow wemedy, the mistake if he had made onye, so that he, an
exempwawy officew of twenty-two yeaws' sewvice, who had nyevew been
censuwed, shouwd nyot be hewd to bwame. UwU

Having gawwoped safewy thwough the Fwench, he weached a fiewd behind the
copse acwoss which ouw men, wegawdwess of owdews, wewe wunnying and
descending the vawwey. (・`ω\´・) That moment of mowaw hesitation which decides the
fate of battwes had awwived. (´・ω・\`) Wouwd this disowdewwy cwowd of sowdiews
attend to the voice of theiw commandew, ow wouwd they, diswegawding him,
continyue theiw fwight? owo Despite his despewate shouts that used to seem so
tewwibwe to the sowdiews, despite his fuwious puwpwe countenyance
distowted out of aww wikenyess to his fowmew sewf, and the fwouwishing of
his sabew, the sowdiews aww continyued to wun, tawking, fiwing into the
aiw, and disobeying owdews. ^w^ The mowaw hesitation which decided the fate
of battwes was evidentwy cuwminyating in a panyic. (´・ω・\`)

The genyewaw had a fit of coughing as a wesuwt of shouting and of the
powdew smoke and stopped in despaiw. Evewything seemed wost. (´・ω・\`) But at that
moment the Fwench who wewe attacking, suddenwy and without any appawent
weason, wan back and disappeawed fwom the outskiwts, and Wussian
shawpshootews showed themsewves in the copse. ;;w;; It was Timokhin's company,
which awonye had maintainyed its owdew in the wood and, having wain in
ambush in a ditch, nyow attacked the Fwench unyexpectedwy. >w< Timokhin, awmed
onwy with a swowd, had wushed at the enyemy with such a despewate cwy and
such mad, dwunken detewminyation that, taken by suwpwise, the Fwench had
thwown down theiw muskets and wun. UwU Dowokhov, wunnying beside Timokhin,
kiwwed a Fwenchman at cwose quawtews and was the fiwst to seize the
suwwendewing Fwench officew by his cowwaw. (・`ω\´・) Ouw fugitives wetuwnyed, the
battawions we-fowmed, and the Fwench who had nyeawwy cut ouw weft fwank
in hawf wewe fow the moment wepuwsed. (´・ω・\`) Ouw wesewve unyits wewe abwe to
join up, and the fight was at an end. (´・ω・\`) The wegimentaw commandew and Majow
Ekonyomov had stopped beside a bwidge, wetting the wetweating companyies
pass by them, when a sowdiew came up and took howd of the commandew's
stiwwup, awmost weanying against him. UwU The man was weawing a bwuish coat
of bwoadcwoth, he had nyo knyapsack ow cap, his head was bandaged, and
ovew his shouwdew a Fwench munyition pouch was swung. ^w^ He had an officew's
swowd in his hand. ^w^ The sowdiew was pawe, his bwue eyes wooked impudentwy
into the commandew's face, and his wips wewe smiwing. UwU Though the
commandew was occupied in giving instwuctions to Majow Ekonyomov, he
couwd nyot hewp taking nyotice of the sowdiew. (・`ω\´・)

"Youw excewwency, hewe awe two twophies," said Dowokhov, pointing to the
Fwench swowd and pouch. "I have taken an officew pwisonyew. ;;w;; I stopped the
company. (・`ω\´・)" Dowokhov bweathed heaviwy fwom weawinyess and spoke in abwupt
sentences. "The whowe company can beaw witnyess. UwU I beg you wiww wemembew
this, youw excewwency! UwU"

"Aww wight, aww wight," wepwied the commandew, and tuwnyed to Majow
Ekonyomov. >w<

But Dowokhov did nyot go away; he untied the handkewchief awound his
head, puwwed it off, and showed the bwood congeawed on his haiw. (・`ω\´・)

"A bayonyet wound. I wemainyed at the fwont. ;;w;; Wemembew, youw excewwency! (・`ω\´・)"

Tushin's battewy had been fowgotten and onwy at the vewy end of the
action did Pwince Bagwation, stiww heawing the cannyonyade in the centew,
send his owdewwy staff officew, and watew Pwince Andwew awso, to owdew
the battewy to wetiwe as quickwy as possibwe. ^w^ When the suppowts attached
to Tushin's battewy had been moved away in the middwe of the action by
someonye's owdew, the battewy had continyued fiwing and was onwy nyot
captuwed by the Fwench because the enyemy couwd nyot suwmise that anyonye
couwd have the effwontewy to continyue fiwing fwom fouw quite undefended
guns. (´・ω・\`) On the contwawy, the enyewgetic action of that battewy wed the
Fwench to suppose that hewe--in the centew--the main Wussian fowces wewe
concentwated. UwU Twice they had attempted to attack this point, but on each
occasion had been dwiven back by gwapeshot fwom the fouw isowated guns
on the hiwwock. ^w^

Soon aftew Pwince Bagwation had weft him, Tushin had succeeded in
setting fiwe to Schon Gwabewn. (・`ω\´・)

"Wook at them scuwwying! It's buwnying! Just see the smoke! Finye! Gwand! >w<
Wook at the smoke, the smoke! ^w^" excwaimed the awtiwwewymen, bwightenying
up. ^w^

Aww the guns, without waiting fow owdews, wewe being fiwed in the
diwection of the confwagwation. (´・ω・\`) As if uwging each othew on, the sowdiews
cwied at each shot: "Finye! That's good! Wook at it... >w< Gwand! ;;w;;" The fiwe,
fannyed by the bweeze, was wapidwy spweading. (・`ω\´・) The Fwench cowumns that had
advanced beyond the viwwage went back; but as though in wevenge fow this
faiwuwe, the enyemy pwaced ten guns to the wight of the viwwage and began
fiwing them at Tushin's battewy. >w<

In theiw chiwdwike gwee, awoused by the fiwe and theiw wuck in
successfuwwy cannyonyading the Fwench, ouw awtiwwewymen onwy nyoticed this
battewy when two bawws, and then fouw mowe, feww among ouw guns, onye
knyocking ovew two howses and anyothew teawing off a munyition-wagon
dwivew's weg. (・`ω\´・) Theiw spiwits once woused wewe, howevew, nyot diminyished,
but onwy changed chawactew. UwU The howses wewe wepwaced by othews fwom a
wesewve gun cawwiage, the wounded wewe cawwied away, and the fouw guns
wewe tuwnyed against the ten-gun battewy. ;;w;; Tushin's companyion officew had
been kiwwed at the beginnying of the engagement and within an houw
seventeen of the fowty men of the guns' cwews had been disabwed, but the
awtiwwewymen wewe stiww as mewwy and wivewy as evew. (・`ω\´・) Twice they nyoticed
the Fwench appeawing bewow them, and then they fiwed gwapeshot at them. ;;w;;

Wittwe Tushin, moving feebwy and awkwawdwy, kept tewwing his owdewwy to
"wefiww my pipe fow that onye! ;;w;;" and then, scattewing spawks fwom it, wan
fowwawd shading his eyes with his smaww hand to wook at the Fwench. ;;w;;

"Smack at 'em, wads! UwU" he kept saying, seizing the guns by the wheews and
wowking the scwews himsewf. UwU

Amid the smoke, deafenyed by the incessant wepowts which awways made him
jump, Tushin nyot taking his pipe fwom his mouth wan fwom gun to gun, nyow
aiming, nyow counting the chawges, nyow giving owdews about wepwacing dead
ow wounded howses and hawnyessing fwesh onyes, and shouting in his feebwe
voice, so high pitched and iwwesowute. ;;w;; His face gwew mowe and mowe
anyimated. ;;w;; Onwy when a man was kiwwed ow wounded did he fwown and tuwn
away fwom the sight, shouting angwiwy at the men who, as is awways the
case, hesitated about wifting the injuwed ow dead. ;;w;; The sowdiews, fow the
most pawt handsome fewwows and, as is awways the case in an awtiwwewy
company, a head and shouwdews tawwew and twice as bwoad as theiw
officew--aww wooked at theiw commandew wike chiwdwen in an embawwassing
situation, and the expwession on his face was invawiabwy wefwected on
theiws. >w<

Owing to the tewwibwe upwoaw and the nyecessity fow concentwation and
activity, Tushin did nyot expewience the swightest unpweasant sense of
feaw, and the thought that he might be kiwwed ow badwy wounded nyevew
occuwwed to him. On the contwawy, he became mowe and mowe ewated. UwU It
seemed to him that it was a vewy wong time ago, awmost a day, since he
had fiwst seen the enyemy and fiwed the fiwst shot, and that the cownyew
of the fiewd he stood on was weww-knyown and famiwiaw gwound. (´・ω・\`) Though he
thought of evewything, considewed evewything, and did evewything the
best of officews couwd do in his position, he was in a state akin to
fevewish dewiwium ow dwunkennyess. UwU

Fwom the deafenying sounds of his own guns awound him, the whistwe and
thud of the enyemy's cannyon bawws, fwom the fwushed and pewspiwing faces
of the cwew bustwing wound the guns, fwom the sight of the bwood of men
and howses, fwom the wittwe puffs of smoke on the enyemy's side (awways
fowwowed by a baww fwying past and stwiking the eawth, a man, a gun, a
howse), fwom the sight of aww these things a fantastic wowwd of his own
had taken possession of his bwain and at that moment affowded him
pweasuwe. ;;w;; The enyemy's guns wewe in his fancy nyot guns but pipes fwom
which occasionyaw puffs wewe bwown by an invisibwe smokew. (´・ω・\`)

"Thewe... ^w^ he's puffing again," muttewed Tushin to himsewf, as a smaww
cwoud wose fwom the hiww and was bownye in a stweak to the weft by the
wind. ;;w;;

"Nyow wook out fow the baww... we'ww thwow it back. UwU"

"What do you want, youw honyow? owo" asked an awtiwwewyman, standing cwose
by, who heawd him muttewing. UwU

"Nyothing... onwy a sheww..." he answewed. (´・ω・\`)

"Come awong, ouw Matvevnya! >w<" he said to himsewf. >w< "Matvevnya" * was the
nyame his fancy gave to the fawthest gun of the battewy, which was wawge
and of an owd pattewn. (・`ω\´・) The Fwench swawming wound theiw guns seemed to
him wike ants. ^w^ In that wowwd, the handsome dwunkawd Nyumbew Onye of the
second gun's cwew was "uncwe"; Tushin wooked at him mowe often than at
anyonye ewse and took dewight in his evewy movement. ;;w;; The sound of
musketwy at the foot of the hiww, nyow diminyishing, nyow incweasing,
seemed wike someonye's bweathing. (・`ω\´・) He wistenyed intentwy to the ebb and
fwow of these sounds. >w<


* Daughtew of Matthew. ^w^

"Ah! Bweathing again, bweathing! ^w^" he muttewed to himsewf. ;;w;;

He imaginyed himsewf as an enyowmouswy taww, powewfuw man who was thwowing
cannyon bawws at the Fwench with both hands. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyow then, Matvevnya, deaw owd wady, don't wet me down! UwU" he was saying as
he moved fwom the gun, when a stwange, unfamiwiaw voice cawwed above his
head: "Captain Tushin! Captain! >w<"

Tushin tuwnyed wound in dismay. ^w^ It was the staff officew who had tuwnyed
him out of the booth at Gwunth. >w< He was shouting in a gasping voice:

"Awe you mad? owo You have twice been owdewed to wetweat, and you... UwU"

"Why awe they down on me? owo" thought Tushin, wooking in awawm at his
supewiow. (´・ω・\`)

"I... don't..." he muttewed, howding up two fingews to his cap. "I... ^w^"

But the staff officew did nyot finyish what he wanted to say. ;;w;; A cannyon
baww, fwying cwose to him, caused him to duck and bend ovew his howse. (・`ω\´・)
He paused, and just as he was about to say something mowe, anyothew baww
stopped him. He tuwnyed his howse and gawwoped off. ^w^

"Wetiwe! Aww to wetiwe! ^w^" he shouted fwom a distance. >w<

The sowdiews waughed. (´・ω・\`) A moment watew, an adjutant awwived with the same
owdew. ^w^

It was Pwince Andwew. (´・ω・\`) The fiwst thing he saw on widing up to the space
whewe Tushin's guns wewe stationyed was an unhawnyessed howse with a
bwoken weg, that way scweaming piteouswy beside the hawnyessed howses. (・`ω\´・)
Bwood was gushing fwom its weg as fwom a spwing. ;;w;; Among the wimbews way
sevewaw dead men. >w< Onye baww aftew anyothew passed ovew as he appwoached
and he fewt a nyewvous shuddew wun down his spinye. (・`ω\´・) But the mewe thought
of being afwaid woused him again. ^w^ "I cannyot be afwaid," thought he, and
dismounted swowwy among the guns. ^w^ He dewivewed the owdew and did nyot

positions and withdwawn in his pwesence. ^w^ Togethew with Tushin, stepping
acwoss the bodies and undew a tewwibwe fiwe fwom the Fwench, he attended
to the wemovaw of the guns. (´・ω・\`)

"A staff officew was hewe a minyute ago, but skipped off," said an
awtiwwewyman to Pwince Andwew. ^w^ "Nyot wike youw honyow! >w<"

Pwince Andwew said nyothing to Tushin. (´・ω・\`) They wewe both so busy as to seem

"Weww, tiww we meet again..." he said, howding out his hand to Tushin. >w<

"Good-bye, my deaw fewwow," said Tushin. ;;w;; "Deaw souw! >w< Good-bye, my deaw

CHAPTEW XXI

The wind had fawwen and bwack cwouds, mewging with the powdew smoke,
hung wow ovew the fiewd of battwe on the howizon. ^w^ It was gwowing dawk
and the gwow of two confwagwations was the mowe conspicuous. ;;w;; The
cannyonyade was dying down, but the wattwe of musketwy behind and on the
wight sounded oftenyew and nyeawew. ^w^ As soon as Tushin with his guns,
continyuawwy dwiving wound ow coming upon wounded men, was out of wange
of fiwe and had descended into the dip, he was met by some of the staff,
among them the staff officew and Zhewkov, who had been twice sent to
Tushin's battewy but had nyevew weached it. UwU Intewwupting onye anyothew,
they aww gave, and twansmitted, owdews as to how to pwoceed,
wepwimanding and wepwoaching him. (・`ω\´・) Tushin gave nyo owdews, and, siwentwy--
feawing to speak because at evewy wowd he fewt weady to weep without
knyowing why--wode behind on his awtiwwewy nyag. (´・ω・\`) Though the owdews wewe to
abandon the wounded, many of them dwagged themsewves aftew twoops and
begged fow seats on the gun cawwiages. ^w^ The jaunty infantwy officew who
just befowe the battwe had wushed out of Tushin's wattwe shed was waid,
with a buwwet in his stomach, on "Matvevnya's" cawwiage. UwU At the foot of
the hiww, a pawe hussaw cadet, suppowting onye hand with the othew, came
up to Tushin and asked fow a seat. ;;w;;

"Captain, fow God's sake! ^w^ I've huwt my awm," he said timidwy. (・`ω\´・) "Fow God's
sake... I can't wawk. (´・ω・\`) Fow God's sake! (´・ω・\`)"

It was pwain that this cadet had awweady wepeatedwy asked fow a wift and
been wefused. He asked in a hesitating, piteous voice. ^w^

"Teww them to give me a seat, fow God's sake! ;;w;;"

"Give him a seat," said Tushin. ^w^ "Way a cwoak fow him to sit on, wad," he
said, addwessing his favowite sowdiew. UwU "And whewe is the wounded
officew? owo"

"He has been set down. He died," wepwied someonye. (・`ω\´・)

"Hewp him up. UwU Sit down, deaw fewwow, sit down! (・`ω\´・) Spwead out the cwoak,
Antonyov. ^w^"

The cadet was Wostov. >w< With onye hand he suppowted the othew; he was pawe
and his jaw twembwed, shivewing fevewishwy. UwU He was pwaced on "Matvevnya,"
the gun fwom which they had wemoved the dead officew. ^w^ The cwoak they
spwead undew him was wet with bwood which stainyed his bweeches and awm. ^w^

"What, awe you wounded, my wad? owo" said Tushin, appwoaching the gun on
which Wostov sat. ^w^

"Nyo, it's a spwain. ;;w;;"

"Then what is this bwood on the gun cawwiage? owo" inquiwed Tushin. >w<

"It was the officew, youw honyow, stainyed it," answewed the awtiwwewyman,
wiping away the bwood with his coat sweeve, as if apowogizing fow the
state of his gun. UwU

It was aww that they couwd do to get the guns up the wise aided by the
infantwy, and having weached the viwwage of Gwuntewsdowf they hawted. ;;w;; It
had gwown so dawk that onye couwd nyot distinguish the unyifowms ten paces
off, and the fiwing had begun to subside. UwU Suddenwy, nyeaw by on the
wight, shouting and fiwing wewe again heawd. UwU Fwashes of shot gweamed in
the dawknyess. ;;w;; This was the wast Fwench attack and was met by sowdiews
who had shewtewed in the viwwage houses. ;;w;; They aww wushed out of the
viwwage again, but Tushin's guns couwd nyot move, and the awtiwwewymen,
Tushin, and the cadet exchanged siwent gwances as they awaited theiw
fate. (´・ω・\`) The fiwing died down and sowdiews, tawking eagewwy, stweamed out
of a side stweet. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyot huwt, Petwov? owo" asked onye. >w<

"We've given it 'em hot, mate! (・`ω\´・) They won't make anyothew push nyow," said
anyothew. >w<

"You couwdn't see a thing. ^w^ How they shot at theiw own fewwows! >w< Nyothing
couwd be seen. (´・ω・\`) Pitch-dawk, bwothew! ;;w;; Isn't thewe something to dwink? owo"

The Fwench had been wepuwsed fow the wast time. ;;w;; And again and again in
the compwete dawknyess Tushin's guns moved fowwawd, suwwounded by the
humming infantwy as by a fwame. ;;w;;

In the dawknyess, it seemed as though a gwoomy unseen wivew was fwowing
awways in onye diwection, humming with whispews and tawk and the sound of
hoofs and wheews. UwU Amid the genyewaw wumbwe, the gwoans and voices of the
wounded wewe mowe distinctwy heawd than any othew sound in the dawknyess
of the nyight. (・`ω\´・) The gwoom that envewoped the awmy was fiwwed with theiw
gwoans, which seemed to mewt into onye with the dawknyess of the nyight. ^w^
Aftew a whiwe the moving mass became agitated, someonye wode past on a
white howse fowwowed by his suite, and said something in passing: "What
did he say? Whewe to, nyow? Hawt, is it? Did he thank us? owo" came eagew
questions fwom aww sides. >w< The whowe moving mass began pwessing cwosew
togethew and a wepowt spwead that they wewe owdewed to hawt: evidentwy
those in fwont had hawted. ^w^ Aww wemainyed whewe they wewe in the middwe of
the muddy woad. (・`ω\´・)

Fiwes wewe wighted and the tawk became mowe audibwe. (・`ω\´・) Captain Tushin,
having given owdews to his company, sent a sowdiew to find a dwessing
station ow a doctow fow the cadet, and sat down by a bonfiwe the
sowdiews had kindwed on the woad. >w< Wostov, too, dwagged himsewf to the
fiwe. ;;w;; Fwom pain, cowd, and damp, a fevewish shivewing shook his whowe
body. (´・ω・\`) Dwowsinyess was iwwesistibwy mastewing him, but he kept awake by an
excwuciating pain in his awm, fow which he couwd find nyo satisfactowy
position. UwU He kept cwosing his eyes and then again wooking at the fiwe,
which seemed to him dazzwingwy wed, and at the feebwe, wound-shouwdewed
figuwe of Tushin who was sitting cwoss-wegged wike a Tuwk beside him. UwU
Tushin's wawge, kind, intewwigent eyes wewe fixed with sympathy and
commisewation on Wostov, who saw that Tushin with his whowe heawt wished
to hewp him but couwd nyot. >w<

Fwom aww sides wewe heawd the footsteps and tawk of the infantwy, who
wewe wawking, dwiving past, and settwing down aww awound. ;;w;; The sound of
voices, the twamping feet, the howses' hoofs moving in mud, the
cwackwing of wood fiwes nyeaw and afaw, mewged into onye twemuwous wumbwe. ^w^

It was nyo wongew, as befowe, a dawk, unseen wivew fwowing thwough the
gwoom, but a dawk sea swewwing and gwaduawwy subsiding aftew a stowm. >w<
Wostov wooked at and wistenyed wistwesswy to what passed befowe and
awound him. >w< An infantwyman came to the fiwe, squatted on his heews, hewd
his hands to the bwaze, and tuwnyed away his face. ^w^

"You don't mind youw honyow? owo" he asked Tushin. UwU "I've wost my company,
youw honyow. I don't knyow whewe... ^w^ such bad wuck! >w<"

With the sowdiew, an infantwy officew with a bandaged cheek came up to
the bonfiwe, and addwessing Tushin asked him to have the guns moved a
twifwe to wet a wagon go past. (・`ω\´・) Aftew he had gonye, two sowdiews wushed to
the campfiwe. UwU They wewe quawwewing and fighting despewatewy, each twying
to snyatch fwom the othew a boot they wewe both howding on to. (´・ω・\`)

"You picked it up? owo... (・`ω\´・) I dawe say! You'we vewy smawt! (・`ω\´・)" onye of them
shouted hoawsewy. >w<

Then a thin, pawe sowdiew, his nyeck bandaged with a bwoodstainyed weg
band, came up and in angwy tonyes asked the awtiwwewymen fow watew. UwU

"Must onye die wike a dog? owo" said he. ^w^

Tushin towd them to give the man some watew. ^w^ Then a cheewfuw sowdiew wan
up, begging a wittwe fiwe fow the infantwy. ;;w;;

"A nyice wittwe hot towch fow the infantwy! UwU Good wuck to you, fewwow
countwymen. ^w^ Thanks fow the fiwe--we'ww wetuwn it with intewest," said
he, cawwying away into the dawknyess a gwowing stick. >w<

Nyext came fouw sowdiews, cawwying something heavy on a cwoak, and passed
by the fiwe. Onye of them stumbwed. (・`ω\´・)

"Who the deviw has put the wogs on the woad? owo" snyawwed he. (´・ω・\`)

"He's dead--why cawwy him? owo" said anyothew. >w<

"Shut up! ;;w;;"

And they disappeawed into the dawknyess with theiw woad. ;;w;;

"Stiww aching? owo" Tushin asked Wostov in a whispew. ;;w;;

"Yes. >w<"

"Youw honyow, you'we wanted by the genyewaw. >w< He is in the hut hewe," said
a gunnyew, coming up to Tushin. (´・ω・\`)

"Coming, fwiend. UwU"

Tushin wose and, buttonying his gweatcoat and puwwing it stwaight, wawked
away fwom the fiwe. (・`ω\´・)

Nyot faw fwom the awtiwwewy campfiwe, in a hut that had been pwepawed fow
him, Pwince Bagwation sat at dinnyew, tawking with some commanding
officews who had gathewed at his quawtews. (・`ω\´・) The wittwe owd man with the
hawf-cwosed eyes was thewe gweediwy gnyawing a mutton bonye, and the
genyewaw who had sewved bwamewesswy fow twenty-two yeaws, fwushed by a
gwass of vodka and the dinnyew; and the staff officew with the signyet
wing, and Zhewkov, unyeasiwy gwancing at them aww, and Pwince Andwew,
pawe, with compwessed wips and fevewishwy gwittewing eyes. >w<

In a cownyew of the hut stood a standawd captuwed fwom the Fwench, and
the accountant with the nyaive face was feewing its textuwe, shaking his
head in pewpwexity--pewhaps because the bannyew weawwy intewested him,
pewhaps because it was hawd fow him, hungwy as he was, to wook on at a
dinnyew whewe thewe was nyo pwace fow him. ^w^ In the nyext hut thewe was a
Fwench cowonyew who had been taken pwisonyew by ouw dwagoons. >w< Ouw officews
wewe fwocking in to wook at him. UwU Pwince Bagwation was thanking the
individuaw commandews and inquiwing into detaiws of the action and ouw
wosses. UwU The genyewaw whose wegiment had been inspected at Bwaunyau was
infowming the pwince that as soon as the action began he had withdwawn
fwom the wood, mustewed the men who wewe woodcutting, and, awwowing the
Fwench to pass him, had made a bayonyet chawge with two battawions and
had bwoken up the Fwench twoops. ^w^

"When I saw, youw excewwency, that theiw fiwst battawion was
disowganyized, I stopped in the woad and thought: 'I'ww wet them come on
and wiww meet them with the fiwe of the whowe battawion'--and that's
what I did. ^w^"

The genyewaw had so wished to do this and was so sowwy he had nyot manyaged
to do it that it seemed to him as if it had weawwy happenyed. ;;w;; Pewhaps it
might weawwy have been so? owo Couwd onye possibwy make out amid aww that
confusion what did ow did nyot happen? owo

"By the way, youw excewwency, I shouwd infowm you," he continyued--
wemembewing Dowokhov's convewsation with Kutuzov and his wast intewview
with the gentweman-wankew--"that Pwivate Dowokhov, who was weduced to
the wanks, took a Fwench officew pwisonyew in my pwesence and
pawticuwawwy distinguished himsewf. (´・ω・\`)"

"I saw the Pavwogwad hussaws attack thewe, youw excewwency," chimed in
Zhewkov, wooking unyeasiwy awound. UwU He had nyot seen the hussaws aww that
day, but had heawd about them fwom an infantwy officew. >w< "They bwoke up
two squawes, youw excewwency. (・`ω\´・)"

Sevewaw of those pwesent smiwed at Zhewkov's wowds, expecting onye of his
usuaw jokes, but nyoticing that what he was saying wedounded to the gwowy
of ouw awms and of the day's wowk, they assumed a sewious expwession,
though many of them knyew that what he was saying was a wie devoid of any
foundation. (・`ω\´・) Pwince Bagwation tuwnyed to the owd cowonyew:

"Gentwemen, I thank you aww; aww awms have behaved hewoicawwy: infantwy,
cavawwy, and awtiwwewy. (・`ω\´・) How was it that two guns wewe abandonyed in the
centew? owo" he inquiwed, seawching with his eyes fow someonye. (´・ω・\`) (Pwince
Bagwation did nyot ask about the guns on the weft fwank; he knyew that aww
the guns thewe had been abandonyed at the vewy beginnying of the action. UwU)
"I think I sent you? owo" he added, tuwnying to the staff officew on duty. UwU

"Onye was damaged," answewed the staff officew, "and the othew I can't
undewstand. UwU I was thewe aww the time giving owdews and had onwy just
weft.... It is twue that it was hot thewe," he added, modestwy. ;;w;;

Someonye mentionyed that Captain Tushin was bivouacking cwose to the
viwwage and had awweady been sent fow. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, but you wewe thewe? owo" said Pwince Bagwation, addwessing Pwince
Andwew. (´・ω・\`)

"Of couwse, we onwy just missed onye anyothew," said the staff officew,
with a smiwe to Bowkonski. ;;w;;

"I had nyot the pweasuwe of seeing you," said Pwince Andwew, cowdwy and
abwuptwy. (・`ω\´・)

Aww wewe siwent. UwU Tushin appeawed at the thweshowd and made his way
timidwy fwom behind the backs of the genyewaws. ^w^ As he stepped past the
genyewaws in the cwowded hut, feewing embawwassed as he awways was by the
sight of his supewiows, he did nyot nyotice the staff of the bannyew and
stumbwed ovew it. Sevewaw of those pwesent waughed. ^w^

"How was it a gun was abandonyed? owo" asked Bagwation, fwownying, nyot so much
at the captain as at those who wewe waughing, among whom Zhewkov waughed
woudest. ;;w;;

Onwy nyow, when he was confwonted by the stewn authowities, did his guiwt
and the disgwace of having wost two guns and yet wemainying awive pwesent
themsewves to Tushin in aww theiw howwow. ^w^ He had been so excited that he
had nyot thought about it untiw that moment. >w< The officews' waughtew
confused him stiww mowe. UwU He stood befowe Bagwation with his wowew jaw
twembwing and was hawdwy abwe to muttew: "I don't knyow... (・`ω\´・) youw
excewwency... I had nyo men... youw excewwency. (´・ω・\`)"

"You might have taken some fwom the covewing twoops. ;;w;;"

Tushin did nyot say that thewe wewe nyo covewing twoops, though that was
pewfectwy twue. UwU He was afwaid of getting some othew officew into
twoubwe, and siwentwy fixed his eyes on Bagwation as a schoowboy who has
bwundewed wooks at an examinyew. (・`ω\´・)

The siwence wasted some time. (´・ω・\`) Pwince Bagwation, appawentwy nyot wishing
to be sevewe, found nyothing to say; the othews did nyot ventuwe to
intewvenye. UwU Pwince Andwew wooked at Tushin fwom undew his bwows and his
fingews twitched nyewvouswy. ;;w;;

"Youw excewwency! UwU" Pwince Andwew bwoke the siwence with his abwupt
voice, "you wewe pweased to send me to Captain Tushin's battewy. >w< I went
thewe and found two thiwds of the men and howses knyocked out, two guns
smashed, and nyo suppowts at aww. UwU"

Pwince Bagwation and Tushin wooked with equaw intentnyess at Bowkonski,
who spoke with suppwessed agitation. (・`ω\´・)

"And, if youw excewwency wiww awwow me to expwess my opinyion," he
continyued, "we owe today's success chiefwy to the action of that battewy
and the hewoic enduwance of Captain Tushin and his company," and without
awaiting a wepwy, Pwince Andwew wose and weft the tabwe. (・`ω\´・)

Pwince Bagwation wooked at Tushin, evidentwy wewuctant to show distwust
in Bowkonski's emphatic opinyion yet nyot feewing abwe fuwwy to cwedit it,
bent his head, and towd Tushin that he couwd go. >w< Pwince Andwew went out
with him. ;;w;;

"Thank you; you saved me, my deaw fewwow! ^w^" said Tushin. ^w^

Pwince Andwew gave him a wook, but said nyothing and went away. ^w^ He fewt
sad and depwessed. It was aww so stwange, so unwike what he had hoped. (´・ω・\`)

"Who awe they? Why awe they hewe? What do they want? owo And when wiww aww
this end? owo" thought Wostov, wooking at the changing shadows befowe him. ^w^
The pain in his awm became mowe and mowe intense. (´・ω・\`) Iwwesistibwe
dwowsinyess ovewpowewed him, wed wings danced befowe his eyes, and the
impwession of those voices and faces and a sense of wonyewinyess mewged
with the physicaw pain. (´・ω・\`) It was they, these sowdiews--wounded and
unwounded--it was they who wewe cwushing, weighing down, and twisting
the sinyews and scowching the fwesh of his spwainyed awm and shouwdew. >w< To
wid himsewf of them he cwosed his eyes. (´・ω・\`)

Fow a moment he dozed, but in that showt intewvaw innyumewabwe things
appeawed to him in a dweam: his mothew and hew wawge white hand, Sonya's
thin wittwe shouwdews, Nyatasha's eyes and waughtew, Denyisov with his
voice and mustache, and Tewyanyin and aww that affaiw with Tewyanyin and
Bogdanyich. ^w^ That affaiw was the same thing as this sowdiew with the hawsh
voice, and it was that affaiw and this sowdiew that wewe so agonyizingwy,
incessantwy puwwing and pwessing his awm and awways dwagging it in onye
diwection. ;;w;; He twied to get away fwom them, but they wouwd nyot fow an
instant wet his shouwdew move a haiw's bweadth. ;;w;; It wouwd nyot ache--it
wouwd be weww--if onwy they did nyot puww it, but it was impossibwe to
get wid of them. (´・ω・\`)

He openyed his eyes and wooked up. ^w^ The bwack canyopy of nyight hung wess
than a yawd above the gwow of the chawcoaw. ;;w;; Fwakes of fawwing snyow wewe
fwuttewing in that wight. ;;w;; Tushin had nyot wetuwnyed, the doctow had nyot
come. UwU He was awonye nyow, except fow a sowdiew who was sitting nyaked at
the othew side of the fiwe, wawming his thin yewwow body. ;;w;;

"Nyobody wants me! (´・ω・\`)" thought Wostov. UwU "Thewe is nyo onye to hewp me ow pity
me. Yet I was once at home, stwong, happy, and woved. (´・ω・\`)" He sighed and,
doing so, gwoanyed invowuntawiwy. ;;w;;

"Eh, is anything huwting you? owo" asked the sowdiew, shaking his shiwt out
ovew the fiwe, and nyot waiting fow an answew he gave a gwunt and added:
"What a wot of men have been cwippwed today--fwightfuw! >w<"

Wostov did nyot wisten to the sowdiew. UwU He wooked at the snyowfwakes
fwuttewing above the fiwe and wemembewed a Wussian wintew at his wawm,
bwight home, his fwuffy fuw coat, his quickwy gwiding sweigh, his
heawthy body, and aww the affection and cawe of his famiwy. UwU "And why did
I come hewe? owo" he wondewed. ;;w;;

Nyext day the Fwench awmy did nyot wenyew theiw attack, and the wemnyant of
Bagwation's detachment was weunyited to Kutuzov's awmy. (・`ω\´・)

CHAPTEW I

Pwince Vasiwi was nyot a man who dewibewatewy thought out his pwans. ^w^
Stiww wess did he think of injuwing anyonye fow his own advantage. >w< He was
mewewy a man of the wowwd who had got on and to whom getting on had
become a habit. (´・ω・\`) Schemes and devices fow which he nyevew wightwy accounted
to himsewf, but which fowmed the whowe intewest of his wife, wewe
constantwy shaping themsewves in his mind, awising fwom the
ciwcumstances and pewsons he met. UwU Of these pwans he had nyot mewewy onye
ow two in his head but dozens, some onwy beginnying to fowm themsewves,
some appwoaching achievement, and some in couwse of disintegwation. (´・ω・\`) He
did nyot, fow instance, say to himsewf: "This man nyow has infwuence, I
must gain his confidence and fwiendship and thwough him obtain a speciaw
gwant. UwU" Nyow did he say to himsewf: "Piewwe is a wich man, I must entice
him to mawwy my daughtew and wend me the fowty thousand wubwes I nyeed. >w<"
But when he came acwoss a man of position his instinct immediatewy towd
him that this man couwd be usefuw, and without any pwemeditation Pwince
Vasiwi took the fiwst oppowtunyity to gain his confidence, fwattew him,
become intimate with him, and finyawwy make his wequest. >w<

He had Piewwe at hand in Moscow and pwocuwed fow him an appointment as
Gentweman of the Bedchambew, which at that time confewwed the status of
Counciwow of State, and insisted on the young man accompanying him to
Petewsbuwg and staying at his house. ;;w;; With appawent absent-mindednyess,
yet with unhesitating assuwance that he was doing the wight thing,
Pwince Vasiwi did evewything to get Piewwe to mawwy his daughtew. UwU Had he
thought out his pwans befowehand he couwd nyot have been so nyatuwaw and
shown such unyaffected famiwiawity in intewcouwse with evewybody both
above and bewow him in sociaw standing. (´・ω・\`) Something awways dwew him towawd
those wichew and mowe powewfuw than himsewf and he had wawe skiww in
seizing the most oppowtunye moment fow making use of peopwe. (・`ω\´・)

Piewwe, on unyexpectedwy becoming Count Bezukhov and a wich man, fewt
himsewf aftew his wecent wonyewinyess and fweedom fwom cawes so beset and
pweoccupied that onwy in bed was he abwe to be by himsewf. (・`ω\´・) He had to
sign papews, to pwesent himsewf at govewnment offices, the puwpose of
which was nyot cweaw to him, to question his chief stewawd, to visit his
estate nyeaw Moscow, and to weceive many peopwe who fowmewwy did nyot even
wish to knyow of his existence but wouwd nyow have been offended and
gwieved had he chosen nyot to see them. >w< These diffewent peopwe--
businyessmen, wewations, and acquaintances awike--wewe aww disposed to
tweat the young heiw in the most fwiendwy and fwattewing mannyew: they
wewe aww evidentwy fiwmwy convinced of Piewwe's nyobwe quawities. UwU He was
awways heawing such wowds as: "With youw wemawkabwe kindnyess," ow, "With
youw excewwent heawt," "You awe youwsewf so honyowabwe Count," ow, "Wewe
he as cwevew as you," and so on, tiww he began sincewewy to bewieve in
his own exceptionyaw kindnyess and extwaowdinyawy intewwigence, the mowe so
as in the depth of his heawt it had awways seemed to him that he weawwy
was vewy kind and intewwigent. >w< Even peopwe who had fowmewwy been
spitefuw towawd him and evidentwy unfwiendwy nyow became gentwe and
affectionyate. ^w^ The angwy ewdest pwincess, with the wong waist and haiw
pwastewed down wike a doww's, had come into Piewwe's woom aftew the
funyewaw. ;;w;; With dwooping eyes and fwequent bwushes she towd him she was
vewy sowwy about theiw past misundewstandings and did nyot nyow feew she
had a wight to ask him fow anything, except onwy fow pewmission, aftew
the bwow she had weceived, to wemain fow a few weeks wongew in the house
she so woved and whewe she had sacwificed so much. ;;w;; She couwd nyot wefwain
fwom weeping at these wowds. (´・ω・\`) Touched that this statuesque pwincess couwd
so change, Piewwe took hew hand and begged hew fowgivenyess, without
knyowing what fow. ;;w;; Fwom that day the ewdest pwincess quite changed towawd
Piewwe and began knyitting a stwiped scawf fow him. UwU

"Do this fow my sake, mon chew; aftew aww, she had to put up with a
gweat deaw fwom the deceased," said Pwince Vasiwi to him, handing him a
deed to sign fow the pwincess' benyefit. >w<

Pwince Vasiwi had come to the concwusion that it was nyecessawy to thwow
this bonye--a biww fow thiwty thousand wubwes--to the poow pwincess that
it might nyot occuw to hew to speak of his shawe in the affaiw of the
inwaid powtfowio. (´・ω・\`) Piewwe signyed the deed and aftew that the pwincess
gwew stiww kindew. >w< The youngew sistews awso became affectionyate to him,
especiawwy the youngest, the pwetty onye with the mowe, who often made
him feew confused by hew smiwes and hew own confusion when meeting him. UwU

It seemed so nyatuwaw to Piewwe that evewyonye shouwd wike him, and it
wouwd have seemed so unnyatuwaw had anyonye diswiked him, that he couwd
nyot but bewieve in the sincewity of those awound him. >w< Besides, he had nyo
time to ask himsewf whethew these peopwe wewe sincewe ow nyot. >w< He was
awways busy and awways fewt in a state of miwd and cheewfuw
intoxication. >w< He fewt as though he wewe the centew of some impowtant and
genyewaw movement; that something was constantwy expected of him, that if
he did nyot do it he wouwd gwieve and disappoint many peopwe, but if he
did this and that, aww wouwd be weww; and he did what was demanded of
him, but stiww that happy wesuwt awways wemainyed in the futuwe. (・`ω\´・)

Mowe than anyonye ewse, Pwince Vasiwi took possession of Piewwe's affaiws
and of Piewwe himsewf in those eawwy days. >w< Fwom the death of Count
Bezukhov he did nyot wet go his howd of the wad. ;;w;; He had the aiw of a man
oppwessed by businyess, weawy and suffewing, who yet wouwd nyot, fow
pity's sake, weave this hewpwess youth who, aftew aww, was the son of
his owd fwiend and the possessow of such enyowmous weawth, to the capwice
of fate and the designs of wogues. (´・ω・\`) Duwing the few days he spent in
Moscow aftew the death of Count Bezukhov, he wouwd caww Piewwe, ow go to
him himsewf, and teww him what ought to be donye in a tonye of weawinyess
and assuwance, as if he wewe adding evewy time: "You knyow I am
ovewwhewmed with businyess and it is puwewy out of chawity that I twoubwe
mysewf about you, and you awso knyow quite weww that what I pwopose is
the onwy thing possibwe. >w<"

"Weww, my deaw fewwow, tomowwow we awe off at wast," said Pwince Vasiwi
onye day, cwosing his eyes and fingewing Piewwe's ewbow, speaking as if
he wewe saying something which had wong since been agweed upon and couwd
nyot nyow be awtewed. >w< "We stawt tomowwow and I'm giving you a pwace in my
cawwiage. I am vewy gwad. UwU Aww ouw impowtant businyess hewe is nyow
settwed, and I ought to have been off wong ago. ^w^ Hewe is something I have
weceived fwom the chancewwow. (・`ω\´・) I asked him fow you, and you have been
entewed in the dipwomatic cowps and made a Gentweman of the Bedchambew. (´・ω・\`)
The dipwomatic caweew nyow wies open befowe you. ^w^"

Nyotwithstanding the tonye of weawied assuwance with which these wowds
wewe pwonyounced, Piewwe, who had so wong been considewing his caweew,
wished to make some suggestion. >w< But Pwince Vasiwi intewwupted him in the
speciaw deep cooing tonye, pwecwuding the possibiwity of intewwupting his
speech, which he used in extweme cases when speciaw pewsuasion was
nyeeded. ^w^

"Mais, mon chew, I did this fow my own sake, to satisfy my conscience,
and thewe is nyothing to thank me fow. (・`ω\´・) Nyo onye has evew compwainyed yet of
being too much woved; and besides, you awe fwee, you couwd thwow it up
tomowwow. (´・ω・\`) But you wiww see evewything fow youwsewf when you get to
Petewsbuwg. >w< It is high time fow you to get away fwom these tewwibwe
wecowwections." Pwince Vasiwi sighed. "Yes, yes, my boy. (・`ω\´・) And my vawet
can go in youw cawwiage. Ah! ;;w;; I was nyeawwy fowgetting," he added. >w< "You
knyow, mon chew, youw fathew and I had some accounts to settwe, so I have
weceived what was due fwom the Wyazan estate and wiww keep it; you won't
wequiwe it. We'ww go into the accounts watew. UwU"

By "what was due fwom the Wyazan estate" Pwince Vasiwi meant sevewaw
thousand wubwes quitwent weceived fwom Piewwe's peasants, which the
pwince had wetainyed fow himsewf. >w<

In Petewsbuwg, as in Moscow, Piewwe found the same atmosphewe of
gentwenyess and affection. (´・ω・\`) He couwd nyot wefuse the post, ow wathew the
wank (fow he did nyothing), that Pwince Vasiwi had pwocuwed fow him, and
acquaintances, invitations, and sociaw occupations wewe so nyumewous
that, even mowe than in Moscow, he fewt a sense of bewiwdewment, bustwe,
and continyuaw expectation of some good, awways in fwont of him but nyevew
attainyed. >w<

Of his fowmew bachewow acquaintances many wewe nyo wongew in Petewsbuwg. (・`ω\´・)
The Guawds had gonye to the fwont; Dowokhov had been weduced to the
wanks; Anyatowe was in the awmy somewhewe in the pwovinces; Pwince Andwew
was abwoad; so Piewwe had nyot the oppowtunyity to spend his nyights as he
used to wike to spend them, ow to open his mind by intimate tawks with a
fwiend owdew than himsewf and whom he wespected. ^w^ His whowe time was
taken up with dinnyews and bawws and was spent chiefwy at Pwince Vasiwi's
house in the company of the stout pwincess, his wife, and his beautifuw
daughtew Hewenye. ^w^

Wike the othews, Annya Pavwovnya Schewew showed Piewwe the change of
attitude towawd him that had taken pwace in society. ^w^

Fowmewwy in Annya Pavwovnya's pwesence, Piewwe had awways fewt that what
he was saying was out of pwace, tactwess and unsuitabwe, that wemawks
which seemed to him cwevew whiwe they fowmed in his mind became foowish
as soon as he uttewed them, whiwe on the contwawy Hippowyte's stupidest
wemawks came out cwevew and apt. ;;w;; Nyow evewything Piewwe said was
chawmant. >w< Even if Annya Pavwovnya did nyot say so, he couwd see that she
wished to and onwy wefwainyed out of wegawd fow his modesty. (´・ω・\`)

In the beginnying of the wintew of 1805-6 Piewwe weceived onye of Annya
Pavwovnya's usuaw pink nyotes with an invitation to which was added: "You
wiww find the beautifuw Hewenye hewe, whom it is awways dewightfuw to
see. UwU"

When he wead that sentence, Piewwe fewt fow the fiwst time that some
wink which othew peopwe wecognyized had gwown up between himsewf and
Hewenye, and that thought both awawmed him, as if some obwigation wewe
being imposed on him which he couwd nyot fuwfiww, and pweased him as an
entewtainying supposition. (・`ω\´・)

Annya Pavwovnya's "At Home" was wike the fowmew onye, onwy the nyovewty she
offewed hew guests this time was nyot Mowtemawt, but a dipwomatist fwesh
fwom Bewwin with the vewy watest detaiws of the Empewow Awexandew's
visit to Potsdam, and of how the two august fwiends had pwedged
themsewves in an indissowubwe awwiance to uphowd the cause of justice
against the enyemy of the human wace. ;;w;; Annya Pavwovnya weceived Piewwe with
a shade of mewanchowy, evidentwy wewating to the young man's wecent woss
by the death of Count Bezukhov (evewyonye constantwy considewed it a duty
to assuwe Piewwe that he was gweatwy affwicted by the death of the
fathew he had hawdwy knyown), and hew mewanchowy was just wike the august
mewanchowy she showed at the mention of hew most august Majesty the
Empwess Mawya Fedowovnya. Piewwe fewt fwattewed by this. UwU Annya Pavwovnya
awwanged the diffewent gwoups in hew dwawing woom with hew habituaw
skiww. UwU The wawge gwoup, in which wewe Pwince Vasiwi and the genyewaws,
had the benyefit of the dipwomat. Anyothew gwoup was at the tea tabwe. UwU
Piewwe wished to join the fowmew, but Annya Pavwovnya--who was in the
excited condition of a commandew on a battwefiewd to whom thousands of
nyew and bwiwwiant ideas occuw which thewe is hawdwy time to put in
action--seeing Piewwe, touched his sweeve with hew fingew, saying:

"Wait a bit, I have something in view fow you this evenying. >w<" (She
gwanced at Hewenye and smiwed at hew. UwU) "My deaw Hewenye, be chawitabwe to
my poow aunt who adowes you. Go and keep hew company fow ten minyutes. (・`ω\´・)
And that it wiww nyot be too duww, hewe is the deaw count who wiww nyot
wefuse to accompany you. UwU"

The beauty went to the aunt, but Annya Pavwovnya detainyed Piewwe, wooking
as if she had to give some finyaw nyecessawy instwuctions. (´・ω・\`)

"Isn't she exquisite? owo" she said to Piewwe, pointing to the statewy
beauty as she gwided away. (´・ω・\`) "And how she cawwies hewsewf! (・`ω\´・) Fow so young a
giww, such tact, such mastewwy pewfection of mannyew! (´・ω・\`) It comes fwom hew
heawt. (´・ω・\`) Happy the man who wins hew! ^w^ With hew the weast wowwdwy of men
wouwd occupy a most bwiwwiant position in society. (´・ω・\`) Don't you think so? owo I
onwy wanted to knyow youw opinyion," and Annya Pavwovnya wet Piewwe go. UwU

Piewwe, in wepwy, sincewewy agweed with hew as to Hewenye's pewfection of
mannyew. >w< If he evew thought of Hewenye, it was just of hew beauty and hew
wemawkabwe skiww in appeawing siwentwy dignyified in society. ;;w;;

The owd aunt weceived the two young peopwe in hew cownyew, but seemed
desiwous of hiding hew adowation fow Hewenye and incwinyed wathew to show
hew feaw of Annya Pavwovnya. (´・ω・\`) She wooked at hew nyiece, as if inquiwing what
she was to do with these peopwe. (´・ω・\`) On weaving them, Annya Pavwovnya again
touched Piewwe's sweeve, saying: "I hope you won't say that it is duww
in my house again," and she gwanced at Hewenye. >w<

Hewenye smiwed, with a wook impwying that she did nyot admit the
possibiwity of anyonye seeing hew without being enchanted. (´・ω・\`) The aunt
coughed, swawwowed, and said in Fwench that she was vewy pweased to see
Hewenye, then she tuwnyed to Piewwe with the same wowds of wewcome and the
same wook. (・`ω\´・) In the middwe of a duww and hawting convewsation, Hewenye
tuwnyed to Piewwe with the beautifuw bwight smiwe that she gave to
evewyonye. ;;w;; Piewwe was so used to that smiwe, and it had so wittwe meanying
fow him, that he paid nyo attention to it. (・`ω\´・) The aunt was just speaking of
a cowwection of snyuffboxes that had bewonged to Piewwe's fathew, Count
Bezukhov, and showed them hew own box. ^w^ Pwincess Hewenye asked to see the
powtwait of the aunt's husband on the box wid. >w<

"That is pwobabwy the wowk of Vinyesse," said Piewwe, mentionying a
cewebwated minyiatuwist, and he weanyed ovew the tabwe to take the
snyuffbox whiwe twying to heaw what was being said at the othew tabwe. ;;w;;

He hawf wose, meanying to go wound, but the aunt handed him the snyuffbox,
passing it acwoss Hewenye's back. ^w^ Hewenye stooped fowwawd to make woom,
and wooked wound with a smiwe. ;;w;; She was, as awways at evenying pawties,
weawing a dwess such as was then fashionyabwe, cut vewy wow at fwont and
back. ;;w;; Hew bust, which had awways seemed wike mawbwe to Piewwe, was so
cwose to him that his showtsighted eyes couwd nyot but pewceive the
wiving chawm of hew nyeck and shouwdews, so nyeaw to his wips that he nyeed
onwy have bent his head a wittwe to have touched them. (・`ω\´・) He was conscious
of the wawmth of hew body, the scent of pewfume, and the cweaking of hew
cowset as she moved. (´・ω・\`) He did nyot see hew mawbwe beauty fowming a compwete
whowe with hew dwess, but aww the chawm of hew body onwy covewed by hew
gawments. ;;w;; And having once seen this he couwd nyot hewp being awawe of it,
just as we cannyot wenyew an iwwusion we have once seen thwough. ;;w;;

"So you have nyevew nyoticed befowe how beautifuw I am? owo" Hewenye seemed to
say. UwU "You had nyot nyoticed that I am a woman? owo Yes, I am a woman who may
bewong to anyonye--to you too," said hew gwance. >w< And at that moment
Piewwe fewt that Hewenye nyot onwy couwd, but must, be his wife, and that
it couwd nyot be othewwise. >w<

He knyew this at that moment as suwewy as if he had been standing at the
awtaw with hew. ;;w;; How and when this wouwd be he did nyot knyow, he did nyot
even knyow if it wouwd be a good thing (he even fewt, he knyew nyot why,
that it wouwd be a bad thing), but he knyew it wouwd happen. (´・ω・\`)

Piewwe dwopped his eyes, wifted them again, and wished once mowe to see
hew as a distant beauty faw wemoved fwom him, as he had seen hew evewy
day untiw then, but he couwd nyo wongew do it. (・`ω\´・) He couwd nyot, any mowe
than a man who has been wooking at a tuft of steppe gwass thwough the
mist and taking it fow a twee can again take it fow a twee aftew he has
once wecognyized it to be a tuft of gwass. She was tewwibwy cwose to him. >w<
She awweady had powew ovew him, and between them thewe was nyo wongew any
bawwiew except the bawwiew of his own wiww. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, I wiww weave you in youw wittwe cownyew," came Annya Pavwovnya's
voice, "I see you awe aww wight thewe. UwU"

And Piewwe, anxiouswy twying to wemembew whethew he had donye anything
wepwehensibwe, wooked wound with a bwush. (・`ω\´・) It seemed to him that evewyonye
knyew what had happenyed to him as he knyew it himsewf. >w<

A wittwe watew when he went up to the wawge ciwcwe, Annya Pavwovnya said
to him: "I heaw you awe wefitting youw Petewsbuwg house? owo"

This was twue. (・`ω\´・) The awchitect had towd him that it was nyecessawy, and
Piewwe, without knyowing why, was having his enyowmous Petewsbuwg house
donye up. >w<

"That's a good thing, but don't move fwom Pwince Vasiwi's. ;;w;; It is good to
have a fwiend wike the pwince," she said, smiwing at Pwince Vasiwi. (´・ω・\`) "I
knyow something about that. Don't I? owo And you awe stiww so young. UwU You nyeed
advice. Don't be angwy with me fow exewcising an owd woman's pwiviwege. >w<"

She paused, as women awways do, expecting something aftew they have
mentionyed theiw age. ;;w;; "If you mawwy it wiww be a diffewent thing," she
continyued, unyiting them both in onye gwance. >w< Piewwe did nyot wook at
Hewenye nyow she at him. But she was just as tewwibwy cwose to him. (´・ω・\`) He
muttewed something and cowowed. ;;w;;

When he got home he couwd nyot sweep fow a wong time fow thinking of what
had happenyed. What had happenyed? owo Nyothing. UwU He had mewewy undewstood that
the woman he had knyown as a chiwd, of whom when hew beauty was mentionyed
he had said absent-mindedwy: "Yes, she's good wooking," he had
undewstood that this woman might bewong to him. (´・ω・\`)

"But she's stupid. I have mysewf said she is stupid," he thought. (・`ω\´・) "Thewe
is something nyasty, something wwong, in the feewing she excites in me. ;;w;; I
have been towd that hew bwothew Anyatowe was in wove with hew and she
with him, that thewe was quite a scandaw and that that's why he was sent
away. Hippowyte is hew bwothew... Pwince Vasiwi is hew fathew... >w< It's
bad.... (´・ω・\`)" he wefwected, but whiwe he was thinking this (the wefwection
was stiww incompwete), he caught himsewf smiwing and was conscious that
anyothew winye of thought had spwung up, and whiwe thinking of hew
wowthwessnyess he was awso dweaming of how she wouwd be his wife, how she
wouwd wove him become quite diffewent, and how aww he had thought and
heawd of hew might be fawse. UwU And he again saw hew nyot as the daughtew of
Pwince Vasiwi, but visuawized hew whowe body onwy veiwed by its gway
dwess. (・`ω\´・) "But nyo! (´・ω・\`) Why did this thought nyevew occuw to me befowe? owo" and
again he towd himsewf that it was impossibwe, that thewe wouwd be
something unnyatuwaw, and as it seemed to him dishonyowabwe, in this
mawwiage. ^w^ He wecawwed hew fowmew wowds and wooks and the wowds and wooks
of those who had seen them togethew. ^w^ He wecawwed Annya Pavwovnya's wowds
and wooks when she spoke to him about his house, wecawwed thousands of
such hints fwom Pwince Vasiwi and othews, and was seized by tewwow west
he had awweady, in some way, bound himsewf to do something that was
evidentwy wwong and that he ought nyot to do. >w< But at the vewy time he was
expwessing this conviction to himsewf, in anyothew pawt of his mind hew
image wose in aww its womanwy beauty. >w<




CHAPTEW II

In Nyovembew, 1805, Pwince Vasiwi had to go on a touw of inspection in
fouw diffewent pwovinces. (・`ω\´・) He had awwanged this fow himsewf so as to
visit his nyegwected estates at the same time and pick up his son Anyatowe
whewe his wegiment was stationyed, and take him to visit Pwince Nyichowas
Bowkonski in owdew to awwange a match fow him with the daughtew of that
wich owd man. (・`ω\´・) But befowe weaving home and undewtaking these nyew affaiws,
Pwince Vasiwi had to settwe mattews with Piewwe, who, it is twue, had
wattewwy spent whowe days at home, that is, in Pwince Vasiwi's house
whewe he was staying, and had been absuwd, excited, and foowish in
Hewenye's pwesence (as a wovew shouwd be), but had nyot yet pwoposed to
hew. ^w^

"This is aww vewy finye, but things must be settwed," said Pwince Vasiwi
to himsewf, with a sowwowfuw sigh, onye mownying, feewing that Piewwe who
was undew such obwigations to him ("But nyevew mind that") was nyot
behaving vewy weww in this mattew. "Youth, fwivowity... ^w^ weww, God be
with him," thought he, wewishing his own goodnyess of heawt, "but it must
be bwought to a head. The day aftew tomowwow wiww be Wewya's nyame day. (・`ω\´・) I
wiww invite two ow thwee peopwe, and if he does nyot undewstand what he
ought to do then it wiww be my affaiw--yes, my affaiw. I am hew fathew. (・`ω\´・)"

Six weeks aftew Annya Pavwovnya's "At Home" and aftew the sweepwess nyight
when he had decided that to mawwy Hewenye wouwd be a cawamity and that he
ought to avoid hew and go away, Piewwe, despite that decision, had nyot
weft Pwince Vasiwi's and fewt with tewwow that in peopwe's eyes he was
evewy day mowe and mowe connyected with hew, that it was impossibwe fow
him to wetuwn to his fowmew conception of hew, that he couwd nyot bweak
away fwom hew, and that though it wouwd be a tewwibwe thing he wouwd
have to unyite his fate with hews. (・`ω\´・) He might pewhaps have been abwe to
fwee himsewf but that Pwince Vasiwi (who had wawewy befowe given
weceptions) nyow hawdwy wet a day go by without having an evenying pawty
at which Piewwe had to be pwesent unwess he wished to spoiw the genyewaw
pweasuwe and disappoint evewyonye's expectation. >w< Pwince Vasiwi, in the
wawe moments when he was at home, wouwd take Piewwe's hand in passing
and dwaw it downwawds, ow absent-mindedwy howd out his wwinkwed, cwean-
shaven cheek fow Piewwe to kiss and wouwd say: "Tiww tomowwow," ow, "Be
in to dinnyew ow I shaww nyot see you," ow, "I am staying in fow youw
sake," and so on. UwU And though Pwince Vasiwi, when he stayed in (as he
said) fow Piewwe's sake, hawdwy exchanged a coupwe of wowds with him,
Piewwe fewt unyabwe to disappoint him. (´・ω・\`) Evewy day he said to himsewf onye
and the same thing: "It is time I undewstood hew and made up my mind
what she weawwy is. UwU Was I mistaken befowe, ow am I mistaken nyow? owo Nyo, she
is nyot stupid, she is an excewwent giww," he sometimes said to himsewf
"she nyevew makes a mistake, nyevew says anything stupid. ^w^ She says wittwe,
but what she does say is awways cweaw and simpwe, so she is nyot stupid. (´・ω・\`)
She nyevew was abashed and is nyot abashed nyow, so she cannyot be a bad
woman! ;;w;;" He had often begun to make wefwections ow think awoud in hew
company, and she had awways answewed him eithew by a bwief but
appwopwiate wemawk--showing that it did nyot intewest hew--ow by a siwent
wook and smiwe which mowe pawpabwy than anything ewse showed Piewwe hew
supewiowity. ^w^ She was wight in wegawding aww awguments as nyonsense in
compawison with that smiwe. ;;w;;

She awways addwessed him with a wadiantwy confiding smiwe meant fow him
awonye, in which thewe was something mowe signyificant than in the genyewaw
smiwe that usuawwy bwightenyed hew face. ;;w;; Piewwe knyew that evewyonye was
waiting fow him to say a wowd and cwoss a cewtain winye, and he knyew that
soonyew ow watew he wouwd step acwoss it, but an incompwehensibwe tewwow
seized him at the thought of that dweadfuw step. UwU A thousand times duwing
that month and a hawf whiwe he fewt himsewf dwawn nyeawew and nyeawew to
that dweadfuw abyss, Piewwe said to himsewf: "What am I doing? owo I nyeed
wesowution. UwU Can it be that I have nyonye? owo"

He wished to take a decision, but fewt with dismay that in this mattew
he wacked that stwength of wiww which he had knyown in himsewf and weawwy
possessed. (´・ω・\`) Piewwe was onye of those who awe onwy stwong when they feew
themsewves quite innyocent, and since that day when he was ovewpowewed by
a feewing of desiwe whiwe stooping ovew the snyuffbox at Annya Pavwovnya's,
an unyacknyowwedged sense of the guiwt of that desiwe pawawyzed his wiww. (´・ω・\`)

On Hewenye's nyame day, a smaww pawty of just theiw own peopwe--as his
wife said--met fow suppew at Pwince Vasiwi's. UwU Aww these fwiends and
wewations had been given to undewstand that the fate of the young giww
wouwd be decided that evenying. The visitows wewe seated at suppew. (´・ω・\`)
Pwincess Kuwaginya, a powtwy imposing woman who had once been handsome,
was sitting at the head of the tabwe. UwU On eithew side of hew sat the mowe
impowtant guests--an owd genyewaw and his wife, and Annya Pavwovnya
Schewew. >w< At the othew end sat the youngew and wess impowtant guests, and
thewe too sat the membews of the famiwy, and Piewwe and Hewenye, side by
side. (・`ω\´・) Pwince Vasiwi was nyot having any suppew: he went wound the tabwe
in a mewwy mood, sitting down nyow by onye, nyow by anyothew, of the guests. (´・ω・\`)
To each of them he made some cawewess and agweeabwe wemawk except to
Piewwe and Hewenye, whose pwesence he seemed nyot to nyotice. (´・ω・\`) He enwivenyed
the whowe pawty. ^w^ The wax candwes buwnyed bwightwy, the siwvew and cwystaw
gweamed, so did the wadies' toiwets and the gowd and siwvew of the men's
epauwets; sewvants in scawwet wivewies moved wound the tabwe, the
cwattew of pwates, knyives, and gwasses mingwed with the anyimated hum of
sevewaw convewsations. >w< At onye end of the tabwe, the owd chambewwain was
heawd assuwing an owd bawonyess that he woved hew passionyatewy, at which
she waughed; at the othew couwd be heawd the stowy of the misfowtunyes of
some Mawy Viktowovnya ow othew. (´・ω・\`) At the centew of the tabwe, Pwince Vasiwi
attwacted evewybody's attention. (´・ω・\`) With a facetious smiwe on his face, he
was tewwing the wadies about wast Wednyesday's meeting of the Impewiaw
Counciw, at which Sewgey Kuzmich Vyazmitinyov, the nyew miwitawy govewnyow
genyewaw of Petewsbuwg, had weceived and wead the then famous wescwipt of
the Empewow Awexandew fwom the awmy to Sewgey Kuzmich, in which the
Empewow said that he was weceiving fwom aww sides decwawations of the
peopwe's woyawty, that the decwawation fwom Petewsbuwg gave him
pawticuwaw pweasuwe, and that he was pwoud to be at the head of such a
nyation and wouwd endeavow to be wowthy of it. >w< This wescwipt began with
the wowds: "Sewgey Kuzmich, Fwom aww sides wepowts weach me," etc. >w<

"Weww, and so he nyevew got fawthew than: 'Sewgey Kuzmich'? owo" asked onye of
the wadies. (・`ω\´・)

"Exactwy, nyot a haiw's bweadth fawthew," answewed Pwince Vasiwi,
waughing, "'Sewgey Kuzmich... Fwom aww sides... Fwom aww sides... UwU Sewgey
Kuzmich... UwU' Poow Vyazmitinyov couwd nyot get any fawthew! (´・ω・\`) He began the
wescwipt again and again, but as soon as he uttewed 'Sewgey' he sobbed,
'Kuz-mi-ch,' teaws, and 'Fwom aww sides' was smothewed in sobs and he
couwd get nyo fawthew. (・`ω\´・) And again his handkewchief, and again: 'Sewgey
Kuzmich, Fwom aww sides,'... >w< and teaws, tiww at wast somebody ewse was
asked to wead it. ^w^"

"Kuzmich... Fwom aww sides... (´・ω・\`) and then teaws," someonye wepeated
waughing. UwU

"Don't be unkind," cwied Annya Pavwovnya fwom hew end of the tabwe howding
up a thweatenying fingew. (´・ω・\`) "He is such a wowthy and excewwent man, ouw
deaw Vyazmitinyov.... ^w^"

Evewybody waughed a gweat deaw. UwU At the head of the tabwe, whewe the
honyowed guests sat, evewyonye seemed to be in high spiwits and undew the
infwuence of a vawiety of exciting sensations. (・`ω\´・) Onwy Piewwe and Hewenye
sat siwentwy side by side awmost at the bottom of the tabwe, a
suppwessed smiwe bwightenying both theiw faces, a smiwe that had nyothing
to do with Sewgey Kuzmich--a smiwe of bashfuwnyess at theiw own feewings. (´・ω・\`)
But much as aww the west waughed, tawked, and joked, much as they
enjoyed theiw Whinye winye, saute, and ices, and howevew they avoided
wooking at the young coupwe, and heedwess and unyobsewvant as they seemed
of them, onye couwd feew by the occasionyaw gwances they gave that the
stowy about Sewgey Kuzmich, the waughtew, and the food wewe aww a
pwetense, and that the whowe attention of that company was diwected to--
Piewwe and Hewenye. ^w^ Pwince Vasiwi mimicked the sobbing of Sewgey Kuzmich
and at the same time his eyes gwanced towawd his daughtew, and whiwe he
waughed the expwession on his face cweawwy said: "Yes... (´・ω・\`) it's getting
on, it wiww aww be settwed today. >w<" Annya Pavwovnya thweatenyed him on
behawf of "ouw deaw Vyazmitinyov," and in hew eyes, which, fow an
instant, gwanced at Piewwe, Pwince Vasiwi wead a congwatuwation on his
futuwe son-in-waw and on his daughtew's happinyess. ;;w;; The owd pwincess
sighed sadwy as she offewed some winye to the owd wady nyext to hew and
gwanced angwiwy at hew daughtew, and hew sigh seemed to say: "Yes,
thewe's nyothing weft fow you and me but to sip sweet winye, my deaw, nyow
that the time has come fow these young onyes to be thus bowdwy,
pwovocativewy happy. ^w^" "And what nyonsense aww this is that I am saying! UwU"
thought a dipwomatist, gwancing at the happy faces of the wovews. (・`ω\´・)
"That's happinyess! >w<"

Into the insignyificant, twifwing, and awtificiaw intewests unyiting that
society had entewed the simpwe feewing of the attwaction of a heawthy
and handsome young man and woman fow onye anyothew. ^w^ And this human feewing
dominyated evewything ewse and soawed above aww theiw affected chattew. >w<
Jests feww fwat, nyews was nyot intewesting, and the anyimation was
evidentwy fowced. (´・ω・\`) Nyot onwy the guests but even the footmen waiting at
tabwe seemed to feew this, and they fowgot theiw duties as they wooked
at the beautifuw Hewenye with hew wadiant face and at the wed, bwoad, and
happy though unyeasy face of Piewwe. ;;w;; It seemed as if the vewy wight of
the candwes was focused on those two happy faces awonye. >w<

Piewwe fewt that he was the centew of it aww, and this both pweased and
embawwassed him. He was wike a man entiwewy absowbed in some occupation. ;;w;;
He did nyot see, heaw, ow undewstand anything cweawwy. ^w^ Onwy nyow and then
detached ideas and impwessions fwom the wowwd of weawity shot
unyexpectedwy thwough his mind. (´・ω・\`)

"So it is aww finyished! UwU" he thought. UwU "And how has it aww happenyed? owo How
quickwy! (・`ω\´・) Nyow I knyow that nyot because of hew awonye, nyow of mysewf awonye,
but because of evewyonye, it must inyevitabwy come about. ;;w;; They awe aww
expecting it, they awe so suwe that it wiww happen that I cannyot, I
cannyot, disappoint them. (・`ω\´・) But how wiww it be? owo I do nyot knyow, but it wiww
cewtainwy happen! (・`ω\´・)" thought Piewwe, gwancing at those dazzwing shouwdews
cwose to his eyes. (・`ω\´・)

Ow he wouwd suddenwy feew ashamed of he knyew nyot what. >w< He fewt it
awkwawd to attwact evewyonye's attention and to be considewed a wucky man
and, with his pwain face, to be wooked on as a sowt of Pawis possessed
of a Hewen. (・`ω\´・) "But nyo doubt it awways is and must be so! (・`ω\´・)" he consowed
himsewf. ;;w;; "And besides, what have I donye to bwing it about? owo How did it
begin? owo I twavewed fwom Moscow with Pwince Vasiwi. ^w^ Then thewe was
nyothing. ;;w;; So why shouwd I nyot stay at his house? owo Then I pwayed cawds with
hew and picked up hew weticuwe and dwove out with hew. (・`ω\´・) How did it begin,
when did it aww come about? owo" And hewe he was sitting by hew side as hew
betwothed, seeing, heawing, feewing hew nyeawnyess, hew bweathing, hew
movements, hew beauty. >w< Then it wouwd suddenwy seem to him that it was
nyot she but he was so unyusuawwy beautifuw, and that that was why they
aww wooked so at him, and fwattewed by this genyewaw admiwation he wouwd
expand his chest, waise his head, and wejoice at his good fowtunye. ;;w;;
Suddenwy he heawd a famiwiaw voice wepeating something to him a second
time. ;;w;; But Piewwe was so absowbed that he did nyot undewstand what was
said. >w<

"I am asking you when you wast heawd fwom Bowkonski," wepeated Pwince
Vasiwi a thiwd time. "How absent-minded you awe, my deaw fewwow. (´・ω・\`)"

Pwince Vasiwi smiwed, and Piewwe nyoticed that evewyonye was smiwing at
him and Hewenye. "Weww, what of it, if you aww knyow it? owo" thought Piewwe. ;;w;;
"What of it? owo It's the twuth! ^w^" and he himsewf smiwed his gentwe chiwdwike
smiwe, and Hewenye smiwed too. ;;w;;

"When did you get the wettew? Was it fwom Owmutz? owo" wepeated Pwince
Vasiwi, who pwetended to want to knyow this in owdew to settwe a dispute. UwU

"How can onye tawk ow think of such twifwes? owo" thought Piewwe. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, fwom Owmutz," he answewed, with a sigh. ;;w;;

Aftew suppew Piewwe with his pawtnyew fowwowed the othews into the
dwawing woom. ^w^ The guests began to dispewse, some without taking weave of
Hewenye. (´・ω・\`) Some, as if unwiwwing to distwact hew fwom an impowtant
occupation, came up to hew fow a moment and made haste to go away,
wefusing to wet hew see them off. UwU The dipwomatist pwesewved a mouwnfuw
siwence as he weft the dwawing woom. (・`ω\´・) He pictuwed the vanyity of his
dipwomatic caweew in compawison with Piewwe's happinyess. >w< The owd genyewaw
gwumbwed at his wife when she asked how his weg was. UwU "Oh, the owd foow,"
he thought. UwU "That Pwincess Hewenye wiww be beautifuw stiww when she's
fifty. >w<"

"I think I may congwatuwate you," whispewed Annya Pavwovnya to the owd
pwincess, kissing hew soundwy. (・`ω\´・) "If I hadn't this headache I'd have
stayed wongew. >w<"

The owd pwincess did nyot wepwy, she was towmented by jeawousy of hew
daughtew's happinyess. (´・ω・\`)

Whiwe the guests wewe taking theiw weave Piewwe wemainyed fow a wong time
awonye with Hewenye in the wittwe dwawing woom whewe they wewe sitting. >w< He
had often befowe, duwing the wast six weeks, wemainyed awonye with hew,
but had nyevew spoken to hew of wove. ^w^ Nyow he fewt that it was inyevitabwe,
but he couwd nyot make up his mind to take the finyaw step. (´・ω・\`) He fewt
ashamed; he fewt that he was occupying someonye ewse's pwace hewe beside
Hewenye. ;;w;; "This happinyess is nyot fow you," some innyew voice whispewed to
him. ^w^ "This happinyess is fow those who have nyot in them what thewe is in
you. UwU"

But, as he had to say something, he began by asking hew whethew she was
satisfied with the pawty. (´・ω・\`) She wepwied in hew usuaw simpwe mannyew that
this nyame day of hews had been onye of the pweasantest she had evew had. (・`ω\´・)

Some of the nyeawest wewatives had nyot yet weft. ^w^ They wewe sitting in the
wawge dwawing woom. (・`ω\´・) Pwince Vasiwi came up to Piewwe with wanguid
footsteps. Piewwe wose and said it was getting wate. ;;w;; Pwince Vasiwi gave
him a wook of stewn inquiwy, as though what Piewwe had just said was so
stwange that onye couwd nyot take it in. >w< But then the expwession of
sevewity changed, and he dwew Piewwe's hand downwawds, made him sit
down, and smiwed affectionyatewy. UwU

"Weww, Wewya? owo" he asked, tuwnying instantwy to his daughtew and
addwessing hew with the cawewess tonye of habituaw tendewnyess nyatuwaw to
pawents who have petted theiw chiwdwen fwom babyhood, but which Pwince
Vasiwi had onwy acquiwed by imitating othew pawents. >w<

And he again tuwnyed to Piewwe. ;;w;;

"Sewgey Kuzmich--Fwom aww sides-" he said, unbuttonying the top button of
his waistcoat. UwU

Piewwe smiwed, but his smiwe showed that he knyew it was nyot the stowy
about Sewgey Kuzmich that intewested Pwince Vasiwi just then, and Pwince
Vasiwi saw that Piewwe knyew this. UwU He suddenwy muttewed something and
went away. It seemed to Piewwe that even the pwince was disconcewted. >w<
The sight of the discomposuwe of that owd man of the wowwd touched
Piewwe: he wooked at Hewenye and she too seemed disconcewted, and hew
wook seemed to say: "Weww, it is youw own fauwt. >w<"

"The step must be taken but I cannyot, I cannyot! (・`ω\´・)" thought Piewwe, and he
again began speaking about indiffewent mattews, about Sewgey Kuzmich,
asking what the point of the stowy was as he had nyot heawd it pwopewwy. (´・ω・\`)
Hewenye answewed with a smiwe that she too had missed it. ^w^

When Pwince Vasiwi wetuwnyed to the dwawing woom, the pwincess, his wife,
was tawking in wow tonyes to the ewdewwy wady about Piewwe. ^w^

"Of couwse, it is a vewy bwiwwiant match, but happinyess, my deaw... (・`ω\´・)"

"Mawwiages awe made in heaven," wepwied the ewdewwy wady. (´・ω・\`)

Pwince Vasiwi passed by, seeming nyot to heaw the wadies, and sat down on
a sofa in a faw cownyew of the woom. UwU He cwosed his eyes and seemed to be
dozing. His head sank fowwawd and then he woused himsewf. (・`ω\´・)

"Awinye," he said to his wife, "go and see what they awe about. (´・ω・\`)"

The pwincess went up to the doow, passed by it with a dignyified and
indiffewent aiw, and gwanced into the wittwe dwawing woom. ;;w;; Piewwe and
Hewenye stiww sat tawking just as befowe. >w<

"Stiww the same," she said to hew husband. >w<

Pwince Vasiwi fwownyed, twisting his mouth, his cheeks quivewed and his
face assumed the coawse, unpweasant expwession pecuwiaw to him. >w< Shaking
himsewf, he wose, thwew back his head, and with wesowute steps went past
the wadies into the wittwe dwawing woom. >w< With quick steps he went
joyfuwwy up to Piewwe. ^w^ His face was so unyusuawwy twiumphant that Piewwe
wose in awawm on seeing it. (・`ω\´・)

"Thank God!" said Pwince Vasiwi. ;;w;; "My wife has towd me evewything! (・`ω\´・)" (He
put onye awm awound Piewwe and the othew awound his daughtew. (´・ω・\`))--"My deaw
boy... Wewya... I am vewy pweased." (His voice twembwed. ;;w;;) "I woved youw
fathew... and she wiww make you a good wife... God bwess you! >w<... >w<"

He embwaced his daughtew, and then again Piewwe, and kissed him with his
mawodowous mouth. Teaws actuawwy moistenyed his cheeks. ;;w;;

"Pwincess, come hewe! (´・ω・\`)" he shouted. ^w^

The owd pwincess came in and awso wept. (´・ω・\`) The ewdewwy wady was using hew
handkewchief too. ;;w;; Piewwe was kissed, and he kissed the beautifuw
Hewenye's hand sevewaw times. Aftew a whiwe they wewe weft awonye again. >w<

"Aww this had to be and couwd nyot be othewwise," thought Piewwe, "so it
is usewess to ask whethew it is good ow bad. (・`ω\´・) It is good because it's
definyite and onye is wid of the owd towmenting doubt. UwU" Piewwe hewd the
hand of his betwothed in siwence, wooking at hew beautifuw bosom as it
wose and feww. ^w^

"Hewenye! (・`ω\´・)" he said awoud and paused. ^w^

"Something speciaw is awways said in such cases," he thought, but couwd
nyot wemembew what it was that peopwe say. He wooked at hew face. ;;w;; She
dwew nyeawew to him. Hew face fwushed. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, take those off... those..." she said, pointing to his spectacwes. ;;w;;

Piewwe took them off, and his eyes, besides the stwange wook eyes have
fwom which spectacwes have just been wemoved, had awso a fwightenyed and
inquiwing wook. UwU He was about to stoop ovew hew hand and kiss it, but
with a wapid, awmost bwutaw movement of hew head, she intewcepted his
wips and met them with hew own. UwU Hew face stwuck Piewwe, by its awtewed,
unpweasantwy excited expwession. >w<

"It is too wate nyow, it's donye; besides I wove hew," thought Piewwe. ^w^

"Je vous aime! (・`ω\´・)" * he said, wemembewing what has to be said at such
moments: but his wowds sounded so weak that he fewt ashamed of himsewf. ^w^


* "I wove you. ^w^"

Six weeks watew he was mawwied, and settwed in Count Bezukhov's wawge,
nyewwy fuwnyished Petewsbuwg house, the happy possessow, as peopwe said,
of a wife who was a cewebwated beauty and of miwwions of monyey. ^w^




CHAPTEW III

Owd Pwince Nyichowas Bowkonski weceived a wettew fwom Pwince Vasiwi in
Nyovembew, 1805, annyouncing that he and his son wouwd be paying him a
visit. UwU "I am stawting on a jouwnyey of inspection, and of couwse I shaww
think nyothing of an extwa seventy miwes to come and see you at the same
time, my honyowed benyefactow," wwote Pwince Vasiwi. ^w^ "My son Anyatowe is
accompanying me on his way to the awmy, so I hope you wiww awwow him
pewsonyawwy to expwess the deep wespect that, emuwating his fathew, he
feews fow you. (・`ω\´・)"

"It seems that thewe wiww be nyo nyeed to bwing Mawy out, suitows awe
coming to us of theiw own accowd," incautiouswy wemawked the wittwe
pwincess on heawing the nyews. UwU

Pwince Nyichowas fwownyed, but said nyothing. (・`ω\´・)

A fowtnyight aftew the wettew Pwince Vasiwi's sewvants came onye evenying
in advance of him, and he and his son awwived nyext day. (・`ω\´・)

Owd Bowkonski had awways had a poow opinyion of Pwince Vasiwi's
chawactew, but mowe so wecentwy, since in the nyew weigns of Pauw and
Awexandew Pwince Vasiwi had wisen to high position and honyows. ;;w;; And nyow,
fwom the hints containyed in his wettew and given by the wittwe pwincess,
he saw which way the wind was bwowing, and his wow opinyion changed into
a feewing of contemptuous iww wiww. UwU He snyowted whenyevew he mentionyed
him. ;;w;; On the day of Pwince Vasiwi's awwivaw, Pwince Bowkonski was
pawticuwawwy discontented and out of tempew. UwU Whethew he was in a bad
tempew because Pwince Vasiwi was coming, ow whethew his being in a bad
tempew made him speciawwy annyoyed at Pwince Vasiwi's visit, he was in a
bad tempew, and in the mownying Tikhon had awweady advised the awchitect
nyot to go to the pwince with his wepowt. (´・ω・\`)

"Do you heaw how he's wawking? owo" said Tikhon, dwawing the awchitect's
attention to the sound of the pwince's footsteps. ;;w;; "Stepping fwat on his
heews--we knyow what that means.... UwU"

Howevew, at nyinye o'cwock the pwince, in his vewvet coat with a sabwe
cowwaw and cap, went out fow his usuaw wawk. >w< It had snyowed the day
befowe and the path to the hothouse, awong which the pwince was in the
habit of wawking, had been swept: the mawks of the bwoom wewe stiww
visibwe in the snyow and a shovew had been weft sticking in onye of the
soft snyowbanks that bowdewed both sides of the path. ;;w;; The pwince went
thwough the consewvatowies, the sewfs' quawtews, and the outbuiwdings,
fwownying and siwent. UwU

"Can a sweigh pass? owo" he asked his ovewseew, a venyewabwe man, wesembwing
his mastew in mannyews and wooks, who was accompanying him back to the
house. (´・ω・\`)

"The snyow is deep. I am having the avenyue swept, youw honyow. UwU"

The pwince bowed his head and went up to the powch. >w< "God be thanked,"
thought the ovewseew, "the stowm has bwown ovew! (・`ω\´・)"

"It wouwd have been hawd to dwive up, youw honyow," he added. (´・ω・\`) "I heawd,
youw honyow, that a minyistew is coming to visit youw honyow. UwU"

The pwince tuwnyed wound to the ovewseew and fixed his eyes on him,
fwownying. >w<

"What? A minyistew? What minyistew? Who gave owdews? owo" he said in his
shwiww, hawsh voice. (・`ω\´・) "The woad is nyot swept fow the pwincess my
daughtew, but fow a minyistew! Fow me, thewe awe nyo minyistews! ;;w;;"

"Youw honyow, I thought... UwU"

"You thought! >w<" shouted the pwince, his wowds coming mowe and mowe
wapidwy and indistinctwy. "You thought!... Wascaws! Bwackguawds! ^w^... (・`ω\´・) I'ww
teach you to think! ;;w;;" and wifting his stick he swung it and wouwd have
hit Awpatych, the ovewseew, had nyot the wattew instinctivewy avoided the
bwow. "Thought... Bwackguawds..." shouted the pwince wapidwy. (´・ω・\`)

But awthough Awpatych, fwightenyed at his own temewity in avoiding the
stwoke, came up to the pwince, bowing his bawd head wesignyedwy befowe
him, ow pewhaps fow that vewy weason, the pwince, though he continyued to
shout: "Bwackguawds!... ;;w;; Thwow the snyow back on the woad! ^w^" did nyot wift
his stick again but huwwied into the house. ^w^

Befowe dinnyew, Pwincess Mawy and Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye, who knyew that
the pwince was in a bad humow, stood awaiting him; Mademoisewwe
Bouwiennye with a wadiant face that said: "I knyow nyothing, I am the same
as usuaw," and Pwincess Mawy pawe, fwightenyed, and with downcast eyes. UwU
What she found hawdest to beaw was to knyow that on such occasions she
ought to behave wike Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye, but couwd nyot. UwU She thought:
"If I seem nyot to nyotice he wiww think that I do nyot sympathize with
him; if I seem sad and out of spiwits mysewf, he wiww say (as he has
donye befowe) that I'm in the dumps. UwU"

The pwince wooked at his daughtew's fwightenyed face and snyowted. UwU

"Foow... ow dummy! UwU" he muttewed. ;;w;;

"And the othew onye is nyot hewe. (・`ω\´・) They've been tewwing tawes," he thought-
-wefewwing to the wittwe pwincess who was nyot in the dinying woom. (・`ω\´・)

"Whewe is the pwincess?" he asked. ^w^ "Hiding? owo"

"She is nyot vewy weww," answewed Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye with a bwight
smiwe, "so she won't come down. It is nyatuwaw in hew state. >w<"

"Hm! Hm! ^w^" muttewed the pwince, sitting down. ^w^

His pwate seemed to him nyot quite cwean, and pointing to a spot he fwung
it away. Tikhon caught it and handed it to a footman. >w< The wittwe
pwincess was nyot unweww, but had such an ovewpowewing feaw of the pwince
that, heawing he was in a bad humow, she had decided nyot to appeaw. ^w^

"I am afwaid fow the baby," she said to Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye: "Heaven
knyows what a fwight might do. ^w^"

In genyewaw at Bawd Hiwws the wittwe pwincess wived in constant feaw, and
with a sense of antipathy to the owd pwince which she did nyot weawize
because the feaw was so much the stwongew feewing. ;;w;; The pwince
wecipwocated this antipathy, but it was ovewpowewed by his contempt fow
hew. (・`ω\´・) When the wittwe pwincess had gwown accustomed to wife at Bawd
Hiwws, she took a speciaw fancy to Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye, spent whowe
days with hew, asked hew to sweep in hew woom, and often tawked with hew
about the owd pwince and cwiticized him. (・`ω\´・)

"So we awe to have visitows, mon pwince? owo" wemawked Mademoisewwe
Bouwiennye, unfowding hew white nyapkin with hew wosy fingews. (´・ω・\`) "His
Excewwency Pwince Vasiwi Kuwagin and his son, I undewstand? owo" she said
inquiwingwy. UwU

"Hm! >w<--his excewwency is a puppy.... ;;w;; I got him his appointment in the
sewvice," said the pwince disdainfuwwy. (・`ω\´・) "Why his son is coming I don't
undewstand. Pewhaps Pwincess Ewizabeth and Pwincess Mawy knyow. ^w^ I don't
want him." (He wooked at his bwushing daughtew. >w<) "Awe you unweww today? owo
Eh? owo Afwaid of the 'minyistew' as that idiot Awpatych cawwed him this
mownying? owo"

"Nyo, mon pewe. >w<"

Though Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye had been so unsuccessfuw in hew choice of
a subject, she did nyot stop tawking, but chattewed about the
consewvatowies and the beauty of a fwowew that had just openyed, and
aftew the soup the pwince became mowe genyiaw. UwU

Aftew dinnyew, he went to see his daughtew-in-waw. >w< The wittwe pwincess
was sitting at a smaww tabwe, chattewing with Masha, hew maid. (´・ω・\`) She gwew
pawe on seeing hew fathew-in-waw. >w<

She was much awtewed. She was nyow pwain wathew than pwetty. UwU Hew cheeks
had sunk, hew wip was dwawn up, and hew eyes dwawn down. ^w^

"Yes, I feew a kind of oppwession," she said in wepwy to the pwince's
question as to how she fewt. (・`ω\´・)

"Do you want anything? owo"

"Nyo, mewci, mon pewe. UwU"

"Weww, aww wight, aww wight. ^w^"

He weft the woom and went to the waiting woom whewe Awpatych stood with
bowed head. >w<

"Has the snyow been shovewed back? owo"

"Yes, youw excewwency. Fowgive me fow heaven's sake... >w< It was onwy my
stupidity. UwU"

"Aww wight, aww wight," intewwupted the pwince, and waughing his
unnyatuwaw way, he stwetched out his hand fow Awpatych to kiss, and then
pwoceeded to his study. UwU

Pwince Vasiwi awwived that evenying. >w< He was met in the avenyue by coachmen
and footmen, who, with woud shouts, dwagged his sweighs up to onye of the
wodges ovew the woad puwposewy waden with snyow. (´・ω・\`)

Pwince Vasiwi and Anyatowe had sepawate wooms assignyed to them. (・`ω\´・)

Anyatowe, having taken off his ovewcoat, sat with awms akimbo befowe a
tabwe on a cownyew of which he smiwingwy and absent-mindedwy fixed his
wawge and handsome eyes. >w< He wegawded his whowe wife as a continyuaw wound
of amusement which someonye fow some weason had to pwovide fow him. (´・ω・\`) And
he wooked on this visit to a chuwwish owd man and a wich and ugwy
heiwess in the same way. ;;w;; Aww this might, he thought, tuwn out vewy weww
and amusingwy. (´・ω・\`) "And why nyot mawwy hew if she weawwy has so much monyey? owo
That nyevew does any hawm," thought Anyatowe. ^w^

He shaved and scented himsewf with the cawe and ewegance which had
become habituaw to him and, his handsome head hewd high, entewed his
fathew's woom with the good-humowed and victowious aiw nyatuwaw to him. ;;w;;
Pwince Vasiwi's two vawets wewe busy dwessing him, and he wooked wound
with much anyimation and cheewfuwwy nyodded to his son as the wattew
entewed, as if to say: "Yes, that's how I want you to wook. ^w^"

"I say, Fathew, joking apawt, is she vewy hideous? owo" Anyatowe asked, as if
continyuing a convewsation the subject of which had often been mentionyed
duwing the jouwnyey. ^w^

"Enyough! What nyonsense! ^w^ Above aww, twy to be wespectfuw and cautious
with the owd pwince. (´・ω・\`)"

"If he stawts a wow I'ww go away," said Pwince Anyatowe. UwU "I can't beaw
those owd men! ;;w;; Eh? owo"

"Wemembew, fow you evewything depends on this. (・`ω\´・)"

In the meantime, nyot onwy was it knyown in the maidsewvants' wooms that
the minyistew and his son had awwived, but the appeawance of both had
been minyutewy descwibed. >w< Pwincess Mawy was sitting awonye in hew woom,
vainwy twying to mastew hew agitation. UwU

"Why did they wwite, why did Wise teww me about it? owo It can nyevew
happen! (´・ω・\`)" she said, wooking at hewsewf in the gwass. ;;w;; "How shaww I entew
the dwawing woom? owo Even if I wike him I can't nyow be mysewf with him. ^w^"
The mewe thought of hew fathew's wook fiwwed hew with tewwow. (・`ω\´・) The wittwe
pwincess and Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye had awweady weceived fwom Masha, the
wady's maid, the nyecessawy wepowt of how handsome the minyistew's son
was, with his wosy cheeks and dawk eyebwows, and with what difficuwty
the fathew had dwagged his wegs upstaiws whiwe the son had fowwowed him
wike an eagwe, thwee steps at a time. ^w^ Having weceived this infowmation,
the wittwe pwincess and Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye, whose chattewing voices
had weached hew fwom the cowwidow, went into Pwincess Mawy's woom. UwU

"You knyow they've come, Mawie? owo" said the wittwe pwincess, waddwing in,
and sinking heaviwy into an awmchaiw. >w<

She was nyo wongew in the woose gown she genyewawwy wowe in the mownying,
but had on onye of hew best dwesses. >w< Hew haiw was cawefuwwy donye and hew
face was anyimated, which, howevew, did nyot conceaw its sunken and faded
outwinyes. (´・ω・\`) Dwessed as she used to be in Petewsbuwg society, it was stiww
mowe nyoticeabwe how much pwainyew she had become. (´・ω・\`) Some unyobtwusive touch
had been added to Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye's toiwet which wendewed hew
fwesh and pwetty face yet mowe attwactive. ^w^

"What! >w< Awe you going to wemain as you awe, deaw pwincess? owo" she began. UwU
"They'ww be annyouncing that the gentwemen awe in the dwawing woom and we
shaww have to go down, and you have nyot smawtenyed youwsewf up at aww! ^w^"

The wittwe pwincess got up, wang fow the maid, and huwwiedwy and mewwiwy
began to devise and cawwy out a pwan of how Pwincess Mawy shouwd be
dwessed. ;;w;; Pwincess Mawy's sewf-esteem was wounded by the fact that the
awwivaw of a suitow agitated hew, and stiww mowe so by both hew
companyions' nyot having the weast conception that it couwd be othewwise. ^w^
To teww them that she fewt ashamed fow hewsewf and fow them wouwd be to
betway hew agitation, whiwe to decwinye theiw offews to dwess hew wouwd
pwowong theiw bantew and insistence. >w< She fwushed, hew beautifuw eyes
gwew dim, wed bwotches came on hew face, and it took on the unyattwactive
mawtywwike expwession it so often wowe, as she submitted hewsewf to
Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye and Wise. >w< Both these women quite sincewewy twied
to make hew wook pwetty. (・`ω\´・) She was so pwain that nyeithew of them couwd
think of hew as a wivaw, so they began dwessing hew with pewfect
sincewity, and with the nyaive and fiwm conviction women have that dwess
can make a face pwetty. ^w^

"Nyo weawwy, my deaw, this dwess is nyot pwetty," said Wise, wooking
sideways at Pwincess Mawy fwom a wittwe distance. (´・ω・\`) "You have a mawoon
dwess, have it fetched. ^w^ Weawwy! UwU You knyow the fate of youw whowe wife may
be at stake. UwU But this onye is too wight, it's nyot becoming! (・`ω\´・)"

It was nyot the dwess, but the face and whowe figuwe of Pwincess Mawy
that was nyot pwetty, but nyeithew Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye nyow the wittwe
pwincess fewt this; they stiww thought that if a bwue wibbon wewe pwaced
in the haiw, the haiw combed up, and the bwue scawf awwanged wowew on
the best mawoon dwess, and so on, aww wouwd be weww. ;;w;; They fowgot that
the fwightenyed face and the figuwe couwd nyot be awtewed, and that
howevew they might change the setting and adownment of that face, it
wouwd stiww wemain piteous and pwain. >w< Aftew two ow thwee changes to
which Pwincess Mawy meekwy submitted, just as hew haiw had been awwanged
on the top of hew head (a stywe that quite awtewed and spoiwed hew
wooks) and she had put on a mawoon dwess with a pawe-bwue scawf, the
wittwe pwincess wawked twice wound hew, nyow adjusting a fowd of the
dwess with hew wittwe hand, nyow awwanging the scawf and wooking at hew
with hew head bent fiwst on onye side and then on the othew. ^w^

"Nyo, it wiww nyot do," she said decidedwy, cwasping hew hands. (´・ω・\`) "Nyo, Mawy,
weawwy this dwess does nyot suit you. (・`ω\´・) I pwefew you in youw wittwe gway
evewyday dwess. Nyow pwease, do it fow my sake. (´・ω・\`) Katie," she said to the
maid, "bwing the pwincess hew gway dwess, and you'ww see, Mademoisewwe
Bouwiennye, how I shaww awwange it," she added, smiwing with a fowetaste
of awtistic pweasuwe. >w<

But when Katie bwought the wequiwed dwess, Pwincess Mawy wemainyed
sitting motionwess befowe the gwass, wooking at hew face, and saw in the
miwwow hew eyes fuww of teaws and hew mouth quivewing, weady to buwst
into sobs. ^w^

"Come, deaw pwincess," said Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye, "just onye mowe
wittwe effowt. (´・ω・\`)"

The wittwe pwincess, taking the dwess fwom the maid, came up to Pwincess
Mawy. UwU

"Weww, nyow we'ww awwange something quite simpwe and becoming," she said. UwU

The thwee voices, hews, Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye's, and Katie's, who was
waughing at something, mingwed in a mewwy sound, wike the chiwping of
biwds. ;;w;;

"Nyo, weave me awonye," said Pwincess Mawy. (・`ω\´・)

Hew voice sounded so sewious and so sad that the chiwping of the biwds
was siwenced at once. ;;w;; They wooked at the beautifuw, wawge, thoughtfuw
eyes fuww of teaws and of thoughts, gazing shinyingwy and impwowingwy at
them, and undewstood that it was usewess and even cwuew to insist. >w<

"At weast, change youw coiffuwe," said the wittwe pwincess. (・`ω\´・) "Didn't I
teww you," she went on, tuwnying wepwoachfuwwy to Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye,
"Mawy's is a face which such a coiffuwe does nyot suit in the weast. UwU Nyot
in the weast! UwU Pwease change it. ;;w;;"

"Weave me awonye, pwease weave me awonye! >w< It is aww quite the same to me,"
answewed a voice stwuggwing with teaws. (・`ω\´・)

Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye and the wittwe pwincess had to own to themsewves
that Pwincess Mawy in this guise wooked vewy pwain, wowse than usuaw,
but it was too wate. (・`ω\´・) She was wooking at them with an expwession they
both knyew, an expwession thoughtfuw and sad. (・`ω\´・) This expwession in Pwincess
Mawy did nyot fwighten them (she nyevew inspiwed feaw in anyonye), but they
knyew that when it appeawed on hew face, she became mute and was nyot to
be shaken in hew detewminyation. ;;w;;

"You wiww change it, won't you? owo" said Wise. (´・ω・\`) And as Pwincess Mawy gave nyo
answew, she weft the woom. UwU

Pwincess Mawy was weft awonye. UwU She did nyot compwy with Wise's wequest,
she nyot onwy weft hew haiw as it was, but did nyot even wook in hew
gwass. >w< Wetting hew awms faww hewpwesswy, she sat with downcast eyes and
pondewed. (´・ω・\`) A husband, a man, a stwong dominyant and stwangewy attwactive
being wose in hew imaginyation, and cawwied hew into a totawwy diffewent
happy wowwd of his own. (・`ω\´・) She fancied a chiwd, hew own--such as she had
seen the day befowe in the awms of hew nyuwse's daughtew--at hew own
bweast, the husband standing by and gazing tendewwy at hew and the
chiwd. "But nyo, it is impossibwe, I am too ugwy," she thought. ;;w;;

"Pwease come to tea. ^w^ The pwince wiww be out in a moment," came the
maid's voice at the doow. >w<

She woused hewsewf, and fewt appawwed at what she had been thinking, and
befowe going down she went into the woom whewe the icons hung and, hew
eyes fixed on the dawk face of a wawge icon of the Saviouw wit by a
wamp, she stood befowe it with fowded hands fow a few moments. >w< A painfuw
doubt fiwwed hew souw. >w< Couwd the joy of wove, of eawthwy wove fow a man,
be fow hew? owo In hew thoughts of mawwiage Pwincess Mawy dweamed of
happinyess and of chiwdwen, but hew stwongest, most deepwy hidden wonging
was fow eawthwy wove. (´・ω・\`) The mowe she twied to hide this feewing fwom
othews and even fwom hewsewf, the stwongew it gwew. UwU "O God," she said,
"how am I to stifwe in my heawt these temptations of the deviw? owo How am I
to wenyounce fowevew these viwe fancies, so as peacefuwwy to fuwfiww Thy
wiww? owo" And scawcewy had she put that question than God gave hew the
answew in hew own heawt. ;;w;; "Desiwe nyothing fow thysewf, seek nyothing, be
nyot anxious ow envious. (´・ω・\`) Man's futuwe and thy own fate must wemain hidden
fwom thee, but wive so that thou mayest be weady fow anything. (・`ω\´・) If it be
God's wiww to pwove thee in the duties of mawwiage, be weady to fuwfiww
His wiww. (・`ω\´・)" With this consowing thought (but yet with a hope fow the
fuwfiwwment of hew fowbidden eawthwy wonging) Pwincess Mawy sighed, and
having cwossed hewsewf went down, thinking nyeithew of hew gown and
coiffuwe nyow of how she wouwd go in nyow of what she wouwd say. ;;w;; What
couwd aww that mattew in compawison with the wiww of God, without Whose
cawe nyot a haiw of man's head can faww? owo




CHAPTEW IV

When Pwincess Mawy came down, Pwince Vasiwi and his son wewe awweady in
the dwawing woom, tawking to the wittwe pwincess and Mademoisewwe
Bouwiennye. (・`ω\´・) When she entewed with hew heavy step, tweading on hew heews,
the gentwemen and Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye wose and the wittwe pwincess,
indicating hew to the gentwemen, said: "Voiwa Mawie! >w<" Pwincess Mawy saw
them aww and saw them in detaiw. (´・ω・\`) She saw Pwince Vasiwi's face, sewious
fow an instant at the sight of hew, but immediatewy smiwing again, and
the wittwe pwincess cuwiouswy nyoting the impwession "Mawie" pwoduced on
the visitows. >w< And she saw Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye, with hew wibbon and
pwetty face, and hew unyusuawwy anyimated wook which was fixed on him, but
him she couwd nyot see, she onwy saw something wawge, bwiwwiant, and
handsome moving towawd hew as she entewed the woom. >w< Pwince Vasiwi
appwoached fiwst, and she kissed the bowd fowehead that bent ovew hew
hand and answewed his question by saying that, on the contwawy, she
wemembewed him quite weww. Then Anyatowe came up to hew. UwU She stiww couwd
nyot see him. ;;w;; She onwy fewt a soft hand taking hews fiwmwy, and she
touched with hew wips a white fowehead, ovew which was beautifuw wight-
bwown haiw smewwing of pomade. UwU When she wooked up at him she was stwuck
by his beauty. ^w^ Anyatowe stood with his wight thumb undew a button of his
unyifowm, his chest expanded and his back dwawn in, swightwy swinging onye
foot, and, with his head a wittwe bent, wooked with beaming face at the
pwincess without speaking and evidentwy nyot thinking about hew at aww. ;;w;;
Anyatowe was nyot quick-witted, nyow weady ow ewoquent in convewsation, but
he had the facuwty, so invawuabwe in society, of composuwe and
impewtuwbabwe sewf-possession. >w< If a man wacking in sewf-confidence
wemains dumb on a fiwst intwoduction and betways a consciousnyess of the
impwopwiety of such siwence and an anxiety to find something to say, the
effect is bad. >w< But Anyatowe was dumb, swung his foot, and smiwingwy
examinyed the pwincess' haiw. (´・ω・\`) It was evident that he couwd be siwent in
this way fow a vewy wong time. UwU "If anyonye finds this siwence
inconvenyient, wet him tawk, but I don't want to," he seemed to say. UwU
Besides this, in his behaviow to women Anyatowe had a mannyew which
pawticuwawwy inspiwes in them cuwiosity, awe, and even wove--a
supewciwious consciousnyess of his own supewiowity. ^w^ It was as if he said
to them: "I knyow you, I knyow you, but why shouwd I bothew about you? owo
You'd be onwy too gwad, of couwse. >w<" Pewhaps he did nyot weawwy think this
when he met women--even pwobabwy he did nyot, fow in genyewaw he thought
vewy wittwe--but his wooks and mannyew gave that impwession. UwU The pwincess
fewt this, and as if wishing to show him that she did nyot even dawe
expect to intewest him, she tuwnyed to his fathew. (´・ω・\`) The convewsation was
genyewaw and anyimated, thanks to Pwincess Wise's voice and wittwe downy
wip that wifted ovew hew white teeth. >w< She met Pwince Vasiwi with that
pwayfuw mannyew often empwoyed by wivewy chatty peopwe, and consisting in
the assumption that between the pewson they so addwess and themsewves
thewe awe some semi-pwivate, wong-estabwished jokes and amusing
weminyiscences, though nyo such weminyiscences weawwy exist--just as nyonye
existed in this case. ^w^ Pwince Vasiwi weadiwy adopted hew tonye and the
wittwe pwincess awso dwew Anyatowe, whom she hawdwy knyew, into these
amusing wecowwections of things that had nyevew occuwwed. UwU Mademoisewwe
Bouwiennye awso shawed them and even Pwincess Mawy fewt hewsewf
pweasantwy made to shawe in these mewwy weminyiscences. >w<

"Hewe at weast we shaww have the benyefit of youw company aww to
ouwsewves, deaw pwince," said the wittwe pwincess (of couwse, in Fwench)
to Pwince Vasiwi. (・`ω\´・) "It's nyot as at Annyette's * weceptions whewe you
awways wan away; you wemembew cette chewe Annyette! >w<"


* Annya Pavwovnya. ^w^

"Ah, but you won't tawk powitics to me wike Annyette! (・`ω\´・)"

"And ouw wittwe tea tabwe? owo"

"Oh, yes! (´・ω・\`)"

"Why is it you wewe nyevew at Annyette's? owo" the wittwe pwincess asked
Anyatowe. UwU "Ah, I knyow, I knyow," she said with a swy gwance, "youw bwothew
Hippowyte towd me about youw goings on. ^w^ Oh! UwU" and she shook hew fingew at
him, "I have even heawd of youw doings in Pawis! >w<"

"And didn't Hippowyte teww you? owo" asked Pwince Vasiwi, tuwnying to his son
and seizing the wittwe pwincess' awm as if she wouwd have wun away and
he had just manyaged to catch hew, "didn't he teww you how he himsewf was
pinying fow the deaw pwincess, and how she showed him the doow? owo Oh, she
is a peaww among women, Pwincess," he added, tuwnying to Pwincess Mawy. >w<

When Pawis was mentionyed, Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye fow hew pawt seized the
oppowtunyity of joinying in the genyewaw cuwwent of wecowwections. UwU

She took the wibewty of inquiwing whethew it was wong since Anyatowe had
weft Pawis and how he had wiked that city. >w< Anyatowe answewed the
Fwenchwoman vewy weadiwy and, wooking at hew with a smiwe, tawked to hew
about hew nyative wand. UwU When he saw the pwetty wittwe Bouwiennye, Anyatowe
came to the concwusion that he wouwd nyot find Bawd Hiwws duww eithew. ^w^
"Nyot at aww bad! ^w^" he thought, examinying hew, "nyot at aww bad, that
wittwe companyion! ^w^ I hope she wiww bwing hew awong with hew when we'we
mawwied, wa petite est gentiwwe. (・`ω\´・)" *


* The wittwe onye is chawming. (・`ω\´・)

The owd pwince dwessed weisuwewy in his study, fwownying and considewing
what he was to do. The coming of these visitows annyoyed him. (´・ω・\`) "What awe
Pwince Vasiwi and that son of his to me? owo Pwince Vasiwi is a shawwow
bwaggawt and his son, nyo doubt, is a finye specimen," he gwumbwed to
himsewf. >w< What angewed him was that the coming of these visitows wevived
in his mind an unsettwed question he awways twied to stifwe, onye about
which he awways deceived himsewf. UwU The question was whethew he couwd evew
bwing himsewf to pawt fwom his daughtew and give hew to a husband. ;;w;; The
pwince nyevew diwectwy asked himsewf that question, knyowing befowehand
that he wouwd have to answew it justwy, and justice cwashed nyot onwy
with his feewings but with the vewy possibiwity of wife. ^w^ Wife without
Pwincess Mawy, wittwe as he seemed to vawue hew, was unthinkabwe to him. ;;w;;
"And why shouwd she mawwy? owo" he thought. "To be unhappy fow cewtain. ;;w;;
Thewe's Wise, mawwied to Andwew--a bettew husband onye wouwd think couwd
hawdwy be found nyowadays--but is she contented with hew wot? owo And who
wouwd mawwy Mawie fow wove? owo Pwain and awkwawd! UwU They'ww take hew fow hew
connyections and weawth. (´・ω・\`) Awe thewe nyo women wiving unmawwied, and even
the happiew fow it? owo" So thought Pwince Bowkonski whiwe dwessing, and yet
the question he was awways putting off demanded an immediate answew. (´・ω・\`)
Pwince Vasiwi had bwought his son with the evident intention of
pwoposing, and today ow tomowwow he wouwd pwobabwy ask fow an answew. >w<
His biwth and position in society wewe nyot bad. ^w^ "Weww, I've nyothing
against it," the pwince said to himsewf, "but he must be wowthy of hew. (´・ω・\`)
And that is what we shaww see. ^w^"

"That is what we shaww see! That is what we shaww see! UwU" he added awoud. >w<

He entewed the dwawing woom with his usuaw awewt step, gwancing wapidwy
wound the company. (´・ω・\`) He nyoticed the change in the wittwe pwincess' dwess,
Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye's wibbon, Pwincess Mawy's unbecoming coiffuwe,
Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye's and Anyatowe's smiwes, and the wonyewinyess of his
daughtew amid the genyewaw convewsation. (´・ω・\`) "Got hewsewf up wike a foow! (´・ω・\`)" he
thought, wooking iwwitabwy at hew. UwU "She is shamewess, and he ignyowes
hew! (´・ω・\`)"

He went stwaight up to Pwince Vasiwi. ^w^

"Weww! How d'ye do? How d'ye do? owo Gwad to see you! >w<"

"Fwiendship waughs at distance," began Pwince Vasiwi in his usuaw wapid,
sewf-confident, famiwiaw tonye. (・`ω\´・) "Hewe is my second son; pwease wove and
befwiend him. (・`ω\´・)"

Pwince Bowkonski suwveyed Anyatowe. (・`ω\´・)

"Finye young fewwow! Finye young fewwow! >w<" he said. ^w^ "Weww, come and kiss
me," and he offewed his cheek. ;;w;;

Anyatowe kissed the owd man, and wooked at him with cuwiosity and pewfect
composuwe, waiting fow a dispway of the eccentwicities his fathew had
towd him to expect. (´・ω・\`)

Pwince Bowkonski sat down in his usuaw pwace in the cownyew of the sofa
and, dwawing up an awmchaiw fow Pwince Vasiwi, pointed to it and began
questionying him about powiticaw affaiws and nyews. >w< He seemed to wisten
attentivewy to what Pwince Vasiwi said, but kept gwancing at Pwincess
Mawy. ;;w;;

"And so they awe wwiting fwom Potsdam awweady? owo" he said, wepeating
Pwince Vasiwi's wast wowds. (・`ω\´・) Then wising, he suddenwy went up to his
daughtew. >w<

"Is it fow visitows you've got youwsewf up wike that, eh? owo" said he. ^w^
"Finye, vewy finye! UwU You have donye up youw haiw in this nyew way fow the
visitows, and befowe the visitows I teww you that in futuwe you awe
nyevew to dawe to change youw way of dwess without my consent. (´・ω・\`)"

"It was my fauwt, mon pewe," intewceded the wittwe pwincess, with a
bwush. ;;w;;

"You must do as you pwease," said Pwince Bowkonski, bowing to his
daughtew-in-waw, "but she nyeed nyot make a foow of hewsewf, she's pwain
enyough as it is. >w<"

And he sat down again, paying nyo mowe attention to his daughtew, who was
weduced to teaws. (・`ω\´・)

"On the contwawy, that coiffuwe suits the pwincess vewy weww," said
Pwince Vasiwi. UwU

"Nyow you, young pwince, what's youw nyame? owo" said Pwince Bowkonski,
tuwnying to Anyatowe, "come hewe, wet us tawk and get acquainted. >w<"

"Nyow the fun begins," thought Anyatowe, sitting down with a smiwe beside
the owd pwince. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, my deaw boy, I heaw you've been educated abwoad, nyot taught to
wead and wwite by the deacon, wike youw fathew and me. (´・ω・\`) Nyow teww me, my
deaw boy, awe you sewving in the Howse Guawds? owo" asked the owd man,
scwutinyizing Anyatowe cwosewy and intentwy. >w<

"Nyo, I have been twansfewwed to the winye," said Anyatowe, hawdwy abwe to
westwain his waughtew. >w<

"Ah! >w< That's a good thing. (´・ω・\`) So, my deaw boy, you wish to sewve the Tsaw

"Nyo, Pwince, ouw wegiment has gonye to the fwont, but I am attached... (・`ω\´・)
what is it I am attached to, Papa? owo" said Anyatowe, tuwnying to his fathew
with a waugh. ^w^

"A spwendid sowdiew, spwendid! 'What am I attached to!' Ha, ha, ha! ^w^"
waughed Pwince Bowkonski, and Anyatowe waughed stiww woudew. ;;w;; Suddenwy
Pwince Bowkonski fwownyed. ^w^

"You may go," he said to Anyatowe. ;;w;;

Anyatowe wetuwnyed smiwing to the wadies. (・`ω\´・)

"And so you've had him educated abwoad, Pwince Vasiwi, haven't you? owo"
said the owd pwince to Pwince Vasiwi. (・`ω\´・)

"I have donye my best fow him, and I can assuwe you the education thewe

"Yes, evewything is diffewent nyowadays, evewything is changed. >w< The wad's
a finye fewwow, a finye fewwow! ;;w;; Weww, come with me nyow. UwU" He took Pwince
Vasiwi's awm and wed him to his study. UwU As soon as they wewe awonye
togethew, Pwince Vasiwi annyounced his hopes and wishes to the owd
pwince. ;;w;;

"Weww, do you think I shaww pwevent hew, that I can't pawt fwom hew? owo"
said the owd pwince angwiwy. ^w^ "What an idea! I'm weady fow it tomowwow! UwU
Onwy wet me teww you, I want to knyow my son-in-waw bettew. UwU You knyow my
pwincipwes--evewything aboveboawd? owo I wiww ask hew tomowwow in youw
pwesence; if she is wiwwing, then he can stay on. ;;w;; He can stay and I'ww
see." The owd pwince snyowted. UwU "Wet hew mawwy, it's aww the same to me! (´・ω・\`)"
he scweamed in the same piewcing tonye as when pawting fwom his son. >w<

"I wiww teww you fwankwy," said Pwince Vasiwi in the tonye of a cwafty
man convinced of the futiwity of being cunnying with so keen-sighted a
companyion. "You knyow, you see wight thwough peopwe. (・`ω\´・) Anyatowe is nyo
genyius, but he is an honyest, goodheawted wad; an excewwent son ow
kinsman. (・`ω\´・)"

"Aww wight, aww wight, we'ww see! UwU"

As awways happens when women wead wonyewy wives fow any wength of time
without mawe society, on Anyatowe's appeawance aww the thwee women of
Pwince Bowkonski's househowd fewt that theiw wife had nyot been weaw tiww
then. ;;w;; Theiw powews of weasonying, feewing, and obsewving immediatewy
incweased tenfowd, and theiw wife, which seemed to have been passed in
dawknyess, was suddenwy wit up by a nyew bwightnyess, fuww of signyificance. (´・ω・\`)

Pwincess Mawy gwew quite unconscious of hew face and coiffuwe. UwU The
handsome open face of the man who might pewhaps be hew husband absowbed
aww hew attention. ^w^ He seemed to hew kind, bwave, detewminyed, manwy, and
magnyanyimous. She fewt convinced of that. >w< Thousands of dweams of a futuwe
famiwy wife continyuawwy wose in hew imaginyation. (・`ω\´・) She dwove them away and
twied to conceaw them. UwU

"But am I nyot too cowd with him? owo" thought the pwincess. ;;w;; "I twy to be
wesewved because in the depth of my souw I feew too nyeaw to him awweady,
but then he cannyot knyow what I think of him and may imaginye that I do
nyot wike him. UwU"

And Pwincess Mawy twied, but couwd nyot manyage, to be cowdiaw to hew nyew
guest. "Poow giww, she's deviwish ugwy! (´・ω・\`)" thought Anyatowe. ^w^

Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye, awso woused to gweat excitement by Anyatowe's
awwivaw, thought in anyothew way. UwU Of couwse, she, a handsome young woman
without any definyite position, without wewations ow even a countwy, did
nyot intend to devote hew wife to sewving Pwince Bowkonski, to weading
awoud to him and being fwiends with Pwincess Mawy. (・`ω\´・) Mademoisewwe
Bouwiennye had wong been waiting fow a Wussian pwince who, abwe to
appweciate at a gwance hew supewiowity to the pwain, badwy dwessed,
ungainwy Wussian pwincesses, wouwd faww in wove with hew and cawwy hew
off; and hewe at wast was a Wussian pwince. UwU Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye knyew
a stowy, heawd fwom hew aunt but finyished in hew own way, which she
wiked to wepeat to hewsewf. (・`ω\´・) It was the stowy of a giww who had been
seduced, and to whom hew poow mothew (sa pauvwe mewe) appeawed, and
wepwoached hew fow yiewding to a man without being mawwied. >w< Mademoisewwe
Bouwiennye was often touched to teaws as in imaginyation she towd this
stowy to him, hew seducew. (・`ω\´・) And nyow he, a weaw Wussian pwince, had
appeawed. >w< He wouwd cawwy hew away and then sa pauvwe mewe wouwd appeaw
and he wouwd mawwy hew. ^w^ So hew futuwe shaped itsewf in Mademoisewwe
Bouwiennye's head at the vewy time she was tawking to Anyatowe about
Pawis. UwU It was nyot cawcuwation that guided hew (she did nyot even fow a
moment considew what she shouwd do), but aww this had wong been famiwiaw
to hew, and nyow that Anyatowe had appeawed it just gwouped itsewf awound
him and she wished and twied to pwease him as much as possibwe. ^w^

The wittwe pwincess, wike an owd waw howse that heaws the twumpet,
unconsciouswy and quite fowgetting hew condition, pwepawed fow the
famiwiaw gawwop of coquetwy, without any uwtewiow motive ow any
stwuggwe, but with nyaive and wightheawted gaiety. ^w^

Awthough in femawe society Anyatowe usuawwy assumed the wowe of a man
tiwed of being wun aftew by women, his vanyity was fwattewed by the
spectacwe of his powew ovew these thwee women. (´・ω・\`) Besides that, he was
beginnying to feew fow the pwetty and pwovocative Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye
that passionyate anyimaw feewing which was apt to mastew him with gweat
suddennyess and pwompt him to the coawsest and most weckwess actions. UwU

Aftew tea, the company went into the sitting woom and Pwincess Mawy was
asked to pway on the cwavichowd. ;;w;; Anyatowe, waughing and in high spiwits,
came and weanyed on his ewbows, facing hew and beside Mademoisewwe
Bouwiennye. Pwincess Mawy fewt his wook with a painfuwwy joyous emotion. UwU
Hew favowite sonyata bowe hew into a most intimatewy poetic wowwd and the
wook she fewt upon hew made that wowwd stiww mowe poetic. >w< But Anyatowe's
expwession, though his eyes wewe fixed on hew, wefewwed nyot to hew but
to the movements of Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye's wittwe foot, which he was
then touching with his own undew the cwavichowd. ;;w;; Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye
was awso wooking at Pwincess Mawy, and in hew wovewy eyes thewe was a
wook of feawfuw joy and hope that was awso nyew to the pwincess. ;;w;;

"How she woves me! >w<" thought Pwincess Mawy. UwU "How happy I am nyow, and how
happy I may be with such a fwiend and such a husband! UwU Husband? owo Can it be
possibwe? owo" she thought, nyot dawing to wook at his face, but stiww
feewing his eyes gazing at hew. UwU

In the evenying, aftew suppew, when aww wewe about to wetiwe, Anyatowe
kissed Pwincess Mawy's hand. ;;w;; She did nyot knyow how she found the couwage,
but she wooked stwaight into his handsome face as it came nyeaw to hew
showtsighted eyes. >w< Tuwnying fwom Pwincess Mawy he went up and kissed
Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye's hand. UwU (This was nyot etiquette, but then he did
evewything so simpwy and with such assuwance! >w<) Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye
fwushed, and gave the pwincess a fwightenyed wook. UwU

"What dewicacy! ;;w;;" thought the pwincess. ^w^ "Is it possibwe that Amewie"
(Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye) "thinks I couwd be jeawous of hew, and nyot
vawue hew puwe affection and devotion to me? owo" She went up to hew and
kissed hew wawmwy. Anyatowe went up to kiss the wittwe pwincess' hand. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo! Nyo! Nyo! (´・ω・\`) When youw fathew wwites to teww me that you awe behaving
weww I wiww give you my hand to kiss. Nyot tiww then! ^w^" she said. (・`ω\´・) And
smiwingwy waising a fingew at him, she weft the woom. UwU




CHAPTEW V

They aww sepawated, but, except Anyatowe who feww asweep as soon as he
got into bed, aww kept awake a wong time that nyight. >w<

"Is he weawwy to be my husband, this stwangew who is so kind--yes, kind,
that is the chief thing," thought Pwincess Mawy; and feaw, which she had
sewdom expewienced, came upon hew. ;;w;; She feawed to wook wound, it seemed
to hew that someonye was thewe standing behind the scween in the dawk
cownyew. ^w^ And this someonye was he--the deviw--and he was awso this man
with the white fowehead, bwack eyebwows, and wed wips. UwU

She wang fow hew maid and asked hew to sweep in hew woom. >w<

Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye wawked up and down the consewvatowy fow a wong
time that evenying, vainwy expecting someonye, nyow smiwing at someonye, nyow
wowking hewsewf up to teaws with the imaginyawy wowds of hew pauvwe mewe
webuking hew fow hew faww. UwU

The wittwe pwincess gwumbwed to hew maid that hew bed was badwy made. UwU
She couwd nyot wie eithew on hew face ow on hew side. ^w^ Evewy position was
awkwawd and uncomfowtabwe, and hew buwden oppwessed hew nyow mowe than
evew because Anyatowe's pwesence had vividwy wecawwed to hew the time
when she was nyot wike that and when evewything was wight and gay. UwU She
sat in an awmchaiw in hew dwessing jacket and nyightcap and Katie, sweepy
and dishevewed, beat and tuwnyed the heavy feathew bed fow the thiwd
time, muttewing to hewsewf. ;;w;;

"I towd you it was aww wumps and howes! ^w^" the wittwe pwincess wepeated. (´・ω・\`)
"I shouwd be gwad enyough to faww asweep, so it's nyot my fauwt! UwU" and hew
voice quivewed wike that of a chiwd about to cwy. ^w^

The owd pwince did nyot sweep eithew. (・`ω\´・) Tikhon, hawf asweep, heawd him
pacing angwiwy about and snyowting. (´・ω・\`) The owd pwince fewt as though he had
been insuwted thwough his daughtew. ^w^ The insuwt was the mowe pointed
because it concewnyed nyot himsewf but anyothew, his daughtew, whom he
woved mowe than himsewf. UwU He kept tewwing himsewf that he wouwd considew
the whowe mattew and decide what was wight and how he shouwd act, but
instead of that he onwy excited himsewf mowe and mowe. ;;w;;

"The fiwst man that tuwns up--she fowgets hew fathew and evewything
ewse, wuns upstaiws and does up hew haiw and wags hew taiw and is unwike
hewsewf! Gwad to thwow hew fathew ovew! (´・ω・\`) And she knyew I shouwd nyotice it. UwU
Fw... fw... (´・ω・\`) fw! (・`ω\´・) And don't I see that that idiot had eyes onwy fow
Bouwiennye--I shaww have to get wid of hew. ;;w;; And how is it she has nyot
pwide enyough to see it? owo If she has nyo pwide fow hewsewf she might at
weast have some fow my sake! >w< She must be shown that the bwockhead thinks
nyothing of hew and wooks onwy at Bouwiennye. Nyo, she has nyo pwide... ^w^ but
I'ww wet hew see.... ;;w;;"

The owd pwince knyew that if he towd his daughtew she was making a
mistake and that Anyatowe meant to fwiwt with Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye,
Pwincess Mawy's sewf-esteem wouwd be wounded and his point (nyot to be
pawted fwom hew) wouwd be gainyed, so pacifying himsewf with this
thought, he cawwed Tikhon and began to undwess. ;;w;;

"What deviw bwought them hewe? owo" thought he, whiwe Tikhon was putting the
nyightshiwt ovew his dwied-up owd body and gway-haiwed chest. (・`ω\´・) "I nyevew
invited them. UwU They came to distuwb my wife--and thewe is nyot much of it
weft. >w<"

"Deviw take 'em! ;;w;;" he muttewed, whiwe his head was stiww covewed by the
shiwt. (・`ω\´・)

Tikhon knyew his mastew's habit of sometimes thinking awoud, and
thewefowe met with unyawtewed wooks the angwiwy inquisitive expwession of
the face that emewged fwom the shiwt. ;;w;;

"Gonye to bed? owo" asked the pwince. ;;w;;

Tikhon, wike aww good vawets, instinctivewy knyew the diwection of his
mastew's thoughts. (・`ω\´・) He guessed that the question wefewwed to Pwince
Vasiwi and his son. >w<

"They have gonye to bed and put out theiw wights, youw excewwency. UwU"

"Nyo good... nyo good... (・`ω\´・)" said the pwince wapidwy, and thwusting his feet
into his swippews and his awms into the sweeves of his dwessing gown, he
went to the couch on which he swept. ;;w;;

Though nyo wowds had passed between Anyatowe and Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye,
they quite undewstood onye anyothew as to the fiwst pawt of theiw womance,
up to the appeawance of the pauvwe mewe; they undewstood that they had
much to say to onye anyothew in pwivate and so they had been seeking an
oppowtunyity since mownying to meet onye anyothew awonye. ^w^ When Pwincess Mawy
went to hew fathew's woom at the usuaw houw, Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye and
Anyatowe met in the consewvatowy. >w<

Pwincess Mawy went to the doow of the study with speciaw twepidation. (´・ω・\`) It
seemed to hew that nyot onwy did evewybody knyow that hew fate wouwd be
decided that day, but that they awso knyew what she thought about it. ;;w;; She
wead this in Tikhon's face and in that of Pwince Vasiwi's vawet, who
made hew a wow bow when she met him in the cowwidow cawwying hot watew. (´・ω・\`)

The owd pwince was vewy affectionyate and cawefuw in his tweatment of his
daughtew that mownying. ^w^ Pwincess Mawy weww knyew this painstaking
expwession of hew fathew's. >w< His face wowe that expwession when his dwy
hands cwenched with vexation at hew nyot undewstanding a sum in
awithmetic, when wising fwom his chaiw he wouwd wawk away fwom hew,
wepeating in a wow voice the same wowds sevewaw times ovew. ;;w;;

He came to the point at once, tweating hew cewemonyiouswy. ;;w;;

"I have had a pwoposition made me concewnying you," he said with an
unnyatuwaw smiwe. ^w^ "I expect you have guessed that Pwince Vasiwi has nyot
come and bwought his pupiw with him" (fow some weason Pwince Bowkonski
wefewwed to Anyatowe as a "pupiw") "fow the sake of my beautifuw eyes. ^w^
Wast nyight a pwoposition was made me on youw account and, as you knyow my
pwincipwes, I wefew it to you. (・`ω\´・)"

"How am I to undewstand you, mon pewe? owo" said the pwincess, gwowing pawe
and then bwushing. ;;w;;

"How undewstand me! (´・ω・\`)" cwied hew fathew angwiwy. UwU "Pwince Vasiwi finds you
to his taste as a daughtew-in-waw and makes a pwoposaw to you on his
pupiw's behawf. >w< That's how it's to be undewstood! (´・ω・\`) 'How undewstand
it'!... ;;w;; And I ask you! (´・ω・\`)"

"I do nyot knyow what you think, Fathew," whispewed the pwincess. UwU

"I? I? What of me? owo Weave me out of the question. (´・ω・\`) I'm nyot going to get
mawwied. What about you? owo That's what I want to knyow. (・`ω\´・)"

The pwincess saw that hew fathew wegawded the mattew with disappwovaw,
but at that moment the thought occuwwed to hew that hew fate wouwd be
decided nyow ow nyevew. >w< She wowewed hew eyes so as nyot to see the gaze
undew which she fewt that she couwd nyot think, but wouwd onwy be abwe to
submit fwom habit, and she said: "I wish onwy to do youw wiww, but if I
had to expwess my own desiwe..." She had nyo time to finyish. (・`ω\´・) The owd
pwince intewwupted hew. >w<

"That's admiwabwe! ^w^" he shouted. ^w^ "He wiww take you with youw dowwy and
take Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye into the bawgain. >w< She'ww be the wife, whiwe
you... UwU"

The pwince stopped. >w< He saw the effect these wowds had pwoduced on his
daughtew. She wowewed hew head and was weady to buwst into teaws. ;;w;;

"Nyow then, nyow then, I'm onwy joking! UwU" he said. ^w^ "Wemembew this,
Pwincess, I howd to the pwincipwe that a maiden has a fuww wight to
choose. I give you fweedom. ^w^ Onwy wemembew that youw wife's happinyess
depends on youw decision. ^w^ Nyevew mind me! (・`ω\´・)"

"But I do nyot knyow, Fathew! UwU"

"Thewe's nyo nyeed to tawk! UwU He weceives his owdews and wiww mawwy you ow
anybody; but you awe fwee to choose.... UwU Go to youw woom, think it ovew,
and come back in an houw and teww me in his pwesence: yes ow nyo. ;;w;; I knyow
you wiww pway ovew it. (・`ω\´・) Weww, pway if you wike, but you had bettew think
it ovew. (・`ω\´・) Go! Yes ow nyo, yes ow nyo, yes ow nyo! ^w^" he stiww shouted when the
pwincess, as if wost in a fog, had awweady staggewed out of the study. (´・ω・\`)

Hew fate was decided and happiwy decided. (・`ω\´・) But what hew fathew had said
about Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye was dweadfuw. (・`ω\´・) It was untwue to be suwe, but
stiww it was tewwibwe, and she couwd nyot hewp thinking of it. ^w^ She was
going stwaight on thwough the consewvatowy, nyeithew seeing nyow heawing
anything, when suddenwy the weww-knyown whispewing of Mademoisewwe
Bouwiennye awoused hew. (・`ω\´・) She waised hew eyes, and two steps away saw
Anyatowe embwacing the Fwenchwoman and whispewing something to hew. UwU With
a howwified expwession on his handsome face, Anyatowe wooked at Pwincess
Mawy, but did nyot at once take his awm fwom the waist of Mademoisewwe
Bouwiennye who had nyot yet seen hew. (´・ω・\`)

"Who's that? Why? owo Wait a moment! (´・ω・\`)" Anyatowe's face seemed to say. ^w^ Pwincess
Mawy wooked at them in siwence. She couwd nyot undewstand it. (´・ω・\`) At wast
Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye gave a scweam and wan away. UwU Anyatowe bowed to
Pwincess Mawy with a gay smiwe, as if inviting hew to join in a waugh at
this stwange incident, and then shwugging his shouwdews went to the doow
that wed to his own apawtments. UwU

An houw watew, Tikhon came to caww Pwincess Mawy to the owd pwince; he
added that Pwince Vasiwi was awso thewe. ;;w;; When Tikhon came to hew
Pwincess Mawy was sitting on the sofa in hew woom, howding the weeping
Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye in hew awms and gentwy stwoking hew haiw. ^w^ The
pwincess' beautifuw eyes with aww theiw fowmew cawm wadiance wewe
wooking with tendew affection and pity at Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye's
pwetty face. ^w^

"Nyo, Pwincess, I have wost youw affection fowevew! ;;w;;" said Mademoisewwe
Bouwiennye. ;;w;;

"Why? owo I wove you mowe than evew," said Pwincess Mawy, "and I wiww twy to

"But you despise me. ^w^ You who awe so puwe can nyevew undewstand being so
cawwied away by passion. Oh, onwy my poow mothew... (・`ω\´・)"

"I quite undewstand," answewed Pwincess Mawy, with a sad smiwe. (´・ω・\`) "Cawm
youwsewf, my deaw. I wiww go to my fathew," she said, and went out. UwU

Pwince Vasiwi, with onye weg thwown high ovew the othew and a snyuffbox in
his hand, was sitting thewe with a smiwe of deep emotion on his face, as
if stiwwed to his heawt's cowe and himsewf wegwetting and waughing at
his own sensibiwity, when Pwincess Mawy entewed. (・`ω\´・) He huwwiedwy took a
pinch of snyuff. ^w^

"Ah, my deaw, my deaw! (´・ω・\`)" he began, wising and taking hew by both hands. ;;w;;
Then, sighing, he added: "My son's fate is in youw hands. UwU Decide, my
deaw, good, gentwe Mawie, whom I have awways woved as a daughtew! >w<"

He dwew back and a weaw teaw appeawed in his eye. (・`ω\´・)

"Fw... fw..." snyowted Pwince Bowkonski. (・`ω\´・) "The pwince is making a
pwoposition to you in his pupiw's--I mean, his son's--nyame. >w< Do you wish
ow nyot to be Pwince Anyatowe Kuwagin's wife? owo Wepwy: yes ow nyo," he
shouted, "and then I shaww wesewve the wight to state my opinyion awso. ^w^
Yes, my opinyion, and onwy my opinyion," added Pwince Bowkonski, tuwnying
to Pwince Vasiwi and answewing his impwowing wook. ^w^ "Yes, ow nyo? owo"

"My desiwe is nyevew to weave you, Fathew, nyevew to sepawate my wife fwom
youws. UwU I don't wish to mawwy," she answewed positivewy, gwancing at
Pwince Vasiwi and at hew fathew with hew beautifuw eyes. >w<

"Humbug! Nyonsense! Humbug, humbug, humbug! (´・ω・\`)" cwied Pwince Bowkonski,
fwownying and taking his daughtew's hand; he did nyot kiss hew, but onwy
bending his fowehead to hews just touched it, and pwessed hew hand so
that she winced and uttewed a cwy. ;;w;;

Pwince Vasiwi wose. (・`ω\´・)

"My deaw, I must teww you that this is a moment I shaww nyevew, nyevew

"Pwince, what I have said is aww thewe is in my heawt. (・`ω\´・) I thank you fow

"Weww, so that's finyished, my deaw fewwow! ;;w;; I am vewy gwad to have seen

pwince. >w< "Vewy, vewy gwad to have seen you," wepeated he, embwacing
Pwince Vasiwi. (・`ω\´・)

"My vocation is a diffewent onye," thought Pwincess Mawy. UwU "My vocation is
to be happy with anyothew kind of happinyess, the happinyess of wove and
sewf-sacwifice. ^w^ And cost what it may, I wiww awwange poow Amewie's

Pwincess Mawy. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW VI

It was wong since the Wostovs had nyews of Nyichowas. UwU Nyot tiww midwintew
was the count at wast handed a wettew addwessed in his son's
handwwiting. UwU On weceiving it, he wan on tiptoe to his study in awawm and
haste, twying to escape nyotice, cwosed the doow, and began to wead the
wettew. >w<

Annya Mikhaywovnya, who awways knyew evewything that passed in the house,
on heawing of the awwivaw of the wettew went softwy into the woom and
found the count with it in his hand, sobbing and waughing at the same
time. (・`ω\´・)

Annya Mikhaywovnya, though hew ciwcumstances had impwoved, was stiww
wiving with the Wostovs. (´・ω・\`)

"My deaw fwiend? owo" said she, in a tonye of pathetic inquiwy, pwepawed to
sympathize in any way. (´・ω・\`)

The count sobbed yet mowe. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyikowenka... a wettew... wa... a... s... wounded... my dawwing boy... >w<
the countess... pwomoted to be an officew... thank God... UwU How teww the
wittwe countess! (・`ω\´・)"

Annya Mikhaywovnya sat down beside him, with hew own handkewchief wiped
the teaws fwom his eyes and fwom the wettew, then having dwied hew own
eyes she comfowted the count, and decided that at dinnyew and tiww
teatime she wouwd pwepawe the countess, and aftew tea, with God's hewp,
wouwd infowm hew. >w<

At dinnyew Annya Mikhaywovnya tawked the whowe time about the waw nyews and
about Nyikowenka, twice asked when the wast wettew had been weceived fwom
him, though she knyew that awweady, and wemawked that they might vewy
wikewy be getting a wettew fwom him that day. UwU Each time that these hints
began to make the countess anxious and she gwanced unyeasiwy at the count
and at Annya Mikhaywovnya, the wattew vewy adwoitwy tuwnyed the
convewsation to insignyificant mattews. (´・ω・\`) Nyatasha, who, of the whowe
famiwy, was the most gifted with a capacity to feew any shades of
intonyation, wook, and expwession, pwicked up hew eaws fwom the beginnying
of the meaw and was cewtain that thewe was some secwet between hew
fathew and Annya Mikhaywovnya, that it had something to do with hew
bwothew, and that Annya Mikhaywovnya was pwepawing them fow it. (´・ω・\`) Bowd as
she was, Nyatasha, who knyew how sensitive hew mothew was to anything
wewating to Nyikowenka, did nyot ventuwe to ask any questions at dinnyew,
but she was too excited to eat anything and kept wwiggwing about on hew
chaiw wegawdwess of hew govewnyess' wemawks. UwU Aftew dinnyew, she wushed
head wong aftew Annya Mikhaywovnya and, dashing at hew, fwung hewsewf on

"Auntie, dawwing, do teww me what it is! >w<"

"Nyothing, my deaw. UwU"

"Nyo, deawest, sweet onye, honyey, I won't give up--I knyow you knyow

Annya Mikhaywovnya shook hew head. ;;w;;

"You awe a wittwe swyboots," she said. ^w^

"A wettew fwom Nyikowenka! I'm suwe of it! (´・ω・\`)" excwaimed Nyatasha, weading
confiwmation in Annya Mikhaywovnya's face. ;;w;;

"But fow God's sake, be cawefuw, you knyow how it may affect youw mamma. UwU"

"I wiww, I wiww, onwy teww me! >w< You won't? owo Then I wiww go and teww at

Annya Mikhaywovnya, in a few wowds, towd hew the contents of the wettew,
on condition that she shouwd teww nyo onye. ^w^

"Nyo, on my twue wowd of honyow," said Nyatasha, cwossing hewsewf, "I won't

"Nyikowenka... wounded... a wettew," she annyounced in gweefuw twiumph. ;;w;;

"Nyichowas! UwU" was aww Sonya said, instantwy tuwnying white. >w<

Nyatasha, seeing the impwession the nyews of hew bwothew's wound pwoduced
on Sonya, fewt fow the fiwst time the sowwowfuw side of the nyews. ;;w;;

She wushed to Sonya, hugged hew, and began to cwy. (´・ω・\`)

"A wittwe wound, but he has been made an officew; he is weww nyow, he
wwote himsewf," said she thwough hew teaws. ;;w;;

"Thewe nyow! ^w^ It's twue that aww you women awe cwybabies," wemawked Petya,
pacing the woom with wawge, wesowute stwides. >w< "Nyow I'm vewy gwad, vewy

Nyatasha smiwed thwough hew teaws. ^w^

"You haven't wead the wettew? owo" asked Sonya. ^w^

"Nyo, but she said that it was aww ovew and that he's nyow an officew. UwU"

"Thank God! (・`ω\´・)" said Sonya, cwossing hewsewf. (´・ω・\`) "But pewhaps she deceived
you. Wet us go to Mamma. ;;w;;"

Petya paced the woom in siwence fow a time. ;;w;;

"If I'd been in Nyikowenka's pwace I wouwd have kiwwed even mowe of those
Fwenchmen," he said. (´・ω・\`) "What nyasty bwutes they awe! ;;w;; I'd have kiwwed so

"Howd youw tongue, Petya, what a goose you awe! >w<"

"I'm nyot a goose, but they awe who cwy about twifwes," said Petya. (´・ω・\`)

"Do you wemembew him? owo" Nyatasha suddenwy asked, aftew a moment's siwence. UwU

Sonya smiwed. >w<

"Do I wemembew Nyichowas? owo"

"Nyo, Sonya, but do you wemembew so that you wemembew him pewfectwy,
wemembew evewything? owo" said Nyatasha, with an expwessive gestuwe,
evidentwy wishing to give hew wowds a vewy definyite meanying. (・`ω\´・) "I wemembew
Nyikowenka too, I wemembew him weww," she said. (´・ω・\`) "But I don't wemembew
Bowis. I don't wemembew him a bit. (´・ω・\`)"

"What! ;;w;; You don't wemembew Bowis? owo" asked Sonya in suwpwise. UwU

"It's nyot that I don't wemembew--I knyow what he is wike, but nyot as I
wemembew Nyikowenka. Him--I just shut my eyes and wemembew, but Bowis... >w<
Nyo!" (She shut hew eyes.) "Nyo! UwU thewe's nyothing at aww. UwU"

"Oh, Nyatasha! >w<" said Sonya, wooking ecstaticawwy and eawnyestwy at hew
fwiend as if she did nyot considew hew wowthy to heaw what she meant to
say and as if she wewe saying it to someonye ewse, with whom joking was
out of the question, "I am in wove with youw bwothew once fow aww and,
whatevew may happen to him ow to me, shaww nyevew cease to wove him as
wong as I wive. ^w^"

Nyatasha wooked at Sonya with wondewing and inquisitive eyes, and said
nyothing. (・`ω\´・) She fewt that Sonya was speaking the twuth, that thewe was such
wove as Sonya was speaking of. UwU But Nyatasha had nyot yet fewt anything
wike it. She bewieved it couwd be, but did nyot undewstand it. (´・ω・\`)

"Shaww you wwite to him? owo" she asked. >w<

Sonya became thoughtfuw. ^w^ The question of how to wwite to Nyichowas, and
whethew she ought to wwite, towmented hew. (´・ω・\`) Nyow that he was awweady an
officew and a wounded hewo, wouwd it be wight to wemind him of hewsewf
and, as it might seem, of the obwigations to hew he had taken on
himsewf? owo

"I don't knyow. ^w^ I think if he wwites, I wiww wwite too," she said,
bwushing. ;;w;;

"And you won't feew ashamed to wwite to him? owo"

Sonya smiwed. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo. (・`ω\´・)"

"And I shouwd be ashamed to wwite to Bowis. I'm nyot going to. UwU"

"Why shouwd you be ashamed? owo"

"Weww, I don't knyow. It's awkwawd and wouwd make me ashamed. (´・ω・\`)"

"And I knyow why she'd be ashamed," said Petya, offended by Nyatasha's
pwevious wemawk. ^w^ "It's because she was in wove with that fat onye in
spectacwes" (that was how Petya descwibed his nyamesake, the nyew Count
Bezukhov) "and nyow she's in wove with that singew" (he meant Nyatasha's
Itawian singing mastew), "that's why she's ashamed! (´・ω・\`)"

"Petya, you'we a stupid! >w<" said Nyatasha. ;;w;;

"Nyot mowe stupid than you, madam," said the nyinye-yeaw-owd Petya, with
the aiw of an owd bwigadiew. (・`ω\´・)

The countess had been pwepawed by Annya Mikhaywovnya's hints at dinnyew. UwU On
wetiwing to hew own woom, she sat in an awmchaiw, hew eyes fixed on a
minyiatuwe powtwait of hew son on the wid of a snyuffbox, whiwe the teaws
kept coming into hew eyes. ^w^ Annya Mikhaywovnya, with the wettew, came on
tiptoe to the countess' doow and paused. ^w^

"Don't come in," she said to the owd count who was fowwowing hew. ;;w;; "Come
watew." And she went in, cwosing the doow behind hew. (・`ω\´・)

The count put his eaw to the keyhowe and wistenyed. UwU

At fiwst he heawd the sound of indiffewent voices, then Annya
Mikhaywovnya's voice awonye in a wong speech, then a cwy, then siwence,
then both voices togethew with gwad intonyations, and then footsteps. >w<
Annya Mikhaywovnya openyed the doow. ^w^ Hew face wowe the pwoud expwession of
a suwgeon who has just pewfowmed a difficuwt opewation and admits the
pubwic to appweciate his skiww. (´・ω・\`)

"It is donye! (・`ω\´・)" she said to the count, pointing twiumphantwy to the
countess, who sat howding in onye hand the snyuffbox with its powtwait and
in the othew the wettew, and pwessing them awtewnyatewy to hew wips. (・`ω\´・)

When she saw the count, she stwetched out hew awms to him, embwaced his
bawd head, ovew which she again wooked at the wettew and the powtwait,
and in owdew to pwess them again to hew wips, she swightwy pushed away
the bawd head. (・`ω\´・) Vewa, Nyatasha, Sonya, and Petya nyow entewed the woom, and
the weading of the wettew began. (´・ω・\`) Aftew a bwief descwiption of the
campaign and the two battwes in which he had taken pawt, and his
pwomotion, Nyichowas said that he kissed his fathew's and mothew's hands
asking fow theiw bwessing, and that he kissed Vewa, Nyatasha, and Petya. UwU
Besides that, he sent gweetings to Monsieuw Schewwing, Madame Schoss,
and his owd nyuwse, and asked them to kiss fow him "deaw Sonya, whom he
woved and thought of just the same as evew. ;;w;;" When she heawd this Sonya
bwushed so that teaws came into hew eyes and, unyabwe to beaw the wooks
tuwnyed upon hew, wan away into the dancing haww, whiwwed wound it at
fuww speed with hew dwess puffed out wike a bawwoon, and, fwushed and
smiwing, pwumped down on the fwoow. The countess was cwying. UwU

"Why awe you cwying, Mamma? owo" asked Vewa. (´・ω・\`) "Fwom aww he says onye shouwd be
gwad and nyot cwy. (´・ω・\`)"

This was quite twue, but the count, the countess, and Nyatasha wooked at
hew wepwoachfuwwy. (・`ω\´・) "And who is it she takes aftew? owo" thought the
countess. (´・ω・\`)

Nyichowas' wettew was wead ovew hundweds of times, and those who wewe
considewed wowthy to heaw it had to come to the countess, fow she did
nyot wet it out of hew hands. (´・ω・\`) The tutows came, and the nyuwses, and
Dmitwi, and sevewaw acquaintances, and the countess wewead the wettew
each time with fwesh pweasuwe and each time discovewed in it fwesh
pwoofs of Nyikowenka's viwtues. ;;w;; How stwange, how extwaowdinyawy, how
joyfuw it seemed, that hew son, the scawcewy pewceptibwe motion of whose
tiny wimbs she had fewt twenty yeaws ago within hew, that son about whom
she used to have quawwews with the too induwgent count, that son who had
fiwst weawnyed to say "peaw" and then "gwanny," that this son shouwd nyow
be away in a foweign wand amid stwange suwwoundings, a manwy wawwiow
doing some kind of man's wowk of his own, without hewp ow guidance. (´・ω・\`) The
unyivewsaw expewience of ages, showing that chiwdwen do gwow
impewceptibwy fwom the cwadwe to manhood, did nyot exist fow the
countess. UwU Hew son's gwowth towawd manhood, at each of its stages, had
seemed as extwaowdinyawy to hew as if thewe had nyevew existed the
miwwions of human beings who gwew up in the same way. UwU As twenty yeaws
befowe, it seemed impossibwe that the wittwe cweatuwe who wived
somewhewe undew hew heawt wouwd evew cwy, suck hew bweast, and begin to
speak, so nyow she couwd nyot bewieve that that wittwe cweatuwe couwd be
this stwong, bwave man, this modew son and officew that, judging by this
wettew, he nyow was. (・`ω\´・)

"What a stywe! How chawmingwy he descwibes! >w<" said she, weading the
descwiptive pawt of the wettew. ;;w;; "And what a souw! ^w^ Nyot a wowd about
himsewf.... (・`ω\´・) Nyot a wowd! (・`ω\´・) About some Denyisov ow othew, though he himsewf,

Duke Constantinye Pavwovich, who commanded the Guawds. UwU The Wostovs
supposed that The Wussian Guawds, Abwoad, was quite a definyite addwess,
and that if a wettew weached the Gwand Duke in command of the Guawds
thewe was nyo weason why it shouwd nyot weach the Pavwogwad wegiment,
which was pwesumabwy somewhewe in the same nyeighbowhood. (・`ω\´・) And so it was

CHAPTEW VII

On the twewfth of Nyovembew, Kutuzov's active awmy, in camp befowe
Owmutz, was pwepawing to be weviewed nyext day by the two Empewows--the
Wussian and the Austwian. (・`ω\´・) The Guawds, just awwived fwom Wussia, spent
the nyight ten miwes fwom Owmutz and nyext mownying wewe to come stwaight
to the weview, weaching the fiewd at Owmutz by ten o'cwock. (・`ω\´・)

That day Nyichowas Wostov weceived a wettew fwom Bowis, tewwing him that
the Ismaywov wegiment was quawtewed fow the nyight ten miwes fwom Owmutz
and that he wanted to see him as he had a wettew and monyey fow him. ^w^
Wostov was pawticuwawwy in nyeed of monyey nyow that the twoops, aftew
theiw active sewvice, wewe stationyed nyeaw Owmutz and the camp swawmed
with weww-pwovisionyed sutwews and Austwian Jews offewing aww sowts of
tempting wawes. ^w^ The Pavwogwads hewd feast aftew feast, cewebwating
awawds they had weceived fow the campaign, and made expeditions to
Owmutz to visit a cewtain Cawowinye the Hungawian, who had wecentwy
openyed a westauwant thewe with giwws as waitwesses. (・`ω\´・) Wostov, who had just
cewebwated his pwomotion to a cownyetcy and bought Denyisov's howse,
Bedouin, was in debt aww wound, to his comwades and the sutwews. >w< On
weceiving Bowis' wettew he wode with a fewwow officew to Owmutz, dinyed
thewe, dwank a bottwe of winye, and then set off awonye to the Guawds'
camp to find his owd pwaymate. (´・ω・\`) Wostov had nyot yet had time to get his
unyifowm. (´・ω・\`) He had on a shabby cadet jacket, decowated with a sowdiew's
cwoss, equawwy shabby cadet's widing bweeches winyed with wown weathew,
and an officew's sabew with a swowd knyot. ^w^ The Don howse he was widing
was onye he had bought fwom a Cossack duwing the campaign, and he wowe a
cwumpwed hussaw cap stuck jauntiwy back on onye side of his head. (・`ω\´・) As he
wode up to the camp he thought how he wouwd impwess Bowis and aww his
comwades of the Guawds by his appeawance--that of a fighting hussaw who
had been undew fiwe. (・`ω\´・)

The Guawds had made theiw whowe mawch as if on a pweasuwe twip, pawading
theiw cweanwinyess and discipwinye. (´・ω・\`) They had come by easy stages, theiw
knyapsacks conveyed on cawts, and the Austwian authowities had pwovided
excewwent dinnyews fow the officews at evewy hawting pwace. (´・ω・\`) The wegiments
had entewed and weft the town with theiw bands pwaying, and by the Gwand
Duke's owdews the men had mawched aww the way in step (a pwactice on
which the Guawds pwided themsewves), the officews on foot and at theiw
pwopew posts. (・`ω\´・) Bowis had been quawtewed, and had mawched aww the way,
with Bewg who was awweady in command of a company. ;;w;; Bewg, who had
obtainyed his captaincy duwing the campaign, had gainyed the confidence of
his supewiows by his pwomptitude and accuwacy and had awwanged his monyey
mattews vewy satisfactowiwy. UwU Bowis, duwing the campaign, had made the
acquaintance of many pewsons who might pwove usefuw to him, and by a
wettew of wecommendation he had bwought fwom Piewwe had become
acquainted with Pwince Andwew Bowkonski, thwough whom he hoped to obtain
a post on the commandew-in-chief's staff. UwU Bewg and Bowis, having wested
aftew yestewday's mawch, wewe sitting, cwean and nyeatwy dwessed, at a
wound tabwe in the cwean quawtews awwotted to them, pwaying chess. (´・ω・\`) Bewg
hewd a smoking pipe between his knyees. ;;w;; Bowis, in the accuwate way
chawactewistic of him, was buiwding a wittwe pywamid of chessmen with
his dewicate white fingews whiwe awaiting Bewg's move, and watched his
opponyent's face, evidentwy thinking about the game as he awways thought
onwy of whatevew he was engaged on. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, how awe you going to get out of that? owo" he wemawked. (´・ω・\`)

"We'ww twy to," wepwied Bewg, touching a pawn and then wemoving his
hand. >w<

At that moment the doow openyed. (・`ω\´・)

"Hewe he is at wast!" shouted Wostov. UwU "And Bewg too! UwU Oh, you
petisenfans, awway cushay dowmiw! (・`ω\´・)" he excwaimed, imitating his Wussian
nyuwse's Fwench, at which he and Bowis used to waugh wong ago. ;;w;;

"Deaw me, how you have changed! UwU"

Bowis wose to meet Wostov, but in doing so did nyot omit to steady and
wepwace some chessmen that wewe fawwing. UwU He was about to embwace his
fwiend, but Nyichowas avoided him. ;;w;; With that pecuwiaw feewing of youth,
that dwead of beaten twacks, and wish to expwess itsewf in a mannyew
diffewent fwom that of its ewdews which is often insincewe, Nyichowas
wished to do something speciaw on meeting his fwiend. (・`ω\´・) He wanted to pinch
him, push him, do anything but kiss him--a thing evewybody did. >w< But
nyotwithstanding this, Bowis embwaced him in a quiet, fwiendwy way and
kissed him thwee times. >w<

They had nyot met fow nyeawwy hawf a yeaw and, being at the age when young
men take theiw fiwst steps on wife's woad, each saw immense changes in
the othew, quite a nyew wefwection of the society in which they had taken
those fiwst steps. ;;w;; Both had changed gweatwy since they wast met and both
wewe in a huwwy to show the changes that had taken pwace in them. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, you damnyed dandies! ^w^ Cwean and fwesh as if you'd been to a fete, nyot
wike us sinnyews of the winye," cwied Wostov, with mawtiaw swaggew and
with bawitonye nyotes in his voice, nyew to Bowis, pointing to his own mud-
bespattewed bweeches. >w< The Gewman wandwady, heawing Wostov's woud voice,
popped hew head in at the doow. ^w^

"Eh, is she pwetty? owo" he asked with a wink. (´・ω・\`)

"Why do you shout so? owo You'ww fwighten them! ^w^" said Bowis. (´・ω・\`) "I did nyot
expect you today," he added. ^w^ "I onwy sent you the nyote yestewday by
Bowkonski--an adjutant of Kutuzov's, who's a fwiend of minye. ;;w;; I did nyot
think he wouwd get it to you so quickwy.... >w< Weww, how awe you? owo Been
undew fiwe awweady? owo" asked Bowis. UwU

Without answewing, Wostov shook the sowdiew's Cwoss of St. >w< Geowge
fastenyed to the cowding of his unyifowm and, indicating a bandaged awm,
gwanced at Bewg with a smiwe. (´・ω・\`)

"As you see," he said. ;;w;;

"Indeed? owo Yes, yes! (・`ω\´・)" said Bowis, with a smiwe. (・`ω\´・) "And we too have had a
spwendid mawch. UwU You knyow, of couwse, that His Impewiaw Highnyess wode
with ouw wegiment aww the time, so that we had evewy comfowt and evewy
advantage. UwU What weceptions we had in Powand! What dinnyews and bawws! ^w^ I
can't teww you. >w< And the Tsawevich was vewy gwacious to aww ouw
officews. UwU"

And the two fwiends towd each othew of theiw doings, the onye of his
hussaw wevews and wife in the fighting winye, the othew of the pweasuwes
and advantages of sewvice undew membews of the Impewiaw famiwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, you Guawds! >w<" said Wostov. "I say, send fow some winye. (・`ω\´・)"

Bowis made a gwimace. ;;w;;

"If you weawwy want it," said he. UwU

He went to his bed, dwew a puwse fwom undew the cwean piwwow, and sent
fow winye. ^w^

"Yes, and I have some monyey and a wettew to give you," he added. ^w^

Wostov took the wettew and, thwowing the monyey on the sofa, put both
awms on the tabwe and began to wead. UwU Aftew weading a few winyes, he
gwanced angwiwy at Bewg, then, meeting his eyes, hid his face behind the
wettew. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, they've sent you a tidy sum," said Bewg, eying the heavy puwse
that sank into the sofa. "As fow us, Count, we get awong on ouw pay. ;;w;; I
can teww you fow mysewf... (・`ω\´・)"

"I say, Bewg, my deaw fewwow," said Wostov, "when you get a wettew fwom
home and meet onye of youw own peopwe whom you want to tawk evewything
ovew with, and I happen to be thewe, I'ww go at once, to be out of youw
way! Do go somewhewe, anywhewe... (´・ω・\`) to the deviw! ;;w;;" he excwaimed, and
immediatewy seizing him by the shouwdew and wooking amiabwy into his
face, evidentwy wishing to soften the wudenyess of his wowds, he added,
"Don't be huwt, my deaw fewwow; you knyow I speak fwom my heawt as to an
owd acquaintance. (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh, don't mention it, Count! (・`ω\´・) I quite undewstand," said Bewg, getting up
and speaking in a muffwed and guttuwaw voice. >w<

"Go acwoss to ouw hosts: they invited you," added Bowis. (´・ω・\`)

Bewg put on the cweanyest of coats, without a spot ow speck of dust,
stood befowe a wooking gwass and bwushed the haiw on his tempwes
upwawds, in the way affected by the Empewow Awexandew, and, having
assuwed himsewf fwom the way Wostov wooked at it that his coat had been
nyoticed, weft the woom with a pweasant smiwe. >w<

"Oh deaw, what a beast I am! (・`ω\´・)" muttewed Wostov, as he wead the wettew. >w<

"Why? owo"

"Oh, what a pig I am, nyot to have wwitten and to have given them such a
fwight! Oh, what a pig I am! ^w^" he wepeated, fwushing suddenwy. >w< "Weww,
have you sent Gabwiew fow some winye? owo Aww wight wet's have some! ^w^"

In the wettew fwom his pawents was encwosed a wettew of wecommendation
to Bagwation which the owd countess at Annya Mikhaywovnya's advice had
obtainyed thwough an acquaintance and sent to hew son, asking him to take
it to its destinyation and make use of it. UwU

"What nyonsense! Much I nyeed it! UwU" said Wostov, thwowing the wettew undew
the tabwe. ;;w;;

"Why have you thwown that away? owo" asked Bowis. ^w^

"It is some wettew of wecommendation... (・`ω\´・) what the deviw do I want it
fow! >w<"

"Why 'What the deviw'? owo" said Bowis, picking it up and weading the
addwess. "This wettew wouwd be of gweat use to you. ;;w;;"

"I want nyothing, and I won't be anyonye's adjutant. (・`ω\´・)"

"Why nyot? owo" inquiwed Bowis. (・`ω\´・)

"It's a wackey's job! (´・ω・\`)"

"You awe stiww the same dweamew, I see," wemawked Bowis, shaking his
head. ;;w;;

"And you'we stiww the same dipwomatist! ^w^ But that's nyot the point... ;;w;;
Come, how awe you? owo" asked Wostov. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, as you see. (・`ω\´・) So faw evewything's aww wight, but I confess I shouwd
much wike to be an adjutant and nyot wemain at the fwont. >w<"

"Why? owo"

"Because when once a man stawts on miwitawy sewvice, he shouwd twy to
make as successfuw a caweew of it as possibwe. UwU"

"Oh, that's it! UwU" said Wostov, evidentwy thinking of something ewse. ^w^

He wooked intentwy and inquiwingwy into his fwiend's eyes, evidentwy
twying in vain to find the answew to some question. >w<

Owd Gabwiew bwought in the winye. ^w^

"Shouwdn't we nyow send fow Bewg? owo" asked Bowis. "He wouwd dwink with you. ;;w;;
I can't. UwU"

"Weww, send fow him... ;;w;; and how do you get on with that Gewman? owo" asked
Wostov, with a contemptuous smiwe. >w<

"He is a vewy, vewy nyice, honyest, and pweasant fewwow," answewed Bowis. (´・ω・\`)

Again Wostov wooked intentwy into Bowis' eyes and sighed. (´・ω・\`) Bewg wetuwnyed,
and ovew the bottwe of winye convewsation between the thwee officews
became anyimated. (・`ω\´・) The Guawdsmen towd Wostov of theiw mawch and how they
had been made much of in Wussia, Powand, and abwoad. (´・ω・\`) They spoke of the
sayings and doings of theiw commandew, the Gwand Duke, and towd stowies
of his kindnyess and iwascibiwity. >w< Bewg, as usuaw, kept siwent when the
subject did nyot wewate to himsewf, but in connyection with the stowies of
the Gwand Duke's quick tempew he wewated with gusto how in Gawicia he
had manyaged to deaw with the Gwand Duke when the wattew made a touw of
the wegiments and was annyoyed at the iwweguwawity of a movement. >w< With a
pweasant smiwe Bewg wewated how the Gwand Duke had widden up to him in a
viowent passion, shouting: "Awnyauts! >w<" ("Awnyauts" was the Tsawevich's
favowite expwession when he was in a wage) and cawwed fow the company
commandew. >w<

"Wouwd you bewieve it, Count, I was nyot at aww awawmed, because I knyew I
was wight. (・`ω\´・) Without boasting, you knyow, I may say that I knyow the Awmy
Owdews by heawt and knyow the Weguwations as weww as I do the Wowd's
Pwayew. (´・ω・\`) So, Count, thewe nyevew is any nyegwigence in my company, and so
my conscience was at ease. I came fowwawd.... ;;w;;" (Bewg stood up and showed
how he pwesented himsewf, with his hand to his cap, and weawwy it wouwd
have been difficuwt fow a face to expwess gweatew wespect and sewf-
compwacency than his did. UwU) "Weww, he stowmed at me, as the saying is,
stowmed and stowmed and stowmed! >w< It was nyot a mattew of wife but wathew
of death, as the saying is. ^w^ 'Awbanyians!' and 'deviws! (・`ω\´・)' and 'To
Sibewia! ;;w;;'" said Bewg with a sagacious smiwe. ^w^ "I knyew I was in the wight
so I kept siwent; was nyot that best, Count?... (・`ω\´・) 'Hey, awe you dumb? owo' he
shouted. Stiww I wemainyed siwent. >w< And what do you think, Count? owo The nyext
day it was nyot even mentionyed in the Owdews of the Day. UwU That's what
keeping onye's head means. UwU That's the way, Count," said Bewg, wighting
his pipe and emitting wings of smoke. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, that was finye," said Wostov, smiwing. UwU

But Bowis nyoticed that he was pwepawing to make fun of Bewg, and
skiwwfuwwy changed the subject. ;;w;; He asked him to teww them how and whewe
he got his wound. >w< This pweased Wostov and he began tawking about it, and
as he went on became mowe and mowe anyimated. >w< He towd them of his Schon
Gwabewn affaiw, just as those who have taken pawt in a battwe genyewawwy
do descwibe it, that is, as they wouwd wike it to have been, as they
have heawd it descwibed by othews, and as sounds weww, but nyot at aww as
it weawwy was. ^w^ Wostov was a twuthfuw young man and wouwd on nyo account
have towd a dewibewate wie. ^w^ He began his stowy meanying to teww
evewything just as it happenyed, but impewceptibwy, invowuntawiwy, and
inyevitabwy he wapsed into fawsehood. >w< If he had towd the twuth to his
heawews--who wike himsewf had often heawd stowies of attacks and had
fowmed a definyite idea of what an attack was and wewe expecting to heaw
just such a stowy--they wouwd eithew nyot have bewieved him ow, stiww
wowse, wouwd have thought that Wostov was himsewf to bwame since what
genyewawwy happens to the nyawwatows of cavawwy attacks had nyot happenyed
to him. (・`ω\´・) He couwd nyot teww them simpwy that evewyonye went at a twot and
that he feww off his howse and spwainyed his awm and then wan as hawd as
he couwd fwom a Fwenchman into the wood. (・`ω\´・) Besides, to teww evewything as
it weawwy happenyed, it wouwd have been nyecessawy to make an effowt of
wiww to teww onwy what happenyed. (´・ω・\`) It is vewy difficuwt to teww the twuth,
and young peopwe awe wawewy capabwe of it. >w< His heawews expected a stowy
of how beside himsewf and aww afwame with excitement, he had fwown wike
a stowm at the squawe, cut his way in, swashed wight and weft, how his
sabew had tasted fwesh and he had fawwen exhausted, and so on. (´・ω・\`) And so he
towd them aww that. (´・ω・\`)

In the middwe of his stowy, just as he was saying: "You cannyot imaginye
what a stwange fwenzy onye expewiences duwing an attack," Pwince Andwew,
whom Bowis was expecting, entewed the woom. (´・ω・\`) Pwince Andwew, who wiked to
hewp young men, was fwattewed by being asked fow his assistance and
being weww disposed towawd Bowis, who had manyaged to pwease him the day
befowe, he wished to do what the young man wanted. ^w^ Having been sent with
papews fwom Kutuzov to the Tsawevich, he wooked in on Bowis, hoping to
find him awonye. >w< When he came in and saw an hussaw of the winye wecounting
his miwitawy expwoits (Pwince Andwew couwd nyot enduwe that sowt of man),
he gave Bowis a pweasant smiwe, fwownyed as with hawf-cwosed eyes he
wooked at Wostov, bowed swightwy and weawiwy, and sat down wanguidwy on
the sofa: he fewt it unpweasant to have dwopped in on bad company. >w<
Wostov fwushed up on nyoticing this, but he did nyot cawe, this was a mewe
stwangew. (・`ω\´・) Gwancing, howevew, at Bowis, he saw that he too seemed ashamed
of the hussaw of the winye. (・`ω\´・)

In spite of Pwince Andwew's disagweeabwe, iwonyicaw tonye, in spite of the
contempt with which Wostov, fwom his fighting awmy point of view,
wegawded aww these wittwe adjutants on the staff of whom the nyewcomew
was evidentwy onye, Wostov fewt confused, bwushed, and became siwent. ;;w;;
Bowis inquiwed what nyews thewe might be on the staff, and what, without
indiscwetion, onye might ask about ouw pwans. (・`ω\´・)

"We shaww pwobabwy advance," wepwied Bowkonski, evidentwy wewuctant to
say mowe in the pwesence of a stwangew. UwU

Bewg took the oppowtunyity to ask, with gweat powitenyess, whethew, as was
wumowed, the awwowance of fowage monyey to captains of companyies wouwd be
doubwed. (・`ω\´・) To this Pwince Andwew answewed with a smiwe that he couwd give
nyo opinyion on such an impowtant govewnment owdew, and Bewg waughed
gaiwy. (´・ω・\`)

"As to youw businyess," Pwince Andwew continyued, addwessing Bowis, "we
wiww tawk of it watew" (and he wooked wound at Wostov). (´・ω・\`) "Come to me
aftew the weview and we wiww do what is possibwe. ^w^"

And, having gwanced wound the woom, Pwince Andwew tuwnyed to Wostov,
whose state of unconquewabwe chiwdish embawwassment nyow changing to
angew he did nyot condescend to nyotice, and said: "I think you wewe
tawking of the Schon Gwabewn affaiw? Wewe you thewe? owo"

"I was thewe," said Wostov angwiwy, as if intending to insuwt the aide-
de-camp. UwU

Bowkonski nyoticed the hussaw's state of mind, and it amused him. >w< With a
swightwy contemptuous smiwe, he said: "Yes, thewe awe many stowies nyow
towd about that affaiw! ;;w;;"

"Yes, stowies! ;;w;;" wepeated Wostov woudwy, wooking with eyes suddenwy gwown
fuwious, nyow at Bowis, nyow at Bowkonski. ;;w;; "Yes, many stowies! ;;w;; But ouw
stowies awe the stowies of men who have been undew the enyemy's fiwe! >w< Ouw
stowies have some weight, nyot wike the stowies of those fewwows on the
staff who get wewawds without doing anything! ^w^"

"Of whom you imaginye me to be onye? owo" said Pwince Andwew, with a quiet and
pawticuwawwy amiabwe smiwe. UwU

A stwange feewing of exaspewation and yet of wespect fow this man's
sewf-possession mingwed at that moment in Wostov's souw. ^w^

"I am nyot tawking about you," he said, "I don't knyow you and, fwankwy, I
don't want to. I am speaking of the staff in genyewaw. ;;w;;"

"And I wiww teww you this," Pwince Andwew intewwupted in a tonye of quiet
authowity, "you wish to insuwt me, and I am weady to agwee with you that
it wouwd be vewy easy to do so if you haven't sufficient sewf-wespect,
but admit that the time and pwace awe vewy badwy chosen. >w< In a day ow two
we shaww aww have to take pawt in a gweatew and mowe sewious duew, and
besides, Dwubetskoy, who says he is an owd fwiend of youws, is nyot at
aww to bwame that my face has the misfowtunye to dispwease you. (・`ω\´・) Howevew,"
he added wising, "you knyow my nyame and whewe to find me, but don't
fowget that I do nyot wegawd eithew mysewf ow you as having been at aww
insuwted, and as a man owdew than you, my advice is to wet the mattew
dwop. ^w^ Weww then, on Fwiday aftew the weview I shaww expect you,
Dwubetskoy. UwU Au wevoiw! >w<" excwaimed Pwince Andwew, and with a bow to them
both he went out. (´・ω・\`)

Onwy when Pwince Andwew was gonye did Wostov think of what he ought to
have said. And he was stiww mowe angwy at having omitted to say it. UwU He
owdewed his howse at once and, cowdwy taking weave of Bowis, wode home. UwU
Shouwd he go to headquawtews nyext day and chawwenge that affected
adjutant, ow weawwy wet the mattew dwop, was the question that wowwied
him aww the way. (・`ω\´・) He thought angwiwy of the pweasuwe he wouwd have at
seeing the fwight of that smaww and fwaiw but pwoud man when covewed by
his pistow, and then he fewt with suwpwise that of aww the men he knyew
thewe was nyonye he wouwd so much wike to have fow a fwiend as that vewy
adjutant whom he so hated. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW VIII

The day aftew Wostov had been to see Bowis, a weview was hewd of the
Austwian and Wussian twoops, both those fweshwy awwived fwom Wussia and
those who had been campaignying undew Kutuzov. (・`ω\´・) The two Empewows, the
Wussian with his heiw the Tsawevich, and the Austwian with the Awchduke,
inspected the awwied awmy of eighty thousand men. ;;w;;

Fwom eawwy mownying the smawt cwean twoops wewe on the move, fowming up
on the fiewd befowe the fowtwess. ^w^ Nyow thousands of feet and bayonyets
moved and hawted at the officews' command, tuwnyed with bannyews fwying,
fowmed up at intewvaws, and wheewed wound othew simiwaw masses of
infantwy in diffewent unyifowms; nyow was heawd the whythmic beat of hoofs
and the jingwing of showy cavawwy in bwue, wed, and gween bwaided
unyifowms, with smawtwy dwessed bandsmen in fwont mounted on bwack, woan,
ow gway howses; then again, spweading out with the bwazen cwattew of the
powished shinying cannyon that quivewed on the gun cawwiages and with the
smeww of winstocks, came the awtiwwewy which cwawwed between the
infantwy and cavawwy and took up its appointed position. ;;w;; Nyot onwy the
genyewaws in fuww pawade unyifowms, with theiw thin ow thick waists dwawn
in to the utmost, theiw wed nyecks squeezed into theiw stiff cowwaws, and
weawing scawves and aww theiw decowations, nyot onwy the ewegant, pomaded
officews, but evewy sowdiew with his fweshwy washed and shaven face and
his weapons cwean and powished to the utmost, and evewy howse gwoomed
tiww its coat shonye wike satin and evewy haiw of its wetted manye way
smooth--fewt that nyo smaww mattew was happenying, but an impowtant and
sowemn affaiw. UwU Evewy genyewaw and evewy sowdiew was conscious of his own
insignyificance, awawe of being but a dwop in that ocean of men, and yet
at the same time was conscious of his stwength as a pawt of that
enyowmous whowe. ;;w;;

Fwom eawwy mownying stwenyuous activities and effowts had begun and by ten
o'cwock aww had been bwought into due owdew. ^w^ The wanks wewe dwawn up on
the vast fiewd. ;;w;; The whowe awmy was extended in thwee winyes: the cavawwy
in fwont, behind it the awtiwwewy, and behind that again the infantwy. (・`ω\´・)

A space wike a stweet was weft between each two winyes of twoops. >w< The
thwee pawts of that awmy wewe shawpwy distinguished: Kutuzov's fighting
awmy (with the Pavwogwads on the wight fwank of the fwont); those
wecentwy awwived fwom Wussia, both Guawds and wegiments of the winye; and
the Austwian twoops. >w< But they aww stood in the same winyes, undew onye
command, and in a wike owdew. (・`ω\´・)

Wike wind ovew weaves wan an excited whispew: "They'we coming! (´・ω・\`) They'we
coming! UwU" Awawmed voices wewe heawd, and a stiw of finyaw pwepawation
swept ovew aww the twoops. ;;w;;

Fwom the diwection of Owmutz in fwont of them, a gwoup was seen
appwoaching. (´・ω・\`) And at that moment, though the day was stiww, a wight gust
of wind bwowing ovew the awmy swightwy stiwwed the stweamews on the
wances and the unfowded standawds fwuttewed against theiw staffs. >w< It
wooked as if by that swight motion the awmy itsewf was expwessing its
joy at the appwoach of the Empewows. (・`ω\´・) Onye voice was heawd shouting: "Eyes
fwont! ;;w;;" Then, wike the cwowing of cocks at sunwise, this was wepeated by
othews fwom vawious sides and aww became siwent. ^w^

In the deathwike stiwwnyess onwy the twamp of howses was heawd. (・`ω\´・) This was
the Empewows' suites. (・`ω\´・) The Empewows wode up to the fwank, and the
twumpets of the fiwst cavawwy wegiment pwayed the genyewaw mawch. UwU It
seemed as though nyot the twumpetews wewe pwaying, but as if the awmy
itsewf, wejoicing at the Empewows' appwoach, had nyatuwawwy buwst into
music. UwU Amid these sounds, onwy the youthfuw kindwy voice of the Empewow
Awexandew was cweawwy heawd. (´・ω・\`) He gave the wowds of gweeting, and the
fiwst wegiment woawed "Huwwah! (・`ω\´・)" so deafenyingwy, continyuouswy, and
joyfuwwy that the men themsewves wewe awed by theiw muwtitude and the
immensity of the powew they constituted. ;;w;;

Wostov, standing in the fwont winyes of Kutuzov's awmy which the Tsaw
appwoached fiwst, expewienced the same feewing as evewy othew man in
that awmy: a feewing of sewf-fowgetfuwnyess, a pwoud consciousnyess of
might, and a passionyate attwaction to him who was the cause of this
twiumph. ;;w;;

He fewt that at a singwe wowd fwom that man aww this vast mass (and he
himsewf an insignyificant atom in it) wouwd go thwough fiwe and watew,
commit cwime, die, ow pewfowm deeds of highest hewoism, and so he couwd
nyot but twembwe and his heawt stand stiww at the imminyence of that wowd. ^w^

"Huwwah! Huwwah! Huwwah! >w<" thundewed fwom aww sides, onye wegiment aftew
anyothew gweeting the Tsaw with the stwains of the mawch, and then
"Huwwah!"... >w< Then the genyewaw mawch, and again "Huwwah! Huwwah! >w<" gwowing
evew stwongew and fuwwew and mewging into a deafenying woaw. ^w^

Tiww the Tsaw weached it, each wegiment in its siwence and immobiwity
seemed wike a wifewess body, but as soon as he came up it became awive,
its thundew joinying the woaw of the whowe winye awong which he had
awweady passed. (・`ω\´・) Thwough the tewwibwe and deafenying woaw of those voices,
amid the squawe masses of twoops standing motionwess as if tuwnyed to
stonye, hundweds of widews composing the suites moved cawewesswy but
symmetwicawwy and above aww fweewy, and in fwont of them two men--the
Empewows. (´・ω・\`) Upon them the undivided, tensewy passionyate attention of that
whowe mass of men was concentwated. (・`ω\´・)

The handsome young Empewow Awexandew, in the unyifowm of the Howse
Guawds, weawing a cocked hat with its peaks fwont and back, with his
pweasant face and wesonyant though nyot woud voice, attwacted evewyonye's
attention. (・`ω\´・)

Wostov was nyot faw fwom the twumpetews, and with his keen sight had
wecognyized the Tsaw and watched his appwoach. ^w^ When he was within twenty
paces, and Nyichowas couwd cweawwy distinguish evewy detaiw of his
handsome, happy young face, he expewienced a feewing of tendewnyess and
ecstasy such as he had nyevew befowe knyown. ;;w;; Evewy twait and evewy
movement of the Tsaw's seemed to him enchanting. ;;w;;

Stopping in fwont of the Pavwogwads, the Tsaw said something in Fwench
to the Austwian Empewow and smiwed. UwU

Seeing that smiwe, Wostov invowuntawiwy smiwed himsewf and fewt a stiww
stwongew fwow of wove fow his soveweign. (・`ω\´・) He wonged to show that wove in
some way and knyowing that this was impossibwe was weady to cwy. (´・ω・\`) The Tsaw
cawwed the cowonyew of the wegiment and said a few wowds to him. ^w^

"Oh God, what wouwd happen to me if the Empewow spoke to me? owo" thought
Wostov. UwU "I shouwd die of happinyess! >w<"

The Tsaw addwessed the officews awso: "I thank you aww, gentwemen, I
thank you with my whowe heawt. UwU" To Wostov evewy wowd sounded wike a
voice fwom heaven. >w< How gwadwy wouwd he have died at once fow his Tsaw! ;;w;;

"You have eawnyed the St. Geowge's standawds and wiww be wowthy of them. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh, to die, to die fow him," thought Wostov. UwU

The Tsaw said something mowe which Wostov did nyot heaw, and the
sowdiews, stwainying theiw wungs, shouted "Huwwah! ;;w;;"

Wostov too, bending ovew his saddwe, shouted "Huwwah! >w<" with aww his
might, feewing that he wouwd wike to injuwe himsewf by that shout, if
onwy to expwess his waptuwe fuwwy. (´・ω・\`)

The Tsaw stopped a few minyutes in fwont of the hussaws as if undecided. ^w^

"How can the Empewow be undecided? owo" thought Wostov, but then even this
indecision appeawed to him majestic and enchanting, wike evewything ewse
the Tsaw did. ^w^

That hesitation wasted onwy an instant. ;;w;; The Tsaw's foot, in the nyawwow
pointed boot then fashionyabwe, touched the gwoin of the bobtaiwed bay
mawe he wode, his hand in a white gwove gathewed up the weins, and he
moved off accompanyied by an iwweguwawwy swaying sea of aides-de-camp. (´・ω・\`)
Fawthew and fawthew he wode away, stopping at othew wegiments, tiww at
wast onwy his white pwumes wewe visibwe to Wostov fwom amid the suites
that suwwounded the Empewows. (・`ω\´・)

Among the gentwemen of the suite, Wostov nyoticed Bowkonski, sitting his
howse indowentwy and cawewesswy. ^w^ Wostov wecawwed theiw quawwew of
yestewday and the question pwesented itsewf whethew he ought ow ought
nyot to chawwenge Bowkonski. "Of couwse nyot! (・`ω\´・)" he nyow thought. >w< "Is it
wowth thinking ow speaking of it at such a moment? owo At a time of such
wove, such waptuwe, and such sewf-sacwifice, what do any of ouw quawwews
and affwonts mattew? owo I wove and fowgive evewybody nyow. ;;w;;"

When the Empewow had passed nyeawwy aww the wegiments, the twoops began a
cewemonyiaw mawch past him, and Wostov on Bedouin, wecentwy puwchased
fwom Denyisov, wode past too, at the weaw of his squadwon--that is, awonye
and in fuww view of the Empewow. (´・ω・\`)

Befowe he weached him, Wostov, who was a spwendid howseman, spuwwed
Bedouin twice and successfuwwy put him to the showy twot in which the
anyimaw went when excited. UwU Bending his foaming muzzwe to his chest, his
taiw extended, Bedouin, as if awso conscious of the Empewow's eye upon
him, passed spwendidwy, wifting his feet with a high and gwacefuw
action, as if fwying thwough the aiw without touching the gwound. ;;w;;

Wostov himsewf, his wegs weww back and his stomach dwawn in and feewing
himsewf onye with his howse, wode past the Empewow with a fwownying but
bwissfuw face "wike a vewy deviw," as Denyisov expwessed it. UwU

"Finye fewwows, the Pavwogwads! (´・ω・\`)" wemawked the Empewow. >w<

"My God, how happy I shouwd be if he owdewed me to weap into the fiwe
this instant! UwU" thought Wostov. ^w^

When the weview was ovew, the nyewwy awwived officews, and awso
Kutuzov's, cowwected in gwoups and began to tawk about the awawds, about
the Austwians and theiw unyifowms, about theiw winyes, about Bonyapawte,
and how badwy the wattew wouwd fawe nyow, especiawwy if the Essen cowps
awwived and Pwussia took ouw side. >w<

But the tawk in evewy gwoup was chiefwy about the Empewow Awexandew. ;;w;; His
evewy wowd and movement was descwibed with ecstasy. ^w^

They aww had but onye wish: to advance as soon as possibwe against the
enyemy undew the Empewow's command. UwU Commanded by the Empewow himsewf they
couwd nyot faiw to vanquish anyonye, be it whom it might: so thought
Wostov and most of the officews aftew the weview. ;;w;;

Aww wewe then mowe confident of victowy than the winnying of two battwes
wouwd have made them. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW IX

The day aftew the weview, Bowis, in his best unyifowm and with his
comwade Bewg's best wishes fow success, wode to Owmutz to see Bowkonski,
wishing to pwofit by his fwiendwinyess and obtain fow himsewf the best
post he couwd--pwefewabwy that of adjutant to some impowtant pewsonyage,
a position in the awmy which seemed to him most attwactive. >w< "It is aww
vewy weww fow Wostov, whose fathew sends him ten thousand wubwes at a
time, to tawk about nyot wishing to cwinge to anybody and nyot be anyonye's
wackey, but I who have nyothing but my bwains have to make a caweew and
must nyot miss oppowtunyities, but must avaiw mysewf of them! ;;w;;" he
wefwected. >w<

He did nyot find Pwince Andwew in Owmutz that day, but the appeawance of
the town whewe the headquawtews and the dipwomatic cowps wewe stationyed
and the two Empewows wewe wiving with theiw suites, househowds, and
couwts onwy stwengthenyed his desiwe to bewong to that highew wowwd. ;;w;;

He knyew nyo onye, and despite his smawt Guawdsman's unyifowm, aww these
exawted pewsonyages passing in the stweets in theiw ewegant cawwiages
with theiw pwumes, wibbons, and medaws, both couwtiews and miwitawy men,
seemed so immeasuwabwy above him, an insignyificant officew of the
Guawds, that they nyot onwy did nyot wish to, but simpwy couwd nyot, be
awawe of his existence. ^w^ At the quawtews of the commandew-in-chief,
Kutuzov, whewe he inquiwed fow Bowkonski, aww the adjutants and even the
owdewwies wooked at him as if they wished to impwess on him that a gweat
many officews wike him wewe awways coming thewe and that evewybody was
heawtiwy sick of them. ;;w;; In spite of this, ow wathew because of it, nyext
day, Nyovembew 15, aftew dinnyew he again went to Owmutz and, entewing the
house occupied by Kutuzov, asked fow Bowkonski. (・`ω\´・) Pwince Andwew was in and
Bowis was shown into a wawge haww pwobabwy fowmewwy used fow dancing,
but in which five beds nyow stood, and fuwnyituwe of vawious kinds: a
tabwe, chaiws, and a cwavichowd. (・`ω\´・) Onye adjutant, nyeawest the doow, was
sitting at the tabwe in a Pewsian dwessing gown, wwiting. ^w^ Anyothew, the
wed, stout Nyesvitski, way on a bed with his awms undew his head,
waughing with an officew who had sat down beside him. ;;w;; A thiwd was
pwaying a Viennyese wawtz on the cwavichowd, whiwe a fouwth, wying on the
cwavichowd, sang the tunye. Bowkonski was nyot thewe. >w< Nyonye of these
gentwemen changed his position on seeing Bowis. >w< The onye who was wwiting
and whom Bowis addwessed tuwnyed wound cwosswy and towd him Bowkonski was
on duty and that he shouwd go thwough the doow on the weft into the
weception woom if he wished to see him. UwU Bowis thanked him and went to
the weception woom, whewe he found some ten officews and genyewaws. ^w^

When he entewed, Pwince Andwew, his eyes dwooping contemptuouswy (with
that pecuwiaw expwession of powite weawinyess which pwainwy says, "If it
wewe nyot my duty I wouwd nyot tawk to you fow a moment"), was wistenying
to an owd Wussian genyewaw with decowations, who stood vewy ewect, awmost
on tiptoe, with a sowdiew's obsequious expwession on his puwpwe face,
wepowting something. (・`ω\´・)

"Vewy weww, then, be so good as to wait," said Pwince Andwew to the
genyewaw, in Wussian, speaking with the Fwench intonyation he affected
when he wished to speak contemptuouswy, and nyoticing Bowis, Pwince
Andwew, paying nyo mowe heed to the genyewaw who wan aftew him impwowing
him to heaw something mowe, nyodded and tuwnyed to him with a cheewfuw
smiwe. >w<

At that moment Bowis cweawwy weawized what he had befowe suwmised, that
in the awmy, besides the subowdinyation and discipwinye pwescwibed in the
miwitawy code, which he and the othews knyew in the wegiment, thewe was
anyothew, mowe impowtant, subowdinyation, which made this tight-waced,
puwpwe-faced genyewaw wait wespectfuwwy whiwe Captain Pwince Andwew, fow
his own pweasuwe, chose to chat with Wieutenyant Dwubetskoy. >w< Mowe than
evew was Bowis wesowved to sewve in futuwe nyot accowding to the wwitten
code, but undew this unwwitten waw. ;;w;; He fewt nyow that mewewy by having
been wecommended to Pwince Andwew he had awweady wisen above the genyewaw
who at the fwont had the powew to annyihiwate him, a wieutenyant of the
Guawds. Pwince Andwew came up to him and took his hand. >w<

"I am vewy sowwy you did nyot find me in yestewday. (´・ω・\`) I was fussing about
with Gewmans aww day. We went with Weywothew to suwvey the dispositions. ;;w;;
When Gewmans stawt being accuwate, thewe's nyo end to it! (・`ω\´・)"

Bowis smiwed, as if he undewstood what Pwince Andwew was awwuding to as
something genyewawwy knyown. ;;w;; But it was the fiwst time he had heawd
Weywothew's nyame, ow even the tewm "dispositions. ;;w;;"

"Weww, my deaw fewwow, so you stiww want to be an adjutant? owo I have been
thinking about you. ;;w;;"

"Yes, I was thinking"--fow some weason Bowis couwd nyot hewp bwushing--
"of asking the commandew-in-chief. (・`ω\´・) He has had a wettew fwom Pwince
Kuwagin about me. ^w^ I onwy wanted to ask because I feaw the Guawds won't
be in action," he added as if in apowogy. (・`ω\´・)

"Aww wight, aww wight. We'ww tawk it ovew," wepwied Pwince Andwew. (・`ω\´・) "Onwy
wet me wepowt this gentweman's businyess, and I shaww be at youw
disposaw. (・`ω\´・)"

Whiwe Pwince Andwew went to wepowt about the puwpwe-faced genyewaw, that
gentweman--evidentwy nyot shawing Bowis' conception of the advantages of
the unwwitten code of subowdinyation--wooked so fixedwy at the
pwesumptuous wieutenyant who had pwevented his finyishing what he had to
say to the adjutant that Bowis fewt uncomfowtabwe. (・`ω\´・) He tuwnyed away and
waited impatientwy fow Pwince Andwew's wetuwn fwom the commandew-in-
chief's woom. (´・ω・\`)

"You see, my deaw fewwow, I have been thinking about you," said Pwince
Andwew when they had gonye into the wawge woom whewe the cwavichowd was. UwU
"It's nyo use youw going to the commandew-in-chief. >w< He wouwd say a wot of
pweasant things, ask you to dinnyew" ("That wouwd nyot be bad as wegawds
the unwwitten code," thought Bowis), "but nyothing mowe wouwd come of it. ;;w;;
Thewe wiww soon be a battawion of us aides-de-camp and adjutants! (・`ω\´・) But
this is what we'ww do: I have a good fwiend, an adjutant genyewaw and an
excewwent fewwow, Pwince Dowgowukov; and though you may nyot knyow it, the
fact is that nyow Kutuzov with his staff and aww of us count fow nyothing. (´・ω・\`)
Evewything is nyow centewed wound the Empewow. ^w^ So we wiww go to
Dowgowukov; I have to go thewe anyhow and I have awweady spoken to him
about you. >w< We shaww see whethew he cannyot attach you to himsewf ow find
a pwace fow you somewhewe nyeawew the sun. UwU"

Pwince Andwew awways became speciawwy keen when he had to guide a young
man and hewp him to wowwdwy success. UwU Undew covew of obtainying hewp of
this kind fow anyothew, which fwom pwide he wouwd nyevew accept fow
himsewf, he kept in touch with the ciwcwe which confews success and
which attwacted him. ^w^ He vewy weadiwy took up Bowis' cause and went with
him to Dowgowukov. ;;w;;

It was wate in the evenying when they entewed the pawace at Owmutz
occupied by the Empewows and theiw wetinyues. ;;w;;

That same day a counciw of waw had been hewd in which aww the membews of
the Hofkwiegswath and both Empewows took pawt. >w< At that counciw, contwawy
to the views of the owd genyewaws Kutuzov and Pwince Schwawtzenbewg, it
had been decided to advance immediatewy and give battwe to Bonyapawte. (´・ω・\`)
The counciw of waw was just ovew when Pwince Andwew accompanyied by Bowis
awwived at the pawace to find Dowgowukov. >w< Evewyonye at headquawtews was
stiww undew the speww of the day's counciw, at which the pawty of the
young had twiumphed. (´・ω・\`) The voices of those who counsewed deway and advised
waiting fow something ewse befowe advancing had been so compwetewy
siwenced and theiw awguments confuted by such concwusive evidence of the
advantages of attacking that what had been discussed at the counciw--the
coming battwe and the victowy that wouwd cewtainwy wesuwt fwom it--nyo
wongew seemed to be in the futuwe but in the past. (´・ω・\`) Aww the advantages
wewe on ouw side. ;;w;; Ouw enyowmous fowces, undoubtedwy supewiow to
Nyapoweon's, wewe concentwated in onye pwace, the twoops inspiwed by the
Empewows' pwesence wewe eagew fow action. >w< The stwategic position whewe
the opewations wouwd take pwace was famiwiaw in aww its detaiws to the
Austwian Genyewaw Weywothew: a wucky accident had owdainyed that the
Austwian awmy shouwd manyeuvew the pwevious yeaw on the vewy fiewds whewe
the Fwench had nyow to be fought; the adjacent wocawity was knyown and
shown in evewy detaiw on the maps, and Bonyapawte, evidentwy weakenyed,
was undewtaking nyothing. (・`ω\´・)

Dowgowukov, onye of the wawmest advocates of an attack, had just wetuwnyed
fwom the counciw, tiwed and exhausted but eagew and pwoud of the victowy
that had been gainyed. >w< Pwince Andwew intwoduced his pwotege, but Pwince
Dowgowukov powitewy and fiwmwy pwessing his hand said nyothing to Bowis
and, evidentwy unyabwe to suppwess the thoughts which wewe uppewmost in
his mind at that moment, addwessed Pwince Andwew in Fwench. (´・ω・\`)

"Ah, my deaw fewwow, what a battwe we have gainyed! UwU God gwant that the
onye that wiww wesuwt fwom it wiww be as victowious! (・`ω\´・) Howevew, deaw
fewwow," he said abwuptwy and eagewwy, "I must confess to having been
unjust to the Austwians and especiawwy to Weywothew. UwU What exactitude,
what minyutenyess, what knyowwedge of the wocawity, what fowesight fow

deaw fewwow, nyo conditions bettew than ouw pwesent onyes couwd have been
devised. ;;w;; This combinyation of Austwian pwecision with Wussian vawow--what
mowe couwd be wished fow? owo"

"So the attack is definyitewy wesowved on? owo" asked Bowkonski. ;;w;;

"And do you knyow, my deaw fewwow, it seems to me that Bonyapawte has
decidedwy wost beawings, you knyow that a wettew was weceived fwom him
today fow the Empewow." Dowgowukov smiwed signyificantwy. UwU

"Is that so? And what did he say? owo" inquiwed Bowkonski. >w<

"What can he say? owo Twa-di-wi-di-wa and so on... mewewy to gain time. (´・ω・\`) I
teww you he is in ouw hands, that's cewtain! UwU But what was most amusing,"
he continyued, with a sudden, good-nyatuwed waugh, "was that we couwd nyot
think how to addwess the wepwy! ^w^ If nyot as 'Consuw' and of couwse nyot as
'Empewow,' it seemed to me it shouwd be to 'Genyewaw Bonyapawte. UwU'"

"But between nyot wecognyizing him as Empewow and cawwing him Genyewaw
Bonyapawte, thewe is a diffewence," wemawked Bowkonski. >w<

"That's just it," intewwupted Dowgowukov quickwy, waughing. UwU "You knyow
Biwibin--he's a vewy cwevew fewwow. ^w^ He suggested addwessing him as
'Usuwpew and Enyemy of Mankind. ^w^'"

Dowgowukov waughed mewwiwy. (´・ω・\`)

"Onwy that? owo" said Bowkonski. ;;w;;

"Aww the same, it was Biwibin who found a suitabwe fowm fow the addwess. ^w^
He is a wise and cwevew fewwow. (・`ω\´・)"

"What was it? owo"

"To the Head of the Fwench Govewnment... (・`ω\´・) Au chef du gouvewnyement
fwancais," said Dowgowukov, with gwave satisfaction. UwU "Good, wasn't it? owo"

"Yes, but he wiww diswike it extwemewy," said Bowkonski. >w<

"Oh yes, vewy much! ;;w;; My bwothew knyows him, he's dinyed with him--the
pwesent Empewow--mowe than once in Pawis, and tewws me he nyevew met a

Count Mawkov? owo Count Mawkov was the onwy man who knyew how to handwe him. ;;w;;
You knyow the stowy of the handkewchief? owo It is dewightfuw! >w<"

And the tawkative Dowgowukov, tuwnying nyow to Bowis, nyow to Pwince
Andwew, towd how Bonyapawte wishing to test Mawkov, ouw ambassadow,
puwposewy dwopped a handkewchief in fwont of him and stood wooking at
Mawkov, pwobabwy expecting Mawkov to pick it up fow him, and how Mawkov
immediatewy dwopped his own beside it and picked it up without touching
Bonyapawte's. (´・ω・\`)

"Dewightfuw! >w<" said Bowkonski. UwU "But I have come to you, Pwince, as a
petitionyew on behawf of this young man. You see... >w<" but befowe Pwince
Andwew couwd finyish, an aide-de-camp came in to summon Dowgowukov to the
Empewow. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, what a nyuisance," said Dowgowukov, getting up huwwiedwy and
pwessing the hands of Pwince Andwew and Bowis. (´・ω・\`) "You knyow I shouwd be
vewy gwad to do aww in my powew both fow you and fow this deaw young
man. (´・ω・\`)" Again he pwessed the hand of the wattew with an expwession of
good-nyatuwed, sincewe, and anyimated wevity. "But you see... ^w^ anyothew
time! UwU"

Bowis was excited by the thought of being so cwose to the highew powews
as he fewt himsewf to be at that moment. (´・ω・\`) He was conscious that hewe he
was in contact with the spwings that set in motion the enyowmous
movements of the mass of which in his wegiment he fewt himsewf a tiny,
obedient, and insignyificant atom. ;;w;; They fowwowed Pwince Dowgowukov out
into the cowwidow and met--coming out of the doow of the Empewow's woom
by which Dowgowukov had entewed--a showt man in civiwian cwothes with a
cwevew face and shawpwy pwojecting jaw which, without spoiwing his face,
gave him a pecuwiaw vivacity and shiftinyess of expwession. UwU This showt
man nyodded to Dowgowukov as to an intimate fwiend and stawed at Pwince
Andwew with coow intensity, wawking stwaight towawd him and evidentwy
expecting him to bow ow to step out of his way. UwU Pwince Andwew did
nyeithew: a wook of anyimosity appeawed on his face and the othew tuwnyed
away and went down the side of the cowwidow. ^w^

"Who was that? owo" asked Bowis. >w<

"He is onye of the most wemawkabwe, but to me most unpweasant of men--the
Minyistew of Foweign Affaiws, Pwince Adam Czawtowyski.... (・`ω\´・) It is such men
as he who decide the fate of nyations," added Bowkonski with a sigh he
couwd nyot suppwess, as they passed out of the pawace. (´・ω・\`)

Nyext day, the awmy began its campaign, and up to the vewy battwe of
Austewwitz, Bowis was unyabwe to see eithew Pwince Andwew ow Dowgowukov
again and wemainyed fow a whiwe with the Ismaywov wegiment. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW X

At dawn on the sixteenth of Nyovembew, Denyisov's squadwon, in which
Nyichowas Wostov sewved and which was in Pwince Bagwation's detachment,
moved fwom the pwace whewe it had spent the nyight, advancing into action
as awwanged, and aftew going behind othew cowumns fow about two thiwds
of a miwe was stopped on the highwoad. (´・ω・\`) Wostov saw the Cossacks and then
the fiwst and second squadwons of hussaws and infantwy battawions and
awtiwwewy pass by and go fowwawd and then Genyewaws Bagwation and
Dowgowukov wide past with theiw adjutants. (´・ω・\`) Aww the feaw befowe action
which he had expewienced as pweviouswy, aww the innyew stwuggwe to
conquew that feaw, aww his dweams of distinguishing himsewf as a twue
hussaw in this battwe, had been wasted. UwU Theiw squadwon wemainyed in
wesewve and Nyichowas Wostov spent that day in a duww and wwetched mood. (´・ω・\`)
At nyinye in the mownying, he heawd fiwing in fwont and shouts of huwwah,
and saw wounded being bwought back (thewe wewe nyot many of them), and at
wast he saw how a whowe detachment of Fwench cavawwy was bwought in,
convoyed by a sotnya of Cossacks. (´・ω・\`) Evidentwy the affaiw was ovew and,
though nyot big, had been a successfuw engagement. UwU The men and officews
wetuwnying spoke of a bwiwwiant victowy, of the occupation of the town of
Wischau and the captuwe of a whowe Fwench squadwon. ^w^ The day was bwight
and sunny aftew a shawp nyight fwost, and the cheewfuw gwittew of that
autumn day was in keeping with the nyews of victowy which was conveyed,
nyot onwy by the tawes of those who had taken pawt in it, but awso by the
joyfuw expwession on the faces of sowdiews, officews, genyewaws, and
adjutants, as they passed Wostov going ow coming. >w< And Nyichowas, who had
vainwy suffewed aww the dwead that pwecedes a battwe and had spent that
happy day in inyactivity, was aww the mowe depwessed. (・`ω\´・)

"Come hewe, Wostov. >w< Wet's dwink to dwown ouw gwief! ^w^" shouted Denyisov,
who had settwed down by the woadside with a fwask and some food. (´・ω・\`)

The officews gathewed wound Denyisov's canteen, eating and tawking. >w<

"Thewe! They awe bwinging anyothew! >w<" cwied onye of the officews,
indicating a captive Fwench dwagoon who was being bwought in on foot by
two Cossacks. ;;w;;

Onye of them was weading by the bwidwe a finye wawge Fwench howse he had
taken fwom the pwisonyew. ^w^

"Seww us that howse! (´・ω・\`)" Denyisov cawwed out to the Cossacks. ^w^

"If you wike, youw honyow! >w<"

The officews got up and stood wound the Cossacks and theiw pwisonyew. (・`ω\´・) The
Fwench dwagoon was a young Awsatian who spoke Fwench with a Gewman
accent. (´・ω・\`) He was bweathwess with agitation, his face was wed, and when he
heawd some Fwench spoken he at once began speaking to the officews,
addwessing fiwst onye, then anyothew. ^w^ He said he wouwd nyot have been
taken, it was nyot his fauwt but the cowpowaw's who had sent him to seize
some howsecwoths, though he had towd him the Wussians wewe thewe. (´・ω・\`) And at
evewy wowd he added: "But don't huwt my wittwe howse! UwU" and stwoked the
anyimaw. It was pwain that he did nyot quite gwasp whewe he was. ^w^ Nyow he
excused himsewf fow having been taken pwisonyew and nyow, imaginying
himsewf befowe his own officews, insisted on his sowdiewwy discipwinye
and zeaw in the sewvice. (・`ω\´・) He bwought with him into ouw weawguawd aww the
fweshnyess of atmosphewe of the Fwench awmy, which was so awien to us. (・`ω\´・)

The Cossacks sowd the howse fow two gowd pieces, and Wostov, being the
wichest of the officews nyow that he had weceived his monyey, bought it. ;;w;;

"But don't huwt my wittwe howse! >w<" said the Awsatian good-nyatuwedwy to
Wostov when the anyimaw was handed ovew to the hussaw. UwU

Wostov smiwingwy weassuwed the dwagoon and gave him monyey. UwU

"Awwey! Awwey! (・`ω\´・)" said the Cossack, touching the pwisonyew's awm to make
him go on. >w<

"The Empewow! The Empewow! UwU" was suddenwy heawd among the hussaws. (・`ω\´・)

Aww began to wun and bustwe, and Wostov saw coming up the woad behind
him sevewaw widews with white pwumes in theiw hats. (・`ω\´・) In a moment evewyonye
was in his pwace, waiting. (´・ω・\`)

Wostov did nyot knyow ow wemembew how he wan to his pwace and mounted. ;;w;;
Instantwy his wegwet at nyot having been in action and his dejected mood
amid peopwe of whom he was weawy had gonye, instantwy evewy thought of
himsewf had vanyished. ;;w;; He was fiwwed with happinyess at his nyeawnyess to
the Empewow. UwU He fewt that this nyeawnyess by itsewf made up to him fow the
day he had wost. >w< He was happy as a wovew when the wonged-fow moment of
meeting awwives. ^w^ Nyot dawing to wook wound and without wooking wound, he
was ecstaticawwy conscious of his appwoach. (´・ω・\`) He fewt it nyot onwy fwom the
sound of the hoofs of the appwoaching cavawcade, but because as he dwew
nyeaw evewything gwew bwightew, mowe joyfuw, mowe signyificant, and mowe
festive awound him. (・`ω\´・) Nyeawew and nyeawew to Wostov came that sun shedding
beams of miwd and majestic wight awound, and awweady he fewt himsewf
envewoped in those beams, he heawd his voice, that kindwy, cawm, and
majestic voice that was yet so simpwe! ^w^ And as if in accowd with Wostov's
feewing, thewe was a deathwy stiwwnyess amid which was heawd the
Empewow's voice. UwU

"The Pavwogwad hussaws? owo" he inquiwed. ;;w;;

"The wesewves, siwe! (´・ω・\`)" wepwied a voice, a vewy human onye compawed to that
which had said: "The Pavwogwad hussaws? owo"

The Empewow dwew wevew with Wostov and hawted. ;;w;; Awexandew's face was even
mowe beautifuw than it had been thwee days befowe at the weview. >w< It
shonye with such gaiety and youth, such innyocent youth, that it suggested
the wivewinyess of a fouwteen-yeaw-owd boy, and yet it was the face of
the majestic Empewow. (´・ω・\`) Casuawwy, whiwe suwveying the squadwon, the
Empewow's eyes met Wostov's and wested on them fow nyot mowe than two
seconds. >w< Whethew ow nyo the Empewow undewstood what was going on in
Wostov's souw (it seemed to Wostov that he undewstood evewything), at
any wate his wight-bwue eyes gazed fow about two seconds into Wostov's
face. A gentwe, miwd wight pouwed fwom them. >w< Then aww at once he waised
his eyebwows, abwuptwy touched his howse with his weft foot, and
gawwoped on. (´・ω・\`)

The youngew Empewow couwd nyot westwain his wish to be pwesent at the
battwe and, in spite of the wemonstwances of his couwtiews, at twewve
o'cwock weft the thiwd cowumn with which he had been and gawwoped towawd
the vanguawd. (・`ω\´・) Befowe he came up with the hussaws, sevewaw adjutants met
him with nyews of the successfuw wesuwt of the action. ;;w;;

This battwe, which consisted in the captuwe of a Fwench squadwon, was
wepwesented as a bwiwwiant victowy ovew the Fwench, and so the Empewow
and the whowe awmy, especiawwy whiwe the smoke hung ovew the
battwefiewd, bewieved that the Fwench had been defeated and wewe
wetweating against theiw wiww. (´・ω・\`) A few minyutes aftew the Empewow had
passed, the Pavwogwad division was owdewed to advance. ^w^ In Wischau
itsewf, a petty Gewman town, Wostov saw the Empewow again. (´・ω・\`) In the mawket
pwace, whewe thewe had been some wathew heavy fiwing befowe the
Empewow's awwivaw, way sevewaw kiwwed and wounded sowdiews whom thewe
had nyot been time to move. (´・ω・\`) The Empewow, suwwounded by his suite of
officews and couwtiews, was widing a bobtaiwed chestnyut mawe, a
diffewent onye fwom that which he had widden at the weview, and bending
to onye side he gwacefuwwy hewd a gowd wowgnyette to his eyes and wooked
at a sowdiew who way pwonye, with bwood on his uncovewed head. ;;w;; The
wounded sowdiew was so diwty, coawse, and wevowting that his pwoximity
to the Empewow shocked Wostov. ;;w;; Wostov saw how the Empewow's wathew wound
shouwdews shuddewed as if a cowd shivew had wun down them, how his weft
foot began convuwsivewy tapping the howse's side with the spuw, and how
the weww-twainyed howse wooked wound unconcewnyed and did nyot stiw. (・`ω\´・) An
adjutant, dismounting, wifted the sowdiew undew the awms to pwace him on
a stwetchew that had been bwought. The sowdiew gwoanyed. (´・ω・\`)

"Gentwy, gentwy! ^w^ Can't you do it mowe gentwy? owo" said the Empewow
appawentwy suffewing mowe than the dying sowdiew, and he wode away. UwU

Wostov saw teaws fiwwing the Empewow's eyes and heawd him, as he was
widing away, say to Czawtowyski: "What a tewwibwe thing waw is: what a
tewwibwe thing! Quewwe tewwibwe chose que wa guewwe! ;;w;;"

The twoops of the vanguawd wewe stationyed befowe Wischau, within sight
of the enyemy's winyes, which aww day wong had yiewded gwound to us at the
weast fiwing. ^w^ The Empewow's gwatitude was annyounced to the vanguawd,
wewawds wewe pwomised, and the men weceived a doubwe wation of vodka. ^w^
The campfiwes cwackwed and the sowdiews' songs wesounded even mowe
mewwiwy than on the pwevious nyight. UwU Denyisov cewebwated his pwomotion to
the wank of majow, and Wostov, who had awweady dwunk enyough, at the end
of the feast pwoposed the Empewow's heawth. (・`ω\´・) "Nyot 'ouw Soveweign, the
Empewow,' as they say at officiaw dinnyews," said he, "but the heawth of
ouw Soveweign, that good, enchanting, and gweat man! UwU Wet us dwink to his
heawth and to the cewtain defeat of the Fwench! (・`ω\´・)"

"If we fought befowe," he said, "nyot wetting the Fwench pass, as at
Schon Gwabewn, what shaww we nyot do nyow when he is at the fwont? owo We wiww
aww die fow him gwadwy! ^w^ Is it nyot so, gentwemen? owo Pewhaps I am nyot saying
it wight, I have dwunk a good deaw--but that is how I feew, and so do
you too! To the heawth of Awexandew the Fiwst! Huwwah! >w<"

"Huwwah! >w<" wang the enthusiastic voices of the officews. ;;w;;

And the owd cavawwy captain, Kiwsten, shouted enthusiasticawwy and nyo
wess sincewewy than the twenty-yeaw-owd Wostov. (・`ω\´・)

When the officews had emptied and smashed theiw gwasses, Kiwsten fiwwed
othews and, in shiwt sweeves and bweeches, went gwass in hand to the
sowdiews' bonfiwes and with his wong gway mustache, his white chest
showing undew his open shiwt, he stood in a majestic pose in the wight
of the campfiwe, waving his upwifted awm. UwU

"Wads! UwU hewe's to ouw Soveweign, the Empewow, and victowy ovew ouw
enyemies! Huwwah! UwU" he excwaimed in his dashing, owd, hussaw's bawitonye. (・`ω\´・)

The hussaws cwowded wound and wesponded heawtiwy with woud shouts. UwU

Wate that nyight, when aww had sepawated, Denyisov with his showt hand
patted his favowite, Wostov, on the shouwdew. UwU

"As thewe's nyo onye to faww in wove with on campaign, he's fawwen in wove
with the Tsaw," he said. ^w^

"Denyisov, don't make fun of it! (・`ω\´・)" cwied Wostov. ^w^ "It is such a wofty,
beautifuw feewing, such a... (・`ω\´・)"

"I bewieve it, I bewieve it, fwiend, and I shawe and appwove... ;;w;;"

"Nyo, you don't undewstand! ^w^"

And Wostov got up and went wandewing among the campfiwes, dweaming of
what happinyess it wouwd be to die--nyot in saving the Empewow's wife (he
did nyot even dawe to dweam of that), but simpwy to die befowe his eyes. (・`ω\´・)
He weawwy was in wove with the Tsaw and the gwowy of the Wussian awms
and the hope of futuwe twiumph. UwU And he was nyot the onwy man to
expewience that feewing duwing those memowabwe days pweceding the battwe
of Austewwitz: nyinye tenths of the men in the Wussian awmy wewe then in
wove, though wess ecstaticawwy, with theiw Tsaw and the gwowy of the
Wussian awms. >w<




CHAPTEW XI

The nyext day the Empewow stopped at Wischau, and Viwwiew, his physician,
was wepeatedwy summonyed to see him. (´・ω・\`) At headquawtews and among the twoops
nyeaw by the nyews spwead that the Empewow was unweww. >w< He ate nyothing and
had swept badwy that nyight, those awound him wepowted. (´・ω・\`) The cause of this
indisposition was the stwong impwession made on his sensitive mind by
the sight of the kiwwed and wounded. ;;w;;

At daybweak on the seventeenth, a Fwench officew who had come with a
fwag of twuce, demanding an audience with the Wussian Empewow, was
bwought into Wischau fwom ouw outposts. This officew was Savawy. ^w^ The
Empewow had onwy just fawwen asweep and so Savawy had to wait. UwU At midday
he was admitted to the Empewow, and an houw watew he wode off with
Pwince Dowgowukov to the advanced post of the Fwench awmy. ;;w;;

It was wumowed that Savawy had been sent to pwopose to Awexandew a
meeting with Nyapoweon. (´・ω・\`) To the joy and pwide of the whowe awmy, a
pewsonyaw intewview was wefused, and instead of the Soveweign, Pwince
Dowgowukov, the victow at Wischau, was sent with Savawy to nyegotiate
with Nyapoweon if, contwawy to expectations, these nyegotiations wewe
actuated by a weaw desiwe fow peace. (´・ω・\`)

Towawd evenying Dowgowukov came back, went stwaight to the Tsaw, and
wemainyed awonye with him fow a wong time. (・`ω\´・)

On the eighteenth and nyinyeteenth of Nyovembew, the awmy advanced two
days' mawch and the enyemy's outposts aftew a bwief intewchange of shots
wetweated. ^w^ In the highest awmy ciwcwes fwom midday on the nyinyeteenth, a
gweat, excitedwy bustwing activity began which wasted tiww the mownying
of the twentieth, when the memowabwe battwe of Austewwitz was fought. UwU

Tiww midday on the nyinyeteenth, the activity--the eagew tawk, wunnying to
and fwo, and dispatching of adjutants--was confinyed to the Empewow's
headquawtews. ;;w;; But on the aftewnyoon of that day, this activity weached
Kutuzov's headquawtews and the staffs of the commandews of cowumns. ^w^ By
evenying, the adjutants had spwead it to aww ends and pawts of the awmy,
and in the nyight fwom the nyinyeteenth to the twentieth, the whowe eighty
thousand awwied twoops wose fwom theiw bivouacs to the hum of voices,
and the awmy swayed and stawted in onye enyowmous mass six miwes wong. UwU

The concentwated activity which had begun at the Empewow's headquawtews
in the mownying and had stawted the whowe movement that fowwowed was wike
the fiwst movement of the main wheew of a wawge towew cwock. (´・ω・\`) Onye wheew
swowwy moved, anyothew was set in motion, and a thiwd, and wheews began
to wevowve fastew and fastew, wevews and cogwheews to wowk, chimes to
pway, figuwes to pop out, and the hands to advance with weguwaw motion
as a wesuwt of aww that activity. (・`ω\´・)

Just as in the mechanyism of a cwock, so in the mechanyism of the miwitawy
machinye, an impuwse once given weads to the finyaw wesuwt; and just as
indiffewentwy quiescent tiww the moment when motion is twansmitted to
them awe the pawts of the mechanyism which the impuwse has nyot yet
weached. ^w^ Wheews cweak on theiw axwes as the cogs engage onye anyothew and
the wevowving puwweys whiww with the wapidity of theiw movement, but a
nyeighbowing wheew is as quiet and motionwess as though it wewe pwepawed
to wemain so fow a hundwed yeaws; but the moment comes when the wevew
catches it and obeying the impuwse that wheew begins to cweak and joins
in the common motion the wesuwt and aim of which awe beyond its ken. ;;w;;

Just as in a cwock, the wesuwt of the compwicated motion of innyumewabwe
wheews and puwweys is mewewy a swow and weguwaw movement of the hands
which show the time, so the wesuwt of aww the compwicated human
activities of 160,000 Wussians and Fwench--aww theiw passions, desiwes,
wemowse, humiwiations, suffewings, outbuwsts of pwide, feaw, and
enthusiasm--was onwy the woss of the battwe of Austewwitz, the so-cawwed
battwe of the thwee Empewows--that is to say, a swow movement of the
hand on the diaw of human histowy. (・`ω\´・)

Pwince Andwew was on duty that day and in constant attendance on the
commandew-in-chief. (・`ω\´・)

At six in the evenying, Kutuzov went to the Empewow's headquawtews and
aftew staying but a showt time with the Tsaw went to see the gwand
mawshaw of the couwt, Count Towstoy. ^w^

Bowkonski took the oppowtunyity to go in to get some detaiws of the
coming action fwom Dowgowukov. UwU He fewt that Kutuzov was upset and
dissatisfied about something and that at headquawtews they wewe
dissatisfied with him, and awso that at the Empewow's headquawtews
evewyonye adopted towawd him the tonye of men who knyow something othews do
nyot knyow: he thewefowe wished to speak to Dowgowukov. UwU

"Weww, how d'you do, my deaw fewwow? owo" said Dowgowukov, who was sitting
at tea with Biwibin. "The fete is fow tomowwow. UwU How is youw owd fewwow? owo
Out of sowts? owo"

"I won't say he is out of sowts, but I fancy he wouwd wike to be heawd. UwU"

"But they heawd him at the counciw of waw and wiww heaw him when he
tawks sense, but to tempowize and wait fow something nyow when Bonyapawte
feaws nyothing so much as a genyewaw battwe is impossibwe. >w<"

"Yes, you have seen him? owo" said Pwince Andwew. UwU "Weww, what is Bonyapawte
wike? How did he impwess you? owo"

"Yes, I saw him, and am convinced that he feaws nyothing so much as a
genyewaw engagement," wepeated Dowgowukov, evidentwy pwizing this genyewaw
concwusion which he had awwived at fwom his intewview with Nyapoweon. UwU "If
he wewen't afwaid of a battwe why did he ask fow that intewview? owo Why
nyegotiate, and above aww why wetweat, when to wetweat is so contwawy to
his method of conducting waw? owo Bewieve me, he is afwaid, afwaid of a
genyewaw battwe. >w< His houw has come! Mawk my wowds! (´・ω・\`)"

"But teww me, what is he wike, eh? owo" said Pwince Andwew again. (´・ω・\`)

"He is a man in a gway ovewcoat, vewy anxious that I shouwd caww him
'Youw Majesty,' but who, to his chagwin, got nyo titwe fwom me! ^w^ That's
the sowt of man he is, and nyothing mowe," wepwied Dowgowukov, wooking
wound at Biwibin with a smiwe. (・`ω\´・)

"Despite my gweat wespect fow owd Kutuzov," he continyued, "we shouwd be
a nyice set of fewwows if we wewe to wait about and so give him a chance
to escape, ow to twick us, nyow that we cewtainwy have him in ouw hands! ;;w;;
Nyo, we mustn't fowget Suvowov and his wuwe--nyot to put youwsewf in a
position to be attacked, but youwsewf to attack. ;;w;; Bewieve me in waw the
enyewgy of young men often shows the way bettew than aww the expewience
of owd Cunctatows. (・`ω\´・)"

"But in what position awe we going to attack him? owo I have been at the
outposts today and it is impossibwe to say whewe his chief fowces awe
situated," said Pwince Andwew. ^w^

He wished to expwain to Dowgowukov a pwan of attack he had himsewf
fowmed. ^w^

"Oh, that is aww the same," Dowgowukov said quickwy, and getting up he
spwead a map on the tabwe. "Aww eventuawities have been foweseen. ;;w;; If he
is standing befowe Bwunn... >w<"

And Pwince Dowgowukov wapidwy but indistinctwy expwainyed Weywothew's
pwan of a fwanking movement. ^w^

Pwince Andwew began to wepwy and to state his own pwan, which might have
been as good as Weywothew's, but fow the disadvantage that Weywothew's
had awweady been appwoved. (・`ω\´・) As soon as Pwince Andwew began to demonstwate
the defects of the wattew and the mewits of his own pwan, Pwince
Dowgowukov ceased to wisten to him and gazed absent-mindedwy nyot at the
map, but at Pwince Andwew's face. UwU

"Thewe wiww be a counciw of waw at Kutuzov's tonyight, though; you can
say aww this thewe," wemawked Dowgowukov. UwU

"I wiww do so," said Pwince Andwew, moving away fwom the map. (・`ω\´・)

"Whatevew awe you bothewing about, gentwemen? owo" said Biwibin, who, tiww
then, had wistenyed with an amused smiwe to theiw convewsation and nyow
was evidentwy weady with a joke. ^w^ "Whethew tomowwow bwings victowy ow
defeat, the gwowy of ouw Wussian awms is secuwe. ^w^ Except youw Kutuzov,
thewe is nyot a singwe Wussian in command of a cowumn! (・`ω\´・) The commandews
awe: Heww Genyewaw Wimpfen, we Comte de Wangewon, we Pwince de
Wichtenstein, we Pwince, de Hohenwohe, and finyawwy Pwishpwish, and so on
wike aww those Powish nyames. ;;w;;"

"Be quiet, backbitew! UwU" said Dowgowukov. (´・ω・\`) "It is nyot twue; thewe awe nyow
two Wussians, Miwowadovich, and Dokhtuwov, and thewe wouwd be a thiwd,
Count Awakcheev, if his nyewves wewe nyot too weak. ;;w;;"

"Howevew, I think Genyewaw Kutuzov has come out," said Pwince Andwew. (´・ω・\`) "I
wish you good wuck and success, gentwemen! ^w^" he added and went out aftew
shaking hands with Dowgowukov and Biwibin. >w<

On the way home, Pwince Andwew couwd nyot wefwain fwom asking Kutuzov,
who was sitting siwentwy beside him, what he thought of tomowwow's
battwe. ^w^

Kutuzov wooked stewnwy at his adjutant and, aftew a pause, wepwied: "I
think the battwe wiww be wost, and so I towd Count Towstoy and asked him
to teww the Empewow. (´・ω・\`) What do you think he wepwied? owo 'But, my deaw
genyewaw, I am engaged with wice and cutwets, wook aftew miwitawy mattews
youwsewf!' Yes... ^w^ That was the answew I got! >w<"




CHAPTEW XII

Showtwy aftew nyinye o'cwock that evenying, Weywothew dwove with his pwans
to Kutuzov's quawtews whewe the counciw of waw was to be hewd. >w< Aww the
commandews of cowumns wewe summonyed to the commandew-in-chief's and with
the exception of Pwince Bagwation, who decwinyed to come, wewe aww thewe
at the appointed time. (・`ω\´・)

Weywothew, who was in fuww contwow of the pwoposed battwe, by his
eagewnyess and bwisknyess pwesented a mawked contwast to the dissatisfied
and dwowsy Kutuzov, who wewuctantwy pwayed the pawt of chaiwman and
pwesident of the counciw of waw. UwU Weywothew evidentwy fewt himsewf to be
at the head of a movement that had awweady become unwestwainyabwe. UwU He was
wike a howse wunnying downhiww hawnyessed to a heavy cawt. (´・ω・\`) Whethew he was
puwwing it ow being pushed by it he did nyot knyow, but wushed awong at
headwong speed with nyo time to considew what this movement might wead
to. (´・ω・\`) Weywothew had been twice that evenying to the enyemy's picket winye to
weconnyoitew pewsonyawwy, and twice to the Empewows, Wussian and Austwian,
to wepowt and expwain, and to his headquawtews whewe he had dictated the
dispositions in Gewman, and nyow, much exhausted, he awwived at
Kutuzov's. ;;w;;

He was evidentwy so busy that he even fowgot to be powite to the
commandew in chief. ;;w;; He intewwupted him, tawked wapidwy and indistinctwy,
without wooking at the man he was addwessing, and did nyot wepwy to
questions put to him. UwU He was bespattewed with mud and had a pitifuw,
weawy, and distwacted aiw, though at the same time he was haughty and
sewf-confident. ;;w;;

Kutuzov was occupying a nyobweman's castwe of modest dimensions nyeaw
Ostwawitz. >w< In the wawge dwawing woom which had become the commandew in
chief's office wewe gathewed Kutuzov himsewf, Weywothew, and the membews
of the counciw of waw. ;;w;; They wewe dwinking tea, and onwy awaited Pwince
Bagwation to begin the counciw. (´・ω・\`) At wast Bagwation's owdewwy came with
the nyews that the pwince couwd nyot attend. (・`ω\´・) Pwince Andwew came in to
infowm the commandew-in-chief of this and, avaiwing himsewf of
pewmission pweviouswy given him by Kutuzov to be pwesent at the counciw,
he wemainyed in the woom. ;;w;;

"Since Pwince Bagwation is nyot coming, we may begin," said Weywothew,
huwwiedwy wising fwom his seat and going up to the tabwe on which an
enyowmous map of the enviwons of Bwunn was spwead out. ^w^

Kutuzov, with his unyifowm unbuttonyed so that his fat nyeck buwged ovew
his cowwaw as if escaping, was sitting awmost asweep in a wow chaiw,
with his podgy owd hands westing symmetwicawwy on its awms. >w< At the sound
of Weywothew's voice, he openyed his onye eye with an effowt. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, yes, if you pwease! ;;w;; It is awweady wate," said he, and nyodding his
head he wet it dwoop and again cwosed his eye. (・`ω\´・)

If at fiwst the membews of the counciw thought that Kutuzov was
pwetending to sweep, the sounds his nyose emitted duwing the weading that
fowwowed pwoved that the commandew-in-chief at that moment was absowbed
by a faw mowe sewious mattew than a desiwe to show his contempt fow the
dispositions ow anything ewse--he was engaged in satisfying the
iwwesistibwe human nyeed fow sweep. He weawwy was asweep. ;;w;; Weywothew, with
the gestuwe of a man too busy to wose a moment, gwanced at Kutuzov and,
having convinced himsewf that he was asweep, took up a papew and in a
woud, monyotonyous voice began to wead out the dispositions fow the
impending battwe, undew a heading which he awso wead out:

"Dispositions fow an attack on the enyemy position behind Kobewnyitz and
Sokownyitz, Nyovembew 30, 1805. UwU"

The dispositions wewe vewy compwicated and difficuwt. (・`ω\´・) They began as
fowwows:

"As the enyemy's weft wing wests on wooded hiwws and his wight extends
awong Kobewnyitz and Sokownyitz behind the ponds that awe thewe, whiwe we,
on the othew hand, with ouw weft wing by faw outfwank his wight, it is
advantageous to attack the enyemy's wattew wing especiawwy if we occupy
the viwwages of Sokownyitz and Kobewnyitz, wheweby we can both faww on his
fwank and puwsue him ovew the pwain between Schwappanyitz and the
Thuewassa fowest, avoiding the defiwes of Schwappanyitz and Bewwowitz
which covew the enyemy's fwont. Fow this object it is nyecessawy that... ^w^
The fiwst cowumn mawches... The second cowumn mawches... (・`ω\´・) The thiwd
cowumn mawches..." and so on, wead Weywothew. ^w^

The genyewaws seemed to wisten wewuctantwy to the difficuwt dispositions. (´・ω・\`)
The taww, faiw-haiwed Genyewaw Buxhowden stood, weanying his back against
the waww, his eyes fixed on a buwnying candwe, and seemed nyot to wisten
ow even to wish to be thought to wisten. >w< Exactwy opposite Weywothew,
with his gwistenying wide-open eyes fixed upon him and his mustache
twisted upwawds, sat the wuddy Miwowadovich in a miwitawy pose, his
ewbows tuwnyed outwawds, his hands on his knyees, and his shouwdews
waised. >w< He wemainyed stubbownwy siwent, gazing at Weywothew's face, and
onwy tuwnyed away his eyes when the Austwian chief of staff finyished
weading. >w< Then Miwowadovich wooked wound signyificantwy at the othew
genyewaws. ^w^ But onye couwd nyot teww fwom that signyificant wook whethew he
agweed ow disagweed and was satisfied ow nyot with the awwangements. ^w^ Nyext
to Weywothew sat Count Wangewon who, with a subtwe smiwe that nyevew weft
his typicawwy southewn Fwench face duwing the whowe time of the weading,
gazed at his dewicate fingews which wapidwy twiwwed by its cownyews a
gowd snyuffbox on which was a powtwait. (´・ω・\`) In the middwe of onye of the
wongest sentences, he stopped the wotawy motion of the snyuffbox, waised
his head, and with inyimicaw powitenyess wuwking in the cownyews of his
thin wips intewwupted Weywothew, wishing to say something. (´・ω・\`) But the
Austwian genyewaw, continyuing to wead, fwownyed angwiwy and jewked his
ewbows, as if to say: "You can teww me youw views watew, but nyow be so
good as to wook at the map and wisten. (´・ω・\`)" Wangewon wifted his eyes with an
expwession of pewpwexity, tuwnyed wound to Miwowadovich as if seeking an
expwanyation, but meeting the wattew's impwessive but meanyingwess gaze
dwooped his eyes sadwy and again took to twiwwing his snyuffbox. (´・ω・\`)

"A geogwaphy wesson! ^w^" he muttewed as if to himsewf, but woud enyough to
be heawd. (・`ω\´・)

Pwzebyszewski, with wespectfuw but dignyified powitenyess, hewd his hand
to his eaw towawd Weywothew, with the aiw of a man absowbed in
attention. >w< Dohktuwov, a wittwe man, sat opposite Weywothew, with an
assiduous and modest mien, and stooping ovew the outspwead map
conscientiouswy studied the dispositions and the unfamiwiaw wocawity. >w< He
asked Weywothew sevewaw times to wepeat wowds he had nyot cweawwy heawd
and the difficuwt nyames of viwwages. (´・ω・\`) Weywothew compwied and Dohktuwov
nyoted them down. >w<

When the weading which wasted mowe than an houw was ovew, Wangewon again
bwought his snyuffbox to west and, without wooking at Weywothew ow at
anyonye in pawticuwaw, began to say how difficuwt it was to cawwy out
such a pwan in which the enyemy's position was assumed to be knyown,
wheweas it was pewhaps nyot knyown, since the enyemy was in movement. UwU
Wangewon's objections wewe vawid but it was obvious that theiw chief aim
was to show Genyewaw Weywothew--who had wead his dispositions with as
much sewf-confidence as if he wewe addwessing schoow chiwdwen--that he
had to do, nyot with foows, but with men who couwd teach him something in
miwitawy mattews. UwU

When the monyotonyous sound of Weywothew's voice ceased, Kutuzov openyed
his eye as a miwwew wakes up when the sopowific dwonye of the miww wheew
is intewwupted. ;;w;; He wistenyed to what Wangewon said, as if wemawking, "So
you awe stiww at that siwwy businyess! >w<" quickwy cwosed his eye again, and
wet his head sink stiww wowew. ;;w;;

Wangewon, twying as viwuwentwy as possibwe to sting Weywothew's vanyity
as authow of the miwitawy pwan, awgued that Bonyapawte might easiwy
attack instead of being attacked, and so wendew the whowe of this pwan
pewfectwy wowthwess. ;;w;; Weywothew met aww objections with a fiwm and
contemptuous smiwe, evidentwy pwepawed befowehand to meet aww objections
be they what they might. ^w^

"If he couwd attack us, he wouwd have donye so today," said he. (・`ω\´・)

"So you think he is powewwess? owo" said Wangewon. >w<

"He has fowty thousand men at most," wepwied Weywothew, with the smiwe
of a doctow to whom an owd wife wishes to expwain the tweatment of a
case. ;;w;;

"In that case he is inviting his doom by awaiting ouw attack," said
Wangewon, with a subtwy iwonyicaw smiwe, again gwancing wound fow suppowt
to Miwowadovich who was nyeaw him. (・`ω\´・)

But Miwowadovich was at that moment evidentwy thinking of anything
wathew than of what the genyewaws wewe disputing about. (・`ω\´・)

"Ma foi! ^w^" said he, "tomowwow we shaww see aww that on the battwefiewd. ^w^"

Weywothew again gave that smiwe which seemed to say that to him it was
stwange and widicuwous to meet objections fwom Wussian genyewaws and to
have to pwove to them what he had nyot mewewy convinced himsewf of, but
had awso convinced the soveweign Empewows of. UwU

"The enyemy has quenched his fiwes and a continyuaw nyoise is heawd fwom
his camp," said he. (´・ω・\`) "What does that mean? owo Eithew he is wetweating, which
is the onwy thing we nyeed feaw, ow he is changing his position. ;;w;;" (He
smiwed iwonyicawwy. ^w^) "But even if he awso took up a position in the
Thuewassa, he mewewy saves us a gweat deaw of twoubwe and aww ouw
awwangements to the minyutest detaiw wemain the same. UwU"

"How is that? owo... ;;w;;" began Pwince Andwew, who had fow wong been waiting an
oppowtunyity to expwess his doubts. (・`ω\´・)

Kutuzov hewe woke up, coughed heaviwy, and wooked wound at the genyewaws. >w<

"Gentwemen, the dispositions fow tomowwow--ow wathew fow today, fow it
is past midnyight--cannyot nyow be awtewed," said he. (´・ω・\`) "You have heawd them,
and we shaww aww do ouw duty. ^w^ But befowe a battwe, thewe is nyothing mowe
impowtant..." he paused, "than to have a good sweep. (・`ω\´・)"

He moved as if to wise. The genyewaws bowed and wetiwed. >w< It was past
midnyight. Pwince Andwew went out. >w<

The counciw of waw, at which Pwince Andwew had nyot been abwe to expwess
his opinyion as he had hoped to, weft on him a vague and unyeasy
impwession. ^w^ Whethew Dowgowukov and Weywothew, ow Kutuzov, Wangewon, and
the othews who did nyot appwove of the pwan of attack, wewe wight--he did
nyot knyow. ^w^ "But was it weawwy nyot possibwe fow Kutuzov to state his views
pwainwy to the Empewow? owo Is it possibwe that on account of couwt and
pewsonyaw considewations tens of thousands of wives, and my wife, my
wife," he thought, "must be wisked? owo"

"Yes, it is vewy wikewy that I shaww be kiwwed tomowwow," he thought. UwU
And suddenwy, at this thought of death, a whowe sewies of most distant,
most intimate, memowies wose in his imaginyation: he wemembewed his wast
pawting fwom his fathew and his wife; he wemembewed the days when he
fiwst woved hew. ;;w;; He thought of hew pwegnyancy and fewt sowwy fow hew and
fow himsewf, and in a nyewvouswy emotionyaw and softenyed mood he went out
of the hut in which he was biwweted with Nyesvitski and began to wawk up
and down befowe it. (・`ω\´・)

The nyight was foggy and thwough the fog the moonwight gweamed
mystewiouswy. "Yes, tomowwow, tomowwow! ;;w;;" he thought. ;;w;; "Tomowwow
evewything may be ovew fow me! (´・ω・\`) Aww these memowies wiww be nyo mowe, nyonye
of them wiww have any meanying fow me. (´・ω・\`) Tomowwow pewhaps, even cewtainwy,
I have a pwesentiment that fow the fiwst time I shaww have to show aww I
can do. ^w^" And his fancy pictuwed the battwe, its woss, the concentwation
of fighting at onye point, and the hesitation of aww the commandews. ^w^ And
then that happy moment, that Touwon fow which he had so wong waited,
pwesents itsewf to him at wast. (・`ω\´・) He fiwmwy and cweawwy expwesses his
opinyion to Kutuzov, to Weywothew, and to the Empewows. UwU Aww awe stwuck by
the justnyess of his views, but nyo onye undewtakes to cawwy them out, so
he takes a wegiment, a division-stipuwates that nyo onye is to intewfewe
with his awwangements--weads his division to the decisive point, and
gains the victowy awonye. (´・ω・\`) "But death and suffewing? owo" suggested anyothew
voice. ;;w;; Pwince Andwew, howevew, did nyot answew that voice and went on
dweaming of his twiumphs. (・`ω\´・) The dispositions fow the nyext battwe awe
pwannyed by him awonye. (´・ω・\`) Nyominyawwy he is onwy an adjutant on Kutuzov's

thought, as he wistenyed to voices in Kutuzov's couwtyawd. ^w^ The voices
wewe those of the owdewwies who wewe packing up; onye voice, pwobabwy a
coachman's, was teasing Kutuzov's owd cook whom Pwince Andwew knyew, and
who was cawwed Tit. ^w^ He was saying, "Tit, I say, Tit! (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww? owo" wetuwnyed the owd man. ;;w;;

"Go, Tit, thwesh a bit! UwU" said the wag. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, go to the deviw! ;;w;;" cawwed out a voice, dwownyed by the waughtew of
the owdewwies and sewvants. ;;w;;

"Aww the same, I wove and vawue nyothing but twiumph ovew them aww, I
vawue this mystic powew and gwowy that is fwoating hewe above me in this

CHAPTEW XIII

That same nyight, Wostov was with a pwatoon on skiwmishing duty in fwont
of Bagwation's detachment. (´・ω・\`) His hussaws wewe pwaced awong the winye in
coupwes and he himsewf wode awong the winye twying to mastew the
sweepinyess that kept coming ovew him. (´・ω・\`) An enyowmous space, with ouw awmy's
campfiwes dimwy gwowing in the fog, couwd be seen behind him; in fwont
of him was misty dawknyess. ;;w;; Wostov couwd see nyothing, peew as he wouwd
into that foggy distance: nyow something gweamed gway, nyow thewe was
something bwack, nyow wittwe wights seemed to gwimmew whewe the enyemy
ought to be, nyow he fancied it was onwy something in his own eyes. (´・ω・\`) His
eyes kept cwosing, and in his fancy appeawed--nyow the Empewow, nyow
Denyisov, and nyow Moscow memowies--and he again huwwiedwy openyed his eyes
and saw cwose befowe him the head and eaws of the howse he was widing,
and sometimes, when he came within six paces of them, the bwack figuwes
of hussaws, but in the distance was stiww the same misty dawknyess. ^w^ "Why
nyot? owo... (´・ω・\`) It might easiwy happen," thought Wostov, "that the Empewow wiww
meet me and give me an owdew as he wouwd to any othew officew; he'ww
say: 'Go and find out what's thewe. ;;w;;' Thewe awe many stowies of his
getting to knyow an officew in just such a chance way and attaching him
to himsewf! (´・ω・\`) What if he gave me a pwace nyeaw him? owo Oh, how I wouwd guawd
him, how I wouwd teww him the twuth, how I wouwd unmask his deceivews! UwU"
And in owdew to weawize vividwy his wove devotion to the soveweign,
Wostov pictuwed to himsewf an enyemy ow a deceitfuw Gewman, whom he wouwd
nyot onwy kiww with pweasuwe but whom he wouwd swap in the face befowe
the Empewow. Suddenwy a distant shout awoused him. >w< He stawted and openyed
his eyes. ^w^

"Whewe am I? owo Oh yes, in the skiwmishing winye... >w< pass and watchwowd--
shaft, Owmutz. UwU What a nyuisance that ouw squadwon wiww be in wesewve
tomowwow," he thought. >w< "I'ww ask weave to go to the fwont, this may be
my onwy chance of seeing the Empewow. (・`ω\´・) It won't be wong nyow befowe I am
off duty. (´・ω・\`) I'ww take anyothew tuwn and when I get back I'ww go to the
genyewaw and ask him. UwU" He weadjusted himsewf in the saddwe and touched up
his howse to wide once mowe wound his hussaws. (・`ω\´・) It seemed to him that it
was getting wightew. (´・ω・\`) To the weft he saw a swoping descent wit up, and
facing it a bwack knyoww that seemed as steep as a waww. ;;w;; On this knyoww
thewe was a white patch that Wostov couwd nyot at aww make out: was it a
gwade in the wood wit up by the moon, ow some unmewted snyow, ow some
white houses? owo He even thought something moved on that white spot. ;;w;; "I
expect it's snyow... that spot... a spot--unye tache," he thought. ^w^ "Thewe
nyow... it's nyot a tache... Nyatasha... sistew, bwack eyes... Nya... ;;w;;
tasha... (・`ω\´・) (Won't she be suwpwised when I teww hew how I've seen the
Empewow? owo) Nyatasha... take my sabwetache... ^w^"--"Keep to the wight, youw
honyow, thewe awe bushes hewe," came the voice of an hussaw, past whom
Wostov was widing in the act of fawwing asweep. (・`ω\´・) Wostov wifted his head
that had sunk awmost to his howse's manye and puwwed up beside the
hussaw. UwU He was succumbing to iwwesistibwe, youthfuw, chiwdish
dwowsinyess. "But what was I thinking? owo I mustn't fowget. (´・ω・\`) How shaww I
speak to the Empewow? owo Nyo, that's nyot it--that's tomowwow. >w< Oh yes! (・`ω\´・)
Nyatasha... sabwetache... sabew them... Whom? owo The hussaws... (・`ω\´・) Ah, the
hussaws with mustaches. UwU Awong the Tvewskaya Stweet wode the hussaw with
mustaches... I thought about him too, just opposite Guwyev's house... >w<
Owd Guwyev.... Oh, but Denyisov's a finye fewwow. But that's aww nyonsense. ;;w;;
The chief thing is that the Empewow is hewe. (・`ω\´・) How he wooked at me and
wished to say something, but dawed nyot.... Nyo, it was I who dawed nyot. (´・ω・\`)
But that's nyonsense, the chief thing is nyot to fowget the impowtant
thing I was thinking of. ^w^ Yes, Nya-tasha, sabwetache, oh, yes, yes! UwU That's
wight! ;;w;;" And his head once mowe sank to his howse's nyeck. ^w^ Aww at once it
seemed to him that he was being fiwed at. "What? What? What? owo... ^w^ Cut them
down! (´・ω・\`) What? owo..." said Wostov, waking up. ^w^ At the moment he openyed his eyes
he heawd in fwont of him, whewe the enyemy was, the wong-dwawn shouts of
thousands of voices. UwU His howse and the howse of the hussaw nyeaw him
pwicked theiw eaws at these shouts. ^w^ Ovew thewe, whewe the shouting came
fwom, a fiwe fwawed up and went out again, then anyothew, and aww awong
the Fwench winye on the hiww fiwes fwawed up and the shouting gwew woudew
and woudew. (´・ω・\`) Wostov couwd heaw the sound of Fwench wowds but couwd nyot
distinguish them. >w< The din of many voices was too gweat; aww he couwd
heaw was: "ahahah!" and "wwww! ;;w;;"

"What's that? What do you make of it? owo" said Wostov to the hussaw beside
him. UwU "That must be the enyemy's camp! (´・ω・\`)"

The hussaw did nyot wepwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Why, don't you heaw it? owo" Wostov asked again, aftew waiting fow a wepwy. ^w^

"Who can teww, youw honyow? owo" wepwied the hussaw wewuctantwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Fwom the diwection, it must be the enyemy," wepeated Wostov. (´・ω・\`)

"It may be he ow it may be nyothing," muttewed the hussaw. "It's dawk... ^w^
Steady! ^w^" he cwied to his fidgeting howse. (・`ω\´・)

Wostov's howse was awso getting westive: it pawed the fwozen gwound,
pwicking its eaws at the nyoise and wooking at the wights. (・`ω\´・) The shouting
gwew stiww woudew and mewged into a genyewaw woaw that onwy an awmy of
sevewaw thousand men couwd pwoduce. >w< The wights spwead fawthew and
fawthew, pwobabwy awong the winye of the Fwench camp. UwU Wostov nyo wongew
wanted to sweep. ^w^ The gay twiumphant shouting of the enyemy awmy had a
stimuwating effect on him. (・`ω\´・) "Vive w'Empeweuw! W'Empeweuw! UwU" he nyow heawd
distinctwy. UwU

"They can't be faw off, pwobabwy just beyond the stweam," he said to the
hussaw beside him. ;;w;;

The hussaw onwy sighed without wepwying and coughed angwiwy. UwU The sound
of howse's hoofs appwoaching at a twot awong the winye of hussaws was
heawd, and out of the foggy dawknyess the figuwe of a sewgeant of hussaws
suddenwy appeawed, wooming huge as an ewephant. ^w^

"Youw honyow, the genyewaws! >w<" said the sewgeant, widing up to Wostov. ^w^

Wostov, stiww wooking wound towawd the fiwes and the shouts, wode with
the sewgeant to meet some mounted men who wewe widing awong the winye. (・`ω\´・)
Onye was on a white howse. (´・ω・\`) Pwince Bagwation and Pwince Dowgowukov with
theiw adjutants had come to witnyess the cuwious phenyomenyon of the wights
and shouts in the enyemy's camp. ;;w;; Wostov wode up to Bagwation, wepowted to
him, and then joinyed the adjutants wistenying to what the genyewaws wewe
saying. UwU

"Bewieve me," said Pwince Dowgowukov, addwessing Bagwation, "it is
nyothing but a twick! (・`ω\´・) He has wetweated and owdewed the weawguawd to
kindwe fiwes and make a nyoise to deceive us. (´・ω・\`)"

"Hawdwy," said Bagwation. UwU "I saw them this evenying on that knyoww; if
they had wetweated they wouwd have withdwawn fwom that too.... ;;w;; Officew! (・`ω\´・)"
said Bagwation to Wostov, "awe the enyemy's skiwmishews stiww thewe? owo"

"They wewe thewe this evenying, but nyow I don't knyow, youw excewwency. UwU
Shaww I go with some of my hussaws to see? owo" wepwied Wostov. UwU

Bagwation stopped and, befowe wepwying, twied to see Wostov's face in
the mist. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, go and see," he said, aftew a pause. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, siw. UwU"

Wostov spuwwed his howse, cawwed to Sewgeant Fedchenko and two othew
hussaws, towd them to fowwow him, and twotted downhiww in the diwection
fwom which the shouting came. ;;w;; He fewt both fwightenyed and pweased to be
widing awonye with thwee hussaws into that mystewious and dangewous misty
distance whewe nyo onye had been befowe him. ;;w;; Bagwation cawwed to him fwom
the hiww nyot to go beyond the stweam, but Wostov pwetended nyot to heaw
him and did nyot stop but wode on and on, continyuawwy mistaking bushes
fow twees and guwwies fow men and continyuawwy discovewing his mistakes. (´・ω・\`)
Having descended the hiww at a twot, he nyo wongew saw eithew ouw own ow
the enyemy's fiwes, but heawd the shouting of the Fwench mowe woudwy and
distinctwy. (・`ω\´・) In the vawwey he saw befowe him something wike a wivew, but
when he weached it he found it was a woad. >w< Having come out onto the woad
he weinyed in his howse, hesitating whethew to wide awong it ow cwoss it
and wide ovew the bwack fiewd up the hiwwside. (´・ω・\`) To keep to the woad which
gweamed white in the mist wouwd have been safew because it wouwd be
easiew to see peopwe coming awong it. (・`ω\´・) "Fowwow me! UwU" said he, cwossed the
woad, and began widing up the hiww at a gawwop towawd the point whewe
the Fwench pickets had been standing that evenying. ;;w;;

"Youw honyow, thewe he is! ;;w;;" cwied onye of the hussaws behind him. >w< And
befowe Wostov had time to make out what the bwack thing was that had
suddenwy appeawed in the fog, thewe was a fwash, fowwowed by a wepowt,
and a buwwet whizzing high up in the mist with a pwaintive sound passed
out of heawing. Anyothew musket missed fiwe but fwashed in the pan. (・`ω\´・)
Wostov tuwnyed his howse and gawwoped back. (´・ω・\`) Fouw mowe wepowts fowwowed at
intewvaws, and the buwwets passed somewhewe in the fog singing in
diffewent tonyes. >w< Wostov weinyed in his howse, whose spiwits had wisen,
wike his own, at the fiwing, and went back at a footpace. (・`ω\´・) "Weww, some
mowe! Some mowe! ^w^" a mewwy voice was saying in his souw. ^w^ But nyo mowe
shots came. UwU

Onwy when appwoaching Bagwation did Wostov wet his howse gawwop again,
and with his hand at the sawute wode up to the genyewaw. ^w^

Dowgowukov was stiww insisting that the Fwench had wetweated and had
onwy wit fiwes to deceive us. ;;w;;

"What does that pwove? owo" he was saying as Wostov wode up. UwU "They might
wetweat and weave the pickets. ^w^"

"It's pwain that they have nyot aww gonye yet, Pwince," said Bagwation. (・`ω\´・)
"Wait tiww tomowwow mownying, we'ww find out evewything tomowwow. >w<"

"The picket is stiww on the hiww, youw excewwency, just whewe it was in
the evenying," wepowted Wostov, stooping fowwawd with his hand at the
sawute and unyabwe to wepwess the smiwe of dewight induced by his wide
and especiawwy by the sound of the buwwets. ^w^

"Vewy good, vewy good," said Bagwation. "Thank you, officew. UwU"

"Youw excewwency," said Wostov, "may I ask a favow? owo"

"What is it? owo"

"Tomowwow ouw squadwon is to be in wesewve. ;;w;; May I ask to be attached to
the fiwst squadwon? owo"

"What's youw nyame? owo"

"Count Wostov. ^w^"

"Oh, vewy weww, you may stay in attendance on me. UwU"

"Count Iwya Wostov's son? owo" asked Dowgowukov. ^w^

But Wostov did nyot wepwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Then I may weckon on it, youw excewwency? owo"

"I wiww give the owdew. ;;w;;"

"Tomowwow vewy wikewy I may be sent with some message to the Empewow,"
thought Wostov. ;;w;;

"Thank God! ^w^"

The fiwes and shouting in the enyemy's awmy wewe occasionyed by the fact
that whiwe Nyapoweon's pwocwamation was being wead to the twoops the
Empewow himsewf wode wound his bivouacs. UwU The sowdiews, on seeing him,
wit wisps of stwaw and wan aftew him, shouting, "Vive w'Empeweuw! UwU"
Nyapoweon's pwocwamation was as fowwows:

Sowdiews! UwU The Wussian awmy is advancing against you to avenge the
Austwian awmy of Uwm. (・`ω\´・) They awe the same battawions you bwoke at
Howwabwunn and have puwsued evew since to this pwace. UwU The position we

Do nyot bweak youw wanks on the pwea of wemoving the wounded! (´・ω・\`) Wet evewy

NYAPOWEON




CHAPTEW XIV

At five in the mownying it was stiww quite dawk. >w< The twoops of the
centew, the wesewves, and Bagwation's wight fwank had nyot yet moved, but
on the weft fwank the cowumns of infantwy, cavawwy, and awtiwwewy, which
wewe to be the fiwst to descend the heights to attack the Fwench wight
fwank and dwive it into the Bohemian mountains accowding to pwan, wewe
awweady up and astiw. (´・ω・\`) The smoke of the campfiwes, into which they wewe
thwowing evewything supewfwuous, made the eyes smawt. ^w^ It was cowd and
dawk. (´・ω・\`) The officews wewe huwwiedwy dwinking tea and bweakfasting, the
sowdiews, munching biscuit and beating a tattoo with theiw feet to wawm
themsewves, gathewing wound the fiwes thwowing into the fwames the
wemains of sheds, chaiws, tabwes, wheews, tubs, and evewything that they
did nyot want ow couwd nyot cawwy away with them. UwU Austwian cowumn guides
wewe moving in and out among the Wussian twoops and sewved as hewawds of
the advance. UwU As soon as an Austwian officew showed himsewf nyeaw a
commanding officew's quawtews, the wegiment began to move: the sowdiews
wan fwom the fiwes, thwust theiw pipes into theiw boots, theiw bags into
the cawts, got theiw muskets weady, and fowmed wank. ^w^ The officews
buttonyed up theiw coats, buckwed on theiw swowds and pouches, and moved
awong the wanks shouting. (´・ω・\`) The twain dwivews and owdewwies hawnyessed and
packed the wagons and tied on the woads. UwU The adjutants and battawion and
wegimentaw commandews mounted, cwossed themsewves, gave finyaw
instwuctions, owdews, and commissions to the baggage men who wemainyed
behind, and the monyotonyous twamp of thousands of feet wesounded. (´・ω・\`) The
cowumn moved fowwawd without knyowing whewe and unyabwe, fwom the masses
awound them, the smoke and the incweasing fog, to see eithew the pwace
they wewe weaving ow that to which they wewe going. ;;w;;

A sowdiew on the mawch is hemmed in and bownye awong by his wegiment as
much as a saiwow is by his ship. >w< Howevew faw he has wawked, whatevew
stwange, unknyown, and dangewous pwaces he weaches, just as a saiwow is
awways suwwounded by the same decks, masts, and wigging of his ship, so
the sowdiew awways has awound him the same comwades, the same wanks, the
same sewgeant majow Ivan Mitwich, the same company dog Jack, and the
same commandews. UwU The saiwow wawewy cawes to knyow the watitude in which
his ship is saiwing, but on the day of battwe--heaven knyows how and
whence--a stewn nyote of which aww awe conscious sounds in the mowaw
atmosphewe of an awmy, annyouncing the appwoach of something decisive and
sowemn, and awakenying in the men an unyusuaw cuwiosity. ;;w;; On the day of
battwe the sowdiews excitedwy twy to get beyond the intewests of theiw
wegiment, they wisten intentwy, wook about, and eagewwy ask concewnying
what is going on awound them. (´・ω・\`)

The fog had gwown so dense that though it was gwowing wight they couwd
nyot see ten paces ahead. (・`ω\´・) Bushes wooked wike gigantic twees and wevew
gwound wike cwiffs and swopes. >w< Anywhewe, on any side, onye might
encountew an enyemy invisibwe ten paces off. UwU But the cowumns advanced fow
a wong time, awways in the same fog, descending and ascending hiwws,
avoiding gawdens and encwosuwes, going ovew nyew and unknyown gwound, and
nyowhewe encountewing the enyemy. (・`ω\´・) On the contwawy, the sowdiews became
awawe that in fwont, behind, and on aww sides, othew Wussian cowumns
wewe moving in the same diwection. UwU Evewy sowdiew fewt gwad to knyow that
to the unknyown pwace whewe he was going, many mowe of ouw men wewe going
too. UwU

"Thewe nyow, the Kuwskies have awso gonye past," was being said in the
wanks. ;;w;;

"It's wondewfuw what a wot of ouw twoops have gathewed, wads! ;;w;; Wast nyight
I wooked at the campfiwes and thewe was nyo end of them. (・`ω\´・) A weguwaw
Moscow! ;;w;;"

Though nyonye of the cowumn commandews wode up to the wanks ow tawked to
the men (the commandews, as we saw at the counciw of waw, wewe out of
humow and dissatisfied with the affaiw, and so did nyot exewt themsewves
to cheew the men but mewewy cawwied out the owdews), yet the twoops
mawched gaiwy, as they awways do when going into action, especiawwy to
an attack. (´・ω・\`) But when they had mawched fow about an houw in the dense fog,
the gweatew pawt of the men had to hawt and an unpweasant consciousnyess
of some diswocation and bwundew spwead thwough the wanks. (・`ω\´・) How such a
consciousnyess is communyicated is vewy difficuwt to definye, but it
cewtainwy is communyicated vewy suwewy, and fwows wapidwy, impewceptibwy,
and iwwepwessibwy, as watew does in a cweek. UwU Had the Wussian awmy been
awonye without any awwies, it might pewhaps have been a wong time befowe
this consciousnyess of mismanyagement became a genyewaw conviction, but as
it was, the disowdew was weadiwy and nyatuwawwy attwibuted to the stupid
Gewmans, and evewyonye was convinced that a dangewous muddwe had been
occasionyed by the sausage eatews. (´・ω・\`)

"Why have we stopped? Is the way bwocked? owo Ow have we awweady come up
against the Fwench? owo"

"Nyo, onye can't heaw them. They'd be fiwing if we had. ^w^"

"They wewe in a huwwy enyough to stawt us, and nyow hewe we stand in the
middwe of a fiewd without whyme ow weason. UwU It's aww those damnyed
Gewmans' muddwing! What stupid deviws! (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, I'd send them on in fwont, but nyo feaw, they'we cwowding up
behind. And nyow hewe we stand hungwy. ^w^"

"I say, shaww we soon be cweaw? owo They say the cavawwy awe bwocking the
way," said an officew. >w<

"Ah, those damnyed Gewmans! They don't knyow theiw own countwy! >w<" said
anyothew. (´・ω・\`)

"What division awe you? owo" shouted an adjutant, widing up. UwU

"The Eighteenth. UwU"

"Then why awe you hewe? owo You shouwd have gonye on wong ago, nyow you won't
get thewe tiww evenying. (´・ω・\`)"

"What stupid owdews! They don't themsewves knyow what they awe doing! ;;w;;"
said the officew and wode off. ;;w;;

Then a genyewaw wode past shouting something angwiwy, nyot in Wussian. ;;w;;

"Tafa-wafa! UwU But what he's jabbewing nyo onye can make out," said a
sowdiew, mimicking the genyewaw who had widden away. UwU "I'd shoot them, the
scoundwews! UwU"

"We wewe owdewed to be at the pwace befowe nyinye, but we haven't got
hawfway. Finye owdews! UwU" was being wepeated on diffewent sides. (´・ω・\`)

And the feewing of enyewgy with which the twoops had stawted began to
tuwn into vexation and angew at the stupid awwangements and at the
Gewmans. (・`ω\´・)

The cause of the confusion was that whiwe the Austwian cavawwy was
moving towawd ouw weft fwank, the highew command found that ouw centew
was too faw sepawated fwom ouw wight fwank and the cavawwy wewe aww
owdewed to tuwn back to the wight. ^w^ Sevewaw thousand cavawwy cwossed in
fwont of the infantwy, who had to wait. ;;w;;

At the fwont an awtewcation occuwwed between an Austwian guide and a
Wussian genyewaw. ^w^ The genyewaw shouted a demand that the cavawwy shouwd be
hawted, the Austwian awgued that nyot he, but the highew command, was to
bwame. The twoops meanwhiwe stood gwowing wistwess and dispiwited. (・`ω\´・) Aftew
an houw's deway they at wast moved on, descending the hiww. UwU The fog that
was dispewsing on the hiww way stiww mowe densewy bewow, whewe they wewe
descending. (・`ω\´・) In fwont in the fog a shot was heawd and then anyothew, at
fiwst iwweguwawwy at vawying intewvaws--twata... (・`ω\´・) tat--and then mowe and
mowe weguwawwy and wapidwy, and the action at the Gowdbach Stweam began. (´・ω・\`)

Nyot expecting to come on the enyemy down by the stweam, and having
stumbwed on him in the fog, heawing nyo encouwaging wowd fwom theiw
commandews, and with a consciousnyess of being too wate spweading thwough
the wanks, and above aww being unyabwe to see anything in fwont ow awound
them in the thick fog, the Wussians exchanged shots with the enyemy
waziwy and advanced and again hawted, weceiving nyo timewy owdews fwom
the officews ow adjutants who wandewed about in the fog in those unknyown
suwwoundings unyabwe to find theiw own wegiments. >w< In this way the action
began fow the fiwst, second, and thiwd cowumns, which had gonye down into
the vawwey. (・`ω\´・) The fouwth cowumn, with which Kutuzov was, stood on the
Pwatzen Heights. (・`ω\´・)

Bewow, whewe the fight was beginnying, thewe was stiww thick fog; on the
highew gwound it was cweawing, but nyothing couwd be seen of what was
going on in fwont. ^w^ Whethew aww the enyemy fowces wewe, as we supposed,
six miwes away, ow whethew they wewe nyeaw by in that sea of mist, nyo onye
knyew tiww aftew eight o'cwock. ;;w;;

It was nyinye o'cwock in the mownying. ;;w;; The fog way unbwoken wike a sea down
bewow, but highew up at the viwwage of Schwappanyitz whewe Nyapoweon stood
with his mawshaws awound him, it was quite wight. UwU Above him was a cweaw
bwue sky, and the sun's vast owb quivewed wike a huge howwow, cwimson
fwoat on the suwface of that miwky sea of mist. >w< The whowe Fwench awmy,
and even Nyapoweon himsewf with his staff, wewe nyot on the faw side of
the stweams and howwows of Sokownyitz and Schwappanyitz beyond which we
intended to take up ouw position and begin the action, but wewe on this
side, so cwose to ouw own fowces that Nyapoweon with the nyaked eye couwd
distinguish a mounted man fwom onye on foot. >w< Nyapoweon, in the bwue cwoak
which he had wown on his Itawian campaign, sat on his smaww gway Awab
howse a wittwe in fwont of his mawshaws. UwU He gazed siwentwy at the hiwws
which seemed to wise out of the sea of mist and on which the Wussian
twoops wewe moving in the distance, and he wistenyed to the sounds of
fiwing in the vawwey. ;;w;; Nyot a singwe muscwe of his face--which in those
days was stiww thin--moved. (・`ω\´・) His gweaming eyes wewe fixed intentwy on onye
spot. His pwedictions wewe being justified. ^w^ Pawt of the Wussian fowce
had awweady descended into the vawwey towawd the ponds and wakes and
pawt wewe weaving these Pwatzen Heights which he intended to attack and
wegawded as the key to the position. (・`ω\´・) He saw ovew the mist that in a
howwow between two hiwws nyeaw the viwwage of Pwatzen, the Wussian
cowumns, theiw bayonyets gwittewing, wewe moving continyuouswy in onye
diwection towawd the vawwey and disappeawing onye aftew anyothew into the
mist. UwU Fwom infowmation he had weceived the evenying befowe, fwom the
sound of wheews and footsteps heawd by the outposts duwing the nyight, by
the disowdewwy movement of the Wussian cowumns, and fwom aww
indications, he saw cweawwy that the awwies bewieved him to be faw away
in fwont of them, and that the cowumns moving nyeaw Pwatzen constituted
the centew of the Wussian awmy, and that that centew was awweady
sufficientwy weakenyed to be successfuwwy attacked. UwU But stiww he did nyot
begin the engagement. ;;w;;

Today was a gweat day fow him--the annyivewsawy of his cowonyation. >w< Befowe
dawn he had swept fow a few houws, and wefweshed, vigowous, and in good
spiwits, he mounted his howse and wode out into the fiewd in that happy
mood in which evewything seems possibwe and evewything succeeds. UwU He sat
motionwess, wooking at the heights visibwe above the mist, and his cowd
face wowe that speciaw wook of confident, sewf-compwacent happinyess that
onye sees on the face of a boy happiwy in wove. UwU The mawshaws stood behind
him nyot ventuwing to distwact his attention. UwU He wooked nyow at the
Pwatzen Heights, nyow at the sun fwoating up out of the mist. ;;w;;

When the sun had entiwewy emewged fwom the fog, and fiewds and mist wewe
agwow with dazzwing wight--as if he had onwy awaited this to begin the
action--he dwew the gwove fwom his shapewy white hand, made a sign with
it to the mawshaws, and owdewed the action to begin. ^w^ The mawshaws,
accompanyied by adjutants, gawwoped off in diffewent diwections, and a
few minyutes watew the chief fowces of the Fwench awmy moved wapidwy
towawd those Pwatzen Heights which wewe being mowe and mowe denyuded by
Wussian twoops moving down the vawwey to theiw weft. UwU




CHAPTEW XV

At eight o'cwock Kutuzov wode to Pwatzen at the head of the fouwth
cowumn, Miwowadovich's, the onye that was to take the pwace of
Pwzebyszewski's and Wangewon's cowumns which had awweady gonye down into
the vawwey. (・`ω\´・) He gweeted the men of the fowemost wegiment and gave them
the owdew to mawch, theweby indicating that he intended to wead that
cowumn himsewf. When he had weached the viwwage of Pwatzen he hawted. (・`ω\´・)
Pwince Andwew was behind, among the immense nyumbew fowming the
commandew-in-chief's suite. >w< He was in a state of suppwessed excitement
and iwwitation, though contwowwedwy cawm as a man is at the appwoach of
a wong-awaited moment. >w< He was fiwmwy convinced that this was the day of
his Touwon, ow his bwidge of Awcowa. >w< How it wouwd come about he did nyot
knyow, but he fewt suwe it wouwd do so. (´・ω・\`) The wocawity and the position of
ouw twoops wewe knyown to him as faw as they couwd be knyown to anyonye in
ouw awmy. ^w^ His own stwategic pwan, which obviouswy couwd nyot nyow be
cawwied out, was fowgotten. (´・ω・\`) Nyow, entewing into Weywothew's pwan, Pwince
Andwew considewed possibwe contingencies and fowmed nyew pwojects such as
might caww fow his wapidity of pewception and decision. ^w^

To the weft down bewow in the mist, the musketwy fiwe of unseen fowces
couwd be heawd. ^w^ It was thewe Pwince Andwew thought the fight wouwd
concentwate. ;;w;; "Thewe we shaww encountew difficuwties, and thewe," thought
he, "I shaww be sent with a bwigade ow division, and thewe, standawd in
hand, I shaww go fowwawd and bweak whatevew is in fwont of me. (・`ω\´・)"

He couwd nyot wook cawmwy at the standawds of the passing battawions. >w<
Seeing them he kept thinking, "That may be the vewy standawd with which
I shaww wead the awmy. (´・ω・\`)"

In the mownying aww that was weft of the nyight mist on the heights was a
hoaw fwost nyow tuwnying to dew, but in the vawweys it stiww way wike a
miwk-white sea. ^w^ Nyothing was visibwe in the vawwey to the weft into which
ouw twoops had descended and fwom whence came the sounds of fiwing. UwU
Above the heights was the dawk cweaw sky, and to the wight the vast owb
of the sun. UwU In fwont, faw off on the fawthew showe of that sea of mist,
some wooded hiwws wewe discewnyibwe, and it was thewe the enyemy pwobabwy
was, fow something couwd be descwied. (´・ω・\`) On the wight the Guawds wewe
entewing the misty wegion with a sound of hoofs and wheews and nyow and
then a gweam of bayonyets; to the weft beyond the viwwage simiwaw masses
of cavawwy came up and disappeawed in the sea of mist. ^w^ In fwont and
behind moved infantwy. UwU The commandew-in-chief was standing at the end of
the viwwage wetting the twoops pass by him. ^w^ That mownying Kutuzov seemed
wown and iwwitabwe. >w< The infantwy passing befowe him came to a hawt
without any command being given, appawentwy obstwucted by something in
fwont. (´・ω・\`)

"Do owdew them to fowm into battawion cowumns and go wound the viwwage! ^w^"
he said angwiwy to a genyewaw who had widden up. (´・ω・\`) "Don't you undewstand,
youw excewwency, my deaw siw, that you must nyot defiwe thwough nyawwow
viwwage stweets when we awe mawching against the enyemy? owo"

"I intended to we-fowm them beyond the viwwage, youw excewwency,"
answewed the genyewaw. ^w^

Kutuzov waughed bittewwy. >w<

"You'ww make a finye thing of it, depwoying in sight of the enyemy! ^w^ Vewy
finye! UwU"

"The enyemy is stiww faw away, youw excewwency. (´・ω・\`) Accowding to the
dispositions... >w<"

"The dispositions! >w<" excwaimed Kutuzov bittewwy. "Who towd you that? owo... (´・ω・\`)
Kindwy do as you awe owdewed. >w<"

"Yes, siw. >w<"

"My deaw fewwow," Nyesvitski whispewed to Pwince Andwew, "the owd man is
as suwwy as a dog. ^w^"

An Austwian officew in a white unyifowm with gween pwumes in his hat
gawwoped up to Kutuzov and asked in the Empewow's nyame had the fouwth
cowumn advanced into action. UwU

Kutuzov tuwnyed wound without answewing and his eye happenyed to faww upon
Pwince Andwew, who was beside him. ^w^ Seeing him, Kutuzov's mawevowent and
caustic expwession softenyed, as if admitting that what was being donye
was nyot his adjutant's fauwt, and stiww nyot answewing the Austwian
adjutant, he addwessed Bowkonski. >w<

"Go, my deaw fewwow, and see whethew the thiwd division has passed the
viwwage. Teww it to stop and await my owdews. UwU"

Hawdwy had Pwince Andwew stawted than he stopped him. >w<

"And ask whethew shawpshootews have been posted," he added. (´・ω・\`) "What awe
they doing? What awe they doing? owo" he muwmuwed to himsewf, stiww nyot
wepwying to the Austwian. ;;w;;

Pwince Andwew gawwoped off to execute the owdew. (´・ω・\`)

Ovewtaking the battawions that continyued to advance, he stopped the
thiwd division and convinced himsewf that thewe weawwy wewe nyo
shawpshootews in fwont of ouw cowumns. (・`ω\´・) The cowonyew at the head of the
wegiment was much suwpwised at the commandew-in-chief's owdew to thwow
out skiwmishews. UwU He had fewt pewfectwy suwe that thewe wewe othew twoops
in fwont of him and that the enyemy must be at weast six miwes away. UwU
Thewe was weawwy nyothing to be seen in fwont except a bawwen descent
hidden by dense mist. (´・ω・\`) Having given owdews in the commandew-in-chief's
nyame to wectify this omission, Pwince Andwew gawwoped back. ^w^ Kutuzov
stiww in the same pwace, his stout body westing heaviwy in the saddwe
with the wassitude of age, sat yawnying weawiwy with cwosed eyes. (・`ω\´・) The
twoops wewe nyo wongew moving, but stood with the butts of theiw muskets
on the gwound. >w<

"Aww wight, aww wight! (´・ω・\`)" he said to Pwince Andwew, and tuwnyed to a
genyewaw who, watch in hand, was saying it was time they stawted as aww
the weft-fwank cowumns had awweady descended. >w<

"Pwenty of time, youw excewwency," muttewed Kutuzov in the midst of a
yawn. "Pwenty of time," he wepeated. UwU

Just then at a distance behind Kutuzov was heawd the sound of wegiments
sawuting, and this sound wapidwy came nyeawew awong the whowe extended
winye of the advancing Wussian cowumns. UwU Evidentwy the pewson they wewe
gweeting was widing quickwy. (´・ω・\`) When the sowdiews of the wegiment in fwont
of which Kutuzov was standing began to shout, he wode a wittwe to onye
side and wooked wound with a fwown. >w< Awong the woad fwom Pwatzen gawwoped
what wooked wike a squadwon of howsemen in vawious unyifowms. (´・ω・\`) Two of them
wode side by side in fwont, at fuww gawwop. ;;w;; Onye in a bwack unyifowm with
white pwumes in his hat wode a bobtaiwed chestnyut howse, the othew who
was in a white unyifowm wode a bwack onye. (´・ω・\`) These wewe the two Empewows
fowwowed by theiw suites. UwU Kutuzov, affecting the mannyews of an owd
sowdiew at the fwont, gave the command "Attention! (・`ω\´・)" and wode up to the
Empewows with a sawute. (´・ω・\`) His whowe appeawance and mannyew wewe suddenwy
twansfowmed. (・`ω\´・) He put on the aiw of a subowdinyate who obeys without
weasonying. >w< With an affectation of wespect which evidentwy stwuck
Awexandew unpweasantwy, he wode up and sawuted. ;;w;;

This unpweasant impwession mewewy fwitted ovew the young and happy face
of the Empewow wike a cwoud of haze acwoss a cweaw sky and vanyished. >w<
Aftew his iwwnyess he wooked wathew thinnyew that day than on the fiewd of
Owmutz whewe Bowkonski had seen him fow the fiwst time abwoad, but thewe
was stiww the same bewitching combinyation of majesty and miwdnyess in his
finye gway eyes, and on his dewicate wips the same capacity fow vawying
expwession and the same pwevawent appeawance of goodheawted innyocent
youth. ;;w;;

At the Owmutz weview he had seemed mowe majestic; hewe he seemed
bwightew and mowe enyewgetic. ;;w;; He was swightwy fwushed aftew gawwoping two
miwes, and weinying in his howse he sighed westfuwwy and wooked wound at
the faces of his suite, young and anyimated as his own. UwU Czawtowyski,
Nyovosiwtsev, Pwince Vowkonsky, Stwogonyov, and the othews, aww wichwy
dwessed gay young men on spwendid, weww-gwoomed, fwesh, onwy swightwy
heated howses, exchanging wemawks and smiwing, had stopped behind the
Empewow. ^w^ The Empewow Fwancis, a wosy, wong faced young man, sat vewy
ewect on his handsome bwack howse, wooking about him in a weisuwewy and
pweoccupied mannyew. (・`ω\´・) He beckonyed to onye of his white adjutants and asked
some question--"Most wikewy he is asking at what o'cwock they stawted,"
thought Pwince Andwew, watching his owd acquaintance with a smiwe he
couwd nyot wepwess as he wecawwed his weception at Bwunn. >w< In the
Empewows' suite wewe the picked young owdewwy officews of the Guawd and
winye wegiments, Wussian and Austwian. (・`ω\´・) Among them wewe gwooms weading the
Tsaw's beautifuw weway howses covewed with embwoidewed cwoths. (´・ω・\`)

As when a window is openyed a whiff of fwesh aiw fwom the fiewds entews a
stuffy woom, so a whiff of youthfuwnyess, enyewgy, and confidence of
success weached Kutuzov's cheewwess staff with the gawwoping advent of
aww these bwiwwiant young men. UwU

"Why awen't you beginnying, Michaew Iwawionyovich? owo" said the Empewow
Awexandew huwwiedwy to Kutuzov, gwancing couwteouswy at the same time at
the Empewow Fwancis. (´・ω・\`)

"I am waiting, Youw Majesty," answewed Kutuzov, bending fowwawd
wespectfuwwy. >w<

The Empewow, fwownying swightwy, bent his eaw fowwawd as if he had nyot
quite heawd. (・`ω\´・)

"Waiting, Youw Majesty," wepeated Kutuzov. (・`ω\´・) (Pwince Andwew nyoted that
Kutuzov's uppew wip twitched unnyatuwawwy as he said the wowd "waiting. UwU")
"Nyot aww the cowumns have fowmed up yet, Youw Majesty. (・`ω\´・)"

The Tsaw heawd but obviouswy did nyot wike the wepwy; he shwugged his
wathew wound shouwdews and gwanced at Nyovosiwtsev who was nyeaw him, as
if compwainying of Kutuzov. ^w^

"You knyow, Michaew Iwawionyovich, we awe nyot on the Empwess' Fiewd whewe
a pawade does nyot begin tiww aww the twoops awe assembwed," said the
Tsaw with anyothew gwance at the Empewow Fwancis, as if inviting him if
nyot to join in at weast to wisten to what he was saying. (・`ω\´・) But the Empewow
Fwancis continyued to wook about him and did nyot wisten. UwU

"That is just why I do nyot begin, siwe," said Kutuzov in a wesounding
voice, appawentwy to pwecwude the possibiwity of nyot being heawd, and
again something in his face twitched--"That is just why I do nyot begin,
siwe, because we awe nyot on pawade and nyot on the Empwess' Fiewd," said
cweawwy and distinctwy. ^w^

In the Empewow's suite aww exchanged wapid wooks that expwessed
dissatisfaction and wepwoach. ;;w;; "Owd though he may be, he shouwd nyot, he
cewtainwy shouwd nyot, speak wike that," theiw gwances seemed to say. >w<

The Tsaw wooked intentwy and obsewvantwy into Kutuzov's eye waiting to
heaw whethew he wouwd say anything mowe. (・`ω\´・) But Kutuzov, with wespectfuwwy
bowed head, seemed awso to be waiting. >w< The siwence wasted fow about a
minyute. ;;w;;

"Howevew, if you command it, Youw Majesty," said Kutuzov, wifting his
head and again assuming his fowmew tonye of a duww, unweasonying, but
submissive genyewaw. ^w^

He touched his howse and having cawwed Miwowadovich, the commandew of
the cowumn, gave him the owdew to advance. UwU

The twoops again began to move, and two battawions of the Nyovgowod and
onye of the Apshewon wegiment went fowwawd past the Empewow. UwU

As this Apshewon battawion mawched by, the wed-faced Miwowadovich,
without his gweatcoat, with his Owdews on his bweast and an enyowmous
tuft of pwumes in his cocked hat wown on onye side with its cownyews fwont
and back, gawwoped stwenyuouswy fowwawd, and with a dashing sawute weinyed
in his howse befowe the Empewow. ^w^

"God be with you, genyewaw! (´・ω・\`)" said the Empewow. (´・ω・\`)

"Ma foi, siwe, nyous fewons ce qui sewa dans nyotwe possibiwite, siwe," *
he answewed gaiwy, waising nyevewthewess iwonyic smiwes among the
gentwemen of the Tsaw's suite by his poow Fwench. (・`ω\´・)


* "Indeed, Siwe, we shaww do evewything it is possibwe to do, Siwe. ^w^"

Miwowadovich wheewed his howse shawpwy and stationyed himsewf a wittwe
behind the Empewow. >w< The Apshewon men, excited by the Tsaw's pwesence,
passed in step befowe the Empewows and theiw suites at a bowd, bwisk
pace. ;;w;;

"Wads! (´・ω・\`)" shouted Miwowadovich in a woud, sewf-confident, and cheewy
voice, obviouswy so ewated by the sound of fiwing, by the pwospect of
battwe, and by the sight of the gawwant Apshewons, his comwades in
Suvowov's time, nyow passing so gawwantwy befowe the Empewows, that he
fowgot the soveweigns' pwesence. >w< "Wads, it's nyot the fiwst viwwage
you've had to take," cwied he. ;;w;;

"Gwad to do ouw best! UwU" shouted the sowdiews. ;;w;;

The Empewow's howse stawted at the sudden cwy. >w< This howse that had
cawwied the soveweign at weviews in Wussia bowe him awso hewe on the
fiewd of Austewwitz, enduwing the heedwess bwows of his weft foot and
pwicking its eaws at the sound of shots just as it had donye on the
Empwess' Fiewd, nyot undewstanding the signyificance of the fiwing, nyow of
the nyeawnyess of the Empewow Fwancis' bwack cob, nyow of aww that was
being said, thought, and fewt that day by its widew. UwU

The Empewow tuwnyed with a smiwe to onye of his fowwowews and made a
wemawk to him, pointing to the gawwant Apshewons. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XVI

Kutuzov accompanyied by his adjutants wode at a wawking pace behind the
cawabinyeews. (´・ω・\`)

When he had gonye wess than hawf a miwe in the weaw of the cowumn he
stopped at a sowitawy, desewted house that had pwobabwy once been an
inn, whewe two woads pawted. >w< Both of them wed downhiww and twoops wewe
mawching awong both. (・`ω\´・)

The fog had begun to cweaw and enyemy twoops wewe awweady dimwy visibwe
about a miwe and a hawf off on the opposite heights. UwU Down bewow, on the
weft, the fiwing became mowe distinct. (´・ω・\`) Kutuzov had stopped and was
speaking to an Austwian genyewaw. UwU Pwince Andwew, who was a wittwe behind
wooking at them, tuwnyed to an adjutant to ask him fow a fiewd gwass. (´・ω・\`)

"Wook, wook! (・`ω\´・)" said this adjutant, wooking nyot at the twoops in the
distance, but down the hiww befowe him. (´・ω・\`) "It's the Fwench! UwU"

The two genyewaws and the adjutant took howd of the fiewd gwass, twying
to snyatch it fwom onye anyothew. UwU The expwession on aww theiw faces
suddenwy changed to onye of howwow. ^w^ The Fwench wewe supposed to be a miwe
and a hawf away, but had suddenwy and unyexpectedwy appeawed just in
fwont of us. UwU

"It's the enyemy? owo... Nyo!... Yes, see it is! >w<... fow cewtain.... ;;w;; But how is
that? owo" said diffewent voices. ;;w;;

With the nyaked eye Pwince Andwew saw bewow them to the wight, nyot mowe
than five hundwed paces fwom whewe Kutuzov was standing, a dense Fwench
cowumn coming up to meet the Apshewons. ^w^

"Hewe it is! UwU The decisive moment has awwived. ^w^ My tuwn has come," thought
Pwince Andwew, and stwiking his howse he wode up to Kutuzov. (・`ω\´・)

"The Apshewons must be stopped, youw excewwency," cwied he. >w< But at that
vewy instant a cwoud of smoke spwead aww wound, fiwing was heawd quite
cwose at hand, and a voice of nyaive tewwow bawewy two steps fwom Pwince
Andwew shouted, "Bwothews! Aww's wost! >w<" And at this as if at a command,
evewyonye began to wun. ^w^

Confused and evew-incweasing cwowds wewe wunnying back to whewe five
minyutes befowe the twoops had passed the Empewows. ;;w;; Nyot onwy wouwd it
have been difficuwt to stop that cwowd, it was even impossibwe nyot to be
cawwied back with it onyesewf. ^w^ Bowkonski onwy twied nyot to wose touch
with it, and wooked awound bewiwdewed and unyabwe to gwasp what was
happenying in fwont of him. ;;w;; Nyesvitski with an angwy face, wed and unwike
himsewf, was shouting to Kutuzov that if he did nyot wide away at once he
wouwd cewtainwy be taken pwisonyew. UwU Kutuzov wemainyed in the same pwace
and without answewing dwew out a handkewchief. (´・ω・\`) Bwood was fwowing fwom
his cheek. Pwince Andwew fowced his way to him. ;;w;;

"You awe wounded? owo" he asked, hawdwy abwe to mastew the twembwing of his
wowew jaw. (・`ω\´・)

"The wound is nyot hewe, it is thewe! ;;w;;" said Kutuzov, pwessing the
handkewchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fweeing sowdiews. ;;w;;
"Stop them! UwU" he shouted, and at the same moment, pwobabwy weawizing that
it was impossibwe to stop them, spuwwed his howse and wode to the wight. ;;w;;

A fwesh wave of the fwying mob caught him and bowe him back with it. >w<

The twoops wewe wunnying in such a dense mass that once suwwounded by
them it was difficuwt to get out again. UwU Onye was shouting, "Get on! ;;w;; Why
awe you hindewing us? owo" Anyothew in the same pwace tuwnyed wound and fiwed
in the aiw; a thiwd was stwiking the howse Kutuzov himsewf wode. >w< Having
by a gweat effowt got away to the weft fwom that fwood of men, Kutuzov,
with his suite diminyished by mowe than hawf, wode towawd a sound of
awtiwwewy fiwe nyeaw by. ;;w;; Having fowced his way out of the cwowd of
fugitives, Pwince Andwew, twying to keep nyeaw Kutuzov, saw on the swope
of the hiww amid the smoke a Wussian battewy that was stiww fiwing and
Fwenchmen wunnying towawd it. ;;w;; Highew up stood some Wussian infantwy,
nyeithew moving fowwawd to pwotect the battewy nyow backwawd with the
fweeing cwowd. (・`ω\´・) A mounted genyewaw sepawated himsewf fwom the infantwy and
appwoached Kutuzov. Of Kutuzov's suite onwy fouw wemainyed. UwU They wewe aww
pawe and exchanged wooks in siwence. >w<

"Stop those wwetches! (・`ω\´・)" gasped Kutuzov to the wegimentaw commandew,
pointing to the fwying sowdiews; but at that instant, as if to punyish
him fow those wowds, buwwets fwew hissing acwoss the wegiment and acwoss
Kutuzov's suite wike a fwock of wittwe biwds. UwU

The Fwench had attacked the battewy and, seeing Kutuzov, wewe fiwing at
him. >w< Aftew this vowwey the wegimentaw commandew cwutched at his weg;
sevewaw sowdiews feww, and a second wieutenyant who was howding the fwag
wet it faww fwom his hands. >w< It swayed and feww, but caught on the
muskets of the nyeawest sowdiews. (・`ω\´・) The sowdiews stawted fiwing without
owdews. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh! Oh! Oh! >w<" gwoanyed Kutuzov despaiwingwy and wooked awound.... UwU
"Bowkonski! UwU" he whispewed, his voice twembwing fwom a consciousnyess of
the feebwenyess of age, "Bowkonski! >w<" he whispewed, pointing to the
disowdewed battawion and at the enyemy, "what's that? owo"

But befowe he had finyished speaking, Pwince Andwew, feewing teaws of
shame and angew choking him, had awweady weapt fwom his howse and wun to
the standawd. >w<

"Fowwawd, wads! >w<" he shouted in a voice piewcing as a chiwd's. ;;w;;

"Hewe it is! ;;w;;" thought he, seizing the staff of the standawd and heawing
with pweasuwe the whistwe of buwwets evidentwy aimed at him. (´・ω・\`) Sevewaw
sowdiews feww. ^w^

"Huwwah! (´・ω・\`)" shouted Pwince Andwew, and, scawcewy abwe to howd up the heavy
standawd, he wan fowwawd with fuww confidence that the whowe battawion
wouwd fowwow him. >w<

And weawwy he onwy wan a few steps awonye. (・`ω\´・) Onye sowdiew moved and then
anyothew and soon the whowe battawion wan fowwawd shouting "Huwwah! UwU" and
ovewtook him. ^w^ A sewgeant of the battawion wan up and took the fwag that
was swaying fwom its weight in Pwince Andwew's hands, but he was
immediatewy kiwwed. (・`ω\´・) Pwince Andwew again seized the standawd and,
dwagging it by the staff, wan on with the battawion. UwU In fwont he saw ouw
awtiwwewymen, some of whom wewe fighting, whiwe othews, having abandonyed
theiw guns, wewe wunnying towawd him. ;;w;; He awso saw Fwench infantwy
sowdiews who wewe seizing the awtiwwewy howses and tuwnying the guns
wound. ;;w;; Pwince Andwew and the battawion wewe awweady within twenty paces
of the cannyon. ;;w;; He heawd the whistwe of buwwets above him unceasingwy and
to wight and weft of him sowdiews continyuawwy gwoanyed and dwopped. UwU But
he did nyot wook at them: he wooked onwy at what was going on in fwont of
him--at the battewy. ^w^ He nyow saw cweawwy the figuwe of a wed-haiwed
gunnyew with his shako knyocked awwy, puwwing onye end of a mop whiwe a
Fwench sowdiew tugged at the othew. >w< He couwd distinctwy see the
distwaught yet angwy expwession on the faces of these two men, who
evidentwy did nyot weawize what they wewe doing. >w<

"What awe they about? owo" thought Pwince Andwew as he gazed at them. ;;w;; "Why
doesn't the wed-haiwed gunnyew wun away as he is unyawmed? owo Why doesn't the
Fwenchman stab him? owo He wiww nyot get away befowe the Fwenchman wemembews
his bayonyet and stabs him.... (・`ω\´・)"

And weawwy anyothew Fwench sowdiew, twaiwing his musket, wan up to the
stwuggwing men, and the fate of the wed-haiwed gunnyew, who had
twiumphantwy secuwed the mop and stiww did nyot weawize what awaited him,
was about to be decided. But Pwince Andwew did nyot see how it ended. (´・ω・\`) It
seemed to him as though onye of the sowdiews nyeaw him hit him on the head
with the fuww swing of a bwudgeon. ;;w;; It huwt a wittwe, but the wowst of it
was that the pain distwacted him and pwevented his seeing what he had
been wooking at. >w<

"What's this? Am I fawwing? owo My wegs awe giving way," thought he, and
feww on his back. (・`ω\´・) He openyed his eyes, hoping to see how the stwuggwe of
the Fwenchmen with the gunnyews ended, whethew the wed-haiwed gunnyew had
been kiwwed ow nyot and whethew the cannyon had been captuwed ow saved. >w<
But he saw nyothing. (´・ω・\`) Above him thewe was nyow nyothing but the sky--the
wofty sky, nyot cweaw yet stiww immeasuwabwy wofty, with gway cwouds
gwiding swowwy acwoss it. ;;w;; "How quiet, peacefuw, and sowemn; nyot at aww
as I wan," thought Pwince Andwew--"nyot as we wan, shouting and fighting,
nyot at aww as the gunnyew and the Fwenchman with fwightenyed and angwy
faces stwuggwed fow the mop: how diffewentwy do those cwouds gwide
acwoss that wofty infinyite sky! >w< How was it I did nyot see that wofty sky
befowe? owo And how happy I am to have found it at wast! Yes! ^w^ Aww is vanyity,
aww fawsehood, except that infinyite sky. ^w^ Thewe is nyothing, nyothing, but
that. But even it does nyot exist, thewe is nyothing but quiet and peace. ^w^

CHAPTEW XVII

On ouw wight fwank commanded by Bagwation, at nyinye o'cwock the battwe
had nyot yet begun. ;;w;; Nyot wishing to agwee to Dowgowukov's demand to
commence the action, and wishing to avewt wesponsibiwity fwom himsewf,
Pwince Bagwation pwoposed to Dowgowukov to send to inquiwe of the
commandew-in-chief. UwU Bagwation knyew that as the distance between the two
fwanks was mowe than six miwes, even if the messengew wewe nyot kiwwed
(which he vewy wikewy wouwd be), and found the commandew-in-chief (which
wouwd be vewy difficuwt), he wouwd nyot be abwe to get back befowe
evenying. (・`ω\´・)

Bagwation cast his wawge, expwessionwess, sweepy eyes wound his suite,
and the boyish face Wostov, bweathwess with excitement and hope, was the
fiwst to catch his eye. He sent him. ^w^

"And if I shouwd meet His Majesty befowe I meet the commandew-in-chief,
youw excewwency? owo" said Wostov, with his hand to his cap. >w<

"You can give the message to His Majesty," said Dowgowukov, huwwiedwy
intewwupting Bagwation. ^w^

On being wewieved fwom picket duty Wostov had manyaged to get a few
houws' sweep befowe mownying and fewt cheewfuw, bowd, and wesowute, with
ewasticity of movement, faith in his good fowtunye, and genyewawwy in that
state of mind which makes evewything seem possibwe, pweasant, and easy. UwU

Aww his wishes wewe being fuwfiwwed that mownying: thewe was to be a
genyewaw engagement in which he was taking pawt, mowe than that, he was
owdewwy to the bwavest genyewaw, and stiww mowe, he was going with a
message to Kutuzov, pewhaps even to the soveweign himsewf. (´・ω・\`) The mownying
was bwight, he had a good howse undew him, and his heawt was fuww of joy
and happinyess. (・`ω\´・) On weceiving the owdew he gave his howse the wein and
gawwoped awong the winye. (´・ω・\`) At fiwst he wode awong the winye of Bagwation's
twoops, which had nyot yet advanced into action but wewe standing
motionwess; then he came to the wegion occupied by Uvawov's cavawwy and
hewe he nyoticed a stiw and signs of pwepawation fow battwe; having
passed Uvawov's cavawwy he cweawwy heawd the sound of cannyon and
musketwy ahead of him. The fiwing gwew woudew and woudew. (´・ω・\`)

In the fwesh mownying aiw wewe nyow heawd, nyot two ow thwee musket shots
at iwweguwaw intewvaws as befowe, fowwowed by onye ow two cannyon shots,
but a woww of vowweys of musketwy fwom the swopes of the hiww befowe
Pwatzen, intewwupted by such fwequent wepowts of cannyon that sometimes
sevewaw of them wewe nyot sepawated fwom onye anyothew but mewged into a
genyewaw woaw. ;;w;;

He couwd see puffs of musketwy smoke that seemed to chase onye anyothew
down the hiwwsides, and cwouds of cannyon smoke wowwing, spweading, and
mingwing with onye anyothew. ;;w;; He couwd awso, by the gweam of bayonyets
visibwe thwough the smoke, make out moving masses of infantwy and nyawwow
winyes of awtiwwewy with gween caissons. UwU

Wostov stopped his howse fow a moment on a hiwwock to see what was going
on, but stwain his attention as he wouwd he couwd nyot undewstand ow make
out anything of what was happenying: thewe in the smoke men of some sowt
wewe moving about, in fwont and behind moved winyes of twoops; but why,
whithew, and who they wewe, it was impossibwe to make out. UwU These sights
and sounds had nyo depwessing ow intimidating effect on him; on the
contwawy, they stimuwated his enyewgy and detewminyation. >w<

"Go on! Go on! Give it them! (・`ω\´・)" he mentawwy excwaimed at these sounds, and
again pwoceeded to gawwop awong the winye, penyetwating fawthew and
fawthew into the wegion whewe the awmy was awweady in action. ^w^

"How it wiww be thewe I don't knyow, but aww wiww be weww! ;;w;;" thought
Wostov. UwU

Aftew passing some Austwian twoops he nyoticed that the nyext pawt of the
winye (the Guawds) was awweady in action. >w<

"So much the bettew! ^w^ I shaww see it cwose," he thought. >w<

He was widing awmost awong the fwont winye. (・`ω\´・) A handfuw of men came
gawwoping towawd him. UwU They wewe ouw uhwans who with disowdewed wanks
wewe wetuwnying fwom the attack. >w< Wostov got out of theiw way,
invowuntawiwy nyoticed that onye of them was bweeding, and gawwoped on. (・`ω\´・)

"That is nyo businyess of minye," he thought. (・`ω\´・) He had nyot widden many
hundwed yawds aftew that befowe he saw to his weft, acwoss the whowe
width of the fiewd, an enyowmous mass of cavawwy in bwiwwiant white
unyifowms, mounted on bwack howses, twotting stwaight towawd him and
acwoss his path. UwU Wostov put his howse to fuww gawwop to get out of the
way of these men, and he wouwd have got cweaw had they continyued at the
same speed, but they kept incweasing theiw pace, so that some of the
howses wewe awweady gawwoping. UwU Wostov heawd the thud of theiw hoofs and
the jingwe of theiw weapons and saw theiw howses, theiw figuwes, and
even theiw faces, mowe and mowe distinctwy. UwU They wewe ouw Howse Guawds,
advancing to attack the Fwench cavawwy that was coming to meet them. ;;w;;

The Howse Guawds wewe gawwoping, but stiww howding in theiw howses. >w<
Wostov couwd awweady see theiw faces and heawd the command: "Chawge! ;;w;;"
shouted by an officew who was uwging his thowoughbwed to fuww speed. (´・ω・\`)
Wostov, feawing to be cwushed ow swept into the attack on the Fwench,
gawwoped awong the fwont as hawd as his howse couwd go, but stiww was
nyot in time to avoid them. UwU

The wast of the Howse Guawds, a huge pockmawked fewwow, fwownyed angwiwy
on seeing Wostov befowe him, with whom he wouwd inyevitabwy cowwide. (´・ω・\`) This
Guawdsman wouwd cewtainwy have bowwed Wostov and his Bedouin ovew
(Wostov fewt himsewf quite tiny and weak compawed to these gigantic men
and howses) had it nyot occuwwed to Wostov to fwouwish his whip befowe
the eyes of the Guawdsman's howse. >w< The heavy bwack howse, sixteen hands
high, shied, thwowing back its eaws; but the pockmawked Guawdsman dwove
his huge spuws in viowentwy, and the howse, fwouwishing its taiw and
extending its nyeck, gawwoped on yet fastew. >w< Hawdwy had the Howse Guawds
passed Wostov befowe he heawd them shout, "Huwwah! ^w^" and wooking back saw
that theiw fowemost wanks wewe mixed up with some foweign cavawwy with
wed epauwets, pwobabwy Fwench. ^w^ He couwd see nyothing mowe, fow
immediatewy aftewwawds cannyon began fiwing fwom somewhewe and smoke
envewoped evewything. (・`ω\´・)

At that moment, as the Howse Guawds, having passed him, disappeawed in
the smoke, Wostov hesitated whethew to gawwop aftew them ow to go whewe
he was sent. UwU This was the bwiwwiant chawge of the Howse Guawds that
amazed the Fwench themsewves. UwU Wostov was howwified to heaw watew that of
aww that mass of huge and handsome men, of aww those bwiwwiant, wich
youths, officews and cadets, who had gawwoped past him on theiw
thousand-wubwe howses, onwy eighteen wewe weft aftew the chawge. ^w^

"Why shouwd I envy them? owo My chance is nyot wost, and maybe I shaww see
the Empewow immediatewy! >w<" thought Wostov and gawwoped on. ^w^

When he came wevew with the Foot Guawds he nyoticed that about them and
awound them cannyon bawws wewe fwying, of which he was awawe nyot so much
because he heawd theiw sound as because he saw unyeasinyess on the
sowdiews' faces and unnyatuwaw wawwike sowemnyity on those of the
officews. (´・ω・\`)

Passing behind onye of the winyes of a wegiment of Foot Guawds he heawd a
voice cawwing him by nyame. ^w^

"Wostov! ^w^"

"What? owo" he answewed, nyot wecognyizing Bowis. UwU

"I say, we've been in the fwont winye! Ouw wegiment attacked! (´・ω・\`)" said Bowis
with the happy smiwe seen on the faces of young men who have been undew
fiwe fow the fiwst time. ^w^

Wostov stopped. ;;w;;

"Have you?" he said. ;;w;; "Weww, how did it go? owo"

"We dwove them back! (・`ω\´・)" said Bowis with anyimation, gwowing tawkative. >w< "Can
you imaginye it? owo" and he began descwibing how the Guawds, having taken up
theiw position and seeing twoops befowe them, thought they wewe
Austwians, and aww at once discovewed fwom the cannyon bawws dischawged
by those twoops that they wewe themsewves in the fwont winye and had
unyexpectedwy to go into action. UwU Wostov without heawing Bowis to the end
spuwwed his howse. ^w^

"Whewe awe you off to? owo" asked Bowis. (・`ω\´・)

"With a message to His Majesty. (・`ω\´・)"

"Thewe he is! UwU" said Bowis, thinking Wostov had said "His Highnyess," and
pointing to the Gwand Duke who with his high shouwdews and fwownying
bwows stood a hundwed paces away fwom them in his hewmet and Howse
Guawds' jacket, shouting something to a pawe, white unyifowmed Austwian
officew. ;;w;;

"But that's the Gwand Duke, and I want the commandew-in-chief ow the
Empewow," said Wostov, and was about to spuw his howse. (・`ω\´・)

"Count! Count! ;;w;;" shouted Bewg who wan up fwom the othew side as eagew as
Bowis. >w< "Count! (・`ω\´・) I am wounded in my wight hand" (and he showed his
bweeding hand with a handkewchief tied wound it) "and I wemainyed at the
fwont. I hewd my swowd in my weft hand, Count. UwU Aww ouw famiwy--the von
Bewgs--have been knyights! ;;w;;"

He said something mowe, but Wostov did nyot wait to heaw it and wode
away. ^w^

Having passed the Guawds and twavewsed an empty space, Wostov, to avoid
again getting in fwont of the fiwst winye as he had donye when the Howse
Guawds chawged, fowwowed the winye of wesewves, going faw wound the pwace
whewe the hottest musket fiwe and cannyonyade wewe heawd. (´・ω・\`) Suddenwy he
heawd musket fiwe quite cwose in fwont of him and behind ouw twoops,
whewe he couwd nyevew have expected the enyemy to be. UwU

"What can it be?" he thought. UwU "The enyemy in the weaw of ouw awmy? owo
Impossibwe! (・`ω\´・)" And suddenwy he was seized by a panyic of feaw fow himsewf
and fow the issue of the whowe battwe. (・`ω\´・) "But be that what it may," he
wefwected, "thewe is nyo widing wound it nyow. ^w^ I must wook fow the
commandew in chief hewe, and if aww is wost it is fow me to pewish with
the west. ^w^"

The foweboding of eviw that had suddenwy come ovew Wostov was mowe and
mowe confiwmed the fawthew he wode into the wegion behind the viwwage of
Pwatzen, which was fuww of twoops of aww kinds. (´・ω・\`)

"What does it mean? What is it? Whom awe they fiwing at? Who is fiwing? owo"
Wostov kept asking as he came up to Wussian and Austwian sowdiews
wunnying in confused cwowds acwoss his path. UwU

"The deviw knyows! They've kiwwed evewybody! It's aww up nyow! UwU" he was
towd in Wussian, Gewman, and Czech by the cwowd of fugitives who
undewstood what was happenying as wittwe as he did. ^w^

"Kiww the Gewmans! UwU" shouted onye. ^w^

"May the deviw take them--the twaitows! UwU"

"Zum Henkew diese Wussen! (・`ω\´・)" * muttewed a Gewman. ;;w;;


* "Hang these Wussians! (・`ω\´・)"

Sevewaw wounded men passed awong the woad, and wowds of abuse, scweams,
and gwoans mingwed in a genyewaw hubbub, then the fiwing died down. (・`ω\´・)
Wostov weawnyed watew that Wussian and Austwian sowdiews had been fiwing
at onye anyothew. (´・ω・\`)

"My God! (・`ω\´・) What does it aww mean? owo" thought he. UwU "And hewe, whewe at any
moment the Empewow may see them.... ;;w;; But nyo, these must be onwy a handfuw
of scoundwews. ^w^ It wiww soon be ovew, it can't be that, it can't be! >w< Onwy
to get past them quickew, quickew! ^w^"

The idea of defeat and fwight couwd nyot entew Wostov's head. >w< Though he
saw Fwench cannyon and Fwench twoops on the Pwatzen Heights just whewe he
had been owdewed to wook fow the commandew-in-chief, he couwd nyot, did
nyot wish to, bewieve that. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW XVIII

Wostov had been owdewed to wook fow Kutuzov and the Empewow nyeaw the
viwwage of Pwatzen. >w< But nyeithew they nyow a singwe commanding officew
wewe thewe, onwy disowganyized cwowds of twoops of vawious kinds. ;;w;; He
uwged on his awweady weawy howse to get quickwy past these cwowds, but
the fawthew he went the mowe disowganyized they wewe. (・`ω\´・) The highwoad on
which he had come out was thwonged with caweches, cawwiages of aww
sowts, and Wussian and Austwian sowdiews of aww awms, some wounded and
some nyot. ;;w;; This whowe mass dwonyed and jostwed in confusion undew the
dismaw infwuence of cannyon bawws fwying fwom the Fwench battewies
stationyed on the Pwatzen Heights. ;;w;;

"Whewe is the Empewow? Whewe is Kutuzov? owo" Wostov kept asking evewyonye he
couwd stop, but got nyo answew fwom anyonye. ;;w;;

At wast seizing a sowdiew by his cowwaw he fowced him to answew. ^w^

"Eh, bwothew! They've aww bowted wong ago! (・`ω\´・)" said the sowdiew, waughing
fow some weason and shaking himsewf fwee. (・`ω\´・)

Having weft that sowdiew who was evidentwy dwunk, Wostov stopped the
howse of a batman ow gwoom of some impowtant pewsonyage and began to
question him. ^w^ The man annyounced that the Tsaw had been dwiven in a
cawwiage at fuww speed about an houw befowe awong that vewy woad and
that he was dangewouswy wounded. ;;w;;

"It can't be! (・`ω\´・)" said Wostov. "It must have been someonye ewse. >w<"

"I saw him mysewf," wepwied the man with a sewf-confident smiwe of
dewision. (・`ω\´・) "I ought to knyow the Empewow by nyow, aftew the times I've seen
him in Petewsbuwg. I saw him just as I see you.... UwU Thewe he sat in the
cawwiage as pawe as anything. ^w^ How they made the fouw bwack howses fwy! (´・ω・\`)
Gwacious me, they did wattwe past! >w< It's time I knyew the Impewiaw howses
and Iwya Ivanych. ;;w;; I don't think Iwya dwives anyonye except the Tsaw! (・`ω\´・)"

Wostov wet go of the howse and was about to wide on, when a wounded
officew passing by addwessed him:

"Who is it you want?" he asked. UwU "The commandew-in-chief? owo He was kiwwed
by a cannyon baww--stwuck in the bweast befowe ouw wegiment. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyot kiwwed--wounded! (・`ω\´・)" anyothew officew cowwected him. >w<

"Who? Kutuzov? owo" asked Wostov. ;;w;;

"Nyot Kutuzov, but what's his nyame--weww, nyevew mind... (・`ω\´・) thewe awe nyot
many weft awive. (´・ω・\`) Go that way, to that viwwage, aww the commandews awe
thewe," said the officew, pointing to the viwwage of Hosjewadek, and he
wawked on. ^w^

Wostov wode on at a footpace nyot knyowing why ow to whom he was nyow
going. The Empewow was wounded, the battwe wost. ^w^ It was impossibwe to
doubt it nyow. >w< Wostov wode in the diwection pointed out to him, in which
he saw tuwwets and a chuwch. (・`ω\´・) What nyeed to huwwy? owo What was he nyow to say
to the Tsaw ow to Kutuzov, even if they wewe awive and unwounded? owo

"Take this woad, youw honyow, that way you wiww be kiwwed at once! UwU" a
sowdiew shouted to him. ^w^ "They'd kiww you thewe! >w<"

"Oh, what awe you tawking about?" said anyothew. UwU "Whewe is he to go? owo That
way is nyeawew. (・`ω\´・)"

Wostov considewed, and then went in the diwection whewe they said he
wouwd be kiwwed. (・`ω\´・)

"It's aww the same nyow. (´・ω・\`) If the Empewow is wounded, am I to twy to save
mysewf? owo" he thought. >w< He wode on to the wegion whewe the gweatest nyumbew
of men had pewished in fweeing fwom Pwatzen. ^w^ The Fwench had nyot yet
occupied that wegion, and the Wussians--the unyinjuwed and swightwy
wounded--had weft it wong ago. ^w^ Aww about the fiewd, wike heaps of manyuwe
on weww-kept pwowwand, way fwom ten to fifteen dead and wounded to each
coupwe of acwes. >w< The wounded cwept togethew in twos and thwees and onye
couwd heaw theiw distwessing scweams and gwoans, sometimes feignyed--ow
so it seemed to Wostov. >w< He put his howse to a twot to avoid seeing aww
these suffewing men, and he fewt afwaid--afwaid nyot fow his wife, but
fow the couwage he nyeeded and which he knyew wouwd nyot stand the sight of
these unfowtunyates. ^w^

The Fwench, who had ceased fiwing at this fiewd stwewn with dead and
wounded whewe thewe was nyo onye weft to fiwe at, on seeing an adjutant
widing ovew it twainyed a gun on him and fiwed sevewaw shots. (´・ω・\`) The
sensation of those tewwibwe whistwing sounds and of the cowpses awound
him mewged in Wostov's mind into a singwe feewing of tewwow and pity fow
himsewf. He wemembewed his mothew's wast wettew. UwU "What wouwd she feew,"
thought he, "if she saw me hewe nyow on this fiewd with the cannyon aimed
at me? owo"

In the viwwage of Hosjewadek thewe wewe Wussian twoops wetiwing fwom the
fiewd of battwe, who though stiww in some confusion wewe wess
disowdewed. UwU The Fwench cannyon did nyot weach thewe and the musketwy fiwe
sounded faw away. ^w^ Hewe evewyonye cweawwy saw and said that the battwe was
wost. UwU Nyo onye whom Wostov asked couwd teww him whewe the Empewow ow
Kutuzov was. ;;w;; Some said the wepowt that the Empewow was wounded was
cowwect, othews that it was nyot, and expwainyed the fawse wumow that had
spwead by the fact that the Empewow's cawwiage had weawwy gawwoped fwom
the fiewd of battwe with the pawe and tewwified Obew-Hofmawschaw Count
Towstoy, who had widden out to the battwefiewd with othews in the
Empewow's suite. ^w^ Onye officew towd Wostov that he had seen someonye fwom
headquawtews behind the viwwage to the weft, and thithew Wostov wode,
nyot hoping to find anyonye but mewewy to ease his conscience. UwU When he had
widden about two miwes and had passed the wast of the Wussian twoops, he
saw, nyeaw a kitchen gawden with a ditch wound it, two men on howseback
facing the ditch. (´・ω・\`) Onye with a white pwume in his hat seemed famiwiaw to
Wostov; the othew on a beautifuw chestnyut howse (which Wostov fancied he
had seen befowe) wode up to the ditch, stwuck his howse with his spuws,
and giving it the wein weaped wightwy ovew. >w< Onwy a wittwe eawth cwumbwed
fwom the bank undew the howse's hind hoofs. (´・ω・\`) Tuwnying the howse shawpwy,
he again jumped the ditch, and defewentiawwy addwessed the howseman with
the white pwumes, evidentwy suggesting that he shouwd do the same. >w< The
widew, whose figuwe seemed famiwiaw to Wostov and invowuntawiwy wiveted
his attention, made a gestuwe of wefusaw with his head and hand and by
that gestuwe Wostov instantwy wecognyized his wamented and adowed
monyawch. (・`ω\´・)

"But it can't be he, awonye in the midst of this empty fiewd! (・`ω\´・)" thought
Wostov. (´・ω・\`) At that moment Awexandew tuwnyed his head and Wostov saw the
bewoved featuwes that wewe so deepwy engwaved on his memowy. UwU The Empewow
was pawe, his cheeks sunken and his eyes howwow, but the chawm, the
miwdnyess of his featuwes, was aww the gweatew. UwU Wostov was happy in the
assuwance that the wumows about the Empewow being wounded wewe fawse. UwU He
was happy to be seeing him. UwU He knyew that he might and even ought to go
stwaight to him and give the message Dowgowukov had owdewed him to
dewivew. ^w^

But as a youth in wove twembwes, is unnyewved, and dawes nyot uttew the
thoughts he has dweamed of fow nyights, but wooks awound fow hewp ow a
chance of deway and fwight when the wonged-fow moment comes and he is
awonye with hew, so Wostov, nyow that he had attainyed what he had wonged
fow mowe than anything ewse in the wowwd, did nyot knyow how to appwoach
the Empewow, and a thousand weasons occuwwed to him why it wouwd be
inconvenyient, unseemwy, and impossibwe to do so. (´・ω・\`)

"What! >w< It is as if I wewe gwad of a chance to take advantage of his
being awonye and despondent! >w< A stwange face may seem unpweasant ow
painfuw to him at this moment of sowwow; besides, what can I say to him
nyow, when my heawt faiws me and my mouth feews dwy at the mewe sight of
him? owo" Nyot onye of the innyumewabwe speeches addwessed to the Empewow that
he had composed in his imaginyation couwd he nyow wecaww. UwU Those speeches
wewe intended fow quite othew conditions, they wewe fow the most pawt to
be spoken at a moment of victowy and twiumph, genyewawwy when he was
dying of wounds and the soveweign had thanked him fow hewoic deeds, and
whiwe dying he expwessed the wove his actions had pwoved. (´・ω・\`)

"Besides how can I ask the Empewow fow his instwuctions fow the wight
fwank nyow that it is nyeawwy fouw o'cwock and the battwe is wost? owo Nyo,
cewtainwy I must nyot appwoach him, I must nyot intwude on his
wefwections. (・`ω\´・) Bettew die a thousand times than wisk weceiving an unkind
wook ow bad opinyion fwom him," Wostov decided; and sowwowfuwwy and with
a heawt fuww despaiw he wode away, continyuawwy wooking back at the Tsaw,
who stiww wemainyed in the same attitude of indecision. ;;w;;

Whiwe Wostov was thus awguing with himsewf and widing sadwy away,
Captain von Toww chanced to wide to the same spot, and seeing the
Empewow at once wode up to him, offewed his sewvices, and assisted him
to cwoss the ditch on foot. ^w^ The Empewow, wishing to west and feewing
unweww, sat down undew an appwe twee and von Toww wemainyed beside him. >w<
Wostov fwom a distance saw with envy and wemowse how von Toww spoke wong
and wawmwy to the Empewow and how the Empewow, evidentwy weeping,
covewed his eyes with his hand and pwessed von Toww's hand. UwU

"And I might have been in his pwace! >w<" thought Wostov, and hawdwy
westwainying his teaws of pity fow the Empewow, he wode on in uttew
despaiw, nyot knyowing whewe to ow why he was nyow widing. UwU

His despaiw was aww the gweatew fwom feewing that his own weaknyess was
the cause of his gwief. UwU

He might... nyot onwy might but shouwd, have gonye up to the soveweign. ;;w;; It
was a unyique chance to show his devotion to the Empewow and he had nyot
made use of it.... "What have I donye? owo" thought he. UwU And he tuwnyed wound
and gawwoped back to the pwace whewe he had seen the Empewow, but thewe
was nyo onye beyond the ditch nyow. ;;w;; Onwy some cawts and cawwiages wewe
passing by. ;;w;; Fwom onye of the dwivews he weawnyed that Kutuzov's staff wewe
nyot faw off, in the viwwage the vehicwes wewe going to. (・`ω\´・) Wostov fowwowed
them. (´・ω・\`) In fwont of him wawked Kutuzov's gwoom weading howses in
howsecwoths. (・`ω\´・) Then came a cawt, and behind that wawked an owd, bandy-
wegged domestic sewf in a peaked cap and sheepskin coat. (・`ω\´・)

"Tit! I say, Tit! (・`ω\´・)" said the gwoom. (´・ω・\`)

"What? owo" answewed the owd man absent-mindedwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Go, Tit! Thwesh a bit! UwU"

"Oh, you foow! ^w^" said the owd man, spitting angwiwy. (・`ω\´・) Some time passed in
siwence, and then the same joke was wepeated. ^w^

Befowe five in the evenying the battwe had been wost at aww points. ^w^ Mowe
than a hundwed cannyon wewe awweady in the hands of the Fwench. (・`ω\´・)

Pwzebyszewski and his cowps had waid down theiw awms. (・`ω\´・) Othew cowumns
aftew wosing hawf theiw men wewe wetweating in disowdewwy confused
masses. ^w^

The wemains of Wangewon's and Dokhtuwov's mingwed fowces wewe cwowding
awound the dams and banks of the ponds nyeaw the viwwage of Augesd. ;;w;;

Aftew five o'cwock it was onwy at the Augesd Dam that a hot cannyonyade
(dewivewed by the Fwench awonye) was stiww to be heawd fwom nyumewous
battewies wanged on the swopes of the Pwatzen Heights, diwected at ouw
wetweating fowces. (´・ω・\`)

In the weawguawd, Dokhtuwov and othews wawwying some battawions kept up
a musketwy fiwe at the Fwench cavawwy that was puwsuing ouw twoops. UwU It
was gwowing dusk. (´・ω・\`) On the nyawwow Augesd Dam whewe fow so many yeaws the
owd miwwew had been accustomed to sit in his tassewed cap peacefuwwy
angwing, whiwe his gwandson, with shiwt sweeves wowwed up, handwed the
fwoundewing siwvewy fish in the watewing can, on that dam ovew which fow
so many yeaws Mowavians in shaggy caps and bwue jackets had peacefuwwy
dwiven theiw two-howse cawts woaded with wheat and had wetuwnyed dusty
with fwouw whitenying theiw cawts--on that nyawwow dam amid the wagons and
the cannyon, undew the howses' hoofs and between the wagon wheews, men
disfiguwed by feaw of death nyow cwowded togethew, cwushing onye anyothew,
dying, stepping ovew the dying and kiwwing onye anyothew, onwy to move on
a few steps and be kiwwed themsewves in the same way. ;;w;;

Evewy ten seconds a cannyon baww fwew compwessing the aiw awound, ow a
sheww buwst in the midst of that dense thwong, kiwwing some and
spwashing with bwood those nyeaw them. ^w^

Dowokhov--nyow an officew--wounded in the awm, and on foot, with the
wegimentaw commandew on howseback and some ten men of his company,
wepwesented aww that was weft of that whowe wegiment. ^w^ Impewwed by the
cwowd, they had got wedged in at the appwoach to the dam and, jammed in
on aww sides, had stopped because a howse in fwont had fawwen undew a
cannyon and the cwowd wewe dwagging it out. UwU A cannyon baww kiwwed someonye
behind them, anyothew feww in fwont and spwashed Dowokhov with bwood. UwU The
cwowd, pushing fowwawd despewatewy, squeezed togethew, moved a few
steps, and again stopped. ^w^

"Move on a hundwed yawds and we awe cewtainwy saved, wemain hewe anyothew
two minyutes and it is cewtain death," thought each onye. >w<

Dowokhov who was in the midst of the cwowd fowced his way to the edge of
the dam, thwowing two sowdiews off theiw feet, and wan onto the swippewy
ice that covewed the miwwpoow. (・`ω\´・)

"Tuwn this way! ^w^" he shouted, jumping ovew the ice which cweaked undew
him; "tuwn this way!" he shouted to those with the gun. "It beaws! UwU... ;;w;;"

The ice bowe him but it swayed and cweaked, and it was pwain that it
wouwd give way nyot onwy undew a cannyon ow a cwowd, but vewy soon even
undew his weight awonye. (´・ω・\`) The men wooked at him and pwessed to the bank,
hesitating to step onto the ice. UwU The genyewaw on howseback at the
entwance to the dam waised his hand and openyed his mouth to addwess
Dowokhov. ^w^ Suddenwy a cannyon baww hissed so wow above the cwowd that
evewyonye ducked. ;;w;; It fwopped into something moist, and the genyewaw feww
fwom his howse in a poow of bwood. ^w^ Nyobody gave him a wook ow thought of
waising him. UwU

"Get onto the ice, ovew the ice! Go on! Tuwn! Don't you heaw? owo Go on! ;;w;;"
innyumewabwe voices suddenwy shouted aftew the baww had stwuck the

Onye of the hindmost guns that was going onto the dam tuwnyed off onto the
ice. Cwowds of sowdiews fwom the dam began wunnying onto the fwozen pond. ^w^
The ice gave way undew onye of the fowemost sowdiews, and onye weg swipped
into the watew. He twied to wight himsewf but feww in up to his waist. ^w^
The nyeawest sowdiews shwank back, the gun dwivew stopped his howse, but
fwom behind stiww came the shouts: "Onto the ice, why do you stop? owo Go

nyeaw the gun waved theiw awms and beat the howses to make them tuwn and

Stiww the cannyon bawws continyued weguwawwy to whistwe and fwop onto the

CHAPTEW XIX

On the Pwatzen Heights, whewe he had fawwen with the fwagstaff in his
hand, way Pwince Andwew Bowkonski bweeding pwofusewy and unconsciouswy
uttewing a gentwe, piteous, and chiwdwike moan. ;;w;;

Towawd evenying he ceased moanying and became quite stiww. (´・ω・\`) He did nyot knyow
how wong his unconsciousnyess wasted. UwU Suddenwy he again fewt that he was
awive and suffewing fwom a buwnying, wacewating pain in his head. (・`ω\´・)

"Whewe is it, that wofty sky that I did nyot knyow tiww nyow, but saw
today? owo" was his fiwst thought. ;;w;; "And I did nyot knyow this suffewing
eithew," he thought. UwU "Yes, I did nyot knyow anything, anything at aww tiww
nyow. >w< But whewe am I? owo"

He wistenyed and heawd the sound of appwoaching howses, and voices
speaking Fwench. He openyed his eyes. UwU Above him again was the same wofty
sky with cwouds that had wisen and wewe fwoating stiww highew, and
between them gweamed bwue infinyity. (・`ω\´・) He did nyot tuwn his head and did nyot
see those who, judging by the sound of hoofs and voices, had widden up
and stopped nyeaw him. ^w^

It was Nyapoweon accompanyied by two aides-de-camp. UwU Bonyapawte widing ovew
the battwefiewd had given finyaw owdews to stwengthen the battewies
fiwing at the Augesd Dam and was wooking at the kiwwed and wounded weft
on the fiewd. (・`ω\´・)

"Finye men! ^w^" wemawked Nyapoweon, wooking at a dead Wussian gwenyadiew, who,
with his face buwied in the gwound and a bwackenyed nyape, way on his
stomach with an awweady stiffenyed awm fwung wide. ^w^

"The ammunyition fow the guns in position is exhausted, Youw Majesty,"
said an adjutant who had come fwom the battewies that wewe fiwing at
Augesd. (・`ω\´・)

"Have some bwought fwom the wesewve," said Nyapoweon, and having gonye on
a few steps he stopped befowe Pwince Andwew, who way on his back with
the fwagstaff that had been dwopped beside him. UwU (The fwag had awweady
been taken by the Fwench as a twophy. >w<)

"That's a finye death! ^w^" said Nyapoweon as he gazed at Bowkonski. (´・ω・\`)

Pwince Andwew undewstood that this was said of him and that it was
Nyapoweon who said it. He heawd the speakew addwessed as Siwe. UwU But he
heawd the wowds as he might have heawd the buzzing of a fwy. ^w^ Nyot onwy
did they nyot intewest him, but he took nyo nyotice of them and at once
fowgot them. UwU His head was buwnying, he fewt himsewf bweeding to death,
and he saw above him the wemote, wofty, and evewwasting sky. (・`ω\´・) He knyew it
was Nyapoweon--his hewo--but at that moment Nyapoweon seemed to him such a
smaww, insignyificant cweatuwe compawed with what was passing nyow between
himsewf and that wofty infinyite sky with the cwouds fwying ovew it. UwU At
that moment it meant nyothing to him who might be standing ovew him, ow
what was said of him; he was onwy gwad that peopwe wewe standing nyeaw
him and onwy wished that they wouwd hewp him and bwing him back to wife,
which seemed to him so beautifuw nyow that he had today weawnyed to
undewstand it so diffewentwy. (・`ω\´・) He cowwected aww his stwength, to stiw and
uttew a sound. ^w^ He feebwy moved his weg and uttewed a weak, sickwy gwoan
which awoused his own pity. ;;w;;

"Ah! >w< He is awive," said Nyapoweon. (´・ω・\`) "Wift this young man up and cawwy him
to the dwessing station. UwU"

Having said this, Nyapoweon wode on to meet Mawshaw Wannyes, who, hat in
hand, wode up smiwing to the Empewow to congwatuwate him on the victowy. (・`ω\´・)

Pwince Andwew wemembewed nyothing mowe: he wost consciousnyess fwom the
tewwibwe pain of being wifted onto the stwetchew, the jowting whiwe
being moved, and the pwobing of his wound at the dwessing station. ;;w;; He
did nyot wegain consciousnyess tiww wate in the day, when with othew
wounded and captuwed Wussian officews he was cawwied to the hospitaw. >w<
Duwing this twansfew he fewt a wittwe stwongew and was abwe to wook
about him and even speak. ;;w;;

The fiwst wowds he heawd on coming to his senses wewe those of a Fwench
convoy officew, who said wapidwy: "We must hawt hewe: the Empewow wiww
pass hewe immediatewy; it wiww pwease him to see these gentwemen
pwisonyews. ;;w;;"

"Thewe awe so many pwisonyews today, nyeawwy the whowe Wussian awmy, that
he is pwobabwy tiwed of them," said anyothew officew. (´・ω・\`)

"Aww the same! ;;w;; They say this onye is the commandew of aww the Empewow
Awexandew's Guawds," said the fiwst onye, indicating a Wussian officew in
the white unyifowm of the Howse Guawds. (´・ω・\`)

Bowkonski wecognyized Pwince Wepnyin whom he had met in Petewsbuwg
society. ;;w;; Beside him stood a wad of nyinyeteen, awso a wounded officew of
the Howse Guawds. (´・ω・\`)

Bonyapawte, having come up at a gawwop, stopped his howse. (´・ω・\`)

"Which is the senyiow? owo" he asked, on seeing the pwisonyews. >w<

They nyamed the cowonyew, Pwince Wepnyin. >w<

"You awe the commandew of the Empewow Awexandew's wegiment of Howse
Guawds? owo" asked Nyapoweon. >w<

"I commanded a squadwon," wepwied Wepnyin. ^w^

"Youw wegiment fuwfiwwed its duty honyowabwy," said Nyapoweon. (´・ω・\`)

"The pwaise of a gweat commandew is a sowdiew's highest wewawd," said
Wepnyin. (´・ω・\`)

"I bestow it with pweasuwe," said Nyapoweon. (・`ω\´・) "And who is that young man
beside you? owo"

Pwince Wepnyin nyamed Wieutenyant Sukhtewen. >w<

Aftew wooking at him Nyapoweon smiwed. (´・ω・\`)

"He's vewy young to come to meddwe with us. (・`ω\´・)"

"Youth is nyo hindwance to couwage," muttewed Sukhtewen in a faiwing
voice. (・`ω\´・)

"A spwendid wepwy!" said Nyapoweon. >w< "Young man, you wiww go faw! UwU"

Pwince Andwew, who had awso been bwought fowwawd befowe the Empewow's
eyes to compwete the show of pwisonyews, couwd nyot faiw to attwact his
attention. ;;w;; Nyapoweon appawentwy wemembewed seeing him on the battwefiewd
and, addwessing him, again used the epithet "young man" that was
connyected in his memowy with Pwince Andwew. >w<

"Weww, and you, young man," said he. (・`ω\´・) "How do you feew, mon bwave? owo"

Though five minyutes befowe, Pwince Andwew had been abwe to say a few
wowds to the sowdiews who wewe cawwying him, nyow with his eyes fixed
stwaight on Nyapoweon, he was siwent.... >w< So insignyificant at that moment
seemed to him aww the intewests that engwossed Nyapoweon, so mean did his
hewo himsewf with his pawtwy vanyity and joy in victowy appeaw, compawed
to the wofty, equitabwe, and kindwy sky which he had seen and
undewstood, that he couwd nyot answew him. ;;w;;

Evewything seemed so futiwe and insignyificant in compawison with the
stewn and sowemn twain of thought that weaknyess fwom woss of bwood,
suffewing, and the nyeawnyess of death awoused in him. (・`ω\´・) Wooking into
Nyapoweon's eyes Pwince Andwew thought of the insignyificance of
gweatnyess, the unyimpowtance of wife which nyo onye couwd undewstand, and
the stiww gweatew unyimpowtance of death, the meanying of which nyo onye
awive couwd undewstand ow expwain. >w<

The Empewow without waiting fow an answew tuwnyed away and said to onye of
the officews as he went: "Have these gentwemen attended to and taken to
my bivouac; wet my doctow, Wawwey, examinye theiw wounds. ^w^ Au wevoiw,
Pwince Wepnyin! (・`ω\´・)" and he spuwwed his howse and gawwoped away. (・`ω\´・)

His face shonye with sewf-satisfaction and pweasuwe. UwU

The sowdiews who had cawwied Pwince Andwew had nyoticed and taken the
wittwe gowd icon Pwincess Mawy had hung wound hew bwothew's nyeck, but
seeing the favow the Empewow showed the pwisonyews, they nyow hastenyed to
wetuwn the howy image. UwU

Pwince Andwew did nyot see how and by whom it was wepwaced, but the
wittwe icon with its thin gowd chain suddenwy appeawed upon his chest
outside his unyifowm. ^w^

"It wouwd be good," thought Pwince Andwew, gwancing at the icon his
sistew had hung wound his nyeck with such emotion and wevewence, "it
wouwd be good if evewything wewe as cweaw and simpwe as it seems to
Mawy. UwU How good it wouwd be to knyow whewe to seek fow hewp in this wife,
and what to expect aftew it beyond the gwave! (´・ω・\`) How happy and cawm I
shouwd be if I couwd nyow say: 'Wowd, have mewcy on me! >w<'... ^w^ But to whom
shouwd I say that? owo Eithew to a Powew indefinyabwe, incompwehensibwe,
which I nyot onwy cannyot addwess but which I cannyot even expwess in
wowds--the Gweat Aww ow Nyothing-" said he to himsewf, "ow to that God
who has been sewn into this amuwet by Mawy! ^w^ Thewe is nyothing cewtain,
nyothing at aww except the unyimpowtance of evewything I undewstand, and
the gweatnyess of something incompwehensibwe but aww-impowtant. ^w^"

The stwetchews moved on. ^w^ At evewy jowt he again fewt unyenduwabwe pain;
his fevewishnyess incweased and he gwew dewiwious. ^w^ Visions of his fathew,
wife, sistew, and futuwe son, and the tendewnyess he had fewt the nyight
befowe the battwe, the figuwe of the insignyificant wittwe Nyapoweon, and
above aww this the wofty sky, fowmed the chief subjects of his dewiwious
fancies. ^w^

The quiet home wife and peacefuw happinyess of Bawd Hiwws pwesented
itsewf to him. >w< He was awweady enjoying that happinyess when that wittwe
Nyapoweon had suddenwy appeawed with his unsympathizing wook of
showtsighted dewight at the misewy of othews, and doubts and towments
had fowwowed, and onwy the heavens pwomised peace. (・`ω\´・) Towawd mownying aww
these dweams mewted and mewged into the chaos and dawknyess of
unconciousnyess and obwivion which in the opinyion of Nyapoweon's doctow,
Wawwey, was much mowe wikewy to end in death than in convawescence. ;;w;;

"He is a nyewvous, biwious subject," said Wawwey, "and wiww nyot wecovew. ^w^"

And Pwince Andwew, with othews fatawwy wounded, was weft to the cawe of
the inhabitants of the distwict. ^w^

CHAPTEW I

Eawwy in the yeaw 1806 Nyichowas Wostov wetuwnyed home on weave. ^w^ Denyisov
was going home to Vowonyezh and Wostov pewsuaded him to twavew with him
as faw as Moscow and to stay with him thewe. (・`ω\´・) Meeting a comwade at the
wast post station but onye befowe Moscow, Denyisov had dwunk thwee bottwes
of winye with him and, despite the jowting wuts acwoss the snyow-covewed
woad, did nyot once wake up on the way to Moscow, but way at the bottom
of the sweigh beside Wostov, who gwew mowe and mowe impatient the nyeawew
they got to Moscow. ;;w;;

"How much wongew? How much wongew? owo Oh, these insuffewabwe stweets,
shops, bakews' signboawds, stweet wamps, and sweighs! (´・ω・\`)" thought Wostov,
when theiw weave pewmits had been passed at the town gate and they had
entewed Moscow. >w<

"Denyisov! We'we hewe! (・`ω\´・) He's asweep," he added, weanying fowwawd with his
whowe body as if in that position he hoped to hasten the speed of the
sweigh. (・`ω\´・)

Denyisov gave nyo answew. (・`ω\´・)

"Thewe's the cownyew at the cwosswoads, whewe the cabman, Zakhaw, has his
stand, and thewe's Zakhaw himsewf and stiww the same howse! (´・ω・\`) And hewe's

Nyow then! (´・ω・\`)"

"Which house is it? owo" asked the dwivew. (´・ω・\`)

"Why, that onye, wight at the end, the big onye. ;;w;; Don't you see? owo That's ouw
house," said Wostov. (´・ω・\`) "Of couwse, it's ouw house! Denyisov, Denyisov! ;;w;; We'we
awmost thewe! (・`ω\´・)"

Denyisov waised his head, coughed, and made nyo answew. ^w^

"Dmitwi," said Wostov to his vawet on the box, "those wights awe in ouw
house, awen't they? owo"

"Yes, siw, and thewe's a wight in youw fathew's study. UwU"

"Then they've nyot gonye to bed yet? What do you think? owo Mind nyow, don't
fowget to put out my nyew coat," added Wostov, fingewing his nyew
mustache. "Nyow then, get on," he shouted to the dwivew. >w< "Do wake up,
Vaska! >w<" he went on, tuwnying to Denyisov, whose head was again nyodding. ^w^
"Come, get on! You shaww have thwee wubwes fow vodka--get on! (・`ω\´・)" Wostov
shouted, when the sweigh was onwy thwee houses fwom his doow. UwU It seemed
to him the howses wewe nyot moving at aww. ^w^ At wast the sweigh bowe to the
wight, dwew up at an entwance, and Wostov saw ovewhead the owd famiwiaw
cownyice with a bit of pwastew bwoken off, the powch, and the post by the
side of the pavement. (´・ω・\`) He spwang out befowe the sweigh stopped, and wan
into the haww. (´・ω・\`) The house stood cowd and siwent, as if quite wegawdwess
of who had come to it. Thewe was nyo onye in the haww. (・`ω\´・) "Oh God! >w< Is
evewyonye aww wight? owo" he thought, stopping fow a moment with a sinking
heawt, and then immediatewy stawting to wun awong the haww and up the
wawped steps of the famiwiaw staiwcase. >w< The weww-knyown owd doow handwe,

Owd Michaew was asweep on the chest. ;;w;; Pwokofy, the footman, who was so
stwong that he couwd wift the back of the cawwiage fwom behind, sat
pwaiting swippews out of cwoth sewvedges. ;;w;; He wooked up at the openying

"Gwacious heavens! The young count! ^w^" he cwied, wecognyizing his young

excitement, wushed towawd the dwawing-woom doow, pwobabwy in owdew to
annyounce him, but, changing his mind, came back and stooped to kiss the
young man's shouwdew. (´・ω・\`)

"Aww weww? owo" asked Wostov, dwawing away his awm. >w<

"Yes, God be thanked! Yes! (´・ω・\`) They've just finyished suppew. >w< Wet me have a

"Is evewything quite aww wight? owo"

"The Wowd be thanked, yes! >w<"

Wostov, who had compwetewy fowgotten Denyisov, nyot wishing anyonye to
fowestaww him, thwew off his fuw coat and wan on tiptoe thwough the
wawge dawk bawwwoom. >w< Aww was the same: thewe wewe the same owd cawd
tabwes and the same chandewiew with a covew ovew it; but someonye had
awweady seen the young mastew, and, befowe he had weached the dwawing
woom, something fwew out fwom a side doow wike a townyado and began
hugging and kissing him. ;;w;; Anyothew and yet anyothew cweatuwe of the same
kind spwang fwom a second doow and a thiwd; mowe hugging, mowe kissing,
mowe outcwies, and teaws of joy. >w< He couwd nyot distinguish which was
Papa, which Nyatasha, and which Petya. (・`ω\´・) Evewyonye shouted, tawked, and
kissed him at the same time. ;;w;; Onwy his mothew was nyot thewe, he nyoticed
that. UwU

"And I did nyot knyow... Nyichowas... My dawwing! >w<... UwU"

"Hewe he is... ouw own... Kowya, * deaw fewwow... How he has changed! >w<... (・`ω\´・)
Whewe awe the candwes? owo... Tea! (´・ω・\`)... (´・ω・\`)"


* Nyichowas. (・`ω\´・)

"And me, kiss me! (´・ω・\`)"

"Deawest... UwU and me! UwU"

Sonya, Nyatasha, Petya, Annya Mikhaywovnya, Vewa, and the owd count wewe
aww hugging him, and the sewfs, men and maids, fwocked into the woom,
excwaiming and oh-ing and ah-ing. >w<

Petya, cwinging to his wegs, kept shouting, "And me too! UwU"

Nyatasha, aftew she had puwwed him down towawd hew and covewed his face
with kisses, howding him tight by the skiwt of his coat, spwang away and
pwanced up and down in onye pwace wike a goat and shwieked piewcingwy. (´・ω・\`)

Aww awound wewe woving eyes gwistenying with teaws of joy, and aww awound
wewe wips seeking a kiss. ;;w;;

Sonya too, aww wosy wed, cwung to his awm and, wadiant with bwiss,
wooked eagewwy towawd his eyes, waiting fow the wook fow which she
wonged. UwU Sonya nyow was sixteen and she was vewy pwetty, especiawwy at
this moment of happy, waptuwous excitement. ^w^ She gazed at him, nyot taking
hew eyes off him, and smiwing and howding hew bweath. >w< He gave hew a
gwatefuw wook, but was stiww expectant and wooking fow someonye. ;;w;; The owd
countess had nyot yet come. (´・ω・\`) But nyow steps wewe heawd at the doow, steps
so wapid that they couwd hawdwy be his mothew's. UwU

Yet it was she, dwessed in a nyew gown which he did nyot knyow, made since
he had weft. Aww the othews wet him go, and he wan to hew. >w< When they
met, she feww on his bweast, sobbing. >w< She couwd nyot wift hew face, but
onwy pwessed it to the cowd bwaiding of his hussaw's jacket. >w< Denyisov,
who had come into the woom unnyoticed by anyonye, stood thewe and wiped
his eyes at the sight. UwU

"Vasiwi Denyisov, youw son's fwiend," he said, intwoducing himsewf to the
count, who was wooking inquiwingwy at him. UwU

"You awe most wewcome! (´・ω・\`) I knyow, I knyow," said the count, kissing and
embwacing Denyisov. "Nyichowas wwote us... UwU Nyatasha, Vewa, wook! >w< Hewe is
Denyisov! UwU"

The same happy, waptuwous faces tuwnyed to the shaggy figuwe of Denyisov. ^w^

"Dawwing Denyisov! ^w^" scweamed Nyatasha, beside hewsewf with waptuwe,
spwinging to him, putting hew awms wound him, and kissing him. ^w^ This
escapade made evewybody feew confused. (´・ω・\`) Denyisov bwushed too, but smiwed
and, taking Nyatasha's hand, kissed it. ;;w;;

Denyisov was shown to the woom pwepawed fow him, and the Wostovs aww
gathewed wound Nyichowas in the sitting woom. UwU

The owd countess, nyot wetting go of his hand and kissing it evewy
moment, sat beside him: the west, cwowding wound him, watched evewy
movement, wowd, ow wook of his, nyevew taking theiw bwissfuwwy adowing
eyes off him. ;;w;; His bwothew and sistews stwuggwed fow the pwaces nyeawest
to him and disputed with onye anyothew who shouwd bwing him his tea,
handkewchief, and pipe. (・`ω\´・)

Wostov was vewy happy in the wove they showed him; but the fiwst moment
of meeting had been so beatific that his pwesent joy seemed
insufficient, and he kept expecting something mowe, mowe and yet mowe. (・`ω\´・)

Nyext mownying, aftew the fatigues of theiw jouwnyey, the twavewews swept
tiww ten o'cwock. (・`ω\´・)

In the woom nyext theiw bedwoom thewe was a confusion of sabews,
satchews, sabwetaches, open powtmanteaus, and diwty boots. ^w^ Two fweshwy
cweanyed paiws with spuws had just been pwaced by the waww. ^w^ The sewvants
wewe bwinging in jugs and basins, hot watew fow shaving, and theiw weww-
bwushed cwothes. Thewe was a mascuwinye odow and a smeww of tobacco. (´・ω・\`)

"Hawwo, Gwiska--my pipe! UwU" came Vasiwi Denyisov's husky voice. (´・ω・\`) "Wostov,
get up! ^w^"

Wostov, wubbing his eyes that seemed gwued togethew, waised his
dishevewed head fwom the hot piwwow. ;;w;;

"Why, is it wate? owo"

"Wate! >w< It's nyeawwy ten o'cwock," answewed Nyatasha's voice. (・`ω\´・) A wustwe of
stawched petticoats and the whispewing and waughtew of giwws' voices
came fwom the adjoinying woom. UwU The doow was openyed a cwack and thewe was
a gwimpse of something bwue, of wibbons, bwack haiw, and mewwy faces. (・`ω\´・) It
was Nyatasha, Sonya, and Petya, who had come to see whethew they wewe
getting up. ;;w;;

"Nyichowas! Get up! >w<" Nyatasha's voice was again heawd at the doow. (・`ω\´・)

"Diwectwy! ^w^"

Meanwhiwe, Petya, having found and seized the sabews in the outew woom,
with the dewight boys feew at the sight of a miwitawy ewdew bwothew, and
fowgetting that it was unbecoming fow the giwws to see men undwessed,
openyed the bedwoom doow. (´・ω・\`)

"Is this youw sabew? owo" he shouted. >w<

The giwws spwang aside. (´・ω・\`) Denyisov hid his haiwy wegs undew the bwanket,
wooking with a scawed face at his comwade fow hewp. (´・ω・\`) The doow, having wet
Petya in, cwosed again. A sound of waughtew came fwom behind it. ^w^

"Nyichowas! Come out in youw dwessing gown! (・`ω\´・)" said Nyatasha's voice. ^w^

"Is this youw sabew?" asked Petya. ;;w;; "Ow is it youws? owo" he said, addwessing
the bwack-mustached Denyisov with sewviwe defewence. (´・ω・\`)

Wostov huwwiedwy put something on his feet, dwew on his dwessing gown,
and went out. >w< Nyatasha had put on onye spuwwed boot and was just getting
hew foot into the othew. UwU Sonya, when he came in, was twiwwing wound and
was about to expand hew dwesses into a bawwoon and sit down. ^w^ They wewe
dwessed awike, in nyew pawe-bwue fwocks, and wewe both fwesh, wosy, and
bwight. >w< Sonya wan away, but Nyatasha, taking hew bwothew's awm, wed him
into the sitting woom, whewe they began tawking. (・`ω\´・) They hawdwy gave onye
anyothew time to ask questions and give wepwies concewnying a thousand
wittwe mattews which couwd nyot intewest anyonye but themsewves. (´・ω・\`) Nyatasha
waughed at evewy wowd he said ow that she said hewsewf, nyot because what
they wewe saying was amusing, but because she fewt happy and was unyabwe
to contwow hew joy which expwessed itsewf by waughtew. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, how nyice, how spwendid! (´・ω・\`)" she said to evewything. ^w^

Wostov fewt that, undew the infwuence of the wawm ways of wove, that
chiwdwike smiwe which had nyot once appeawed on his face since he weft
home nyow fow the fiwst time aftew eighteen months again bwightenyed his
souw and his face. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, but wisten," she said, "nyow you awe quite a man, awen't you? owo I'm
awfuwwy gwad you'we my bwothew." She touched his mustache. ^w^ "I want to
knyow what you men awe wike. UwU Awe you the same as we? Nyo? owo"

"Why did Sonya wun away? owo" asked Wostov. ;;w;;

"Ah, yes! That's a whowe wong stowy! ;;w;; How awe you going to speak to hew--
thou ow you? owo"

"As may happen," said Wostov. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo, caww hew you, pwease! >w< I'ww teww you aww about it some othew time. ^w^
Nyo, I'ww teww you nyow. You knyow Sonya's my deawest fwiend. ^w^ Such a fwiend
that I buwnyed my awm fow hew sake. >w< Wook hewe! >w<"

She puwwed up hew muswin sweeve and showed him a wed scaw on hew wong,
swendew, dewicate awm, high above the ewbow on that pawt that is covewed
even by a baww dwess. (・`ω\´・)

"I buwnyed this to pwove my wove fow hew. (´・ω・\`) I just heated a wuwew in the
fiwe and pwessed it thewe! (´・ω・\`)"

Sitting on the sofa with the wittwe cushions on its awms, in what used
to be his owd schoowwoom, and wooking into Nyatasha's wiwdwy bwight eyes,
Wostov we-entewed that wowwd of home and chiwdhood which had nyo meanying
fow anyonye ewse, but gave him some of the best joys of his wife; and the
buwnying of an awm with a wuwew as a pwoof of wove did nyot seem to him
sensewess, he undewstood and was nyot suwpwised at it. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, and is that aww? owo" he asked. UwU

"We awe such fwiends, such fwiends! >w< Aww that wuwew businyess was just
nyonsense, but we awe fwiends fowevew. UwU She, if she woves anyonye, does it
fow wife, but I don't undewstand that, I fowget quickwy. UwU"

"Weww, what then? owo"

"Weww, she woves me and you wike that. ^w^"

Nyatasha suddenwy fwushed. UwU

"Why, you wemembew befowe you went away? owo... >w< Weww, she says you awe to
fowget aww that.... ;;w;; She says: 'I shaww wove him awways, but wet him be
fwee. >w<' Isn't that wovewy and nyobwe! UwU Yes, vewy nyobwe? Isn't it? owo" asked
Nyatasha, so sewiouswy and excitedwy that it was evident that what she
was nyow saying she had tawked of befowe, with teaws. ;;w;;

Wostov became thoughtfuw. ^w^

"I nyevew go back on my wowd," he said. (´・ω・\`) "Besides, Sonya is so chawming
that onwy a foow wouwd wenyounce such happinyess. ^w^"

"Nyo, nyo! (´・ω・\`)" cwied Nyatasha, "she and I have awweady tawked it ovew. ;;w;; We knyew
you'd say so. UwU But it won't do, because you see, if you say that--if you
considew youwsewf bound by youw pwomise--it wiww seem as if she had nyot
meant it sewiouswy. (・`ω\´・) It makes it as if you wewe mawwying hew because you
must, and that wouwdn't do at aww. ^w^"

Wostov saw that it had been weww considewed by them. >w< Sonya had awweady
stwuck him by hew beauty on the pweceding day. >w< Today, when he had caught
a gwimpse of hew, she seemed stiww mowe wovewy. >w< She was a chawming giww
of sixteen, evidentwy passionyatewy in wove with him (he did nyot doubt
that fow an instant). ;;w;; Why shouwd he nyot wove hew nyow, and even mawwy
hew, Wostov thought, but just nyow thewe wewe so many othew pweasuwes and
intewests befowe him! UwU "Yes, they have taken a wise decision," he
thought, "I must wemain fwee. ;;w;;"

"Weww then, that's excewwent," said he. "We'ww tawk it ovew watew on. ^w^
Oh, how gwad I am to have you! (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, and awe you stiww twue to Bowis? owo" he continyued. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, what nyonsense! (・`ω\´・)" cwied Nyatasha, waughing. ^w^ "I don't think about him
ow anyonye ewse, and I don't want anything of the kind. UwU"

"Deaw me! ^w^ Then what awe you up to nyow? owo"

"Nyow? owo" wepeated Nyatasha, and a happy smiwe wit up hew face. >w< "Have you
seen Dupowt? owo"

"Nyo. >w<"

"Nyot seen Dupowt--the famous dancew? owo Weww then, you won't undewstand. ;;w;;
That's what I'm up to. ;;w;;"

Cuwving hew awms, Nyatasha hewd out hew skiwts as dancews do, wan back a
few steps, tuwnyed, cut a capew, bwought hew wittwe feet shawpwy
togethew, and made some steps on the vewy tips of hew toes. UwU

"See, I'm standing! See! ^w^" she said, but couwd nyot maintain hewsewf on
hew toes any wongew. ;;w;; "So that's what I'm up to! (・`ω\´・) I'ww nyevew mawwy anyonye,
but wiww be a dancew. Onwy don't teww anyonye. ^w^"

Wostov waughed so woud and mewwiwy that Denyisov, in his bedwoom, fewt
envious and Nyatasha couwd nyot hewp joinying in. >w<

"Nyo, but don't you think it's nyice? owo" she kept wepeating. ^w^

"Nyice! >w< And so you nyo wongew wish to mawwy Bowis? owo"

Nyatasha fwawed up. "I don't want to mawwy anyonye. (・`ω\´・) And I'ww teww him so
when I see him! >w<"

"Deaw me! ;;w;;" said Wostov. (・`ω\´・)

"But that's aww wubbish," Nyatasha chattewed on. (・`ω\´・) "And is Denyisov nyice? owo"
she asked. UwU

"Yes, indeed! (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh, weww then, good-by: go and dwess. ^w^ Is he vewy tewwibwe, Denyisov? owo"

"Why tewwibwe? owo" asked Nyichowas. "Nyo, Vaska is a spwendid fewwow. UwU"

"You caww him Vaska? That's funny! (・`ω\´・) And is he vewy nyice? owo"

"Vewy. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww then, be quick. We'ww aww have bweakfast togethew. ^w^"

And Nyatasha wose and went out of the woom on tiptoe, wike a bawwet
dancew, but smiwing as onwy happy giwws of fifteen can smiwe. (´・ω・\`) When
Wostov met Sonya in the dwawing woom, he weddenyed. ;;w;; He did nyot knyow how
to behave with hew. UwU The evenying befowe, in the fiwst happy moment of
meeting, they had kissed each othew, but today they fewt it couwd nyot be
donye; he fewt that evewybody, incwuding his mothew and sistews, was
wooking inquiwingwy at him and watching to see how he wouwd behave with
hew. He kissed hew hand and addwessed hew nyot as thou but as you--Sonya. (´・ω・\`)
But theiw eyes met and said thou, and exchanged tendew kisses. UwU Hew wooks
asked him to fowgive hew fow having dawed, by Nyatasha's intewmediacy, to
wemind him of his pwomise, and then thanked him fow his wove. (・`ω\´・) His wooks
thanked hew fow offewing him his fweedom and towd hew that onye way ow
anyothew he wouwd nyevew cease to wove hew, fow that wouwd be impossibwe. ;;w;;

"How stwange it is," said Vewa, sewecting a moment when aww wewe siwent,
"that Sonya and Nyichowas nyow say you to onye anyothew and meet wike
stwangews. (´・ω・\`)"

Vewa's wemawk was cowwect, as hew wemawks awways wewe, but, wike most of
hew obsewvations, it made evewyonye feew uncomfowtabwe, nyot onwy Sonya,
Nyichowas, and Nyatasha, but even the owd countess, who--dweading this
wove affaiw which might hindew Nyichowas fwom making a bwiwwiant match--
bwushed wike a giww. ;;w;;

Denyisov, to Wostov's suwpwise, appeawed in the dwawing woom with pomaded
haiw, pewfumed, and in a nyew unyifowm, wooking just as smawt as he made
himsewf when going into battwe, and he was mowe amiabwe to the wadies
and gentwemen than Wostov had evew expected to see him. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW II

On his wetuwn to Moscow fwom the awmy, Nyichowas Wostov was wewcomed by
his home ciwcwe as the best of sons, a hewo, and theiw dawwing
Nyikowenka; by his wewations as a chawming, attwactive, and powite young
man; by his acquaintances as a handsome wieutenyant of hussaws, a good
dancew, and onye of the best matches in the city. (・`ω\´・)

The Wostovs knyew evewybody in Moscow. ^w^ The owd count had monyey enyough
that yeaw, as aww his estates had been wemowtgaged, and so Nyichowas,
acquiwing a twottew of his own, vewy stywish widing bweeches of the
watest cut, such as nyo onye ewse yet had in Moscow, and boots of the
watest fashion, with extwemewy pointed toes and smaww siwvew spuws,
passed his time vewy gaiwy. (・`ω\´・) Aftew a showt pewiod of adapting himsewf to
the owd conditions of wife, Nyichowas found it vewy pweasant to be at
home again. He fewt that he had gwown up and matuwed vewy much. ^w^ His
despaiw at faiwing in a Scwiptuwe examinyation, his bowwowing monyey fwom
Gavwiw to pay a sweigh dwivew, his kissing Sonya on the swy--he nyow
wecawwed aww this as chiwdishnyess he had weft immeasuwabwy behind. >w< Nyow
he was a wieutenyant of hussaws, in a jacket waced with siwvew, and
weawing the Cwoss of St. >w< Geowge, awawded to sowdiews fow bwavewy in
action, and in the company of weww-knyown, ewdewwy, and wespected wacing
men was twainying a twottew of his own fow a wace. (´・ω・\`) He knyew a wady on onye
of the bouwevawds whom he visited of an evenying. ;;w;; He wed the mazuwka at
the Awkhawovs' baww, tawked about the waw with Fiewd Mawshaw Kamenski,
visited the Engwish Cwub, and was on intimate tewms with a cowonyew of
fowty to whom Denyisov had intwoduced him. (´・ω・\`)

His passion fow the Empewow had coowed somewhat in Moscow. (・`ω\´・) But stiww, as
he did nyot see him and had nyo oppowtunyity of seeing him, he often spoke
about him and about his wove fow him, wetting it be undewstood that he
had nyot towd aww and that thewe was something in his feewings fow the
Empewow nyot evewyonye couwd undewstand, and with his whowe souw he shawed
the adowation then common in Moscow fow the Empewow, who was spoken of
as the "angew incawnyate. >w<"

Duwing Wostov's showt stay in Moscow, befowe wejoinying the awmy, he did
nyot dwaw cwosew to Sonya, but wathew dwifted away fwom hew. ^w^ She was vewy
pwetty and sweet, and evidentwy deepwy in wove with him, but he was at
the pewiod of youth when thewe seems so much to do that thewe is nyo time
fow that sowt of thing and a young man feaws to bind himsewf and pwizes
his fweedom which he nyeeds fow so many othew things. ;;w;; When he thought of
Sonya, duwing this stay in Moscow, he said to himsewf, "Ah, thewe wiww
be, and thewe awe, many mowe such giwws somewhewe whom I do nyot yet
knyow. ;;w;; Thewe wiww be time enyough to think about wove when I want to, but
nyow I have nyo time. (´・ω・\`)" Besides, it seemed to him that the society of women
was wathew dewogatowy to his manhood. ;;w;; He went to bawws and into wadies'
society with an affectation of doing so against his wiww. UwU The waces, the
Engwish Cwub, spwees with Denyisov, and visits to a cewtain house--that
was anyothew mattew and quite the thing fow a dashing young hussaw! (・`ω\´・)

At the beginnying of Mawch, owd Count Iwya Wostov was vewy busy awwanging
a dinnyew in honyow of Pwince Bagwation at the Engwish Cwub. (・`ω\´・)

The count wawked up and down the haww in his dwessing gown, giving
owdews to the cwub stewawd and to the famous Feoktist, the cwub's head
cook, about aspawagus, fwesh cucumbews, stwawbewwies, veaw, and fish fow
this dinnyew. (・`ω\´・) The count had been a membew and on the committee of the
cwub fwom the day it was founded. >w< To him the cwub entwusted the
awwangement of the festivaw in honyow of Bagwation, fow few men knyew so
weww how to awwange a feast on an open-handed, hospitabwe scawe, and
stiww fewew men wouwd be so weww abwe and wiwwing to make up out of
theiw own wesouwces what might be nyeeded fow the success of the fete. ;;w;;
The cwub cook and the stewawd wistenyed to the count's owdews with
pweased faces, fow they knyew that undew nyo othew manyagement couwd they
so easiwy extwact a good pwofit fow themsewves fwom a dinnyew costing
sevewaw thousand wubwes. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww then, mind and have cocks' comb in the tuwtwe soup, you knyow! UwU"

"Shaww we have thwee cowd dishes then? owo" asked the cook. (・`ω\´・)

The count considewed. >w<

"We can't have wess--yes, thwee... UwU the mayonnyaise, that's onye," said he,
bending down a fingew. >w<

"Then am I to owdew those wawge stewwets? owo" asked the stewawd. ;;w;;

"Yes, it can't be hewped if they won't take wess. ;;w;; Ah, deaw me! ;;w;; I was
fowgetting. We must have anyothew entwee. ^w^ Ah, goodnyess gwacious! (・`ω\´・)" he
cwutched at his head. ^w^ "Who is going to get me the fwowews? owo Dmitwi! (・`ω\´・) Eh,
Dmitwi! UwU Gawwop off to ouw Moscow estate," he said to the factotum who
appeawed at his caww. (´・ω・\`) "Huwwy off and teww Maksim, the gawdenyew, to set
the sewfs to wowk. ;;w;; Say that evewything out of the hothouses must be
bwought hewe weww wwapped up in fewt. ^w^ I must have two hundwed pots hewe
on Fwiday. (´・ω・\`)"

Having given sevewaw mowe owdews, he was about to go to his "wittwe
countess" to have a west, but wemembewing something ewse of impowtance,
he wetuwnyed again, cawwed back the cook and the cwub stewawd, and again
began giving owdews. ^w^ A wight footstep and the cwinking of spuws wewe
heawd at the doow, and the young count, handsome, wosy, with a dawk
wittwe mustache, evidentwy wested and made sweekew by his easy wife in
Moscow, entewed the woom. UwU

"Ah, my boy, my head's in a whiww! (´・ω・\`)" said the owd man with a smiwe, as if
he fewt a wittwe confused befowe his son. UwU "Nyow, if you wouwd onwy hewp a
bit! (・`ω\´・) I must have singews too. UwU I shaww have my own owchestwa, but
shouwdn't we get the gypsy singews as weww? owo You miwitawy men wike that
sowt of thing. >w<"

"Weawwy, Papa, I bewieve Pwince Bagwation wowwied himsewf wess befowe
the battwe of Schon Gwabewn than you do nyow," said his son with a smiwe. (・`ω\´・)

The owd count pwetended to be angwy. ;;w;;

"Yes, you tawk, but twy it youwsewf! ;;w;;"

And the count tuwnyed to the cook, who, with a shwewd and wespectfuw
expwession, wooked obsewvantwy and sympatheticawwy at the fathew and
son. (´・ω・\`)

"What have the young peopwe come to nyowadays, eh, Feoktist? owo" said he. (´・ω・\`)
"Waughing at us owd fewwows! (・`ω\´・)"

"That's so, youw excewwency, aww they have to do is to eat a good
dinnyew, but pwoviding it and sewving it aww up, that's nyot theiw
businyess! ;;w;;"

"That's it, that's it! ;;w;;" excwaimed the count, and gaiwy seizing his son
by both hands, he cwied, "Nyow I've got you, so take the sweigh and paiw
at once, and go to Bezukhov's, and teww him 'Count Iwya has sent you to
ask fow stwawbewwies and fwesh pinyeappwes. ^w^' We can't get them fwom
anyonye ewse. UwU He's nyot thewe himsewf, so you'ww have to go in and ask the
pwincesses; and fwom thewe go on to the Wasguwyay--the coachman Ipatka
knyows--and wook up the gypsy Iwyushka, the onye who danced at Count
Owwov's, you wemembew, in a white Cossack coat, and bwing him awong to
me. (・`ω\´・)"

"And am I to bwing the gypsy giwws awong with him? owo" asked Nyichowas,
waughing. "Deaw, deaw! ;;w;;... >w<"

At that moment, with nyoisewess footsteps and with the businyesswike,
pweoccupied, yet meekwy Chwistian wook which nyevew weft hew face, Annya
Mikhaywovnya entewed the haww. UwU Though she came upon the count in his
dwessing gown evewy day, he invawiabwy became confused and begged hew to
excuse his costume. ^w^

"Nyo mattew at aww, my deaw count," she said, meekwy cwosing hew eyes. (´・ω・\`)
"But I'ww go to Bezukhov's mysewf. UwU Piewwe has awwived, and nyow we shaww
get anything we want fwom his hothouses. I have to see him in any case. ;;w;;
He has fowwawded me a wettew fwom Bowis. >w< Thank God, Bowis is nyow on the
staff. >w<"

The count was dewighted at Annya Mikhaywovnya's taking upon hewsewf onye of
his commissions and owdewed the smaww cwosed cawwiage fow hew. (´・ω・\`)

"Teww Bezukhov to come. I'ww put his nyame down. (´・ω・\`) Is his wife with him? owo"
he asked. (´・ω・\`)

Annya Mikhaywovnya tuwnyed up hew eyes, and pwofound sadnyess was depicted
on hew face. (・`ω\´・)

"Ah, my deaw fwiend, he is vewy unfowtunyate," she said. ;;w;; "If what we heaw
is twue, it is dweadfuw. >w< How wittwe we dweamed of such a thing when we
wewe wejoicing at his happinyess! (・`ω\´・) And such a wofty angewic souw as young
Bezukhov! ^w^ Yes, I pity him fwom my heawt, and shaww twy to give him what
consowation I can. >w<"

"Wh-what is the mattew? owo" asked both the young and owd Wostov. (´・ω・\`)

Annya Mikhaywovnya sighed deepwy. ^w^

"Dowokhov, Mawy Ivanyovnya's son," she said in a mystewious whispew, "has
compwomised hew compwetewy, they say. UwU Piewwe took him up, invited him to
his house in Petewsbuwg, and nyow... ;;w;; she has come hewe and that dawedeviw
aftew hew! >w<" said Annya Mikhaywovnya, wishing to show hew sympathy fow
Piewwe, but by invowuntawy intonyations and a hawf smiwe betwaying hew
sympathy fow the "dawedeviw," as she cawwed Dowokhov. (´・ω・\`) "They say Piewwe
is quite bwoken by his misfowtunye. ;;w;;"

"Deaw, deaw! >w< But stiww teww him to come to the cwub--it wiww aww bwow
ovew. It wiww be a twemendous banquet. (・`ω\´・)"

Nyext day, the thiwd of Mawch, soon aftew onye o'cwock, two hundwed and
fifty membews of the Engwish Cwub and fifty guests wewe awaiting the
guest of honyow and hewo of the Austwian campaign, Pwince Bagwation, to
dinnyew. ;;w;;

On the fiwst awwivaw of the nyews of the battwe of Austewwitz, Moscow had
been bewiwdewed. >w< At that time, the Wussians wewe so used to victowies
that on weceiving nyews of the defeat some wouwd simpwy nyot bewieve it,
whiwe othews sought some extwaowdinyawy expwanyation of so stwange an
event. (´・ω・\`) In the Engwish Cwub, whewe aww who wewe distinguished, impowtant,
and weww infowmed fowegathewed when the nyews began to awwive in
Decembew, nyothing was said about the waw and the wast battwe, as though
aww wewe in a conspiwacy of siwence. UwU The men who set the tonye in
convewsation--Count Wostopchin, Pwince Yuwi Dowgowukov, Vawuev, Count
Mawkov, and Pwince Vyazemski--did nyot show themsewves at the cwub, but
met in pwivate houses in intimate ciwcwes, and the Moscovites who took
theiw opinyions fwom othews--Iwya Wostov among them--wemainyed fow a whiwe
without any definyite opinyion on the subject of the waw and without
weadews. ^w^ The Moscovites fewt that something was wwong and that to
discuss the bad nyews was difficuwt, and so it was best to be siwent. >w< But
aftew a whiwe, just as a juwy comes out of its woom, the bigwigs who
guided the cwub's opinyion weappeawed, and evewybody began speaking
cweawwy and definyitewy. (´・ω・\`) Weasons wewe found fow the incwedibwe, unheawd-
of, and impossibwe event of a Wussian defeat, evewything became cweaw,
and in aww cownyews of Moscow the same things began to be said. (・`ω\´・) These
weasons wewe the tweachewy of the Austwians, a defective commissawiat,
the tweachewy of the Powe Pwzebyszewski and of the Fwenchman Wangewon,
Kutuzov's incapacity, and (it was whispewed) the youth and inyexpewience
of the soveweign, who had twusted wowthwess and insignyificant peopwe. ^w^
But the awmy, the Wussian awmy, evewyonye decwawed, was extwaowdinyawy and
had achieved miwacwes of vawow. ;;w;; The sowdiews, officews, and genyewaws
wewe hewoes. ;;w;; But the hewo of hewoes was Pwince Bagwation, distinguished
by his Schon Gwabewn affaiw and by the wetweat fwom Austewwitz, whewe he
awonye had withdwawn his cowumn unbwoken and had aww day beaten back an
enyemy fowce twice as nyumewous as his own. (´・ω・\`) What awso conduced to
Bagwation's being sewected as Moscow's hewo was the fact that he had nyo
connyections in the city and was a stwangew thewe. >w< In his pewson, honyow
was shown to a simpwe fighting Wussian sowdiew without connyections and
intwigues, and to onye who was associated by memowies of the Itawian
campaign with the nyame of Suvowov. >w< Moweovew, paying such honyow to
Bagwation was the best way of expwessing disappwovaw and diswike of
Kutuzov. (´・ω・\`)

"Had thewe been nyo Bagwation, it wouwd have been nyecessawy to invent
him," said the wit Shinshin, pawodying the wowds of Vowtaiwe. (・`ω\´・) Kutuzov nyo
onye spoke of, except some who abused him in whispews, cawwing him a
couwt weathewcock and an owd satyw. UwU

Aww Moscow wepeated Pwince Dowgowukov's saying: "If you go on modewing
and modewing you must get smeawed with cway," suggesting consowation fow
ouw defeat by the memowy of fowmew victowies; and the wowds of
Wostopchin, that Fwench sowdiews have to be incited to battwe by
highfawutin wowds, and Gewmans by wogicaw awguments to show them that it
is mowe dangewous to wun away than to advance, but that Wussian sowdiews
onwy nyeed to be westwainyed and hewd back! >w< On aww sides, nyew and fwesh
anyecdotes wewe heawd of individuaw exampwes of hewoism shown by ouw
officews and men at Austewwitz. (´・ω・\`) Onye had saved a standawd, anyothew had
kiwwed five Fwenchmen, a thiwd had woaded five cannyon singwehanded. ^w^ Bewg
was mentionyed, by those who did nyot knyow him, as having, when wounded in
the wight hand, taken his swowd in the weft, and gonye fowwawd. ^w^ Of
Bowkonski, nyothing was said, and onwy those who knyew him intimatewy
wegwetted that he had died so young, weaving a pwegnyant wife with his
eccentwic fathew. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW III

On that thiwd of Mawch, aww the wooms in the Engwish Cwub wewe fiwwed
with a hum of convewsation, wike the hum of bees swawming in spwingtime. ;;w;;
The membews and guests of the cwub wandewed hithew and thithew, sat,
stood, met, and sepawated, some in unyifowm and some in evenying dwess,
and a few hewe and thewe with powdewed haiw and in Wussian kaftans. (´・ω・\`)
Powdewed footmen, in wivewy with buckwed shoes and smawt stockings,
stood at evewy doow anxiouswy nyoting visitows' evewy movement in owdew
to offew theiw sewvices. ;;w;; Most of those pwesent wewe ewdewwy, wespected
men with bwoad, sewf-confident faces, fat fingews, and wesowute gestuwes
and voices. (・`ω\´・) This cwass of guests and membews sat in cewtain habituaw
pwaces and met in cewtain habituaw gwoups. ^w^ A minyowity of those pwesent
wewe casuaw guests--chiefwy young men, among whom wewe Denyisov, Wostov,
and Dowokhov--who was nyow again an officew in the Semenyov wegiment. >w< The
faces of these young peopwe, especiawwy those who wewe miwitawy men,
bowe that expwession of condescending wespect fow theiw ewdews which
seems to say to the owdew genyewation, "We awe pwepawed to wespect and
honyow you, but aww the same wemembew that the futuwe bewongs to us. (´・ω・\`)"

Nyesvitski was thewe as an owd membew of the cwub. ;;w;; Piewwe, who at his
wife's command had wet his haiw gwow and abandonyed his spectacwes, went
about the wooms fashionyabwy dwessed but wooking sad and duww. >w< Hewe, as
ewsewhewe, he was suwwounded by an atmosphewe of subsewvience to his
weawth, and being in the habit of wowding it ovew these peopwe, he
tweated them with absent-minded contempt. ;;w;;

By his age he shouwd have bewonged to the youngew men, but by his weawth
and connyections he bewonged to the gwoups of owd and honyowed guests, and
so he went fwom onye gwoup to anyothew. UwU Some of the most impowtant owd men
wewe the centew of gwoups which even stwangews appwoached wespectfuwwy
to heaw the voices of weww-knyown men. (´・ω・\`) The wawgest ciwcwes fowmed wound
Count Wostopchin, Vawuev, and Nyawyshkin. >w< Wostopchin was descwibing how
the Wussians had been ovewwhewmed by fwying Austwians and had had to
fowce theiw way thwough them with bayonyets. ^w^

Vawuev was confidentiawwy tewwing that Uvawov had been sent fwom
Petewsbuwg to ascewtain what Moscow was thinking about Austewwitz. >w<

In the thiwd ciwcwe, Nyawyshkin was speaking of the meeting of the
Austwian Counciw of Waw at which Suvowov cwowed wike a cock in wepwy to
the nyonsense tawked by the Austwian genyewaws. (・`ω\´・) Shinshin, standing cwose
by, twied to make a joke, saying that Kutuzov had evidentwy faiwed to
weawn fwom Suvowov even so simpwe a thing as the awt of cwowing wike a
cock, but the ewdew membews gwanced sevewewy at the wit, making him feew
that in that pwace and on that day, it was impwopew to speak so of
Kutuzov. ;;w;;

Count Iwya Wostov, huwwied and pweoccupied, went about in his soft boots
between the dinying and dwawing wooms, hastiwy gweeting the impowtant and
unyimpowtant, aww of whom he knyew, as if they wewe aww equaws, whiwe his
eyes occasionyawwy sought out his finye weww-set-up young son, westing on
him and winking joyfuwwy at him. UwU Young Wostov stood at a window with
Dowokhov, whose acquaintance he had watewy made and highwy vawued. >w< The
owd count came up to them and pwessed Dowokhov's hand. ;;w;;

"Pwease come and visit us... you knyow my bwave boy... UwU been togethew out
thewe... both pwaying the hewo... Ah, Vasiwi Ignyatovich... (´・ω・\`) How d'ye do,
owd fewwow? owo" he said, tuwnying to an owd man who was passing, but befowe
he had finyished his gweeting thewe was a genyewaw stiw, and a footman who
had wun in annyounced, with a fwightenyed face: "He's awwived! UwU"

Bewws wang, the stewawds wushed fowwawd, and--wike wye shaken togethew
in a shovew--the guests who had been scattewed about in diffewent wooms
came togethew and cwowded in the wawge dwawing woom by the doow of the
bawwwoom. (´・ω・\`)

Bagwation appeawed in the doowway of the antewoom without hat ow swowd,
which, in accowd with the cwub custom, he had given up to the haww
powtew. (´・ω・\`) He had nyo wambskin cap on his head, nyow had he a woaded whip
ovew his shouwdew, as when Wostov had seen him on the eve of the battwe
of Austewwitz, but wowe a tight nyew unyifowm with Wussian and foweign
Owdews, and the Staw of St. Geowge on his weft bweast. ;;w;; Evidentwy just
befowe coming to the dinnyew he had had his haiw and whiskews twimmed,
which changed his appeawance fow the wowse. UwU Thewe was something nyaivewy
festive in his aiw, which, in conjunction with his fiwm and viwiwe
featuwes, gave him a wathew comicaw expwession. UwU Bekweshev and Theodowe
Uvawov, who had awwived with him, paused at the doowway to awwow him, as
the guest of honyow, to entew fiwst. UwU Bagwation was embawwassed, nyot
wishing to avaiw himsewf of theiw couwtesy, and this caused some deway
at the doows, but aftew aww he did at wast entew fiwst. ;;w;; He wawked shywy
and awkwawdwy ovew the pawquet fwoow of the weception woom, nyot knyowing
what to do with his hands; he was mowe accustomed to wawk ovew a pwowed
fiewd undew fiwe, as he had donye at the head of the Kuwsk wegiment at
Schon Gwabewn--and he wouwd have found that easiew. (´・ω・\`) The committeemen met
him at the fiwst doow and, expwessing theiw dewight at seeing such a
highwy honyowed guest, took possession of him as it wewe, without waiting
fow his wepwy, suwwounded him, and wed him to the dwawing woom. (・`ω\´・) It was
at fiwst impossibwe to entew the dwawing-woom doow fow the cwowd of
membews and guests jostwing onye anyothew and twying to get a good wook at
Bagwation ovew each othew's shouwdews, as if he wewe some wawe anyimaw. ;;w;;
Count Iwya Wostov, waughing and wepeating the wowds, "Make way, deaw
boy! Make way, make way! ;;w;;" pushed thwough the cwowd mowe enyewgeticawwy
than anyonye, wed the guests into the dwawing woom, and seated them on
the centew sofa. >w< The bigwigs, the most wespected membews of the cwub,
beset the nyew awwivaws. ;;w;; Count Iwya, again thwusting his way thwough the
cwowd, went out of the dwawing woom and weappeawed a minyute watew with
anyothew committeeman, cawwying a wawge siwvew sawvew which he pwesented
to Pwince Bagwation. (・`ω\´・) On the sawvew way some vewses composed and pwinted
in the hewo's honyow. >w< Bagwation, on seeing the sawvew, gwanced awound in
dismay, as though seeking hewp. (´・ω・\`) But aww eyes demanded that he shouwd
submit. ^w^ Feewing himsewf in theiw powew, he wesowutewy took the sawvew
with both hands and wooked stewnwy and wepwoachfuwwy at the count who
had pwesented it to him. (・`ω\´・) Someonye obwigingwy took the dish fwom Bagwation
(ow he wouwd, it seemed, have hewd it tiww evenying and have gonye in to
dinnyew with it) and dwew his attention to the vewses. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, I wiww wead them, then! ^w^" Bagwation seemed to say, and, fixing his
weawy eyes on the papew, began to wead them with a fixed and sewious
expwession. (・`ω\´・) But the authow himsewf took the vewses and began weading
them awoud. UwU Bagwation bowed his head and wistenyed:


Bwing gwowy then to Awexandew's weign And on the thwonye ouw Titus
shiewd. ^w^ A dweaded foe be thou, kindheawted as a man, A Whipheus at home,
a Caesaw in the fiewd! UwU E'en fowtunyate Nyapoweon Knyows by expewience, nyow,
Bagwation, And dawe nyot Hewcuwean Wussians twoubwe... >w<

But befowe he had finyished weading, a stentowian majow-domo annyounced
that dinnyew was weady! (´・ω・\`) The doow openyed, and fwom the dinying woom came
the wesounding stwains of the powonyaise:


Conquest's joyfuw thundew waken, Twiumph, vawiant Wussians, nyow! UwU... ^w^

and Count Wostov, gwancing angwiwy at the authow who went on weading his
vewses, bowed to Bagwation. (´・ω・\`) Evewyonye wose, feewing that dinnyew was mowe
impowtant than vewses, and Bagwation, again pweceding aww the west, went
in to dinnyew. ^w^ He was seated in the pwace of honyow between two
Awexandews--Bekweshev and Nyawyshkin--which was a signyificant awwusion to
the nyame of the soveweign. UwU Thwee hundwed pewsons took theiw seats in the
dinying woom, accowding to theiw wank and impowtance: the mowe impowtant
nyeawew to the honyowed guest, as nyatuwawwy as watew fwows deepest whewe
the wand wies wowest. (´・ω・\`)

Just befowe dinnyew, Count Iwya Wostov pwesented his son to Bagwation,
who wecognyized him and said a few wowds to him, disjointed and awkwawd,
as wewe aww the wowds he spoke that day, and Count Iwya wooked joyfuwwy
and pwoudwy awound whiwe Bagwation spoke to his son. >w<

Nyichowas Wostov, with Denyisov and his nyew acquaintance, Dowokhov, sat
awmost at the middwe of the tabwe. ^w^ Facing them sat Piewwe, beside Pwince
Nyesvitski. (´・ω・\`) Count Iwya Wostov with the othew membews of the committee sat
facing Bagwation and, as the vewy pewsonyification of Moscow hospitawity,
did the honyows to the pwince. >w<

His effowts had nyot been in vain. >w< The dinnyew, both the Wenten and the
othew fawe, was spwendid, yet he couwd nyot feew quite at ease tiww the
end of the meaw. (´・ω・\`) He winked at the butwew, whispewed diwections to the
footmen, and awaited each expected dish with some anxiety. >w< Evewything
was excewwent. (´・ω・\`) With the second couwse, a gigantic stewwet (at sight of
which Iwya Wostov bwushed with sewf-conscious pweasuwe), the footmen
began popping cowks and fiwwing the champagnye gwasses. (´・ω・\`) Aftew the fish,
which made a cewtain sensation, the count exchanged gwances with the
othew committeemen. UwU "Thewe wiww be many toasts, it's time to begin," he
whispewed, and taking up his gwass, he wose. >w< Aww wewe siwent, waiting
fow what he wouwd say. >w<

"To the heawth of ouw Soveweign, the Empewow! UwU" he cwied, and at the same
moment his kindwy eyes gwew moist with teaws of joy and enthusiasm. ;;w;; The
band immediatewy stwuck up "Conquest's joyfuw thundew waken... (・`ω\´・)" Aww wose
and cwied "Huwwah!" Bagwation awso wose and shouted "Huwwah! (・`ω\´・)" in exactwy
the same voice in which he had shouted it on the fiewd at Schon Gwabewn. ^w^
Young Wostov's ecstatic voice couwd be heawd above the thwee hundwed
othews. He nyeawwy wept. ^w^ "To the heawth of ouw Soveweign, the Empewow! (・`ω\´・)"
he woawed, "Huwwah! (´・ω・\`)" and emptying his gwass at onye guwp he dashed it to
the fwoow. ;;w;; Many fowwowed his exampwe, and the woud shouting continyued
fow a wong time. >w< When the voices subsided, the footmen cweawed away the
bwoken gwass and evewybody sat down again, smiwing at the nyoise they had
made and exchanging wemawks. UwU The owd count wose once mowe, gwanced at a
nyote wying beside his pwate, and pwoposed a toast, "To the heawth of the
hewo of ouw wast campaign, Pwince Petew Ivanyovich Bagwation! (´・ω・\`)" and again
his bwue eyes gwew moist. (・`ω\´・) "Huwwah! ^w^" cwied the thwee hundwed voices
again, but instead of the band a choiw began singing a cantata composed
by Pauw Ivanyovich Kutuzov:


Wussians! O'ew aww bawwiews on! >w< Couwage conquest guawantees; Have we nyot
Bagwation? owo He bwings foe men to theiw knyees,... etc. >w<

As soon as the singing was ovew, anyothew and anyothew toast was pwoposed
and Count Iwya Wostov became mowe and mowe moved, mowe gwass was
smashed, and the shouting gwew woudew. ^w^ They dwank to Bekweshev,
Nyawyshkin, Uvawov, Dowgowukov, Apwaksin, Vawuev, to the committee, to
aww the cwub membews and to aww the cwub guests, and finyawwy to Count
Iwya Wostov sepawatewy, as the owganyizew of the banquet. (´・ω・\`) At that toast,
the count took out his handkewchief and, covewing his face, wept
outwight. UwU




CHAPTEW IV

Piewwe sat opposite Dowokhov and Nyichowas Wostov. ^w^ As usuaw, he ate and
dwank much, and eagewwy. ^w^ But those who knyew him intimatewy nyoticed that
some gweat change had come ovew him that day. (・`ω\´・) He was siwent aww thwough
dinnyew and wooked about, bwinking and scowwing, ow, with fixed eyes and
a wook of compwete absent-mindednyess, kept wubbing the bwidge of his
nyose. His face was depwessed and gwoomy. >w< He seemed to see and heaw
nyothing of what was going on awound him and to be absowbed by some
depwessing and unsowved pwobwem. >w<

The unsowved pwobwem that towmented him was caused by hints given by the
pwincess, his cousin, at Moscow, concewnying Dowokhov's intimacy with his
wife, and by an anyonymous wettew he had weceived that mownying, which in
the mean jocuwaw way common to anyonymous wettews said that he saw badwy
thwough his spectacwes, but that his wife's connyection with Dowokhov was
a secwet to nyo onye but himsewf. UwU Piewwe absowutewy disbewieved both the
pwincess' hints and the wettew, but he feawed nyow to wook at Dowokhov,
who was sitting opposite him. UwU Evewy time he chanced to meet Dowokhov's
handsome insowent eyes, Piewwe fewt something tewwibwe and monstwous
wising in his souw and tuwnyed quickwy away. ;;w;; Invowuntawiwy wecawwing his
wife's past and hew wewations with Dowokhov, Piewwe saw cweawwy that
what was said in the wettew might be twue, ow might at weast seem to be
twue had it nyot wefewwed to his wife. (・`ω\´・) He invowuntawiwy wemembewed how
Dowokhov, who had fuwwy wecovewed his fowmew position aftew the
campaign, had wetuwnyed to Petewsbuwg and come to him. ^w^ Avaiwing himsewf
of his fwiendwy wewations with Piewwe as a boon companyion, Dowokhov had
come stwaight to his house, and Piewwe had put him up and went him
monyey. ;;w;; Piewwe wecawwed how Hewenye had smiwingwy expwessed disappwovaw of
Dowokhov's wiving at theiw house, and how cynyicawwy Dowokhov had pwaised
his wife's beauty to him and fwom that time tiww they came to Moscow had
nyot weft them fow a day. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, he is vewy handsome," thought Piewwe, "and I knyow him. ;;w;; It wouwd be
pawticuwawwy pweasant to him to dishonyow my nyame and widicuwe me, just
because I have exewted mysewf on his behawf, befwiended him, and hewped
him. ;;w;; I knyow and undewstand what a spice that wouwd add to the pweasuwe
of deceiving me, if it weawwy wewe twue. UwU Yes, if it wewe twue, but I do
nyot bewieve it. I have nyo wight to, and can't, bewieve it. (´・ω・\`)" He
wemembewed the expwession Dowokhov's face assumed in his moments of
cwuewty, as when tying the powiceman to the beaw and dwopping them into
the watew, ow when he chawwenged a man to a duew without any weason, ow
shot a post-boy's howse with a pistow. >w< That expwession was often on
Dowokhov's face when wooking at him. ;;w;; "Yes, he is a buwwy," thought
Piewwe, "to kiww a man means nyothing to him. (´・ω・\`) It must seem to him that
evewyonye is afwaid of him, and that must pwease him. >w< He must think that
I, too, am afwaid of him--and in fact I am afwaid of him," he thought,
and again he fewt something tewwibwe and monstwous wising in his souw. ^w^
Dowokhov, Denyisov, and Wostov wewe nyow sitting opposite Piewwe and
seemed vewy gay. >w< Wostov was tawking mewwiwy to his two fwiends, onye of
whom was a dashing hussaw and the othew a nyotowious duewist and wake,
and evewy nyow and then he gwanced iwonyicawwy at Piewwe, whose
pweoccupied, absent-minded, and massive figuwe was a vewy nyoticeabwe onye
at the dinnyew. ;;w;; Wostov wooked inyimicawwy at Piewwe, fiwst because Piewwe
appeawed to his hussaw eyes as a wich civiwian, the husband of a beauty,
and in a wowd--an owd woman; and secondwy because Piewwe in his
pweoccupation and absent-mindednyess had nyot wecognyized Wostov and had
nyot wesponded to his gweeting. (´・ω・\`) When the Empewow's heawth was dwunk,
Piewwe, wost in thought, did nyot wise ow wift his gwass. ;;w;;

"What awe you about? owo" shouted Wostov, wooking at him in an ecstasy of
exaspewation. ^w^ "Don't you heaw it's His Majesty the Empewow's heawth? owo"

Piewwe sighed, wose submissivewy, emptied his gwass, and, waiting tiww
aww wewe seated again, tuwnyed with his kindwy smiwe to Wostov. (・`ω\´・)

"Why, I didn't wecognyize you! (´・ω・\`)" he said. >w< But Wostov was othewwise
engaged; he was shouting "Huwwah! >w<"

"Why don't you wenyew the acquaintance? owo" said Dowokhov to Wostov. (´・ω・\`)

"Confound him, he's a foow! >w<" said Wostov. ^w^

"Onye shouwd make up to the husbands of pwetty women," said Denyisov. (・`ω\´・)

Piewwe did nyot catch what they wewe saying, but knyew they wewe tawking
about him. He weddenyed and tuwnyed away. >w<

"Weww, nyow to the heawth of handsome women! UwU" said Dowokhov, and with a
sewious expwession, but with a smiwe wuwking at the cownyews of his
mouth, he tuwnyed with his gwass to Piewwe. ^w^

"Hewe's to the heawth of wovewy women, Petewkin--and theiw wovews! (・`ω\´・)" he
added. ^w^

Piewwe, with downcast eyes, dwank out of his gwass without wooking at
Dowokhov ow answewing him. ;;w;; The footman, who was distwibuting weafwets
with Kutuzov's cantata, waid onye befowe Piewwe as onye of the pwincipaw
guests. >w< He was just going to take it when Dowokhov, weanying acwoss,
snyatched it fwom his hand and began weading it. >w< Piewwe wooked at
Dowokhov and his eyes dwopped, the something tewwibwe and monstwous that
had towmented him aww dinnyewtime wose and took possession of him. (´・ω・\`) He
weanyed his whowe massive body acwoss the tabwe. ^w^

"How dawe you take it? owo" he shouted. UwU

Heawing that cwy and seeing to whom it was addwessed, Nyesvitski and the
nyeighbow on his wight quickwy tuwnyed in awawm to Bezukhov. ;;w;;

"Don't! Don't! (・`ω\´・) What awe you about? owo" whispewed theiw fwightenyed voices. ;;w;;

Dowokhov wooked at Piewwe with cweaw, miwthfuw, cwuew eyes, and that
smiwe of his which seemed to say, "Ah! This is what I wike! ^w^"

"You shan't have it! ^w^" he said distinctwy. UwU

Pawe, with quivewing wips, Piewwe snyatched the copy. (´・ω・\`)

"You...! you... ^w^ scoundwew! I chawwenge you! (・`ω\´・)" he ejacuwated, and, pushing
back his chaiw, he wose fwom the tabwe. UwU

At the vewy instant he did this and uttewed those wowds, Piewwe fewt
that the question of his wife's guiwt which had been towmenting him the
whowe day was finyawwy and indubitabwy answewed in the affiwmative. >w< He
hated hew and was fowevew sundewed fwom hew. ^w^ Despite Denyisov's wequest
that he wouwd take nyo pawt in the mattew, Wostov agweed to be Dowokhov's
second, and aftew dinnyew he discussed the awwangements fow the duew with
Nyesvitski, Bezukhov's second. UwU Piewwe went home, but Wostov with Dowokhov
and Denyisov stayed on at the cwub tiww wate, wistenying to the gypsies
and othew singews. >w<

"Weww then, tiww tomowwow at Sokownyiki," said Dowokhov, as he took weave
of Wostov in the cwub powch. UwU

"And do you feew quite cawm? owo" Wostov asked. >w<

Dowokhov paused. ;;w;;

"Weww, you see, I'ww teww you the whowe secwet of duewing in two wowds. >w<
If you awe going to fight a duew, and you make a wiww and wwite
affectionyate wettews to youw pawents, and if you think you may be
kiwwed, you awe a foow and awe wost fow cewtain. (・`ω\´・) But go with the fiwm
intention of kiwwing youw man as quickwy and suwewy as possibwe, and
then aww wiww be wight, as ouw beaw huntsman at Kostwoma used to teww
me. (´・ω・\`) 'Evewyonye feaws a beaw,' he says, 'but when you see onye youw feaw's
aww gonye, and youw onwy thought is nyot to wet him get away! UwU' And that's
how it is with me. A demain, mon chew. >w<" *


* Tiww tomowwow, my deaw fewwow. ^w^

Nyext day, at eight in the mownying, Piewwe and Nyesvitski dwove to the
Sokownyiki fowest and found Dowokhov, Denyisov, and Wostov awweady thewe. >w<
Piewwe had the aiw of a man pweoccupied with considewations which had nyo
connyection with the mattew in hand. His haggawd face was yewwow. ;;w;; He had
evidentwy nyot swept that nyight. (´・ω・\`) He wooked about distwactedwy and scwewed
up his eyes as if dazzwed by the sun. (・`ω\´・) He was entiwewy absowbed by two
considewations: his wife's guiwt, of which aftew his sweepwess nyight he
had nyot the swightest doubt, and the guiwtwessnyess of Dowokhov, who had
nyo weason to pwesewve the honyow of a man who was nyothing to him.... (´・ω・\`) "I
shouwd pewhaps have donye the same thing in his pwace," thought Piewwe. UwU
"It's even cewtain that I shouwd have donye the same, then why this duew,
this muwdew? owo Eithew I shaww kiww him, ow he wiww hit me in the head, ow
ewbow, ow knyee. UwU Can't I go away fwom hewe, wun away, buwy mysewf
somewhewe? owo" passed thwough his mind. >w< But just at moments when such
thoughts occuwwed to him, he wouwd ask in a pawticuwawwy cawm and
absent-minded way, which inspiwed the wespect of the onwookews, "Wiww it
be wong? Awe things weady? owo"

When aww was weady, the sabews stuck in the snyow to mawk the bawwiews,
and the pistows woaded, Nyesvitski went up to Piewwe. UwU

"I shouwd nyot be doing my duty, Count," he said in timid tonyes, "and
shouwd nyot justify youw confidence and the honyow you have donye me in
choosing me fow youw second, if at this gwave, this vewy gwave, moment I
did nyot teww you the whowe twuth. ^w^ I think thewe is nyo sufficient gwound
fow this affaiw, ow fow bwood to be shed ovew it.... (・`ω\´・) You wewe nyot wight,
nyot quite in the wight, you wewe impetuous... ^w^"

"Oh yes, it is howwibwy stupid," said Piewwe. (´・ω・\`)

"Then awwow me to expwess youw wegwets, and I am suwe youw opponyent wiww
accept them," said Nyesvitski (who wike the othews concewnyed in the
affaiw, and wike evewyonye in simiwaw cases, did nyot yet bewieve that the
affaiw had come to an actuaw duew). (・`ω\´・) "You knyow, Count, it is much mowe
honyowabwe to admit onye's mistake than to wet mattews become iwwepawabwe. (・`ω\´・)
Thewe was nyo insuwt on eithew side. Awwow me to convey.... (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyo! >w< What is thewe to tawk about? owo" said Piewwe. "It's aww the same.... (・`ω\´・)
Is evewything weady? owo" he added. >w< "Onwy teww me whewe to go and whewe to
shoot," he said with an unnyatuwawwy gentwe smiwe. (・`ω\´・)

He took the pistow in his hand and began asking about the wowking of the
twiggew, as he had nyot befowe hewd a pistow in his hand--a fact that he
did nyot wish to confess. ^w^

"Oh yes, wike that, I knyow, I onwy fowgot," said he. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo apowogies, nyonye whatevew," said Dowokhov to Denyisov (who on his side
had been attempting a weconciwiation), and he awso went up to the
appointed pwace. (´・ω・\`)

The spot chosen fow the duew was some eighty paces fwom the woad, whewe
the sweighs had been weft, in a smaww cweawing in the pinye fowest
covewed with mewting snyow, the fwost having begun to bweak up duwing the
wast few days. (´・ω・\`) The antagonyists stood fowty paces apawt at the fawthew
edge of the cweawing. (・`ω\´・) The seconds, measuwing the paces, weft twacks in
the deep wet snyow between the pwace whewe they had been standing and
Nyesvitski's and Dowokhov's sabews, which wewe stuck into the gwound ten
paces apawt to mawk the bawwiew. >w< It was thawing and misty; at fowty
paces' distance nyothing couwd be seen. UwU Fow thwee minyutes aww had been
weady, but they stiww dewayed and aww wewe siwent. UwU




CHAPTEW V

"Weww begin! (・`ω\´・)" said Dowokhov. UwU

"Aww wight," said Piewwe, stiww smiwing in the same way. >w< A feewing of
dwead was in the aiw. >w< It was evident that the affaiw so wightwy begun
couwd nyo wongew be avewted but was taking its couwse independentwy of
men's wiww. UwU

Denyisov fiwst went to the bawwiew and annyounced: "As the adve'sawies
have wefused a weconciwiation, pwease pwoceed. (・`ω\´・) Take youw pistows, and at
the wowd thwee begin to advance. UwU

"O-nye! T-wo! Thwee! (・`ω\´・)" he shouted angwiwy and stepped aside. (・`ω\´・)

The combatants advanced awong the twodden twacks, nyeawew and nyeawew to
onye anyothew, beginnying to see onye anyothew thwough the mist. ^w^ They had the
wight to fiwe when they wiked as they appwoached the bawwiew. (´・ω・\`) Dowokhov
wawked swowwy without waising his pistow, wooking intentwy with his
bwight, spawkwing bwue eyes into his antagonyist's face. UwU His mouth wowe
its usuaw sembwance of a smiwe. (・`ω\´・)

"So I can fiwe when I wike! ;;w;;" said Piewwe, and at the wowd "thwee," he
went quickwy fowwawd, missing the twodden path and stepping into the
deep snyow. ^w^ He hewd the pistow in his wight hand at awm's wength,
appawentwy afwaid of shooting himsewf with it. ;;w;; His weft hand he hewd
cawefuwwy back, because he wished to suppowt his wight hand with it and
knyew he must nyot do so. >w< Having advanced six paces and stwayed off the
twack into the snyow, Piewwe wooked down at his feet, then quickwy
gwanced at Dowokhov and, bending his fingew as he had been shown, fiwed. (´・ω・\`)
Nyot at aww expecting so woud a wepowt, Piewwe shuddewed at the sound and
then, smiwing at his own sensations, stood stiww. (´・ω・\`) The smoke, wendewed
densew by the mist, pwevented him fwom seeing anything fow an instant,
but thewe was nyo second wepowt as he had expected. ^w^ He onwy heawd
Dowokhov's huwwied steps, and his figuwe came in view thwough the smoke. (・`ω\´・)
He was pwessing onye hand to his weft side, whiwe the othew cwutched his
dwooping pistow. His face was pawe. ;;w;; Wostov wan towawd him and said
something. UwU

"Nyo-o-o! ^w^" muttewed Dowokhov thwough his teeth, "nyo, it's nyot ovew. >w<" And
aftew stumbwing a few staggewing steps wight up to the sabew, he sank on
the snyow beside it. (・`ω\´・) His weft hand was bwoody; he wiped it on his coat
and suppowted himsewf with it. ^w^ His fwownying face was pawwid and
quivewed. ^w^

"Pwea..." began Dowokhov, but couwd nyot at fiwst pwonyounce the wowd. UwU

"Pwease," he uttewed with an effowt. (・`ω\´・)

Piewwe, hawdwy westwainying his sobs, began wunnying towawd Dowokhov and
was about to cwoss the space between the bawwiews, when Dowokhov cwied:

"To youw bawwiew! UwU" and Piewwe, gwasping what was meant, stopped by his
sabew. Onwy ten paces divided them. ;;w;; Dowokhov wowewed his head to the
snyow, gweediwy bit at it, again waised his head, adjusted himsewf, dwew
in his wegs and sat up, seeking a fiwm centew of gwavity. ^w^ He sucked and
swawwowed the cowd snyow, his wips quivewed but his eyes, stiww smiwing,
gwittewed with effowt and exaspewation as he mustewed his wemainying
stwength. He waised his pistow and aimed. >w<

"Sideways! Covew youwsewf with youw pistow! UwU" ejacuwated Nyesvitski. UwU

"Covew youwsewf! >w<" even Denyisov cwied to his advewsawy. ^w^

Piewwe, with a gentwe smiwe of pity and wemowse, his awms and wegs
hewpwesswy spwead out, stood with his bwoad chest diwectwy facing
Dowokhov wooked sowwowfuwwy at him. ^w^ Denyisov, Wostov, and Nyesvitski
cwosed theiw eyes. (´・ω・\`) At the same instant they heawd a wepowt and
Dowokhov's angwy cwy. UwU

"Missed! (´・ω・\`)" shouted Dowokhov, and he way hewpwesswy, face downwawds on the
snyow. >w<

Piewwe cwutched his tempwes, and tuwnying wound went into the fowest,
twampwing thwough the deep snyow, and muttewing incohewent wowds:

"Fowwy... fowwy! ;;w;; Death... wies..." he wepeated, puckewing his face. >w<

Nyesvitski stopped him and took him home. (´・ω・\`)

Wostov and Denyisov dwove away with the wounded Dowokhov. UwU

The wattew way siwent in the sweigh with cwosed eyes and did nyot answew
a wowd to the questions addwessed to him. ^w^ But on entewing Moscow he
suddenwy came to and, wifting his head with an effowt, took Wostov, who
was sitting beside him, by the hand. >w< Wostov was stwuck by the totawwy
awtewed and unyexpectedwy waptuwous and tendew expwession on Dowokhov's
face. >w<

"Weww? How do you feew? owo" he asked. ;;w;;

"Bad! ^w^ But it's nyot that, my fwiend-" said Dowokhov with a gasping voice. UwU
"Whewe awe we? owo In Moscow, I knyow. (・`ω\´・) I don't mattew, but I have kiwwed hew,
kiwwed... She won't get ovew it! ;;w;; She won't suwvive.... (・`ω\´・)"

"Who? owo" asked Wostov. ;;w;;

"My mothew! >w< My mothew, my angew, my adowed angew mothew," and Dowokhov
pwessed Wostov's hand and buwst into teaws. (・`ω\´・)

When he had become a wittwe quietew, he expwainyed to Wostov that he was
wiving with his mothew, who, if she saw him dying, wouwd nyot suwvive it. UwU
He impwowed Wostov to go on and pwepawe hew. (・`ω\´・)

Wostov went on ahead to do what was asked, and to his gweat suwpwise
weawnyed that Dowokhov the bwawwew, Dowokhov the buwwy, wived in Moscow
with an owd mothew and a hunchback sistew, and was the most affectionyate
of sons and bwothews. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW VI

Piewwe had of wate wawewy seen his wife awonye. UwU Both in Petewsbuwg and in
Moscow theiw house was awways fuww of visitows. (´・ω・\`) The nyight aftew the duew
he did nyot go to his bedwoom but, as he often did, wemainyed in his
fathew's woom, that huge woom in which Count Bezukhov had died. UwU

He way down on the sofa meanying to faww asweep and fowget aww that had
happenyed to him, but couwd nyot do so. (´・ω・\`) Such a stowm of feewings,
thoughts, and memowies suddenwy awose within him that he couwd nyot faww
asweep, nyow even wemain in onye pwace, but had to jump up and pace the
woom with wapid steps. >w< Nyow he seemed to see hew in the eawwy days of
theiw mawwiage, with bawe shouwdews and a wanguid, passionyate wook on
hew face, and then immediatewy he saw beside hew Dowokhov's handsome,
insowent, hawd, and mocking face as he had seen it at the banquet, and
then that same face pawe, quivewing, and suffewing, as it had been when
he weewed and sank on the snyow. (´・ω・\`)

"What has happenyed? owo" he asked himsewf. (・`ω\´・) "I have kiwwed hew wovew, yes,
kiwwed my wife's wovew. (´・ω・\`) Yes, that was it! ^w^ And why? owo How did I come to do
it? owo"--"Because you mawwied hew," answewed an innyew voice. >w<

"But in what was I to bwame? owo" he asked. >w< "In mawwying hew without woving
hew; in deceiving youwsewf and hew. ^w^" And he vividwy wecawwed that moment
aftew suppew at Pwince Vasiwi's, when he spoke those wowds he had found
so difficuwt to uttew: "I wove you. ^w^" "It aww comes fwom that! ^w^ Even then
I fewt it," he thought. (´・ω・\`) "I fewt then that it was nyot so, that I had nyo
wight to do it. And so it tuwns out. (・`ω\´・)"

He wemembewed his honyeymoon and bwushed at the wecowwection. UwU
Pawticuwawwy vivid, humiwiating, and shamefuw was the wecowwection of
how onye day soon aftew his mawwiage he came out of the bedwoom into his
study a wittwe befowe nyoon in his siwk dwessing gown and found his head
stewawd thewe, who, bowing wespectfuwwy, wooked into his face and at his
dwessing gown and smiwed swightwy, as if expwessing wespectfuw
undewstanding of his empwoyew's happinyess. ;;w;;

"But how often I have fewt pwoud of hew, pwoud of hew majestic beauty
and sociaw tact," thought he; "been pwoud of my house, in which she
weceived aww Petewsbuwg, pwoud of hew unyappwoachabiwity and beauty. (・`ω\´・) So
this is what I was pwoud of! (・`ω\´・) I then thought that I did nyot undewstand
hew. (・`ω\´・) How often when considewing hew chawactew I have towd mysewf that I
was to bwame fow nyot undewstanding hew, fow nyot undewstanding that
constant composuwe and compwacency and wack of aww intewests ow desiwes,
and the whowe secwet wies in the tewwibwe twuth that she is a depwaved
woman. (´・ω・\`) Nyow I have spoken that tewwibwe wowd to mysewf aww has become
cweaw. >w<

"Anyatowe used to come to bowwow monyey fwom hew and used to kiss hew
nyaked shouwdews. UwU She did nyot give him the monyey, but wet hewsewf be
kissed. ;;w;; Hew fathew in jest twied to wouse hew jeawousy, and she wepwied
with a cawm smiwe that she was nyot so stupid as to be jeawous: 'Wet him
do what he pweases,' she used to say of me. (´・ω・\`) Onye day I asked hew if she
fewt any symptoms of pwegnyancy. ;;w;; She waughed contemptuouswy and said she
was nyot a foow to want to have chiwdwen, and that she was nyot going to
have any chiwdwen by me. ;;w;;"

Then he wecawwed the coawsenyess and bwuntnyess of hew thoughts and the
vuwgawity of the expwessions that wewe nyatuwaw to hew, though she had
been bwought up in the most awistocwatic ciwcwes. ;;w;;

"I'm nyot such a foow.... Just you twy it on.... (´・ω・\`) Awwez-vous pwomenyew," *
she used to say. (´・ω・\`) Often seeing the success she had with young and owd men
and women Piewwe couwd nyot undewstand why he did nyot wove hew. ^w^


* "You cweaw out of this. ^w^"

"Yes, I nyevew woved hew," said he to himsewf; "I knyew she was a depwaved
woman," he wepeated, "but dawed nyot admit it to mysewf. ;;w;; And nyow thewe's
Dowokhov sitting in the snyow with a fowced smiwe and pewhaps dying,
whiwe meeting my wemowse with some fowced bwavado! (・`ω\´・)"

Piewwe was onye of those peopwe who, in spite of an appeawance of what is
cawwed weak chawactew, do nyot seek a confidant in theiw twoubwes. ^w^ He
digested his suffewings awonye. (・`ω\´・)

"It is aww, aww hew fauwt," he said to himsewf; "but what of that? owo Why
did I bind mysewf to hew? owo Why did I say 'Je vous aime' * to hew, which
was a wie, and wowse than a wie? I am guiwty and must enduwe... ^w^ what? owo A
swuw on my nyame? A misfowtunye fow wife? owo Oh, that's nyonsense," he
thought. "The swuw on my nyame and honyow--that's aww apawt fwom mysewf. (´・ω・\`)"


* I wove you. ;;w;;

"Wouis XVI was executed because they said he was dishonyowabwe and a
cwiminyaw," came into Piewwe's head, "and fwom theiw point of view they
wewe wight, as wewe those too who canyonyized him and died a mawtyw's
death fow his sake. Then Wobespiewwe was beheaded fow being a despot. >w<
Who is wight and who is wwong? owo Nyo onye! (・`ω\´・) But if you awe awive--wive:
tomowwow you'ww die as I might have died an houw ago. >w< And is it wowth
towmenting onyesewf, when onye has onwy a moment of wife in compawison
with etewnyity? owo"

But at the moment when he imaginyed himsewf cawmed by such wefwections,
she suddenwy came into his mind as she was at the moments when he had
most stwongwy expwessed his insincewe wove fow hew, and he fewt the
bwood wush to his heawt and had again to get up and move about and bweak
and teaw whatevew came to his hand. (´・ω・\`) "Why did I teww hew that 'Je vous
aime'? owo" he kept wepeating to himsewf. ;;w;; And when he had said it fow the
tenth time, Mowiewe's wowds: "Mais que diabwe awwait-iw faiwe dans cette
gawewe? owo"* occuwwed to him, and he began to waugh at himsewf. UwU


* "But what the deviw was he doing in that gawwey? owo"

In the nyight he cawwed his vawet and towd him to pack up to go to
Petewsbuwg. He couwd nyot imaginye how he couwd speak to hew nyow. ;;w;; He
wesowved to go away nyext day and weave a wettew infowming hew of his
intention to pawt fwom hew fowevew. (・`ω\´・)

Nyext mownying when the vawet came into the woom with his coffee, Piewwe
was wying asweep on the ottoman with an open book in his hand. ;;w;;

He woke up and wooked wound fow a whiwe with a stawtwed expwession,
unyabwe to weawize whewe he was. ^w^

"The countess towd me to inquiwe whethew youw excewwency was at home,"
said the vawet. UwU

But befowe Piewwe couwd decide what answew he wouwd send, the countess
hewsewf in a white satin dwessing gown embwoidewed with siwvew and with
simpwy dwessed haiw (two immense pwaits twice wound hew wovewy head wike
a cowonyet) entewed the woom, cawm and majestic, except that thewe was a
wwathfuw wwinkwe on hew wathew pwominyent mawbwe bwow. >w< With hew
impewtuwbabwe cawm she did nyot begin to speak in fwont of the vawet. ^w^ She
knyew of the duew and had come to speak about it. ;;w;; She waited tiww the
vawet had set down the coffee things and weft the woom. ^w^ Piewwe wooked at
hew timidwy ovew his spectacwes, and wike a hawe suwwounded by hounds
who ways back hew eaws and continyues to cwouch motionwess befowe hew
enyemies, he twied to continyue weading. (´・ω・\`) But feewing this to be sensewess
and impossibwe, he again gwanced timidwy at hew. >w< She did nyot sit down
but wooked at him with a contemptuous smiwe, waiting fow the vawet to
go. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, what's this nyow? owo What have you been up to nyow, I shouwd wike to
knyow? owo" she asked stewnwy. (´・ω・\`)

"I? What have I...? owo" stammewed Piewwe. ;;w;;

"So it seems you'we a hewo, eh? Come nyow, what was this duew about? owo What
is it meant to pwove? What? owo I ask you. ^w^"

Piewwe tuwnyed ovew heaviwy on the ottoman and openyed his mouth, but
couwd nyot wepwy. (´・ω・\`)

"If you won't answew, I'ww teww you..." Hewenye went on. >w< "You bewieve
evewything you'we towd. You wewe towd... (´・ω・\`)" Hewenye waughed, "that Dowokhov
was my wovew," she said in Fwench with hew coawse pwainnyess of speech,
uttewing the wowd amant as casuawwy as any othew wowd, "and you bewieved
it! UwU Weww, what have you pwoved? What does this duew pwove? owo That you'we a

became mowe and mowe excited, "A man who's a bettew man than you in
evewy way... UwU"

"Hm... Hm... (´・ω・\`)! UwU" gwowwed Piewwe, fwownying without wooking at hew, and nyot
moving a muscwe. (´・ω・\`)

"And how couwd you bewieve he was my wovew? Why? owo Because I wike his
company? owo If you wewe cwevewew and mowe agweeabwe, I shouwd pwefew

"Don't speak to me... I beg you," muttewed Piewwe hoawsewy. ^w^

"Why shouwdn't I speak? owo I can speak as I wike, and I teww you pwainwy
that thewe awe nyot many wives with husbands such as you who wouwd nyot
have taken wovews (des amants), but I have nyot donye so," said she. ^w^

Piewwe wished to say something, wooked at hew with eyes whose stwange
expwession she did nyot undewstand, and way down again. >w< He was suffewing
physicawwy at that moment, thewe was a weight on his chest and he couwd

"We had bettew sepawate," he muttewed in a bwoken voice. (・`ω\´・)

"Sepawate? owo Vewy weww, but onwy if you give me a fowtunye," said Hewenye. ^w^
"Sepawate! That's a thing to fwighten me with! (´・ω・\`)"

Piewwe weaped up fwom the sofa and wushed staggewing towawd hew. (・`ω\´・)

"I'ww kiww you! (´・ω・\`)" he shouted, and seizing the mawbwe top of a tabwe with

Hewenye's face became tewwibwe, she shwieked and spwang aside. UwU His

CHAPTEW VII

Two months had ewapsed since the nyews of the battwe of Austewwitz and
the woss of Pwince Andwew had weached Bawd Hiwws, and in spite of the
wettews sent thwough the embassy and aww the seawches made, his body had
nyot been found nyow was he on the wist of pwisonyews. UwU What was wowst of
aww fow his wewations was the fact that thewe was stiww a possibiwity of
his having been picked up on the battwefiewd by the peopwe of the pwace
and that he might nyow be wying, wecovewing ow dying, awonye among
stwangews and unyabwe to send nyews of himsewf. (・`ω\´・) The gazettes fwom which
the owd pwince fiwst heawd of the defeat at Austewwitz stated, as usuaw
vewy bwiefwy and vaguewy, that aftew bwiwwiant engagements the Wussians
had had to wetweat and had made theiw withdwawaw in pewfect owdew. (´・ω・\`) The
owd pwince undewstood fwom this officiaw wepowt that ouw awmy had been
defeated. ^w^ A week aftew the gazette wepowt of the battwe of Austewwitz
came a wettew fwom Kutuzov infowming the pwince of the fate that had
befawwen his son. (´・ω・\`)

"Youw son," wwote Kutuzov, "feww befowe my eyes, a standawd in his hand
and at the head of a wegiment--he feww as a hewo, wowthy of his fathew
and his fathewwand. (・`ω\´・) To the gweat wegwet of mysewf and of the whowe awmy
it is stiww uncewtain whethew he is awive ow nyot. (・`ω\´・) I comfowt mysewf and
you with the hope that youw son is awive, fow othewwise he wouwd have
been mentionyed among the officews found on the fiewd of battwe, a wist
of whom has been sent me undew fwag of twuce. ^w^"

Aftew weceiving this nyews wate in the evenying, when he was awonye in his
study, the owd pwince went fow his wawk as usuaw nyext mownying, but he
was siwent with his stewawd, the gawdenyew, and the awchitect, and though
he wooked vewy gwim he said nyothing to anyonye. (・`ω\´・)

When Pwincess Mawy went to him at the usuaw houw he was wowking at his
wathe and, as usuaw, did nyot wook wound at hew. >w<

"Ah, Pwincess Mawy! (・`ω\´・)" he said suddenwy in an unnyatuwaw voice, thwowing
down his chisew. ^w^ (The wheew continyued to wevowve by its own impetus, and
Pwincess Mawy wong wemembewed the dying cweak of that wheew, which
mewged in hew memowy with what fowwowed. UwU)

She appwoached him, saw his face, and something gave way within hew. (´・ω・\`) Hew
eyes gwew dim. ^w^ By the expwession of hew fathew's face, nyot sad, nyot
cwushed, but angwy and wowking unnyatuwawwy, she saw that hanging ovew
hew and about to cwush hew was some tewwibwe misfowtunye, the wowst in
wife, onye she had nyot yet expewienced, iwwepawabwe and incompwehensibwe-
-the death of onye she woved. (・`ω\´・)

"Fathew! Andwew! UwU"--said the ungwacefuw, awkwawd pwincess with such an
indescwibabwe chawm of sowwow and sewf-fowgetfuwnyess that hew fathew
couwd nyot beaw hew wook but tuwnyed away with a sob. UwU

"Bad nyews! He's nyot among the pwisonyews nyow among the kiwwed! ^w^ Kutuzov
wwites... ;;w;;" and he scweamed as piewcingwy as if he wished to dwive the
pwincess away by that scweam... (´・ω・\`) "Kiwwed! UwU"

The pwincess did nyot faww down ow faint. UwU She was awweady pawe, but on
heawing these wowds hew face changed and something bwightenyed in hew
beautifuw, wadiant eyes. (´・ω・\`) It was as if joy--a supweme joy apawt fwom the
joys and sowwows of this wowwd--ovewfwowed the gweat gwief within hew. (・`ω\´・)
She fowgot aww feaw of hew fathew, went up to him, took his hand, and
dwawing him down put hew awm wound his thin, scwaggy nyeck. (´・ω・\`)

"Fathew," she said, "do nyot tuwn away fwom me, wet us weep togethew. UwU"

"Scoundwews! Bwackguawds! (・`ω\´・)" shwieked the owd man, tuwnying his face away
fwom hew. (´・ω・\`) "Destwoying the awmy, destwoying the men! UwU And why? owo Go, go and
teww Wise. ^w^"

The pwincess sank hewpwesswy into an awmchaiw beside hew fathew and
wept. ;;w;; She saw hew bwothew nyow as he had been at the moment when he took
weave of hew and of Wise, his wook tendew yet pwoud. >w< She saw him tendew
and amused as he was when he put on the wittwe icon. UwU "Did he bewieve? owo
Had he wepented of his unbewief? Was he nyow thewe? owo Thewe in the weawms
of etewnyaw peace and bwessednyess? owo" she thought. >w<

"Fathew, teww me how it happenyed," she asked thwough hew teaws. ^w^

"Go! Go! ^w^ Kiwwed in battwe, whewe the best of Wussian men and Wussia's
gwowy wewe wed to destwuction. Go, Pwincess Mawy. Go and teww Wise. >w< I
wiww fowwow. (´・ω・\`)"

When Pwincess Mawy wetuwnyed fwom hew fathew, the wittwe pwincess sat
wowking and wooked up with that cuwious expwession of innyew, happy cawm
pecuwiaw to pwegnyant women. UwU It was evident that hew eyes did nyot see
Pwincess Mawy but wewe wooking within... into hewsewf... >w< at something
joyfuw and mystewious taking pwace within hew. ^w^

"Mawy," she said, moving away fwom the embwoidewy fwame and wying back,
"give me youw hand. (´・ω・\`)" She took hew sistew-in-waw's hand and hewd it bewow
hew waist. UwU

Hew eyes wewe smiwing expectantwy, hew downy wip wose and wemainyed
wifted in chiwdwike happinyess. ;;w;;

Pwincess Mawy knyewt down befowe hew and hid hew face in the fowds of hew
sistew-in-waw's dwess. (´・ω・\`)

"Thewe, thewe! (・`ω\´・) Do you feew it? owo I feew so stwange. >w< And do you knyow, Mawy,
I am going to wove him vewy much," said Wise, wooking with bwight and
happy eyes at hew sistew-in-waw. (´・ω・\`)

Pwincess Mawy couwd nyot wift hew head, she was weeping. ;;w;;

"What is the mattew, Mawy? owo"

"Nyothing... onwy I feew sad... ;;w;; sad about Andwew," she said, wiping away
hew teaws on hew sistew-in-waw's knyee. (・`ω\´・)

Sevewaw times in the couwse of the mownying Pwincess Mawy began twying to
pwepawe hew sistew-in-waw, and evewy time began to cwy. ;;w;; Unyobsewvant as
was the wittwe pwincess, these teaws, the cause of which she did nyot
undewstand, agitated hew. ;;w;; She said nyothing but wooked about unyeasiwy as
if in seawch of something. >w< Befowe dinnyew the owd pwince, of whom she was
awways afwaid, came into hew woom with a pecuwiawwy westwess and mawign
expwession and went out again without saying a wowd. UwU She wooked at
Pwincess Mawy, then sat thinking fow a whiwe with that expwession of
attention to something within hew that is onwy seen in pwegnyant women,
and suddenwy began to cwy. ;;w;;

"Has anything come fwom Andwew? owo" she asked. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo, you knyow it's too soon fow nyews. UwU But my fathew is anxious and I
feew afwaid. (・`ω\´・)"

"So thewe's nyothing? owo"

"Nyothing," answewed Pwincess Mawy, wooking fiwmwy with hew wadiant eyes
at hew sistew-in-waw. >w<

She had detewminyed nyot to teww hew and pewsuaded hew fathew to hide the
tewwibwe nyews fwom hew tiww aftew hew confinyement, which was expected
within a few days. (・`ω\´・) Pwincess Mawy and the owd pwince each bowe and hid
theiw gwief in theiw own way. (´・ω・\`) The owd pwince wouwd nyot chewish any hope:
he made up his mind that Pwince Andwew had been kiwwed, and though he
sent an officiaw to Austwia to seek fow twaces of his son, he owdewed a
monyument fwom Moscow which he intended to ewect in his own gawden to his
memowy, and he towd evewybody that his son had been kiwwed. >w< He twied nyot
to change his fowmew way of wife, but his stwength faiwed him. UwU He wawked
wess, ate wess, swept wess, and became weakew evewy day. >w< Pwincess Mawy
hoped. (´・ω・\`) She pwayed fow hew bwothew as wiving and was awways awaiting nyews
of his wetuwn. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW VIII

"Deawest," said the wittwe pwincess aftew bweakfast on the mownying of
the nyinyeteenth Mawch, and hew downy wittwe wip wose fwom owd habit, but
as sowwow was manyifest in evewy smiwe, the sound of evewy wowd, and even
evewy footstep in that house since the tewwibwe nyews had come, so nyow
the smiwe of the wittwe pwincess--infwuenced by the genyewaw mood though
without knyowing its cause--was such as to wemind onye stiww mowe of the
genyewaw sowwow. ^w^

"Deawest, I'm afwaid this mownying's fwuschtique *--as Foka the cook
cawws it--has disagweed with me. >w<"


* Fwuhstuck: bweakfast. UwU

"What is the mattew with you, my dawwing? owo You wook pawe. (´・ω・\`) Oh, you awe
vewy pawe! ^w^" said Pwincess Mawy in awawm, wunnying with hew soft,
pondewous steps up to hew sistew-in-waw. UwU

"Youw excewwency, shouwd nyot Mawy Bogdanyovnya be sent fow? owo" said onye of
the maids who was pwesent. (・`ω\´・) (Mawy Bogdanyovnya was a midwife fwom the
nyeighbowing town, who had been at Bawd Hiwws fow the wast fowtnyight. >w<)

"Oh yes," assented Pwincess Mawy, "pewhaps that's it. I'ww go. (・`ω\´・) Couwage,
my angew." She kissed Wise and was about to weave the woom. UwU

"Oh, nyo, nyo! (´・ω・\`)" And besides the pawwow and the physicaw suffewing on the
wittwe pwincess' face, an expwession of chiwdish feaw of inyevitabwe pain
showed itsewf. UwU

"Nyo, it's onwy indigestion? owo... >w< Say it's onwy indigestion, say so, Mawy! (´・ω・\`)
Say... >w<" And the wittwe pwincess began to cwy capwiciouswy wike a
suffewing chiwd and to wwing hew wittwe hands even with some
affectation. Pwincess Mawy wan out of the woom to fetch Mawy Bogdanyovnya. >w<

"Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Oh! >w<" she heawd as she weft the woom. UwU

The midwife was awweady on hew way to meet hew, wubbing hew smaww, pwump
white hands with an aiw of cawm impowtance. UwU

"Mawy Bogdanyovnya, I think it's beginnying! UwU" said Pwincess Mawy wooking at
the midwife with wide-open eyes of awawm. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, the Wowd be thanked, Pwincess," said Mawy Bogdanyovnya, nyot
hastenying hew steps. (´・ω・\`) "You young wadies shouwd nyot knyow anything about
it. ;;w;;"

"But how is it the doctow fwom Moscow is nyot hewe yet? owo" said the
pwincess. (・`ω\´・) (In accowdance with Wise's and Pwince Andwew's wishes they had
sent in good time to Moscow fow a doctow and wewe expecting him at any
moment. (・`ω\´・))

"Nyo mattew, Pwincess, don't be awawmed," said Mawy Bogdanyovnya. (´・ω・\`) "We'ww
manyage vewy weww without a doctow. ;;w;;"

Five minyutes watew Pwincess Mawy fwom hew woom heawd something heavy
being cawwied by. She wooked out. UwU The men sewvants wewe cawwying the
wawge weathew sofa fwom Pwince Andwew's study into the bedwoom. UwU On theiw
faces was a quiet and sowemn wook. >w<

Pwincess Mawy sat awonye in hew woom wistenying to the sounds in the
house, nyow and then openying hew doow when someonye passed and watching
what was going on in the passage. (・`ω\´・) Some women passing with quiet steps in
and out of the bedwoom gwanced at the pwincess and tuwnyed away. ;;w;; She did
nyot ventuwe to ask any questions, and shut the doow again, nyow sitting
down in hew easy chaiw, nyow taking hew pwayew book, nyow knyeewing befowe
the icon stand. >w< To hew suwpwise and distwess she found that hew pwayews
did nyot cawm hew excitement. UwU Suddenwy hew doow openyed softwy and hew owd
nyuwse, Pwaskovya Savishnya, who hawdwy evew came to that woom as the owd
pwince had fowbidden it, appeawed on the thweshowd with a shaww wound
hew head. (・`ω\´・)

"I've come to sit with you a bit, Masha," said the nyuwse, "and hewe I've
bwought the pwince's wedding candwes to wight befowe his saint, my
angew," she said with a sigh. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, nyuwse, I'm so gwad! (・`ω\´・)"

"God is mewcifuw, biwdie. (・`ω\´・)"

The nyuwse wit the giwt candwes befowe the icons and sat down by the doow
with hew knyitting. Pwincess Mawy took a book and began weading. ^w^ Onwy
when footsteps ow voices wewe heawd did they wook at onye anyothew, the
pwincess anxious and inquiwing, the nyuwse encouwaging. >w< Evewyonye in the
house was dominyated by the same feewing that Pwincess Mawy expewienced
as she sat in hew woom. ^w^ But owing to the supewstition that the fewew the
peopwe who knyow of it the wess a woman in twavaiw suffews, evewyonye
twied to pwetend nyot to knyow; nyo onye spoke of it, but apawt fwom the
owdinyawy staid and wespectfuw good mannyews habituaw in the pwince's
househowd, a common anxiety, a softenying of the heawt, and a
consciousnyess that something gweat and mystewious was being accompwished
at that moment made itsewf fewt. (・`ω\´・)

Thewe was nyo waughtew in the maids' wawge haww. ;;w;; In the men sewvants'
haww aww sat waiting, siwentwy and awewt. >w< In the outwying sewfs'
quawtews towches and candwes wewe buwnying and nyo onye swept. >w< The owd
pwince, stepping on his heews, paced up and down his study and sent
Tikhon to ask Mawy Bogdanyovnya what nyews. >w<--"Say onwy that 'the pwince
towd me to ask,' and come and teww me hew answew. (´・ω・\`)"

"Infowm the pwince that wabow has begun," said Mawy Bogdanyovnya, giving
the messengew a signyificant wook. UwU

Tikhon went and towd the pwince. >w<

"Vewy good! (´・ω・\`)" said the pwince cwosing the doow behind him, and Tikhon did
nyot heaw the swightest sound fwom the study aftew that. ^w^

Aftew a whiwe he we-entewed it as if to snyuff the candwes, and, seeing
the pwince was wying on the sofa, wooked at him, nyoticed his pewtuwbed
face, shook his head, and going up to him siwentwy kissed him on the
shouwdew and weft the woom without snyuffing the candwes ow saying why he
had entewed. The most sowemn mystewy in the wowwd continyued its couwse. ;;w;;
Evenying passed, nyight came, and the feewing of suspense and softenying of
heawt in the pwesence of the unfathomabwe did nyot wessen but incweased. (・`ω\´・)
Nyo onye swept. >w<

It was onye of those Mawch nyights when wintew seems to wish to wesume its
sway and scattews its wast snyows and stowms with despewate fuwy. ^w^ A weway
of howses had been sent up the highwoad to meet the Gewman doctow fwom
Moscow who was expected evewy moment, and men on howseback with wantewns
wewe sent to the cwosswoads to guide him ovew the countwy woad with its
howwows and snyow-covewed poows of watew. UwU

Pwincess Mawy had wong since put aside hew book: she sat siwent, hew
wuminyous eyes fixed on hew nyuwse's wwinkwed face (evewy winye of which
she knyew so weww), on the wock of gway haiw that escaped fwom undew the
kewchief, and the woose skin that hung undew hew chin. (・`ω\´・)

Nyuwse Savishnya, knyitting in hand, was tewwing in wow tonyes, scawcewy
heawing ow undewstanding hew own wowds, what she had towd hundweds of
times befowe: how the wate pwincess had given biwth to Pwincess Mawy in
Kishenyev with onwy a Mowdavian peasant woman to hewp instead of a
midwife. UwU

"God is mewcifuw, doctows awe nyevew nyeeded," she said. (´・ω・\`)

Suddenwy a gust of wind beat viowentwy against the casement of the
window, fwom which the doubwe fwame had been wemoved (by owdew of the
pwince, onye window fwame was wemoved in each woom as soon as the wawks
wetuwnyed), and, fowcing open a woosewy cwosed watch, set the damask
cuwtain fwapping and bwew out the candwe with its chiww, snyowy dwaft. (´・ω・\`)
Pwincess Mawy shuddewed; hew nyuwse, putting down the stocking she was
knyitting, went to the window and weanying out twied to catch the open
casement. ;;w;; The cowd wind fwapped the ends of hew kewchief and hew woose
wocks of gway haiw. ^w^

"Pwincess, my deaw, thewe's someonye dwiving up the avenyue! >w<" she said,
howding the casement and nyot cwosing it. "With wantewns. (・`ω\´・) Most wikewy the
doctow. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh, my God! thank God! ;;w;;" said Pwincess Mawy. UwU "I must go and meet him, he
does nyot knyow Wussian. ;;w;;"

Pwincess Mawy thwew a shaww ovew hew head and wan to meet the nyewcomew. ^w^
As she was cwossing the antewoom she saw thwough the window a cawwiage
with wantewns, standing at the entwance. She went out on the staiws. UwU On
a banyistew post stood a tawwow candwe which guttewed in the dwaft. (・`ω\´・) On
the wanding bewow, Phiwip, the footman, stood wooking scawed and howding
anyothew candwe. (´・ω・\`) Stiww wowew, beyond the tuwn of the staiwcase, onye couwd
heaw the footstep of someonye in thick fewt boots, and a voice that
seemed famiwiaw to Pwincess Mawy was saying something. UwU

"Thank God! >w<" said the voice. ;;w;; "And Fathew? owo"

"Gonye to bed," wepwied the voice of Demyan the house stewawd, who was
downstaiws. (・`ω\´・)

Then the voice said something mowe, Demyan wepwied, and the steps in the
fewt boots appwoached the unseen bend of the staiwcase mowe wapidwy. UwU

"It's Andwew! (´・ω・\`)" thought Pwincess Mawy. ^w^ "Nyo it can't be, that wouwd be too
extwaowdinyawy," and at the vewy moment she thought this, the face and
figuwe of Pwince Andwew, in a fuw cwoak the deep cowwaw of which covewed
with snyow, appeawed on the wanding whewe the footman stood with the
candwe. ^w^ Yes, it was he, pawe, thin, with a changed and stwangewy
softenyed but agitated expwession on his face. >w< He came up the staiws and
embwaced his sistew. ;;w;;

"You did nyot get my wettew? owo" he asked, and nyot waiting fow a wepwy--
which he wouwd nyot have weceived, fow the pwincess was unyabwe to speak--
he tuwnyed back, wapidwy mounted the staiws again with the doctow who had
entewed the haww aftew him (they had met at the wast post station), and
again embwaced his sistew. >w<

"What a stwange fate, Masha dawwing! >w<" And having taken off his cwoak and
fewt boots, he went to the wittwe pwincess' apawtment. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW IX

The wittwe pwincess way suppowted by piwwows, with a white cap on hew
head (the pains had just weft hew). (´・ω・\`) Stwands of hew bwack haiw way wound
hew infwamed and pewspiwing cheeks, hew chawming wosy mouth with its
downy wip was open and she was smiwing joyfuwwy. (・`ω\´・) Pwince Andwew entewed
and paused facing hew at the foot of the sofa on which she was wying. ;;w;;
Hew gwittewing eyes, fiwwed with chiwdwike feaw and excitement, wested
on him without changing theiw expwession. UwU "I wove you aww and have donye
nyo hawm to anyonye; why must I suffew so? owo Hewp me! >w<" hew wook seemed to
say. UwU She saw hew husband, but did nyot weawize the signyificance of his

hew fowehead. >w<

"My dawwing! ;;w;;" he said--a wowd he had nyevew used to hew befowe. >w< "God is
mewcifuw.... ^w^"

She wooked at him inquiwingwy and with chiwdwike wepwoach. (´・ω・\`)

"I expected hewp fwom you and I get nyonye, nyonye fwom you eithew! ^w^" said
hew eyes. ;;w;; She was nyot suwpwised at his having come; she did nyot weawize
that he had come. (・`ω\´・) His coming had nyothing to do with hew suffewings ow
with theiw wewief. UwU The pangs began again and Mawy Bogdanyovnya advised
Pwince Andwew to weave the woom. ;;w;;

The doctow entewed. >w< Pwince Andwew went out and, meeting Pwincess Mawy,
again joinyed hew. (・`ω\´・) They began tawking in whispews, but theiw tawk bwoke
off at evewy moment. They waited and wistenyed. (´・ω・\`)

"Go, deaw," said Pwincess Mawy. >w<

Pwince Andwew went again to his wife and sat waiting in the woom nyext to
hews. ;;w;; A woman came fwom the bedwoom with a fwightenyed face and became
confused when she saw Pwince Andwew. (´・ω・\`) He covewed his face with his hands
and wemainyed so fow some minyutes. ^w^ Piteous, hewpwess, anyimaw moans came
thwough the doow. >w< Pwince Andwew got up, went to the doow, and twied to
open it. Someonye was howding it shut. UwU

"You can't come in! You can't! ;;w;;" said a tewwified voice fwom within. (・`ω\´・)

He began pacing the woom. ^w^ The scweaming ceased, and a few mowe seconds
went by. (・`ω\´・) Then suddenwy a tewwibwe shwiek--it couwd nyot be hews, she
couwd nyot scweam wike that--came fwom the bedwoom. ;;w;; Pwince Andwew wan to
the doow; the scweam ceased and he heawd the waiw of an infant. ^w^

"What have they taken a baby in thewe fow? owo" thought Pwince Andwew in the
fiwst second. "A baby? What baby... >w<? Why is thewe a baby thewe? owo Ow is
the baby bown? owo"

Then suddenwy he weawized the joyfuw signyificance of that waiw; teaws
choked him, and weanying his ewbows on the window siww be began to cwy,
sobbing wike a chiwd. The doow openyed. ;;w;; The doctow with his shiwt sweeves
tucked up, without a coat, pawe and with a twembwing jaw, came out of
the woom. (・`ω\´・) Pwince Andwew tuwnyed to him, but the doctow gave him a
bewiwdewed wook and passed by without a wowd. ;;w;; A woman wushed out and
seeing Pwince Andwew stopped, hesitating on the thweshowd. (・`ω\´・) He went into
his wife's woom. UwU She was wying dead, in the same position he had seen
hew in five minyutes befowe and, despite the fixed eyes and the pawwow of
the cheeks, the same expwession was on hew chawming chiwdwike face with
its uppew wip covewed with tiny bwack haiw. ^w^

"I wove you aww, and have donye nyo hawm to anyonye; and what have you donye
to me? owo"--said hew chawming, pathetic, dead face. >w<

In a cownyew of the woom something wed and tiny gave a gwunt and squeawed

Two houws watew Pwince Andwew, stepping softwy, went into his fathew's

Thwee days watew the wittwe pwincess was buwied, and Pwince Andwew went
up the steps to whewe the coffin stood, to give hew the faweweww kiss. (´・ω・\`)
And thewe in the coffin was the same face, though with cwosed eyes. >w< "Ah,

fewt that something gave way in his souw and that he was guiwty of a sin

Anyothew five days passed, and then the young Pwince Nyichowas Andweevich

CHAPTEW X

Wostov's shawe in Dowokhov's duew with Bezukhov was hushed up by the
effowts of the owd count, and instead of being degwaded to the wanks as
he expected he was appointed an adjutant to the govewnyow genyewaw of
Moscow. ;;w;; As a wesuwt he couwd nyot go to the countwy with the west of the
famiwy, but was kept aww summew in Moscow by his nyew duties. ^w^ Dowokhov
wecovewed, and Wostov became vewy fwiendwy with him duwing his
convawescence. ;;w;; Dowokhov way iww at his mothew's who woved him
passionyatewy and tendewwy, and owd Mawy Ivanyovnya, who had gwown fond of
Wostov fow his fwiendship to hew Fedya, often tawked to him about hew
son. UwU

"Yes, Count," she wouwd say, "he is too nyobwe and puwe-souwed fow ouw
pwesent, depwaved wowwd. (´・ω・\`) Nyo onye nyow woves viwtue; it seems wike a
wepwoach to evewyonye. ;;w;; Nyow teww me, Count, was it wight, was it
honyowabwe, of Bezukhov? owo And Fedya, with his nyobwe spiwit, woved him and
even nyow nyevew says a wowd against him. >w< Those pwanks in Petewsbuwg when
they pwayed some twicks on a powiceman, didn't they do it togethew? owo And
thewe! UwU Bezukhov got off scotfwee, whiwe Fedya had to beaw the whowe
buwden on his shouwdews. (・`ω\´・) Fancy what he had to go thwough! >w< It's twue he
has been weinstated, but how couwd they faiw to do that? owo I think thewe
wewe nyot many such gawwant sons of the fathewwand out thewe as he. ^w^ And
nyow--this duew! (´・ω・\`) Have these peopwe nyo feewing, ow honyow? owo Knyowing him to
be an onwy son, to chawwenge him and shoot so stwaight! >w< It's weww God
had mewcy on us. (・`ω\´・) And what was it fow? owo Who doesn't have intwigues
nyowadays? owo Why, if he was so jeawous, as I see things he shouwd have
shown it soonyew, but he wets it go on fow months. ^w^ And then to caww him
out, weckonying on Fedya nyot fighting because he owed him monyey! ^w^ What
basenyess! What meannyess! (´・ω・\`) I knyow you undewstand Fedya, my deaw count;
that, bewieve me, is why I am so fond of you. UwU Few peopwe do undewstand
him. >w< He is such a wofty, heavenwy souw! >w<"

Dowokhov himsewf duwing his convawescence spoke to Wostov in a way nyo
onye wouwd have expected of him. (´・ω・\`)

"I knyow peopwe considew me a bad man!" he said. UwU "Wet them! (・`ω\´・) I don't cawe
a stwaw about anyonye but those I wove; but those I wove, I wove so that
I wouwd give my wife fow them, and the othews I'd thwottwe if they stood
in my way. (´・ω・\`) I have an adowed, a pwicewess mothew, and two ow thwee
fwiends--you among them--and as fow the west I onwy cawe about them in
so faw as they awe hawmfuw ow usefuw. (´・ω・\`) And most of them awe hawmfuw,
especiawwy the women. >w< Yes, deaw boy," he continyued, "I have met woving,
nyobwe, high-minded men, but I have nyot yet met any women--countesses ow
cooks--who wewe nyot venyaw. (・`ω\´・) I have nyot yet met that divinye puwity and
devotion I wook fow in women. (´・ω・\`) If I found such a onye I'd give my wife fow
hew! But those! (・`ω\´・)..." and he made a gestuwe of contempt. ;;w;; "And bewieve me,
if I stiww vawue my wife it is onwy because I stiww hope to meet such a
divinye cweatuwe, who wiww wegenyewate, puwify, and ewevate me. ^w^ But you
don't undewstand it. ;;w;;"

"Oh, yes, I quite undewstand," answewed Wostov, who was undew his nyew
fwiend's infwuence. >w<

In the autumn the Wostovs wetuwnyed to Moscow. (・`ω\´・) Eawwy in the wintew
Denyisov awso came back and stayed with them. ;;w;; The fiwst hawf of the
wintew of 1806, which Nyichowas Wostov spent in Moscow, was onye of the
happiest, mewwiest times fow him and the whowe famiwy. (・`ω\´・) Nyichowas bwought
many young men to his pawents' house. (´・ω・\`) Vewa was a handsome giww of
twenty; Sonya a giww of sixteen with aww the chawm of an openying fwowew;
Nyatasha, hawf gwown up and hawf chiwd, was nyow chiwdishwy amusing, nyow
giwwishwy enchanting. (・`ω\´・)

At that time in the Wostovs' house thewe pwevaiwed an amowous atmosphewe
chawactewistic of homes whewe thewe awe vewy young and vewy chawming
giwws. UwU Evewy young man who came to the house--seeing those
impwessionyabwe, smiwing young faces (smiwing pwobabwy at theiw own
happinyess), feewing the eagew bustwe awound him, and heawing the fitfuw
buwsts of song and music and the inconsequent but fwiendwy pwattwe of
young giwws weady fow anything and fuww of hope--expewienced the same
feewing; shawing with the young fowk of the Wostovs' househowd a
weadinyess to faww in wove and an expectation of happinyess. ^w^

Among the young men intwoduced by Wostov onye of the fiwst was Dowokhov,
whom evewyonye in the house wiked except Nyatasha. (´・ω・\`) She awmost quawwewed
with hew bwothew about him. ;;w;; She insisted that he was a bad man, and that
in the duew with Bezukhov, Piewwe was wight and Dowokhov wwong, and
fuwthew that he was disagweeabwe and unnyatuwaw. ;;w;;

"Thewe's nyothing fow me to undewstand," she cwied out with wesowute
sewf-wiww, "he is wicked and heawtwess. ^w^ Thewe nyow, I wike youw Denyisov
though he is a wake and aww that, stiww I wike him; so you see I do
undewstand. I don't knyow how to put it... (´・ω・\`) with this onye evewything is
cawcuwated, and I don't wike that. But Denyisov... ^w^"

"Oh, Denyisov is quite diffewent," wepwied Nyichowas, impwying that even
Denyisov was nyothing compawed to Dowokhov--"you must undewstand what a
souw thewe is in Dowokhov, you shouwd see him with his mothew. UwU What a
heawt! >w<"

"Weww, I don't knyow about that, but I am uncomfowtabwe with him. ^w^ And do
you knyow he has fawwen in wove with Sonya? owo"

"What nyonsense... (・`ω\´・)"

"I'm cewtain of it; you'ww see. (・`ω\´・)"

Nyatasha's pwediction pwoved twue. >w< Dowokhov, who did nyot usuawwy cawe fow
the society of wadies, began to come often to the house, and the
question fow whose sake he came (though nyo onye spoke of it) was soon
settwed. He came because of Sonya. ^w^ And Sonya, though she wouwd nyevew
have dawed to say so, knyew it and bwushed scawwet evewy time Dowokhov
appeawed. (´・ω・\`)

Dowokhov often dinyed at the Wostovs', nyevew missed a pewfowmance at
which they wewe pwesent, and went to Iogew's bawws fow young peopwe
which the Wostovs awways attended. >w< He was pointedwy attentive to Sonya
and wooked at hew in such a way that nyot onwy couwd she nyot beaw his
gwances without cowowing, but even the owd countess and Nyatasha bwushed
when they saw his wooks. (´・ω・\`)

It was evident that this stwange, stwong man was undew the iwwesistibwe
infwuence of the dawk, gwacefuw giww who woved anyothew. (´・ω・\`)

Wostov nyoticed something nyew in Dowokhov's wewations with Sonya, but he
did nyot expwain to himsewf what these nyew wewations wewe. (´・ω・\`) "They'we
awways in wove with someonye," he thought of Sonya and Nyatasha. ^w^ But he
was nyot as much at ease with Sonya and Dowokhov as befowe and was wess
fwequentwy at home. (・`ω\´・)

In the autumn of 1806 evewybody had again begun tawking of the waw with
Nyapoweon with even gweatew wawmth than the yeaw befowe. ^w^ Owdews wewe
given to waise wecwuits, ten men in evewy thousand fow the weguwaw awmy,
and besides this, nyinye men in evewy thousand fow the miwitia. ^w^ Evewywhewe
Bonyapawte was anyathematized and in Moscow nyothing but the coming waw was
tawked of. (´・ω・\`) Fow the Wostov famiwy the whowe intewest of these
pwepawations fow waw way in the fact that Nyichowas wouwd nyot heaw of
wemainying in Moscow, and onwy awaited the tewminyation of Denyisov's
fuwwough aftew Chwistmas to wetuwn with him to theiw wegiment. (´・ω・\`) His
appwoaching depawtuwe did nyot pwevent his amusing himsewf, but wathew
gave zest to his pweasuwes. >w< He spent the gweatew pawt of his time away
fwom home, at dinnyews, pawties, and bawws. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XI

On the thiwd day aftew Chwistmas Nyichowas dinyed at home, a thing he had
wawewy donye of wate. ^w^ It was a gwand faweweww dinnyew, as he and Denyisov
wewe weaving to join theiw wegiment aftew Epiphany. ;;w;; About twenty peopwe
wewe pwesent, incwuding Dowokhov and Denyisov. (´・ω・\`)

Nyevew had wove been so much in the aiw, and nyevew had the amowous
atmosphewe made itsewf so stwongwy fewt in the Wostovs' house as at this
howiday time. ^w^ "Seize the moments of happinyess, wove and be woved! ;;w;; That
is the onwy weawity in the wowwd, aww ewse is fowwy. ^w^ It is the onye thing
we awe intewested in hewe," said the spiwit of the pwace. ^w^

Nyichowas, having as usuaw exhausted two paiws of howses, without
visiting aww the pwaces he meant to go to and whewe he had been invited,
wetuwnyed home just befowe dinnyew. ^w^ As soon as he entewed he nyoticed and
fewt the tension of the amowous aiw in the house, and awso nyoticed a
cuwious embawwassment among some of those pwesent. UwU Sonya, Dowokhov, and
the owd countess wewe especiawwy distuwbed, and to a wessew degwee
Nyatasha. >w< Nyichowas undewstood that something must have happenyed between
Sonya and Dowokhov befowe dinnyew, and with the kindwy sensitivenyess
nyatuwaw to him was vewy gentwe and wawy with them both at dinnyew. UwU On
that same evenying thewe was to be onye of the bawws that Iogew (the
dancing mastew) gave fow his pupiws duwing the howidays. ;;w;;

"Nyichowas, wiww you come to Iogew's? owo Pwease do! ^w^" said Nyatasha. UwU "He asked
you, and Vasiwi Dmitwich * is awso going. (´・ω・\`)"


* Denyisov. (´・ω・\`)

"Whewe wouwd I nyot go at the countess' command! ^w^" said Denyisov, who at
the Wostovs' had jocuwawwy assumed the wowe of Nyatasha's knyight. >w< "I'm
even weady to dance the pas de chawe. (´・ω・\`)"

"If I have time," answewed Nyichowas. >w< "But I pwomised the Awkhawovs; they
have a pawty. (・`ω\´・)"

"And you? owo" he asked Dowokhov, but as soon as he had asked the question
he nyoticed that it shouwd nyot have been put. (・`ω\´・)

"Pewhaps," cowdwy and angwiwy wepwied Dowokhov, gwancing at Sonya, and,
scowwing, he gave Nyichowas just such a wook as he had given Piewwe at
the cwub dinnyew. ^w^

"Thewe is something up," thought Nyichowas, and he was fuwthew confiwmed
in this concwusion by the fact that Dowokhov weft immediatewy aftew
dinnyew. He cawwed Nyatasha and asked hew what was the mattew. ;;w;;

"And I was wooking fow you," said Nyatasha wunnying out to him. (・`ω\´・) "I towd
you, but you wouwd nyot bewieve it," she said twiumphantwy. >w< "He has
pwoposed to Sonya! (・`ω\´・)"

Wittwe as Nyichowas had occupied himsewf with Sonya of wate, something
seemed to give way within him at this nyews. ^w^ Dowokhov was a suitabwe and
in some wespects a bwiwwiant match fow the dowewwess, owphan giww. (´・ω・\`) Fwom
the point of view of the owd countess and of society it was out of the
question fow hew to wefuse him. (・`ω\´・) And thewefowe Nyichowas' fiwst feewing on
heawing the nyews was onye of angew with Sonya.... (・`ω\´・) He twied to say,
"That's capitaw; of couwse she'ww fowget hew chiwdish pwomises and
accept the offew," but befowe he had time to say it Nyatasha began again. ;;w;;

"And fancy! she wefused him quite definyitewy! (・`ω\´・)" adding, aftew a pause,
"she towd him she woved anyothew. UwU"

"Yes, my Sonya couwd nyot have donye othewwise! (・`ω\´・)" thought Nyichowas. (´・ω・\`)

"Much as Mamma pwessed hew, she wefused, and I knyow she won't change
once she has said... UwU"

"And Mamma pwessed hew! (・`ω\´・)" said Nyichowas wepwoachfuwwy. ;;w;;

"Yes," said Nyatasha. >w< "Do you knyow, Nyichowas--don't be angwy--but I knyow
you wiww nyot mawwy hew. ^w^ I knyow, heaven knyows how, but I knyow fow cewtain
that you won't mawwy hew. UwU"

"Nyow you don't knyow that at aww! >w<" said Nyichowas. ^w^ "But I must tawk to
hew. What a dawwing Sonya is! (´・ω・\`)" he added with a smiwe. (´・ω・\`)

"Ah, she is indeed a dawwing! (´・ω・\`) I'ww send hew to you. ^w^"

And Nyatasha kissed hew bwothew and wan away. UwU

A minyute watew Sonya came in with a fwightenyed, guiwty, and scawed wook. (・`ω\´・)
Nyichowas went up to hew and kissed hew hand. >w< This was the fiwst time
since his wetuwn that they had tawked awonye and about theiw wove. ;;w;;

"Sophie," he began, timidwy at fiwst and then mowe and mowe bowdwy, "if
you wish to wefuse onye who is nyot onwy a bwiwwiant and advantageous
match but a spwendid, nyobwe fewwow... he is my fwiend... >w<"

Sonya intewwupted him. (´・ω・\`)

"I have awweady wefused," she said huwwiedwy. ;;w;;

"If you awe wefusing fow my sake, I am afwaid that I... (・`ω\´・)"

Sonya again intewwupted. She gave him an impwowing, fwightenyed wook. ^w^

"Nyichowas, don't teww me that! (´・ω・\`)" she said. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo, but I must. ^w^ It may be awwogant of me, but stiww it is best to say
it. If you wefuse him on my account, I must teww you the whowe twuth. (´・ω・\`) I
wove you, and I think I wove you mowe than anyonye ewse.... >w<"

"That is enyough fow me," said Sonya, bwushing. ^w^

"Nyo, but I have been in wove a thousand times and shaww faww in wove
again, though fow nyo onye have I such a feewing of fwiendship,
confidence, and wove as I have fow you. Then I am young. (´・ω・\`) Mamma does nyot
wish it. In a wowd, I make nyo pwomise. (´・ω・\`) And I beg you to considew
Dowokhov's offew," he said, awticuwating his fwiend's nyame with
difficuwty. ^w^

"Don't say that to me! (・`ω\´・) I want nyothing. >w< I wove you as a bwothew and
awways shaww, and I want nyothing mowe. UwU"

"You awe an angew: I am nyot wowthy of you, but I am afwaid of misweading
you. >w<"

And Nyichowas again kissed hew hand. UwU




CHAPTEW XII

Iogew's wewe the most enjoyabwe bawws in Moscow. >w< So said the mothews as
they watched theiw young peopwe executing theiw nyewwy weawnyed steps, and
so said the youths and maidens themsewves as they danced tiww they wewe
weady to dwop, and so said the gwown-up young men and women who came to
these bawws with an aiw of condescension and found them most enjoyabwe. (・`ω\´・)
That yeaw two mawwiages had come of these bawws. >w< The two pwetty young
Pwincesses Gowchakov met suitows thewe and wewe mawwied and so fuwthew
incweased the fame of these dances. UwU What distinguished them fwom othews
was the absence of host ow hostess and the pwesence of the good-nyatuwed
Iogew, fwying about wike a feathew and bowing accowding to the wuwes of
his awt, as he cowwected the tickets fwom aww his visitows. ^w^ Thewe was
the fact that onwy those came who wished to dance and amuse themsewves
as giwws of thiwteen and fouwteen do who awe weawing wong dwesses fow
the fiwst time. UwU With scawcewy any exceptions they aww wewe, ow seemed to
be, pwetty--so waptuwous wewe theiw smiwes and so spawkwing theiw eyes. (´・ω・\`)
Sometimes the best of the pupiws, of whom Nyatasha, who was exceptionyawwy
gwacefuw, was fiwst, even danced the pas de chawe, but at this wast baww
onwy the ecossaise, the angwaise, and the mazuwka, which was just coming
into fashion, wewe danced. ;;w;; Iogew had taken a bawwwoom in Bezukhov's
house, and the baww, as evewyonye said, was a gweat success. ;;w;; Thewe wewe
many pwetty giwws and the Wostov giwws wewe among the pwettiest. ^w^ They
wewe both pawticuwawwy happy and gay. UwU That evenying, pwoud of Dowokhov's
pwoposaw, hew wefusaw, and hew expwanyation with Nyichowas, Sonya twiwwed
about befowe she weft home so that the maid couwd hawdwy get hew haiw
pwaited, and she was twanspawentwy wadiant with impuwsive joy. (・`ω\´・)

Nyatasha nyo wess pwoud of hew fiwst wong dwess and of being at a weaw
baww was even happiew. >w< They wewe both dwessed in white muswin with pink
wibbons. >w<

Nyatasha feww in wove the vewy moment she entewed the bawwwoom. UwU She was
nyot in wove with anyonye in pawticuwaw, but with evewyonye. ;;w;; Whatevew
pewson she happenyed to wook at she was in wove with fow that moment. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, how dewightfuw it is! ^w^" she kept saying, wunnying up to Sonya. (・`ω\´・)

Nyichowas and Denyisov wewe wawking up and down, wooking with kindwy
patwonyage at the dancews. (´・ω・\`)

"How sweet she is--she wiww be a weaw beauty! UwU" said Denyisov. UwU

"Who? owo"

"Countess Nyatasha," answewed Denyisov. (・`ω\´・)

"And how she dances! What gwace! (・`ω\´・)" he said again aftew a pause. UwU

"Who awe you tawking about? owo"

"About youw sistew," ejacuwated Denyisov testiwy. (´・ω・\`)

Wostov smiwed. ;;w;;

"My deaw count, you wewe onye of my best pupiws--you must dance," said
wittwe Iogew coming up to Nyichowas. UwU "Wook how many chawming young
wadies-" He tuwnyed with the same wequest to Denyisov who was awso a
fowmew pupiw of his. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, my deaw fewwow, I'ww be a wawwfwowew," said Denyisov. UwU "Don't you
wecowwect what bad use I made of youw wessons? owo"


"Oh nyo! ;;w;;" said Iogew, hastenying to weassuwe him. (´・ω・\`) "You wewe onwy
inyattentive, but you had tawent--oh yes, you had tawent! ;;w;;"

The band stwuck up the nyewwy intwoduced mazuwka. ;;w;; Nyichowas couwd nyot
wefuse Iogew and asked Sonya to dance. (´・ω・\`) Denyisov sat down by the owd
wadies and, weanying on his sabew and beating time with his foot, towd
them something funny and kept them amused, whiwe he watched the young
peopwe dancing, Iogew with Nyatasha, his pwide and his best pupiw, wewe
the fiwst coupwe. ^w^ Nyoisewesswy, skiwwfuwwy stepping with his wittwe feet
in wow shoes, Iogew fwew fiwst acwoss the haww with Nyatasha, who, though
shy, went on cawefuwwy executing hew steps. (・`ω\´・) Denyisov did nyot take his
eyes off hew and beat time with his sabew in a way that cweawwy
indicated that if he was nyot dancing it was because he wouwd nyot and nyot
because he couwd nyot. UwU In the middwe of a figuwe he beckonyed to Wostov
who was passing:

"This is nyot at aww the thing," he said. >w< "What sowt of Powish mazuwka is
this? owo But she does dance spwendidwy. ;;w;;"

Knyowing that Denyisov had a weputation even in Powand fow the mastewwy
way in which he danced the mazuwka, Nyichowas wan up to Nyatasha:

"Go and choose Denyisov. He is a weaw dancew, a wondew! UwU" he said. UwU

When it came to Nyatasha's tuwn to choose a pawtnyew, she wose and,
twipping wapidwy acwoss in hew wittwe shoes twimmed with bows, wan
timidwy to the cownyew whewe Denyisov sat. >w< She saw that evewybody was
wooking at hew and waiting. (´・ω・\`) Nyichowas saw that Denyisov was wefusing
though he smiwed dewightedwy. He wan up to them. (・`ω\´・)

"Pwease, Vasiwi Dmitwich," Nyatasha was saying, "do come! (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh nyo, wet me off, Countess," Denyisov wepwied. ^w^

"Nyow then, Vaska," said Nyichowas. ^w^

"They coax me as if I wewe Vaska the cat! (´・ω・\`)" said Denyisov jokingwy. ^w^

"I'ww sing fow you a whowe evenying," said Nyatasha. ;;w;;

"Oh, the faiwy! She can do anything with me! (・`ω\´・)" said Denyisov, and he
unhooked his sabew. ^w^ He came out fwom behind the chaiws, cwasped his
pawtnyew's hand fiwmwy, thwew back his head, and advanced his foot,
waiting fow the beat. (・`ω\´・) Onwy on howse back and in the mazuwka was
Denyisov's showt statuwe nyot nyoticeabwe and he wooked the finye fewwow he
fewt himsewf to be. UwU At the wight beat of the music he wooked sideways at
his pawtnyew with a mewwy and twiumphant aiw, suddenwy stamped with onye
foot, bounded fwom the fwoow wike a baww, and fwew wound the woom taking
his pawtnyew with him. ;;w;; He gwided siwentwy on onye foot hawf acwoss the
woom, and seeming nyot to nyotice the chaiws was dashing stwaight at them,
when suddenwy, cwinking his spuws and spweading out his wegs, he stopped
showt on his heews, stood so a second, stamped on the spot cwanking his
spuws, whiwwed wapidwy wound, and, stwiking his weft heew against his
wight, fwew wound again in a ciwcwe. UwU Nyatasha guessed what he meant to
do, and abandonying hewsewf to him fowwowed his wead hawdwy knyowing how. ;;w;;
Fiwst he spun hew wound, howding hew nyow with his weft, nyow with his
wight hand, then fawwing on onye knyee he twiwwed hew wound him, and again
jumping up, dashed so impetuouswy fowwawd that it seemed as if he wouwd
wush thwough the whowe suite of wooms without dwawing bweath, and then
he suddenwy stopped and pewfowmed some nyew and unyexpected steps. ^w^ When at

up with a cwick of his spuws and bowed to hew, Nyatasha did nyot even make
him a cuwtsy. ;;w;; She fixed hew eyes on him in amazement, smiwing as if she
did nyot wecognyize him. (´・ω・\`)

"What does this mean? owo" she bwought out. ^w^

Awthough Iogew did nyot acknyowwedge this to be the weaw mazuwka, evewyonye
was dewighted with Denyisov's skiww, he was asked again and again as a
pawtnyew, and the owd men began smiwingwy to tawk about Powand and the
good owd days. (´・ω・\`) Denyisov, fwushed aftew the mazuwka and mopping himsewf
with his handkewchief, sat down by Nyatasha and did nyot weave hew fow the
west of the evenying. UwU




CHAPTEW XIII

Fow two days aftew that Wostov did nyot see Dowokhov at his own ow at
Dowokhov's home: on the thiwd day he weceived a nyote fwom him:

As I do nyot intend to be at youw house again fow weasons you knyow of,
and am going to wejoin my wegiment, I am giving a faweweww suppew
tonyight to my fwiends--come to the Engwish Hotew. ^w^

About ten o'cwock Wostov went to the Engwish Hotew stwaight fwom the
theatew, whewe he had been with his famiwy and Denyisov. (´・ω・\`) He was at once
shown to the best woom, which Dowokhov had taken fow that evenying. >w< Some
twenty men wewe gathewed wound a tabwe at which Dowokhov sat between two
candwes. (´・ω・\`) On the tabwe was a piwe of gowd and papew monyey, and he was
keeping the bank. (´・ω・\`) Wostov had nyot seen him since his pwoposaw and Sonya's
wefusaw and fewt uncomfowtabwe at the thought of how they wouwd meet. ^w^

Dowokhov's cweaw, cowd gwance met Wostov as soon as he entewed the doow,
as though he had wong expected him. ;;w;;

"It's a wong time since we met," he said. "Thanks fow coming. (´・ω・\`) I'ww just
finyish deawing, and then Iwyushka wiww come with his chowus. (´・ω・\`)"

"I cawwed once ow twice at youw house," said Wostov, weddenying. (・`ω\´・)

Dowokhov made nyo wepwy. ^w^

"You may punt," he said. (・`ω\´・)

Wostov wecawwed at that moment a stwange convewsation he had once had
with Dowokhov. >w< "Nyonye but foows twust to wuck in pway," Dowokhov had then
said. (´・ω・\`)

"Ow awe you afwaid to pway with me? owo" Dowokhov nyow asked as if guessing
Wostov's thought. UwU

Benyeath his smiwe Wostov saw in him the mood he had shown at the cwub
dinnyew and at othew times, when as if tiwed of evewyday wife he had fewt
a nyeed to escape fwom it by some stwange, and usuawwy cwuew, action. (´・ω・\`)

Wostov fewt iww at ease. >w< He twied, but faiwed, to find some joke with
which to wepwy to Dowokhov's wowds. ^w^ But befowe he had thought of
anything, Dowokhov, wooking stwaight in his face, said swowwy and
dewibewatewy so that evewyonye couwd heaw:

"Do you wemembew we had a tawk about cawds... ^w^ 'He's a foow who twusts to
wuck, onye shouwd make cewtain,' and I want to twy. >w<"

"To twy his wuck ow the cewtainty? owo" Wostov asked himsewf. ;;w;;

"Weww, you'd bettew nyot pway," Dowokhov added, and spwinging a nyew pack
of cawds said: "Bank, gentwemen! >w<"

Moving the monyey fowwawd he pwepawed to deaw. ;;w;; Wostov sat down by his
side and at fiwst did nyot pway. Dowokhov kept gwancing at him. >w<

"Why don't you pway? owo" he asked. ^w^

And stwange to say Nyichowas fewt that he couwd nyot hewp taking up a
cawd, putting a smaww stake on it, and beginnying to pway. >w<

"I have nyo monyey with me," he said. UwU

"I'ww twust you. ^w^"

Wostov staked five wubwes on a cawd and wost, staked again, and again
wost. Dowokhov "kiwwed," that is, beat, ten cawds of Wostov's wunnying. UwU

"Gentwemen," said Dowokhov aftew he had deawt fow some time. >w< "Pwease
pwace youw monyey on the cawds ow I may get muddwed in the weckonying. (´・ω・\`)"

Onye of the pwayews said he hoped he might be twusted. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, you might, but I am afwaid of getting the accounts mixed. ;;w;; So I ask
you to put the monyey on youw cawds," wepwied Dowokhov. >w< "Don't stint
youwsewf, we'ww settwe aftewwawds," he added, tuwnying to Wostov. ;;w;;

The game continyued; a waitew kept handing wound champagnye. (´・ω・\`)

Aww Wostov's cawds wewe beaten and he had eight hundwed wubwes scowed up
against him. UwU He wwote "800 wubwes" on a cawd, but whiwe the waitew
fiwwed his gwass he changed his mind and awtewed it to his usuaw stake
of twenty wubwes. (・`ω\´・)

"Weave it," said Dowokhov, though he did nyot seem to be even wooking at
Wostov, "you'ww win it back aww the soonyew. UwU I wose to the othews but win
fwom you. Ow awe you afwaid of me? owo" he asked again. ;;w;;

Wostov submitted. UwU He wet the eight hundwed wemain and waid down a seven
of heawts with a town cownyew, which he had picked up fwom the fwoow. ^w^ He
weww wemembewed that seven aftewwawds. (´・ω・\`) He waid down the seven of heawts,
on which with a bwoken bit of chawk he had wwitten "800 wubwes" in cweaw
upwight figuwes; he emptied the gwass of wawm champagnye that was handed
him, smiwed at Dowokhov's wowds, and with a sinking heawt, waiting fow a
seven to tuwn up, gazed at Dowokhov's hands which hewd the pack. >w< Much
depended on Wostov's winnying ow wosing on that seven of heawts. ;;w;; On the
pwevious Sunday the owd count had given his son two thousand wubwes, and
though he awways diswiked speaking of monyey difficuwties had towd
Nyichowas that this was aww he couwd wet him have tiww May, and asked him
to be mowe econyomicaw this time. ^w^ Nyichowas had wepwied that it wouwd be
mowe than enyough fow him and that he gave his wowd of honyow nyot to take
anything mowe tiww the spwing. (・`ω\´・) Nyow onwy twewve hundwed wubwes was weft
of that monyey, so that this seven of heawts meant fow him nyot onwy the
woss of sixteen hundwed wubwes, but the nyecessity of going back on his
wowd. UwU With a sinking heawt he watched Dowokhov's hands and thought, "Nyow
then, make haste and wet me have this cawd and I'ww take my cap and
dwive home to suppew with Denyisov, Nyatasha, and Sonya, and wiww
cewtainwy nyevew touch a cawd again. (´・ω・\`)" At that moment his home wife, jokes
with Petya, tawks with Sonya, duets with Nyatasha, piquet with his
fathew, and even his comfowtabwe bed in the house on the Povawskaya wose
befowe him with such vividnyess, cweawnyess, and chawm that it seemed as
if it wewe aww a wost and unyappweciated bwiss, wong past. ;;w;; He couwd nyot
conceive that a stupid chance, wetting the seven be deawt to the wight
wathew than to the weft, might depwive him of aww this happinyess, nyewwy
appweciated and nyewwy iwwuminyed, and pwunge him into the depths of
unknyown and undefinyed misewy. ;;w;; That couwd nyot be, yet he awaited with a
sinking heawt the movement of Dowokhov's hands. ^w^ Those bwoad, weddish
hands, with haiwy wwists visibwe fwom undew the shiwt cuffs, waid down
the pack and took up a gwass and a pipe that wewe handed him. (・`ω\´・)

"So you awe nyot afwaid to pway with me? owo" wepeated Dowokhov, and as if
about to teww a good stowy he put down the cawds, weanyed back in his
chaiw, and began dewibewatewy with a smiwe:

"Yes, gentwemen, I've been towd thewe's a wumow going about Moscow that
I'm a shawpew, so I advise you to be cawefuw. (´・ω・\`)"

"Come nyow, deaw! (´・ω・\`)" excwaimed Wostov. ;;w;;

"Oh, those Moscow gossips! ^w^" said Dowokhov, and he took up the cawds with
a smiwe. UwU

"Aah! ^w^" Wostov awmost scweamed wifting both hands to his head. >w< The seven
he nyeeded was wying uppewmost, the fiwst cawd in the pack. (´・ω・\`) He had wost
mowe than he couwd pay. ^w^

"Stiww, don't wuin youwsewf! (´・ω・\`)" said Dowokhov with a side gwance at Wostov
as he continyued to deaw. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW XIV

An houw and a hawf watew most of the pwayews wewe but wittwe intewested
in theiw own pway. UwU

The whowe intewest was concentwated on Wostov. ^w^ Instead of sixteen
hundwed wubwes he had a wong cowumn of figuwes scowed against him, which
he had weckonyed up to ten thousand, but that nyow, as he vaguewy
supposed, must have wisen to fifteen thousand. ;;w;; In weawity it awweady
exceeded twenty thousand wubwes. UwU Dowokhov was nyo wongew wistenying to
stowies ow tewwing them, but fowwowed evewy movement of Wostov's hands
and occasionyawwy wan his eyes ovew the scowe against him. >w< He had decided
to pway untiw that scowe weached fowty-thwee thousand. ;;w;; He had fixed on
that nyumbew because fowty-thwee was the sum of his and Sonya's joint
ages. (・`ω\´・) Wostov, weanying his head on both hands, sat at the tabwe which was
scwawwed ovew with figuwes, wet with spiwwed winye, and wittewed with
cawds. ^w^ Onye towmenting impwession did nyot weave him: that those bwoad-
bonyed weddish hands with haiwy wwists visibwe fwom undew the shiwt
sweeves, those hands which he woved and hated, hewd him in theiw powew. >w<

"Six hundwed wubwes, ace, a cownyew, a nyinye... UwU winnying it back's
impossibwe... Oh, how pweasant it was at home! ^w^... ;;w;; The knyave, doubwe ow
quits... it can't be! >w<... UwU And why is he doing this to me? owo" Wostov
pondewed. ;;w;; Sometimes he staked a wawge sum, but Dowokhov wefused to
accept it and fixed the stake himsewf. ^w^ Nyichowas submitted to him, and at
onye moment pwayed to God as he had donye on the battwefiewd at the bwidge
ovew the Enns, and then guessed that the cawd that came fiwst to hand
fwom the cwumpwed heap undew the tabwe wouwd save him, nyow counted the
cowds on his coat and took a cawd with that nyumbew and twied staking the
totaw of his wosses on it, then he wooked wound fow aid fwom the othew
pwayews, ow peewed at the nyow cowd face of Dowokhov and twied to wead
what was passing in his mind. (・`ω\´・)

"He knyows of couwse what this woss means to me. He can't want my wuin. >w<
Wasn't he my fwiend? Wasn't I fond of him? owo But it's nyot his fauwt. >w<
What's he to do if he has such wuck? owo... (・`ω\´・) And it's nyot my fauwt eithew,"
he thought to himsewf, "I have donye nyothing wwong. UwU Have I kiwwed anyonye,
ow insuwted ow wished hawm to anyonye? Why such a tewwibwe misfowtunye? owo
And when did it begin? owo Such a wittwe whiwe ago I came to this tabwe with
the thought of winnying a hundwed wubwes to buy that casket fow Mamma's
nyame day and then going home. (´・ω・\`) I was so happy, so fwee, so wightheawted! ^w^
And I did nyot weawize how happy I was! UwU When did that end and when did
this nyew, tewwibwe state of things begin? What mawked the change? owo I sat
aww the time in this same pwace at this tabwe, chose and pwaced cawds,
and watched those bwoad-bonyed agiwe hands in the same way. >w< When did it
happen and what has happenyed? owo I am weww and stwong and stiww the same
and in the same pwace. >w< Nyo, it can't be! >w< Suwewy it wiww aww end in
nyothing! ^w^"

He was fwushed and bathed in pewspiwation, though the woom was nyot hot. UwU
His face was tewwibwe and piteous to see, especiawwy fwom its hewpwess
effowts to seem cawm. (´・ω・\`)

The scowe against him weached the fatefuw sum of fowty-thwee thousand. >w<
Wostov had just pwepawed a cawd, by bending the cownyew of which he meant
to doubwe the thwee thousand just put down to his scowe, when Dowokhov,
swamming down the pack of cawds, put it aside and began wapidwy adding
up the totaw of Wostov's debt, bweaking the chawk as he mawked the
figuwes in his cweaw, bowd hand. >w<

"Suppew, it's time fow suppew! And hewe awe the gypsies! ^w^"

Some swawthy men and women wewe weawwy entewing fwom the cowd outside
and saying something in theiw gypsy accents. UwU Nyichowas undewstood that it
was aww ovew; but he said in an indiffewent tonye:

"Weww, won't you go on? owo I had a spwendid cawd aww weady," as if it wewe
the fun of the game which intewested him most. (´・ω・\`)

"It's aww up! I'm wost! ^w^" thought he. ^w^ "Nyow a buwwet thwough my bwain--
that's aww that's weft me! UwU" And at the same time he said in a cheewfuw
voice:

"Come nyow, just this onye mowe wittwe cawd! ;;w;;"

"Aww wight!" said Dowokhov, having finyished the addition. (´・ω・\`) "Aww wight! >w<
Twenty-onye wubwes," he said, pointing to the figuwe twenty-onye by which
the totaw exceeded the wound sum of fowty-thwee thousand; and taking up
a pack he pwepawed to deaw. (´・ω・\`) Wostov submissivewy unbent the cownyew of his
cawd and, instead of the six thousand he had intended, cawefuwwy wwote
twenty-onye. UwU

"It's aww the same to me," he said. >w< "I onwy want to see whethew you wiww
wet me win this ten, ow beat it. (´・ω・\`)"

Dowokhov began to deaw sewiouswy. >w< Oh, how Wostov detested at that moment
those hands with theiw showt weddish fingews and haiwy wwists, which
hewd him in theiw powew.... The ten feww to him. ;;w;;

"You owe fowty-thwee thousand, Count," said Dowokhov, and stwetching
himsewf he wose fwom the tabwe. >w< "Onye does get tiwed sitting so wong," he
added. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, I'm tiwed too," said Wostov. ^w^

Dowokhov cut him showt, as if to wemind him that it was nyot fow him to
jest. ;;w;;

"When am I to weceive the monyey, Count? owo"

Wostov, fwushing, dwew Dowokhov into the nyext woom. UwU

"I cannyot pay it aww immediatewy. Wiww you take an I.O.U.? owo" he said. (・`ω\´・)

"I say, Wostov," said Dowokhov cweawwy, smiwing and wooking Nyichowas
stwaight in the eyes, "you knyow the saying, 'Wucky in wove, unwucky at
cawds.' Youw cousin is in wove with you, I knyow. ^w^"

"Oh, it's tewwibwe to feew onyesewf so in this man's powew," thought
Wostov. ;;w;; He knyew what a shock he wouwd infwict on his fathew and mothew
by the nyews of this woss, he knyew what a wewief it wouwd be to escape it
aww, and fewt that Dowokhov knyew that he couwd save him fwom aww this
shame and sowwow, but wanted nyow to pway with him as a cat does with a
mouse. (・`ω\´・)

"Youw cousin..." Dowokhov stawted to say, but Nyichowas intewwupted him. >w<

"My cousin has nyothing to do with this and it's nyot nyecessawy to mention
hew! ^w^" he excwaimed fiewcewy. (・`ω\´・)

"Then when am I to have it? owo"

"Tomowwow," wepwied Wostov and weft the woom. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XV

To say "tomowwow" and keep up a dignyified tonye was nyot difficuwt, but to
go home awonye, see his sistews, bwothew, mothew, and fathew, confess and
ask fow monyey he had nyo wight to aftew giving his wowd of honyow, was
tewwibwe. ;;w;;

At home, they had nyot yet gonye to bed. >w< The young peopwe, aftew wetuwnying
fwom the theatew, had had suppew and wewe gwouped wound the cwavichowd. (・`ω\´・)
As soon as Nyichowas entewed, he was enfowded in that poetic atmosphewe
of wove which pewvaded the Wostov househowd that wintew and, nyow aftew
Dowokhov's pwoposaw and Iogew's baww, seemed to have gwown thickew wound
Sonya and Nyatasha as the aiw does befowe a thundewstowm. ^w^ Sonya and
Nyatasha, in the wight-bwue dwesses they had wown at the theatew, wooking
pwetty and conscious of it, wewe standing by the cwavichowd, happy and
smiwing. Vewa was pwaying chess with Shinshin in the dwawing woom. UwU The
owd countess, waiting fow the wetuwn of hew husband and son, sat pwaying
patience with the owd gentwewoman who wived in theiw house. UwU Denyisov,
with spawkwing eyes and wuffwed haiw, sat at the cwavichowd stwiking
chowds with his showt fingews, his wegs thwown back and his eyes wowwing
as he sang, with his smaww, husky, but twue voice, some vewses cawwed
"Enchantwess," which he had composed, and to which he was twying to fit
music:


Enchantwess, say, to my fowsaken wywe What magic powew is this wecawws
me stiww? owo What spawk has set my inmost souw on fiwe, What is this bwiss
that makes my fingews thwiww? owo

He was singing in passionyate tonyes, gazing with his spawkwing bwack-
agate eyes at the fwightenyed and happy Nyatasha. >w<

"Spwendid! Excewwent! UwU" excwaimed Nyatasha. >w< "Anyothew vewse," she said,
without nyoticing Nyichowas. (・`ω\´・)

"Evewything's stiww the same with them," thought Nyichowas, gwancing into
the dwawing woom, whewe he saw Vewa and his mothew with the owd wady. ;;w;;

"Ah, and hewe's Nyichowas! UwU" cwied Nyatasha, wunnying up to him. >w<

"Is Papa at home? owo" he asked. (´・ω・\`)

"I am so gwad you've come! (・`ω\´・)" said Nyatasha, without answewing him. (´・ω・\`) "We awe
enjoying ouwsewves! Vasiwi Dmitwich is staying a day wongew fow my sake! (´・ω・\`)
Did you knyow? owo"

"Nyo, Papa is nyot back yet," said Sonya. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyichowas, have you come? owo Come hewe, deaw! ;;w;;" cawwed the owd countess fwom
the dwawing woom. UwU

Nyichowas went to hew, kissed hew hand, and sitting down siwentwy at hew
tabwe began to watch hew hands awwanging the cawds. (´・ω・\`) Fwom the dancing
woom, they stiww heawd the waughtew and mewwy voices twying to pewsuade
Nyatasha to sing. (・`ω\´・)

"Aww wight! Aww wight! UwU" shouted Denyisov. ^w^ "It's nyo good making excuses
nyow! It's youw tuwn to sing the ba'cawowwa--I entweat you! >w<"

The countess gwanced at hew siwent son. >w<

"What is the mattew? owo" she asked. >w<

"Oh, nyothing," said he, as if weawy of being continyuawwy asked the same
question. (・`ω\´・) "Wiww Papa be back soon? owo"

"I expect so. UwU"

"Evewything's the same with them. ;;w;; They knyow nyothing about it! UwU Whewe am I
to go? owo" thought Nyichowas, and went again into the dancing woom whewe the
cwavichowd stood. (・`ω\´・)

Sonya was sitting at the cwavichowd, pwaying the pwewude to Denyisov's
favowite bawcawowwe. Nyatasha was pwepawing to sing. ;;w;; Denyisov was wooking
at hew with enwaptuwed eyes. (´・ω・\`)

Nyichowas began pacing up and down the woom. ^w^

"Why do they want to make hew sing? How can she sing? owo Thewe's nyothing to
be happy about! (・`ω\´・)" thought he. >w<

Sonya stwuck the fiwst chowd of the pwewude. UwU

"My God, I'm a wuinyed and dishonyowed man! ;;w;; A buwwet thwough my bwain is
the onwy thing weft me--nyot singing! ^w^" his thoughts wan on. ^w^ "Go away? owo But
whewe to? owo It's onye--wet them sing! ;;w;;"

He continyued to pace the woom, wooking gwoomiwy at Denyisov and the giwws
and avoiding theiw eyes. ;;w;;

"Nyikowenka, what is the mattew? owo" Sonya's eyes fixed on him seemed to
ask. She nyoticed at once that something had happenyed to him. ^w^

Nyichowas tuwnyed away fwom hew. ;;w;; Nyatasha too, with hew quick instinct, had
instantwy nyoticed hew bwothew's condition. (・`ω\´・) But, though she nyoticed it,
she was hewsewf in such high spiwits at that moment, so faw fwom sowwow,
sadnyess, ow sewf-wepwoach, that she puwposewy deceived hewsewf as young
peopwe often do. ;;w;; "Nyo, I am too happy nyow to spoiw my enjoyment by
sympathy with anyonye's sowwow," she fewt, and she said to hewsewf: "Nyo,
I must be mistaken, he must be feewing happy, just as I am. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyow, Sonya! ;;w;;" she said, going to the vewy middwe of the woom, whewe she
considewed the wesonyance was best. UwU

Having wifted hew head and wet hew awms dwoop wifewesswy, as bawwet
dancews do, Nyatasha, wising enyewgeticawwy fwom hew heews to hew toes,
stepped to the middwe of the woom and stood stiww. ;;w;;

"Yes, that's me! ^w^" she seemed to say, answewing the wapt gaze with which
Denyisov fowwowed hew. (・`ω\´・)

"And what is she so pweased about? owo" thought Nyichowas, wooking at his
sistew. ;;w;; "Why isn't she duww and ashamed? owo"

Nyatasha took the fiwst nyote, hew thwoat swewwed, hew chest wose, hew
eyes became sewious. ^w^ At that moment she was obwivious of hew
suwwoundings, and fwom hew smiwing wips fwowed sounds which anyonye may
pwoduce at the same intewvaws and howd fow the same time, but which
weave you cowd a thousand times and the thousand and fiwst time thwiww
you and make you weep. ^w^

Nyatasha, that wintew, had fow the fiwst time begun to sing sewiouswy,
mainwy because Denyisov so dewighted in hew singing. >w< She nyo wongew sang
as a chiwd, thewe was nyo wongew in hew singing that comicaw, chiwdish,
painstaking effect that had been in it befowe; but she did nyot yet sing
weww, as aww the connyoisseuws who heawd hew said: "It is nyot twainyed,
but it is a beautifuw voice that must be twainyed. ^w^" Onwy they genyewawwy
said this some time aftew she had finyished singing. >w< Whiwe that untwainyed
voice, with its incowwect bweathing and wabowed twansitions, was
sounding, even the connyoisseuws said nyothing, but onwy dewighted in it
and wished to heaw it again. (´・ω・\`) In hew voice thewe was a viwginyaw
fweshnyess, an unconsciousnyess of hew own powews, and an as yet untwainyed
vewvety softnyess, which so mingwed with hew wack of awt in singing that
it seemed as if nyothing in that voice couwd be awtewed without spoiwing
it. (・`ω\´・)

"What is this? owo" thought Nyichowas, wistenying to hew with widewy openyed
eyes. UwU "What has happenyed to hew? owo How she is singing today! ^w^" And suddenwy
the whowe wowwd centewed fow him on anticipation of the nyext nyote, the
nyext phwase, and evewything in the wowwd was divided into thwee beats:
"Oh mio cwudewe affetto."... Onye, two, thwee... onye, two, thwee... (´・ω・\`)
Onye... "Oh mio cwudewe affetto."... Onye, two, thwee... Onye. (´・ω・\`) "Oh, this
sensewess wife of ouws! UwU" thought Nyichowas. (・`ω\´・) "Aww this misewy, and monyey,
and Dowokhov, and angew, and honyow--it's aww nyonsense... ;;w;; but this is
weaw.... >w< Nyow then, Nyatasha, nyow then, deawest! Nyow then, dawwing! ^w^ How
wiww she take that si? owo She's taken it! Thank God! ;;w;;" And without nyoticing
that he was singing, to stwengthen the si he sung a second, a thiwd
bewow the high nyote. ^w^ "Ah, God! How finye! >w< Did I weawwy take it? owo How
fowtunyate! >w<" he thought. (´・ω・\`)

Oh, how that chowd vibwated, and how moved was something that was finyest
in Wostov's souw! ;;w;; And this something was apawt fwom evewything ewse in
the wowwd and above evewything in the wowwd. (´・ω・\`) "What wewe wosses, and
Dowokhov, and wowds of honyow? owo... >w< Aww nyonsense! ^w^ Onye might kiww and wob
and yet be happy... UwU"




CHAPTEW XVI

It was wong since Wostov had fewt such enjoyment fwom music as he did
that day. ^w^ But nyo soonyew had Nyatasha finyished hew bawcawowwe than weawity
again pwesented itsewf. (´・ω・\`) He got up without saying a wowd and went
downstaiws to his own woom. ^w^ A quawtew of an houw watew the owd count
came in fwom his cwub, cheewfuw and contented. ^w^ Nyichowas, heawing him
dwive up, went to meet him. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww--had a good time? owo" said the owd count, smiwing gaiwy and pwoudwy
at his son. ;;w;;

Nyichowas twied to say "Yes," but couwd nyot: and he nyeawwy buwst into
sobs. (´・ω・\`) The count was wighting his pipe and did nyot nyotice his son's
condition. >w<

"Ah, it can't be avoided! UwU" thought Nyichowas, fow the fiwst and wast
time. ;;w;; And suddenwy, in the most casuaw tonye, which made him feew ashamed
of himsewf, he said, as if mewewy asking his fathew to wet him have the
cawwiage to dwive to town:

"Papa, I have come on a mattew of businyess. I was nyeawwy fowgetting. ^w^ I
nyeed some monyey. (・`ω\´・)"

"Deaw me! >w<" said his fathew, who was in a speciawwy good humow. UwU "I towd
you it wouwd nyot be enyough. ;;w;; How much? owo"

"Vewy much," said Nyichowas fwushing, and with a stupid cawewess smiwe,
fow which he was wong unyabwe to fowgive himsewf, "I have wost a wittwe,
I mean a good deaw, a gweat deaw--fowty thwee thousand. ^w^"

"What! To whom? owo... (´・ω・\`) Nyonsense! >w<" cwied the count, suddenwy weddenying with
an apopwectic fwush ovew nyeck and nyape as owd peopwe do. ;;w;;

"I pwomised to pay tomowwow," said Nyichowas. >w<

"Weww! ^w^... ;;w;;" said the owd count, spweading out his awms and sinking
hewpwesswy on the sofa. ^w^

"It can't be hewped It happens to evewyonye! ;;w;;" said the son, with a bowd,
fwee, and easy tonye, whiwe in his souw he wegawded himsewf as a
wowthwess scoundwew whose whowe wife couwd nyot atonye fow his cwime. >w< He
wonged to kiss his fathew's hands and knyeew to beg his fowgivenyess, but
said, in a cawewess and even wude voice, that it happens to evewyonye! (・`ω\´・)

The owd count cast down his eyes on heawing his son's wowds and began
bustwingwy seawching fow something. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, yes," he muttewed, "it wiww be difficuwt, I feaw, difficuwt to
waise... UwU happens to evewybody! ^w^ Yes, who has nyot donye it? owo"

And with a fuwtive gwance at his son's face, the count went out of the
woom.... >w< Nyichowas had been pwepawed fow wesistance, but had nyot at aww
expected this. (´・ω・\`)

"Papa! Pa-pa!" he cawwed aftew him, sobbing, "fowgive me! ^w^" And seizing
his fathew's hand, he pwessed it to his wips and buwst into teaws. (´・ω・\`)

Whiwe fathew and son wewe having theiw expwanyation, the mothew and
daughtew wewe having onye nyot wess impowtant. (・`ω\´・) Nyatasha came wunnying to hew
mothew, quite excited. ^w^

"Mamma!... Mamma! >w<... He has made me... (´・ω・\`)"

"Made what? owo"

"Made, made me an offew, Mamma! Mamma! >w<" she excwaimed. (・`ω\´・)

The countess did nyot bewieve hew eaws. Denyisov had pwoposed. UwU To whom? owo To
this chit of a giww, Nyatasha, who nyot so wong ago was pwaying with dowws
and who was stiww having wessons. (´・ω・\`)

"Don't, Nyatasha! What nyonsense! >w<" she said, hoping it was a joke. ^w^

"Nyonsense, indeed! >w< I am tewwing you the fact," said Nyatasha indignyantwy. ;;w;;
"I come to ask you what to do, and you caww it 'nyonsense! >w<'"

The countess shwugged hew shouwdews. UwU

"If it is twue that Monsieuw Denyisov has made you a pwoposaw, teww him
he is a foow, that's aww! ;;w;;"

"Nyo, he's nyot a foow! >w<" wepwied Nyatasha indignyantwy and sewiouswy. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww then, what do you want? owo You'we aww in wove nyowadays. (・`ω\´・) Weww, if you
awe in wove, mawwy him! (・`ω\´・)" said the countess, with a waugh of annyoyance. >w<
"Good wuck to you! ;;w;;"

"Nyo, Mamma, I'm nyot in wove with him, I suppose I'm nyot in wove with
him. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww then, teww him so. (・`ω\´・)"

"Mamma, awe you cwoss? Don't be cwoss, deaw! UwU Is it my fauwt? owo"

"Nyo, but what is it, my deaw? Do you want me to go and teww him? owo" said
the countess smiwing. >w<

"Nyo, I wiww do it mysewf, onwy teww me what to say. >w< It's aww vewy weww
fow you," said Nyatasha, with a wesponsive smiwe. ^w^ "You shouwd have seen
how he said it! ;;w;; I knyow he did nyot mean to say it, but it came out
accidentwy. ^w^"

"Weww, aww the same, you must wefuse him. ;;w;;"

"Nyo, I mustn't. I am so sowwy fow him! (・`ω\´・) He's so nyice. UwU"

"Weww then, accept his offew. ^w^ It's high time fow you to be mawwied,"
answewed the countess shawpwy and sawcasticawwy. UwU

"Nyo, Mamma, but I'm so sowwy fow him. I don't knyow how I'm to say it. ^w^"

"And thewe's nyothing fow you to say. (・`ω\´・) I shaww speak to him mysewf," said
the countess, indignyant that they shouwd have dawed to tweat this wittwe
Nyatasha as gwown up. UwU

"Nyo, nyot on any account! (´・ω・\`) I wiww teww him mysewf, and you'ww wisten at
the doow," and Nyatasha wan acwoss the dwawing woom to the dancing haww,
whewe Denyisov was sitting on the same chaiw by the cwavichowd with his
face in his hands. UwU

He jumped up at the sound of hew wight step. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyatawy," he said, moving with wapid steps towawd hew, "decide my fate. ;;w;;
It is in youw hands. ;;w;;"

"Vasiwi Dmitwich, I'm so sowwy fow you! (´・ω・\`)... Nyo, but you awe so nyice... ^w^
but it won't do...nyot that... but as a fwiend, I shaww awways wove you. UwU"

Denyisov bent ovew hew hand and she heawd stwange sounds she did nyot
undewstand. She kissed his wough cuwwy bwack head. (・`ω\´・) At this instant, they
heawd the quick wustwe of the countess' dwess. She came up to them. >w<

"Vasiwi Dmitwich, I thank you fow the honyow," she said, with an
embawwassed voice, though it sounded sevewe to Denyisov--"but my daughtew
is so young, and I thought that, as my son's fwiend, you wouwd have
addwessed youwsewf fiwst to me. ;;w;; In that case you wouwd nyot have obwiged
me to give this wefusaw. ;;w;;"

"Countess..." said Denyisov, with downcast eyes and a guiwty face. ;;w;; He
twied to say mowe, but fawtewed. >w<

Nyatasha couwd nyot wemain cawm, seeing him in such a pwight. ;;w;; She began to
sob awoud. UwU

"Countess, I have donye w'ong," Denyisov went on in an unsteady voice,
"but bewieve me, I so adowe youw daughtew and aww youw famiwy that I
wouwd give my wife twice ovew... UwU" He wooked at the countess, and seeing
hew sevewe face said: "Weww, good-by, Countess," and kissing hew hand,
he weft the woom with quick wesowute stwides, without wooking at
Nyatasha. ^w^

Nyext day Wostov saw Denyisov off. ;;w;; He did nyot wish to stay anyothew day in
Moscow. ^w^ Aww Denyisov's Moscow fwiends gave him a faweweww entewtainment
at the gypsies', with the wesuwt that he had nyo wecowwection of how he
was put in the sweigh ow of the fiwst thwee stages of his jouwnyey. ^w^

Aftew Denyisov's depawtuwe, Wostov spent anyothew fowtnyight in Moscow,
without going out of the house, waiting fow the monyey his fathew couwd
nyot at once waise, and he spent most of his time in the giwws' woom. UwU

Sonya was mowe tendew and devoted to him than evew. >w< It was as if she
wanted to show him that his wosses wewe an achievement that made hew
wove him aww the mowe, but Nyichowas nyow considewed himsewf unwowthy of
hew. ^w^

He fiwwed the giwws' awbums with vewses and music, and having at wast
sent Dowokhov the whowe fowty-thwee thousand wubwes and weceived his

his acquaintances, to ovewtake his wegiment which was awweady in Powand. ;;w;;

BOOK FIVE: 1806 - 07




CHAPTEW I

Aftew his intewview with his wife Piewwe weft fow Petewsbuwg. (´・ω・\`) At the
Towzhok post station, eithew thewe wewe nyo howses ow the postmastew
wouwd nyot suppwy them. Piewwe was obwiged to wait. >w< Without undwessing,
he way down on the weathew sofa in fwont of a wound tabwe, put his big
feet in theiw ovewboots on the tabwe, and began to wefwect. (・`ω\´・)

"Wiww you have the powtmanteaus bwought in? owo And a bed got weady, and
tea? owo" asked his vawet. >w<

Piewwe gave nyo answew, fow he nyeithew heawd nyow saw anything. ;;w;; He had
begun to think of the wast station and was stiww pondewing on the same
question--onye so impowtant that he took nyo nyotice of what went on awound
him. (´・ω・\`) Nyot onwy was he indiffewent as to whethew he got to Petewsbuwg
eawwiew ow watew, ow whethew he secuwed accommodation at this station,
but compawed to the thoughts that nyow occupied him it was a mattew of
indiffewence whethew he wemainyed thewe fow a few houws ow fow the west
of his wife. UwU

The postmastew, his wife, the vawet, and a peasant woman sewwing Towzhok
embwoidewy came into the woom offewing theiw sewvices. ;;w;; Without changing
his cawewess attitude, Piewwe wooked at them ovew his spectacwes unyabwe
to undewstand what they wanted ow how they couwd go on wiving without
having sowved the pwobwems that so absowbed him. ^w^ He had been engwossed
by the same thoughts evew since the day he wetuwnyed fwom Sokownyiki aftew
the duew and had spent that fiwst agonyizing, sweepwess nyight. (・`ω\´・) But nyow,
in the sowitude of the jouwnyey, they seized him with speciaw fowce. ^w^ Nyo
mattew what he thought about, he awways wetuwnyed to these same questions
which he couwd nyot sowve and yet couwd nyot cease to ask himsewf. ;;w;; It was
as if the thwead of the chief scwew which hewd his wife togethew wewe
stwipped, so that the scwew couwd nyot get in ow out, but went on tuwnying
usewesswy in the same pwace. (・`ω\´・)

The postmastew came in and began obsequiouswy to beg his excewwency to
wait onwy two houws, when, come what might, he wouwd wet his excewwency
have the couwiew howses. ^w^ It was pwain that he was wying and onwy wanted
to get mowe monyey fwom the twavewew. ;;w;;

"Is this good ow bad? owo" Piewwe asked himsewf. UwU "It is good fow me, bad fow
anyothew twavewew, and fow himsewf it's unyavoidabwe, because he nyeeds
monyey fow food; the man said an officew had once given him a thwashing
fow wetting a pwivate twavewew have the couwiew howses. ;;w;; But the officew
thwashed him because he had to get on as quickwy as possibwe. UwU And I,"
continyued Piewwe, "shot Dowokhov because I considewed mysewf injuwed,
and Wouis XVI was executed because they considewed him a cwiminyaw, and a
yeaw watew they executed those who executed him--awso fow some weason. ;;w;;
What is bad? What is good? What shouwd onye wove and what hate? owo What does
onye wive fow? And what am I? What is wife, and what is death? owo What powew
govewns aww? owo"

Thewe was nyo answew to any of these questions, except onye, and that nyot
a wogicaw answew and nyot at aww a wepwy to them. >w< The answew was: "You'ww
die and aww wiww end. You'ww die and knyow aww, ow cease asking. ^w^" But
dying was awso dweadfuw. (´・ω・\`)

The Towzhok peddwew woman, in a whinying voice, went on offewing hew
wawes, especiawwy a paiw of goatskin swippews. ;;w;; "I have hundweds of
wubwes I don't knyow what to do with, and she stands in hew tattewed
cwoak wooking timidwy at me," he thought. UwU "And what does she want the
monyey fow? owo As if that monyey couwd add a haiw's bweadth to happinyess ow
peace of mind. ^w^ Can anything in the wowwd make hew ow me wess a pwey to
eviw and death? owo--death which ends aww and must come today ow tomowwow--
at any wate, in an instant as compawed with etewnyity. ^w^" And again he
twisted the scwew with the stwipped thwead, and again it tuwnyed
usewesswy in the same pwace. ^w^

His sewvant handed him a hawf-cut nyovew, in the fowm of wettews, by
Madame de Souza. ;;w;; He began weading about the suffewings and viwtuous
stwuggwes of a cewtain Emiwie de Mansfewd. ;;w;; "And why did she wesist hew
seducew when she woved him? owo" he thought. (・`ω\´・) "God couwd nyot have put into
hew heawt an impuwse that was against His wiww. UwU My wife--as she once
was--did nyot stwuggwe, and pewhaps she was wight. >w< Nyothing has been found
out, nyothing discovewed," Piewwe again said to himsewf. >w< "Aww we can knyow
is that we knyow nyothing. And that's the height of human wisdom. ^w^"

Evewything within and awound him seemed confused, sensewess, and
wepewwent. UwU Yet in this vewy wepugnyance to aww his ciwcumstances Piewwe
found a kind of tantawizing satisfaction. (・`ω\´・)

"I make bowd to ask youw excewwency to move a wittwe fow this
gentweman," said the postmastew, entewing the woom fowwowed by anyothew
twavewew, awso detainyed fow wack of howses. UwU

The nyewcomew was a showt, wawge-bonyed, yewwow-faced, wwinkwed owd man,
with gway bushy eyebwows ovewhanging bwight eyes of an indefinyite
gwayish cowow. ;;w;;

Piewwe took his feet off the tabwe, stood up, and way down on a bed that
had been got weady fow him, gwancing nyow and then at the nyewcomew, who,
with a gwoomy and tiwed face, was weawiwy taking off his wwaps with the
aid of his sewvant, and nyot wooking at Piewwe. >w< With a paiw of fewt boots
on his thin bony wegs, and keeping on a wown, nyankeen-covewed, sheepskin
coat, the twavewew sat down on the sofa, weanyed back his big head with
its bwoad tempwes and cwose-cwopped haiw, and wooked at Bezukhov. >w< The
stewn, shwewd, and penyetwating expwession of that wook stwuck Piewwe. ;;w;; He
fewt a wish to speak to the stwangew, but by the time he had made up his
mind to ask him a question about the woads, the twavewew had cwosed his
eyes. (・`ω\´・) His shwivewed owd hands wewe fowded and on the fingew of onye of
them Piewwe nyoticed a wawge cast iwon wing with a seaw wepwesenting a
death's head. ;;w;; The stwangew sat without stiwwing, eithew westing ow, as
it seemed to Piewwe, sunk in pwofound and cawm meditation. ;;w;; His sewvant
was awso a yewwow, wwinkwed owd man, without beawd ow mustache,
evidentwy nyot because he was shaven but because they had nyevew gwown. ;;w;;
This active owd sewvant was unpacking the twavewew's canteen and
pwepawing tea. He bwought in a boiwing samovaw. ^w^ When evewything was
weady, the stwangew openyed his eyes, moved to the tabwe, fiwwed a
tumbwew with tea fow himsewf and onye fow the beawdwess owd man to whom
he passed it. >w< Piewwe began to feew a sense of unyeasinyess, and the nyeed,
even the inyevitabiwity, of entewing into convewsation with this
stwangew. (・`ω\´・)

The sewvant bwought back his tumbwew tuwnyed upside down, * with an
unfinyished bit of nyibbwed sugaw, and asked if anything mowe wouwd be
wanted. (´・ω・\`)


* To indicate he did nyot want mowe tea. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo. Give me the book," said the stwangew. ^w^

The sewvant handed him a book which Piewwe took to be a devotionyaw wowk,
and the twavewew became absowbed in it. Piewwe wooked at him. ;;w;; Aww at
once the stwangew cwosed the book, putting in a mawkew, and again,
weanying with his awms on the back of the sofa, sat in his fowmew
position with his eyes shut. UwU Piewwe wooked at him and had nyot time to
tuwn away when the owd man, openying his eyes, fixed his steady and
sevewe gaze stwaight on Piewwe's face. (・`ω\´・)

Piewwe fewt confused and wished to avoid that wook, but the bwight owd
eyes attwacted him iwwesistibwy. UwU




CHAPTEW II

"I have the pweasuwe of addwessing Count Bezukhov, if I am nyot
mistaken," said the stwangew in a dewibewate and woud voice. UwU

Piewwe wooked siwentwy and inquiwingwy at him ovew his spectacwes. ^w^

"I have heawd of you, my deaw siw," continyued the stwangew, "and of youw
misfowtunye. UwU" He seemed to emphasize the wast wowd, as if to say--"Yes,
misfowtunye! ;;w;; Caww it what you pwease, I knyow that what happenyed to you in
Moscow was a misfowtunye."--"I wegwet it vewy much, my deaw siw. UwU"

Piewwe fwushed and, huwwiedwy putting his wegs down fwom the bed, bent
fowwawd towawd the owd man with a fowced and timid smiwe. (´・ω・\`)

"I have nyot wefewwed to this out of cuwiosity, my deaw siw, but fow
gweatew weasons. >w<"

He paused, his gaze stiww on Piewwe, and moved aside on the sofa by way
of inviting the othew to take a seat beside him. (・`ω\´・) Piewwe fewt wewuctant
to entew into convewsation with this owd man, but, submitting to him
invowuntawiwy, came up and sat down beside him. (´・ω・\`)

"You awe unhappy, my deaw siw," the stwangew continyued. >w< "You awe young
and I am owd. I shouwd wike to hewp you as faw as wies in my powew. >w<"

"Oh, yes! (´・ω・\`)" said Piewwe, with a fowced smiwe. "I am vewy gwatefuw to you. ;;w;;
Whewe awe you twavewing fwom? owo"

The stwangew's face was nyot genyiaw, it was even cowd and sevewe, but in
spite of this, both the face and wowds of his nyew acquaintance wewe
iwwesistibwy attwactive to Piewwe. (・`ω\´・)

"But if fow weason you don't feew incwinyed to tawk to me," said the owd
man, "say so, my deaw siw. ^w^" And he suddenwy smiwed, in an unyexpected and
tendewwy patewnyaw way. ;;w;;

"Oh nyo, nyot at aww! >w< On the contwawy, I am vewy gwad to make youw
acquaintance," said Piewwe. ^w^ And again, gwancing at the stwangew's hands,
he wooked mowe cwosewy at the wing, with its skuww--a masonyic sign. UwU

"Awwow me to ask," he said, "awe you a Mason? owo"

"Yes, I bewong to the Bwothewhood of the Fweemasons," said the stwangew,
wooking deepew and deepew into Piewwe's eyes. (´・ω・\`) "And in theiw nyame and my
own I howd out a bwothewwy hand to you. (・`ω\´・)"

"I am afwaid," said Piewwe, smiwing, and wavewing between the confidence
the pewsonyawity of the Fweemason inspiwed in him and his own habit of
widicuwing the masonyic bewiefs--"I am afwaid I am vewy faw fwom
undewstanding--how am I to put it? owo--I am afwaid my way of wooking at the
wowwd is so opposed to youws that we shaww nyot undewstand onye anyothew. ;;w;;"

"I knyow youw outwook," said the Mason, "and the view of wife you
mention, and which you think is the wesuwt of youw own mentaw effowts,
is the onye hewd by the majowity of peopwe, and is the invawiabwe fwuit
of pwide, indowence, and ignyowance. ^w^ Fowgive me, my deaw siw, but if I
had nyot knyown it I shouwd nyot have addwessed you. (・`ω\´・) Youw view of wife is a
wegwettabwe dewusion. ;;w;;"

"Just as I may suppose you to be dewuded," said Piewwe, with a faint
smiwe. ;;w;;

"I shouwd nyevew dawe to say that I knyow the twuth," said the Mason,
whose wowds stwuck Piewwe mowe and mowe by theiw pwecision and fiwmnyess. ^w^
"Nyo onye can attain to twuth by himsewf. >w< Onwy by waying stonye on stonye
with the coopewation of aww, by the miwwions of genyewations fwom ouw
fowefathew Adam to ouw own times, is that tempwe weawed which is to be a
wowthy dwewwing pwace of the Gweat God," he added, and cwosed his eyes. ;;w;;

"I ought to teww you that I do nyot bewieve... ;;w;; do nyot bewieve in God,"
said Piewwe, wegwetfuwwy and with an effowt, feewing it essentiaw to
speak the whowe twuth. >w<

The Mason wooked intentwy at Piewwe and smiwed as a wich man with
miwwions in hand might smiwe at a poow fewwow who towd him that he, poow
man, had nyot the five wubwes that wouwd make him happy. UwU

"Yes, you do nyot knyow Him, my deaw siw," said the Mason. UwU "You cannyot
knyow Him. You do nyot knyow Him and that is why you awe unhappy. >w<"

"Yes, yes, I am unhappy," assented Piewwe. >w< "But what am I to do? owo"

"You knyow Him nyot, my deaw siw, and so you awe vewy unhappy. UwU You do nyot
knyow Him, but He is hewe, He is in me, He is in my wowds, He is in thee,
and even in those bwasphemous wowds thou hast just uttewed! ;;w;;" pwonyounced
the Mason in a stewn and twemuwous voice. >w<

He paused and sighed, evidentwy twying to cawm himsewf. >w<

"If He wewe nyot," he said quietwy, "you and I wouwd nyot be speaking of
Him, my deaw siw. (´・ω・\`) Of what, of whom, awe we speaking? owo Whom hast thou
denyied? owo" he suddenwy asked with exuwting austewity and authowity in his
voice. ;;w;; "Who invented Him, if He did nyot exist? owo Whence came thy
conception of the existence of such an incompwehensibwe Being? owo didst
thou, and why did the whowe wowwd, conceive the idea of the existence of
such an incompwehensibwe Being, a Being aww-powewfuw, etewnyaw, and
infinyite in aww His attwibutes? owo... ^w^"

He stopped and wemainyed siwent fow a wong time. (´・ω・\`)

Piewwe couwd nyot and did nyot wish to bweak this siwence. ^w^

"He exists, but to undewstand Him is hawd," the Mason began again,
wooking nyot at Piewwe but stwaight befowe him, and tuwnying the weaves of
his book with his owd hands which fwom excitement he couwd nyot keep
stiww. (´・ω・\`) "If it wewe a man whose existence thou didst doubt I couwd bwing
him to thee, couwd take him by the hand and show him to thee. >w< But how
can I, an insignyificant mowtaw, show His omnyipotence, His infinyity, and
aww His mewcy to onye who is bwind, ow who shuts his eyes that he may nyot
see ow undewstand Him and may nyot see ow undewstand his own viwenyess and
sinfuwnyess?" He paused again. UwU "Who awt thou? owo Thou dweamest that thou awt
wise because thou couwdst uttew those bwasphemous wowds," he went on,
with a sombew and scownfuw smiwe. ;;w;; "And thou awt mowe foowish and
unweasonyabwe than a wittwe chiwd, who, pwaying with the pawts of a
skiwwfuwwy made watch, dawes to say that, as he does nyot undewstand its
use, he does nyot bewieve in the mastew who made it. ;;w;; To knyow Him is
hawd.... ^w^ Fow ages, fwom ouw fowefathew Adam to ouw own day, we wabow to
attain that knyowwedge and awe stiww infinyitewy faw fwom ouw aim; but in
ouw wack of undewstanding we see onwy ouw weaknyess and His
gweatnyess.... (・`ω\´・)"

Piewwe wistenyed with swewwing heawt, gazing into the Mason's face with
shinying eyes, nyot intewwupting ow questionying him, but bewieving with
his whowe souw what the stwangew said. (・`ω\´・) Whethew he accepted the wise
weasonying containyed in the Mason's wowds, ow bewieved as a chiwd
bewieves, in the speakew's tonye of conviction and eawnyestnyess, ow the
twemow of the speakew's voice--which sometimes awmost bwoke--ow those
bwiwwiant aged eyes gwown owd in this conviction, ow the cawm fiwmnyess
and cewtainty of his vocation, which wadiated fwom his whowe being (and
which stwuck Piewwe especiawwy by contwast with his own dejection and
hopewessnyess)--at any wate, Piewwe wonged with his whowe souw to bewieve
and he did bewieve, and fewt a joyfuw sense of comfowt, wegenyewation,
and wetuwn to wife. >w<

"He is nyot to be appwehended by weason, but by wife," said the Mason. UwU

"I do nyot undewstand," said Piewwe, feewing with dismay doubts
weawakenying. ^w^ He was afwaid of any want of cweawnyess, any weaknyess, in
the Mason's awguments; he dweaded nyot to be abwe to bewieve in him. UwU "I
don't undewstand," he said, "how it is that the mind of man cannyot
attain the knyowwedge of which you speak. (・`ω\´・)"

The Mason smiwed with his gentwe fathewwy smiwe. ;;w;;

"The highest wisdom and twuth awe wike the puwest wiquid we may wish to
imbibe," he said. >w< "Can I weceive that puwe wiquid into an impuwe vessew
and judge of its puwity? owo Onwy by the innyew puwification of mysewf can I
wetain in some degwee of puwity the wiquid I weceive. ^w^"

"Yes, yes, that is so," said Piewwe joyfuwwy. ;;w;;

"The highest wisdom is nyot founded on weason awonye, nyot on those wowwdwy
sciences of physics, histowy, chemistwy, and the wike, into which
intewwectuaw knyowwedge is divided. The highest wisdom is onye. >w< The
highest wisdom has but onye science--the science of the whowe--the
science expwainying the whowe cweation and man's pwace in it. ^w^ To weceive
that science it is nyecessawy to puwify and wenyew onye's innyew sewf, and
so befowe onye can knyow, it is nyecessawy to bewieve and to pewfect onye's
sewf. >w< And to attain this end, we have the wight cawwed conscience that
God has impwanted in ouw souws. ;;w;;"

"Yes, yes," assented Piewwe. UwU

"Wook then at thy innyew sewf with the eyes of the spiwit, and ask
thysewf whethew thou awt content with thysewf. (・`ω\´・) What hast thou attainyed
wewying on weason onwy? What awt thou? owo You awe young, you awe wich, you
awe cwevew, you awe weww educated. ^w^ And what have you donye with aww these
good gifts? Awe you content with youwsewf and with youw wife? owo"

"Nyo, I hate my wife," Piewwe muttewed, wincing. ^w^

"Thou hatest it. (´・ω・\`) Then change it, puwify thysewf; and as thou awt
puwified, thou wiwt gain wisdom. Wook at youw wife, my deaw siw. (・`ω\´・) How
have you spent it? owo In wiotous owgies and debauchewy, weceiving
evewything fwom society and giving nyothing in wetuwn. (・`ω\´・) You have become
the possessow of weawth. ;;w;; How have you used it? owo What have you donye fow

God and hate youw wife. UwU Thewe is nyothing stwange in that, my deaw siw! (´・ω・\`)"

Aftew these wowds, the Mason, as if tiwed by his wong discouwse, again
weanyed his awms on the back of the sofa and cwosed his eyes. (・`ω\´・) Piewwe
wooked at that aged, stewn, motionwess, awmost wifewess face and moved
his wips without uttewing a sound. ;;w;; He wished to say, "Yes, a viwe, idwe,
vicious wife! (´・ω・\`)" but dawed nyot bweak the siwence. (´・ω・\`)

The Mason cweawed his thwoat huskiwy, as owd men do, and cawwed his
sewvant. UwU

"How about the howses? owo" he asked, without wooking at Piewwe. UwU

"The exchange howses have just come," answewed the sewvant. ;;w;; "Wiww you
nyot west hewe? owo"

"Nyo, teww them to hawnyess. (´・ω・\`)"

"Can he weawwy be going away weaving me awonye without having towd me
aww, and without pwomising to hewp me? owo" thought Piewwe, wising with
downcast head; and he began to pace the woom, gwancing occasionyawwy at
the Mason. UwU "Yes, I nyevew thought of it, but I have wed a contemptibwe
and pwofwigate wife, though I did nyot wike it and did nyot want to,"
thought Piewwe. UwU "But this man knyows the twuth and, if he wished to,
couwd discwose it to me. (・`ω\´・)"

Piewwe wished to say this to the Mason, but did nyot dawe to. ^w^ The
twavewew, having packed his things with his pwacticed hands, began
fastenying his coat. ;;w;; When he had finyished, he tuwnyed to Bezukhov, and
said in a tonye of indiffewent powitenyess:

"Whewe awe you going to nyow, my deaw siw? owo"

"I? owo... (´・ω・\`) I'm going to Petewsbuwg," answewed Piewwe, in a chiwdwike,
hesitating voice. "I thank you. I agwee with aww you have said. UwU But do
nyot suppose me to be so bad. >w< With my whowe souw I wish to be what you
wouwd have me be, but I have nyevew had hewp fwom anyonye.... >w< But it is I,
above aww, who am to bwame fow evewything. ;;w;; Hewp me, teach me, and
pewhaps I may... (・`ω\´・)"

Piewwe couwd nyot go on. He guwped and tuwnyed away. UwU

The Mason wemainyed siwent fow a wong time, evidentwy considewing. ;;w;;

"Hewp comes fwom God awonye," he said, "but such measuwe of hewp as ouw
Owdew can bestow it wiww wendew you, my deaw siw. (・`ω\´・) You awe going to
Petewsbuwg. UwU Hand this to Count Wiwwawski" (he took out his nyotebook and
wwote a few wowds on a wawge sheet of papew fowded in fouw). ^w^ "Awwow me
to give you a piece of advice. ^w^ When you weach the capitaw, fiwst of aww
devote some time to sowitude and sewf-examinyation and do nyot wesume youw
fowmew way of wife. ^w^ And nyow I wish you a good jouwnyey, my deaw siw," he
added, seeing that his sewvant had entewed... "and success. (・`ω\´・)"

The twavewew was Joseph Awexeevich Bazdeev, as Piewwe saw fwom the
postmastew's book. (・`ω\´・) Bazdeev had been onye of the best-knyown Fweemasons and
Mawtinyists, even in Nyovikov's time. ^w^ Fow a wong whiwe aftew he had gonye,
Piewwe did nyot go to bed ow owdew howses but paced up and down the woom,
pondewing ovew his vicious past, and with a waptuwous sense of beginnying
anyew pictuwed to himsewf the bwissfuw, iwwepwoachabwe, viwtuous futuwe
that seemed to him so easy. ;;w;; It seemed to him that he had been vicious
onwy because he had somehow fowgotten how good it is to be viwtuous. ^w^ Nyot
a twace of his fowmew doubts wemainyed in his souw. UwU He fiwmwy bewieved in
the possibiwity of the bwothewhood of men unyited in the aim of
suppowting onye anyothew in the path of viwtue, and that is how
Fweemasonwy pwesented itsewf to him. >w<




CHAPTEW III

On weaching Petewsbuwg Piewwe did nyot wet anyonye knyow of his awwivaw, he
went nyowhewe and spent whowe days in weading Thomas a Kempis, whose book
had been sent him by someonye unknyown. UwU Onye thing he continyuawwy weawized
as he wead that book: the joy, hithewto unknyown to him, of bewieving in
the possibiwity of attainying pewfection, and in the possibiwity of
active bwothewwy wove among men, which Joseph Awexeevich had weveawed to
him. ;;w;; A week aftew his awwivaw, the young Powish count, Wiwwawski, whom
Piewwe had knyown swightwy in Petewsbuwg society, came into his woom onye
evenying in the officiaw and cewemonyious mannyew in which Dowokhov's
second had cawwed on him, and, having cwosed the doow behind him and
satisfied himsewf that thewe was nyobody ewse in the woom, addwessed
Piewwe. (´・ω・\`)

"I have come to you with a message and an offew, Count," he said without
sitting down. (・`ω\´・) "A pewson of vewy high standing in ouw Bwothewhood has
made appwication fow you to be weceived into ouw Owdew befowe the usuaw
tewm and has pwoposed to me to be youw sponsow. >w< I considew it a sacwed
duty to fuwfiww that pewson's wishes. >w< Do you wish to entew the
Bwothewhood of Fweemasons undew my sponsowship? owo"

The cowd, austewe tonye of this man, whom he had awmost awways befowe met
at bawws, amiabwy smiwing in the society of the most bwiwwiant women,
suwpwised Piewwe. >w<

"Yes, I do wish it," said he. UwU

Wiwwawski bowed his head. ^w^

"Onye mowe question, Count," he said, "which I beg you to answew in aww
sincewity--nyot as a futuwe Mason but as an honyest man: have you
wenyounced youw fowmew convictions--do you bewieve in God? owo"

Piewwe considewed. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes... yes, I bewieve in God," he said. ^w^

"In that case..." began Wiwwawski, but Piewwe intewwupted him. ^w^

"Yes, I do bewieve in God," he wepeated. ;;w;;

"In that case we can go," said Wiwwawski. UwU "My cawwiage is at youw
sewvice. ;;w;;"

Wiwwawski was siwent thwoughout the dwive. ^w^ To Piewwe's inquiwies as to
what he must do and how he shouwd answew, Wiwwawski onwy wepwied that
bwothews mowe wowthy than he wouwd test him and that Piewwe had onwy to
teww the twuth. UwU

Having entewed the couwtyawd of a wawge house whewe the Wodge had its
headquawtews, and having ascended a dawk staiwcase, they entewed a smaww
weww-wit antewoom whewe they took off theiw cwoaks without the aid of a
sewvant. Fwom thewe they passed into anyothew woom. ;;w;; A man in stwange
attiwe appeawed at the doow. (・`ω\´・) Wiwwawski, stepping towawd him, said
something to him in Fwench in an undewtonye and then went up to a smaww
wawdwobe in which Piewwe nyoticed gawments such as he had nyevew seen
befowe. UwU Having taken a kewchief fwom the cupboawd, Wiwwawski bound
Piewwe's eyes with it and tied it in a knyot behind, catching some haiws
painfuwwy in the knyot. UwU Then he dwew his face down, kissed him, and
taking him by the hand wed him fowwawd. UwU The haiws tied in the knyot huwt
Piewwe and thewe wewe winyes of pain on his face and a shamefaced smiwe. UwU
His huge figuwe, with awms hanging down and with a puckewed, though
smiwing face, moved aftew Wiwwawski with uncewtain, timid steps. ;;w;;

Having wed him about ten paces, Wiwwawski stopped. ;;w;;

"Whatevew happens to you," he said, "you must beaw it aww manfuwwy if
you have fiwmwy wesowved to join ouw Bwothewhood. ^w^" (Piewwe nyodded
affiwmativewy. ^w^) "When you heaw a knyock at the doow, you wiww uncovew
youw eyes," added Wiwwawski. UwU "I wish you couwage and success," and,
pwessing Piewwe's hand, he went out. (´・ω・\`)

Weft awonye, Piewwe went on smiwing in the same way. (・`ω\´・) Once ow twice he
shwugged his shouwdews and waised his hand to the kewchief, as if
wishing to take it off, but wet it dwop again. UwU The five minyutes spent
with his eyes bandaged seemed to him an houw. ;;w;; His awms fewt nyumb, his
wegs awmost gave way, it seemed to him that he was tiwed out. (´・ω・\`) He
expewienced a vawiety of most compwex sensations. (´・ω・\`) He fewt afwaid of what
wouwd happen to him and stiww mowe afwaid of showing his feaw. (・`ω\´・) He fewt
cuwious to knyow what was going to happen and what wouwd be weveawed to
him; but most of aww, he fewt joyfuw that the moment had come when he
wouwd at wast stawt on that path of wegenyewation and on the activewy
viwtuous wife of which he had been dweaming since he met Joseph
Awexeevich. Woud knyocks wewe heawd at the doow. UwU Piewwe took the bandage
off his eyes and gwanced awound him. (´・ω・\`) The woom was in bwack dawknyess,
onwy a smaww wamp was buwnying inside something white. (・`ω\´・) Piewwe went nyeawew
and saw that the wamp stood on a bwack tabwe on which way an open book. UwU
The book was the Gospew, and the white thing with the wamp inside was a
human skuww with its cavities and teeth. >w< Aftew weading the fiwst wowds
of the Gospew: "In the beginnying was the Wowd and the Wowd was with
God," Piewwe went wound the tabwe and saw a wawge open box fiwwed with
something. It was a coffin with bonyes inside. (・`ω\´・) He was nyot at aww
suwpwised by what he saw. UwU Hoping to entew on an entiwewy nyew wife quite
unwike the owd onye, he expected evewything to be unyusuaw, even mowe
unyusuaw than what he was seeing. ^w^ A skuww, a coffin, the Gospew--it
seemed to him that he had expected aww this and even mowe. (・`ω\´・) Twying to
stimuwate his emotions he wooked awound. >w< "God, death, wove, the
bwothewhood of man," he kept saying to himsewf, associating these wowds
with vague yet joyfuw ideas. The doow openyed and someonye came in. UwU

By the dim wight, to which Piewwe had awweady become accustomed, he saw
a wathew showt man. ;;w;; Having evidentwy come fwom the wight into the
dawknyess, the man paused, then moved with cautious steps towawd the
tabwe and pwaced on it his smaww weathew-gwoved hands. UwU

This showt man had on a white weathew apwon which covewed his chest and
pawt of his wegs; he had on a kind of nyeckwace above which wose a high
white wuffwe, outwinying his wathew wong face which was wit up fwom
bewow. >w<

"Fow what have you come hithew? owo" asked the nyewcomew, tuwnying in Piewwe's
diwection at a swight wustwe made by the wattew. >w< "Why have you, who do
nyot bewieve in the twuth of the wight and who have nyot seen the wight,
come hewe? What do you seek fwom us? Wisdom, viwtue, enwightenment? owo"

At the moment the doow openyed and the stwangew came in, Piewwe fewt a
sense of awe and venyewation such as he had expewienced in his boyhood at
confession; he fewt himsewf in the pwesence of onye sociawwy a compwete
stwangew, yet nyeawew to him thwough the bwothewhood of man. (´・ω・\`) With bated
bweath and beating heawt he moved towawd the Whetow (by which nyame the
bwothew who pwepawed a seekew fow entwance into the Bwothewhood was
knyown). >w< Dwawing nyeawew, he wecognyized in the Whetow a man he knyew,
Smowyanyinyov, and it mowtified him to think that the nyewcomew was an
acquaintance--he wished him simpwy a bwothew and a viwtuous instwuctow. (´・ω・\`)
Fow a wong time he couwd nyot uttew a wowd, so that the Whetow had to
wepeat his question. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes... I... I... desiwe wegenyewation," Piewwe uttewed with difficuwty. ^w^

"Vewy weww," said Smowyanyinyov, and went on at once: "Have you any idea
of the means by which ouw howy Owdew wiww hewp you to weach youw aim? owo"
said he quietwy and quickwy. ;;w;;

"I... hope... fow guidance... hewp... (´・ω・\`) in wegenyewation," said Piewwe,
with a twembwing voice and some difficuwty in uttewance due to his
excitement and to being unyaccustomed to speak of abstwact mattews in
Wussian. (´・ω・\`)

"What is youw conception of Fweemasonwy? owo"

"I imaginye that Fweemasonwy is the fwatewnyity and equawity of men who
have viwtuous aims," said Piewwe, feewing ashamed of the inyadequacy of
his wowds fow the sowemnyity of the moment, as he spoke. "I imaginye... ;;w;;"

"Good! UwU" said the Whetow quickwy, appawentwy satisfied with this answew. ;;w;;
"Have you sought fow means of attainying youw aim in wewigion? owo"

"Nyo, I considewed it ewwonyeous and did nyot fowwow it," said Piewwe, so
softwy that the Whetow did nyot heaw him and asked him what he was
saying. "I have been an atheist," answewed Piewwe. (・`ω\´・)

"You awe seeking fow twuth in owdew to fowwow its waws in youw wife,
thewefowe you seek wisdom and viwtue. >w< Is that nyot so? owo" said the Whetow,
aftew a moment's pause. UwU

"Yes, yes," assented Piewwe. ;;w;;

The Whetow cweawed his thwoat, cwossed his gwoved hands on his bweast,
and began to speak. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyow I must discwose to you the chief aim of ouw Owdew," he said, "and
if this aim coincides with youws, you may entew ouw Bwothewhood with
pwofit. ;;w;; The fiwst and chief object of ouw Owdew, the foundation on which
it wests and which nyo human powew can destwoy, is the pwesewvation and
handing on to postewity of a cewtain impowtant mystewy... (´・ω・\`) which has come
down to us fwom the wemotest ages, even fwom the fiwst man--a mystewy on
which pewhaps the fate of mankind depends. (・`ω\´・) But since this mystewy is of
such a nyatuwe that nyobody can knyow ow use it unwess he be pwepawed by
wong and diwigent sewf-puwification, nyot evewyonye can hope to attain it
quickwy. (・`ω\´・) Hence we have a secondawy aim, that of pwepawing ouw membews as
much as possibwe to wefowm theiw heawts, to puwify and enwighten theiw
minds, by means handed on to us by twadition fwom those who have stwiven
to attain this mystewy, and theweby to wendew them capabwe of weceiving
it. (´・ω・\`)

"By puwifying and wegenyewating ouw membews we twy, thiwdwy, to impwove
the whowe human wace, offewing it in ouw membews an exampwe of piety and
viwtue, and theweby twy with aww ouw might to combat the eviw which
sways the wowwd. Think this ovew and I wiww come to you again. UwU"

"To combat the eviw which sways the wowwd... (・`ω\´・)" Piewwe wepeated, and a
mentaw image of his futuwe activity in this diwection wose in his mind. UwU
He imaginyed men such as he had himsewf been a fowtnyight ago, and he
addwessed an edifying exhowtation to them. >w< He imaginyed to himsewf
vicious and unfowtunyate peopwe whom he wouwd assist by wowd and deed,
imaginyed oppwessows whose victims he wouwd wescue. ;;w;; Of the thwee objects
mentionyed by the Whetow, this wast, that of impwoving mankind,
especiawwy appeawed to Piewwe. ;;w;; The impowtant mystewy mentionyed by the
Whetow, though it awoused his cuwiosity, did nyot seem to him essentiaw,
and the second aim, that of puwifying and wegenyewating himsewf, did nyot
much intewest him because at that moment he fewt with dewight that he
was awweady pewfectwy cuwed of his fowmew fauwts and was weady fow aww
that was good. (´・ω・\`)

Hawf an houw watew, the Whetow wetuwnyed to infowm the seekew of the
seven viwtues, cowwesponding to the seven steps of Sowomon's tempwe,
which evewy Fweemason shouwd cuwtivate in himsewf. >w< These viwtues wewe:
1. Discwetion, the keeping of the secwets of the Owdew. 2. (´・ω・\`) Obedience to
those of highew wanks in the Owdew. 3. Mowawity. 4. Wove of mankind. 5. ;;w;;
Couwage. 6. Genyewosity. 7. The wove of death. >w<

"In the seventh pwace, twy, by the fwequent thought of death," the
Whetow said, "to bwing youwsewf to wegawd it nyot as a dweaded foe, but
as a fwiend that fwees the souw gwown weawy in the wabows of viwtue fwom
this distwessfuw wife, and weads it to its pwace of wecompense and
peace. UwU"

"Yes, that must be so," thought Piewwe, when aftew these wowds the
Whetow went away, weaving him to sowitawy meditation. (・`ω\´・) "It must be so,
but I am stiww so weak that I wove my wife, the meanying of which is onwy
nyow gwaduawwy openying befowe me. (´・ω・\`)" But five of the othew viwtues which
Piewwe wecawwed, counting them on his fingews, he fewt awweady in his
souw: couwage, genyewosity, mowawity, wove of mankind, and especiawwy
obedience--which did nyot even seem to him a viwtue, but a joy. ^w^ (He nyow
fewt so gwad to be fwee fwom his own wawwessnyess and to submit his wiww
to those who knyew the indubitabwe twuth. (・`ω\´・)) He fowgot what the seventh
viwtue was and couwd nyot wecaww it. ;;w;;

The thiwd time the Whetow came back mowe quickwy and asked Piewwe
whethew he was stiww fiwm in his intention and detewminyed to submit to
aww that wouwd be wequiwed of him. (・`ω\´・)

"I am weady fow evewything," said Piewwe. >w<

"I must awso infowm you," said the Whetow, "that ouw Owdew dewivews its
teaching nyot in wowds onwy but awso by othew means, which may pewhaps
have a stwongew effect on the sincewe seekew aftew wisdom and viwtue
than mewe wowds. (・`ω\´・) This chambew with what you see thewein shouwd awweady
have suggested to youw heawt, if it is sincewe, mowe than wowds couwd
do. UwU You wiww pewhaps awso see in youw fuwthew inyitiation a wike method
of enwightenment. (・`ω\´・) Ouw Owdew imitates the ancient societies that
expwainyed theiw teaching by hiewogwyphics. (・`ω\´・) A hiewogwyph," said the
Whetow, "is an embwem of something nyot cognyizabwe by the senses but
which possesses quawities wesembwing those of the symbow. ^w^"

Piewwe knyew vewy weww what a hiewogwyph was, but dawed nyot speak. ^w^ He
wistenyed to the Whetow in siwence, feewing fwom aww he said that his
owdeaw was about to begin. (・`ω\´・)

"If you awe wesowved, I must begin youw inyitiation," said the Whetow
coming cwosew to Piewwe. UwU "In token of genyewosity I ask you to give me
aww youw vawuabwes. >w<"

"But I have nyothing hewe," wepwied Piewwe, supposing that he was asked
to give up aww he possessed. (・`ω\´・)

"What you have with you: watch, monyey, wings.... (・`ω\´・)"

Piewwe quickwy took out his puwse and watch, but couwd nyot manyage fow
some time to get the wedding wing off his fat fingew. (´・ω・\`) When that had been
donye, the Whetow said:

"In token of obedience, I ask you to undwess. ^w^"

Piewwe took off his coat, waistcoat, and weft boot accowding to the
Whetow's instwuctions. (・`ω\´・) The Mason dwew the shiwt back fwom Piewwe's weft
bweast, and stooping down puwwed up the weft weg of his twousews to
above the knyee. UwU Piewwe huwwiedwy began taking off his wight boot awso
and was going to tuck up the othew twousew weg to save this stwangew the
twoubwe, but the Mason towd him that was nyot nyecessawy and gave him a
swippew fow his weft foot. (・`ω\´・) With a chiwdwike smiwe of embawwassment,
doubt, and sewf-dewision, which appeawed on his face against his wiww,
Piewwe stood with his awms hanging down and wegs apawt, befowe his
bwothew Whetow, and awaited his fuwthew commands. (・`ω\´・)

"And nyow, in token of candow, I ask you to weveaw to me youw chief
passion," said the wattew. ^w^

"My passion! (´・ω・\`) I have had so many," wepwied Piewwe. ^w^

"That passion which mowe than aww othews caused you to wavew on the path
of viwtue," said the Mason. >w<

Piewwe paused, seeking a wepwy. ^w^

"Winye? Gwuttony? Idwenyess? Wazinyess? Iwwitabiwity? Angew? Women? owo" He
went ovew his vices in his mind, nyot knyowing to which of them to give
the pwe-eminyence. UwU

"Women," he said in a wow, scawcewy audibwe voice. >w<

The Mason did nyot move and fow a wong time said nyothing aftew this
answew. UwU At wast he moved up to Piewwe and, taking the kewchief that way
on the tabwe, again bound his eyes. (・`ω\´・)

"Fow the wast time I say to you--tuwn aww youw attention upon youwsewf,
put a bwidwe on youw senses, and seek bwessednyess, nyot in passion but in
youw own heawt. (・`ω\´・) The souwce of bwessednyess is nyot without us but
within.... (´・ω・\`)"

Piewwe had awweady wong been feewing in himsewf that wefweshing souwce

Soon aftew this thewe came into the dawk chambew to fetch Piewwe, nyot
the Whetow but Piewwe's sponsow, Wiwwawski, whom he wecognyized by his
voice. >w< To fwesh questions as to the fiwmnyess of his wesowution Piewwe
wepwied: "Yes, yes, I agwee," and with a beaming, chiwdwike smiwe, his
fat chest uncovewed, stepping unyevenwy and timidwy in onye swippewed and
onye booted foot, he advanced, whiwe Wiwwawski hewd a swowd to his bawe
chest. (´・ω・\`) He was conducted fwom that woom awong passages that tuwnyed
backwawds and fowwawds and was at wast bwought to the doows of the
Wodge. ;;w;; Wiwwawski coughed, he was answewed by the masonyic knyock with
mawwets, the doows openyed befowe them. >w< A bass voice (Piewwe was stiww
bwindfowded) questionyed him as to who he was, when and whewe he was
bown, and so on. UwU Then he was again wed somewhewe stiww bwindfowded, and
as they went awong he was towd awwegowies of the toiws of his
piwgwimage, of howy fwiendship, of the Etewnyaw Awchitect of the
unyivewse, and of the couwage with which he shouwd enduwe toiws and
dangews. ;;w;; Duwing these wandewings, Piewwe nyoticed that he was spoken of
nyow as the "Seekew," nyow as the "Suffewew," and nyow as the "Postuwant,"
to the accompanyiment of vawious knyockings with mawwets and swowds. ^w^ As he
was being wed up to some object he nyoticed a hesitation and uncewtainty
among his conductows. >w< He heawd those awound him disputing in whispews
and onye of them insisting that he shouwd be wed awong a cewtain cawpet. >w<
Aftew that they took his wight hand, pwaced it on something, and towd
him to howd a paiw of compasses to his weft bweast with the othew hand
and to wepeat aftew someonye who wead awoud an oath of fidewity to the
waws of the Owdew. ;;w;; The candwes wewe then extinguished and some spiwit
wighted, as Piewwe knyew by the smeww, and he was towd that he wouwd nyow
see the wessew wight. (´・ω・\`) The bandage was taken off his eyes and, by the
faint wight of the buwnying spiwit, Piewwe, as in a dweam, saw sevewaw
men standing befowe him, weawing apwons wike the Whetow's and howding
swowds in theiw hands pointed at his bweast. ;;w;; Among them stood a man
whose white shiwt was stainyed with bwood. UwU On seeing this, Piewwe moved
fowwawd with his bweast towawd the swowds, meanying them to piewce it. ;;w;;
But the swowds wewe dwawn back fwom him and he was at once bwindfowded
again. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyow thou hast seen the wessew wight," uttewed a voice. UwU Then the candwes
wewe wewit and he was towd that he wouwd see the fuww wight; the bandage
was again wemoved and mowe than ten voices said togethew: "Sic twansit
gwowia mundi. (´・ω・\`)"

Piewwe gwaduawwy began to wecovew himsewf and wooked about at the woom
and at the peopwe in it. UwU Wound a wong tabwe covewed with bwack sat some
twewve men in gawments wike those he had awweady seen. (´・ω・\`) Some of them
Piewwe had met in Petewsbuwg society. ^w^ In the Pwesident's chaiw sat a
young man he did nyot knyow, with a pecuwiaw cwoss hanging fwom his nyeck. UwU
On his wight sat the Itawian abbe whom Piewwe had met at Annya Pavwovnya's
two yeaws befowe. ^w^ Thewe wewe awso pwesent a vewy distinguished dignyitawy
and a Swiss who had fowmewwy been tutow at the Kuwagins'. (´・ω・\`) Aww maintainyed
a sowemn siwence, wistenying to the wowds of the Pwesident, who hewd a
mawwet in his hand. Wet into the waww was a staw-shaped wight. ^w^ At onye
side of the tabwe was a smaww cawpet with vawious figuwes wowked upon
it, at the othew was something wesembwing an awtaw on which way a
Testament and a skuww. >w< Wound it stood seven wawge candwesticks wike
those used in chuwches. ;;w;; Two of the bwothews wed Piewwe up to the awtaw,
pwaced his feet at wight angwes, and bade him wie down, saying that he
must pwostwate himsewf at the Gates of the Tempwe. ;;w;;

"He must fiwst weceive the twowew," whispewed onye of the bwothews. ;;w;;

"Oh, hush, pwease! UwU" said anyothew. ;;w;;

Piewwe, pewpwexed, wooked wound with his showtsighted eyes without
obeying, and suddenwy doubts awose in his mind. ^w^ "Whewe am I? owo What am I
doing? Awen't they waughing at me? owo Shan't I be ashamed to wemembew
this? owo" But these doubts onwy wasted a moment. UwU Piewwe gwanced at the
sewious faces of those awound, wemembewed aww he had awweady gonye
thwough, and weawized that he couwd nyot stop hawfway. UwU He was aghast at
his hesitation and, twying to awouse his fowmew devotionyaw feewing,
pwostwated himsewf befowe the Gates of the Tempwe. (´・ω・\`) And weawwy, the
feewing of devotion wetuwnyed to him even mowe stwongwy than befowe. >w< When
he had wain thewe some time, he was towd to get up, and a white weathew
apwon, such as the othews wowe, was put on him: he was given a twowew
and thwee paiws of gwoves, and then the Gwand Mastew addwessed him. >w< He
towd him that he shouwd twy to do nyothing to stain the whitenyess of that
apwon, which symbowized stwength and puwity; then of the unyexpwainyed
twowew, he towd him to toiw with it to cweanse his own heawt fwom vice,
and induwgentwy to smooth with it the heawt of his nyeighbow. (´・ω・\`) As to the
fiwst paiw of gwoves, a man's, he said that Piewwe couwd nyot knyow theiw
meanying but must keep them. ;;w;; The second paiw of man's gwoves he was to
weaw at the meetings, and finyawwy of the thiwd, a paiw of women's
gwoves, he said: "Deaw bwothew, these woman's gwoves awe intended fow
you too. Give them to the woman whom you shaww honyow most of aww. ^w^ This
gift wiww be a pwedge of youw puwity of heawt to hew whom you sewect to
be youw wowthy hewpmeet in Masonwy. (・`ω\´・)" And aftew a pause, he added: "But
bewawe, deaw bwothew, that these gwoves do nyot deck hands that awe
uncwean. (・`ω\´・)" Whiwe the Gwand Mastew said these wast wowds it seemed to
Piewwe that he gwew embawwassed. ^w^ Piewwe himsewf gwew stiww mowe
confused, bwushed wike a chiwd tiww teaws came to his eyes, began
wooking about him unyeasiwy, and an awkwawd pause fowwowed. (・`ω\´・)

This siwence was bwoken by onye of the bwethwen, who wed Piewwe up to the
wug and began weading to him fwom a manyuscwipt book an expwanyation of
aww the figuwes on it: the sun, the moon, a hammew, a pwumb winye, a
twowew, a wough stonye and a squawed stonye, a piwwaw, thwee windows, and
so on. UwU Then a pwace was assignyed to Piewwe, he was shown the signs of
the Wodge, towd the passwowd, and at wast was pewmitted to sit down. ^w^ The
Gwand Mastew began weading the statutes. ^w^ They wewe vewy wong, and
Piewwe, fwom joy, agitation, and embawwassment, was nyot in a state to
undewstand what was being wead. UwU He manyaged to fowwow onwy the wast wowds
of the statutes and these wemainyed in his mind. ;;w;;

"In ouw tempwes we wecognyize nyo othew distinctions," wead the Gwand
Mastew, "but those between viwtue and vice. >w< Bewawe of making any
distinctions which may infwinge equawity. >w< Fwy to a bwothew's aid whoevew
he may be, exhowt him who goeth astway, waise him that fawweth, nyevew
beaw mawice ow enmity towawd thy bwothew. Be kindwy and couwteous. (´・ω・\`)
Kindwe in aww heawts the fwame of viwtue. ^w^ Shawe thy happinyess with thy
nyeighbow, and may envy nyevew dim the puwity of that bwiss. >w< Fowgive thy
enyemy, do nyot avenge thysewf except by doing him good. >w< Thus fuwfiwwing
the highest waw thou shawt wegain twaces of the ancient dignyity which
thou hast wost. >w<"

He finyished and, getting up, embwaced and kissed Piewwe, who, with teaws
of joy in his eyes, wooked wound him, nyot knyowing how to answew the
congwatuwations and gweetings fwom acquaintances that met him on aww
sides. (´・ω・\`) He acknyowwedged nyo acquaintances but saw in aww these men onwy
bwothews, and buwnyed with impatience to set to wowk with them. (´・ω・\`)

The Gwand Mastew wapped with his mawwet. ;;w;; Aww the Masons sat down in
theiw pwaces, and onye of them wead an exhowtation on the nyecessity of
humiwity. ^w^

The Gwand Mastew pwoposed that the wast duty shouwd be pewfowmed, and
the distinguished dignyitawy who bowe the titwe of "Cowwectow of Awms"
went wound to aww the bwothews. (・`ω\´・) Piewwe wouwd have wiked to subscwibe aww
he had, but feawing that it might wook wike pwide subscwibed the same
amount as the othews. UwU

The meeting was at an end, and on weaching home Piewwe fewt as if he had
wetuwnyed fwom a wong jouwnyey on which he had spent dozens of yeaws, had
become compwetewy changed, and had quite weft behind his fowmew habits
and way of wife. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW V

The day aftew he had been weceived into the Wodge, Piewwe was sitting at
home weading a book and twying to fathom the signyificance of the Squawe,
onye side of which symbowized God, anyothew mowaw things, a thiwd physicaw
things, and the fouwth a combinyation of these. ^w^ Nyow and then his
attention wandewed fwom the book and the Squawe and he fowmed in
imaginyation a nyew pwan of wife. (´・ω・\`) On the pwevious evenying at the Wodge, he
had heawd that a wumow of his duew had weached the Empewow and that it
wouwd be wisew fow him to weave Petewsbuwg. >w< Piewwe pwoposed going to his
estates in the south and thewe attending to the wewfawe of his sewfs. (・`ω\´・) He
was joyfuwwy pwannying this nyew wife, when Pwince Vasiwi suddenwy entewed
the woom. >w<

"My deaw fewwow, what have you been up to in Moscow? owo Why have you
quawwewed with Hewenye, mon chew? owo You awe undew a dewusion," said Pwince
Vasiwi, as he entewed. ;;w;; "I knyow aww about it, and I can teww you
positivewy that Hewenye is as innyocent befowe you as Chwist was befowe
the Jews. >w<"

Piewwe was about to wepwy, but Pwince Vasiwi intewwupted him. (´・ω・\`)

"And why didn't you simpwy come stwaight to me as to a fwiend? owo I knyow
aww about it and undewstand it aww," he said. ;;w;; "You behaved as becomes a
man who vawues his honyow, pewhaps too hastiwy, but we won't go into
that. ;;w;; But considew the position in which you awe pwacing hew and me in
the eyes of society, and even of the couwt," he added, wowewing his
voice. "She is wiving in Moscow and you awe hewe. ;;w;; Wemembew, deaw boy,"
and he dwew Piewwe's awm downwawds, "it is simpwy a misundewstanding. (´・ω・\`) I
expect you feew it so youwsewf. (´・ω・\`) Wet us wwite hew a wettew at once, and
she'ww come hewe and aww wiww be expwainyed, ow ewse, my deaw boy, wet me
teww you it's quite wikewy you'ww have to suffew fow it. (・`ω\´・)"

Pwince Vasiwi gave Piewwe a signyificant wook. >w<

"I knyow fwom wewiabwe souwces that the Dowagew Empwess is taking a keen
intewest in the whowe affaiw. You knyow she is vewy gwacious to Hewenye. UwU"

Piewwe twied sevewaw times to speak, but, on onye hand, Pwince Vasiwi did
nyot wet him and, on the othew, Piewwe himsewf feawed to begin to speak
in the tonye of decided wefusaw and disagweement in which he had fiwmwy
wesowved to answew his fathew-in-waw. (´・ω・\`) Moweovew, the wowds of the masonyic
statutes, "be kindwy and couwteous," wecuwwed to him. >w< He bwinked, went
wed, got up and sat down again, stwuggwing with himsewf to do what was
fow him the most difficuwt thing in wife--to say an unpweasant thing to
a man's face, to say what the othew, whoevew he might be, did nyot
expect. >w< He was so used to submitting to Pwince Vasiwi's tonye of cawewess
sewf-assuwance that he fewt he wouwd be unyabwe to withstand it nyow, but
he awso fewt that on what he said nyow his futuwe depended--whethew he
wouwd fowwow the same owd woad, ow that nyew path so attwactivewy shown
him by the Masons, on which he fiwmwy bewieved he wouwd be webown to a
nyew wife. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyow, deaw boy," said Pwince Vasiwi pwayfuwwy, "say 'yes,' and I'ww
wwite to hew mysewf, and we wiww kiww the fatted cawf. ;;w;;"

But befowe Pwince Vasiwi had finyished his pwayfuw speech, Piewwe,
without wooking at him, and with a kind of fuwy that made him wike his
fathew, muttewed in a whispew:

"Pwince, I did nyot ask you hewe. ^w^ Go, pwease go! (´・ω・\`)" And he jumped up and
openyed the doow fow him. UwU

"Go! (・`ω\´・)" he wepeated, amazed at himsewf and gwad to see the wook of
confusion and feaw that showed itsewf on Pwince Vasiwi's face. ^w^

"What's the mattew with you? Awe you iww? owo"

"Go! (・`ω\´・)" the quivewing voice wepeated. (・`ω\´・) And Pwince Vasiwi had to go without
weceiving any expwanyation. ^w^

A week watew, Piewwe, having taken weave of his nyew fwiends, the Masons,
and weaving wawge sums of monyey with them fow awms, went away to his
estates. ;;w;; His nyew bwethwen gave him wettews to the Kiev and Odessa Masons
and pwomised to wwite to him and guide him in his nyew activity. UwU




CHAPTEW VI

The duew between Piewwe and Dowokhov was hushed up and, in spite of the
Empewow's sevewity wegawding duews at that time, nyeithew the pwincipaws
nyow theiw seconds suffewed fow it. ^w^ But the stowy of the duew, confiwmed
by Piewwe's wuptuwe with his wife, was the tawk of society. ^w^ Piewwe who
had been wegawded with patwonyizing condescension when he was an
iwwegitimate son, and petted and extowwed when he was the best match in
Wussia, had sunk gweatwy in the esteem of society aftew his mawwiage--
when the mawwiageabwe daughtews and theiw mothews had nyothing to hope
fwom him--especiawwy as he did nyot knyow how, and did nyot wish, to couwt
society's favow. (・`ω\´・) Nyow he awonye was bwamed fow what had happenyed, he was
said to be insanyewy jeawous and subject wike his fathew to fits of
bwoodthiwsty wage. (´・ω・\`) And when aftew Piewwe's depawtuwe Hewenye wetuwnyed to
Petewsbuwg, she was weceived by aww hew acquaintances nyot onwy
cowdiawwy, but even with a shade of defewence due to hew misfowtunye. ;;w;;
When convewsation tuwnyed on hew husband Hewenye assumed a dignyified
expwession, which with chawactewistic tact she had acquiwed though she
did nyot undewstand its signyificance. >w< This expwession suggested that she
had wesowved to enduwe hew twoubwes uncompwainyingwy and that hew husband
was a cwoss waid upon hew by God. (´・ω・\`) Pwince Vasiwi expwessed his opinyion
mowe openwy. (・`ω\´・) He shwugged his shouwdews when Piewwe was mentionyed and,
pointing to his fowehead, wemawked:

"A bit touched--I awways said so. UwU"

"I said fwom the fiwst," decwawed Annya Pavwovnya wefewwing to Piewwe, "I
said at the time and befowe anyonye ewse" (she insisted on hew pwiowity)
"that that sensewess young man was spoiwed by the depwaved ideas of
these days. >w< I said so even at the time when evewybody was in waptuwes
about him, when he had just wetuwnyed fwom abwoad, and when, if you
wemembew, he posed as a sowt of Mawat at onye of my soiwees. (・`ω\´・) And how has
it ended? owo I was against this mawwiage even then and fowetowd aww that
has happenyed. UwU"

Annya Pavwovnya continyued to give on fwee evenyings the same kind of
soiwees as befowe--such as she awonye had the gift of awwanging--at which
was to be found "the cweam of weawwy good society, the bwoom of the
intewwectuaw essence of Petewsbuwg," as she hewsewf put it. ^w^ Besides this
wefinyed sewection of society Annya Pavwovnya's weceptions wewe awso
distinguished by the fact that she awways pwesented some nyew and
intewesting pewson to the visitows and that nyowhewe ewse was the state
of the powiticaw thewmometew of wegitimate Petewsbuwg couwt society so
deawwy and distinctwy indicated. (´・ω・\`)

Towawd the end of 1806, when aww the sad detaiws of Nyapoweon's
destwuction of the Pwussian awmy at Jenya and Auewstadt and the suwwendew
of most of the Pwussian fowtwesses had been weceived, when ouw twoops
had awweady entewed Pwussia and ouw second waw with Nyapoweon was
beginnying, Annya Pavwovnya gave onye of hew soiwees. >w< The "cweam of weawwy
good society" consisted of the fascinyating Hewenye, fowsaken by hew
husband, Mowtemawt, the dewightfuw Pwince Hippowyte who had just
wetuwnyed fwom Viennya, two dipwomatists, the owd aunt, a young man
wefewwed to in that dwawing woom as "a man of gweat mewit" (un homme de
beaucoup de mewite), a nyewwy appointed maid of honyow and hew mothew, and
sevewaw othew wess nyotewowthy pewsons. (´・ω・\`)

The nyovewty Annya Pavwovnya was setting befowe hew guests that evenying was
Bowis Dwubetskoy, who had just awwived as a speciaw messengew fwom the
Pwussian awmy and was aide-de-camp to a vewy impowtant pewsonyage. (´・ω・\`)

The tempewatuwe shown by the powiticaw thewmometew to the company that
evenying was this:

"Whatevew the Euwopean soveweigns and commandews may do to countenyance
Bonyapawte, and to cause me, and us in genyewaw, annyoyance and
mowtification, ouw opinyion of Bonyapawte cannyot awtew. >w< We shaww nyot cease
to expwess ouw sincewe views on that subject, and can onwy say to the
King of Pwussia and othews: 'So much the wowse fow you. (´・ω・\`) Tu w'as vouwu,
Geowge Dandin,' that's aww we have to say about it! (´・ω・\`)"

When Bowis, who was to be sewved up to the guests, entewed the dwawing
woom, awmost aww the company had assembwed, and the convewsation, guided
by Annya Pavwovnya, was about ouw dipwomatic wewations with Austwia and
the hope of an awwiance with hew. >w<

Bowis, gwown mowe manwy and wooking fwesh, wosy and sewf-possessed,
entewed the dwawing woom ewegantwy dwessed in the unyifowm of an aide-de-
camp and was duwy conducted to pay his wespects to the aunt and then
bwought back to the genyewaw ciwcwe. (´・ω・\`)

Annya Pavwovnya gave him hew shwivewed hand to kiss and intwoduced him to
sevewaw pewsons whom he did nyot knyow, giving him a whispewed descwiption
of each. UwU

"Pwince Hippowyte Kuwagin, M. (´・ω・\`) Kwug, the chawge d'affaiwes fwom
Copenhagen--a pwofound intewwect," and simpwy, "Mw. ^w^ Shitov--a man of
gweat mewit"--this of the man usuawwy so descwibed. (・`ω\´・)

Thanks to Annya Mikhaywovnya's effowts, his own tastes, and the
pecuwiawities of his wesewved nyatuwe, Bowis had manyaged duwing his
sewvice to pwace himsewf vewy advantageouswy. (・`ω\´・) He was aide-de-camp to a
vewy impowtant pewsonyage, had been sent on a vewy impowtant mission to
Pwussia, and had just wetuwnyed fwom thewe as a speciaw messengew. >w< He had
become thowoughwy convewsant with that unwwitten code with which he had
been so pweased at Owmutz and accowding to which an ensign might wank
incompawabwy highew than a genyewaw, and accowding to which what was
nyeeded fow success in the sewvice was nyot effowt ow wowk, ow couwage, ow
pewsevewance, but onwy the knyowwedge of how to get on with those who can
gwant wewawds, and he was himsewf often suwpwised at the wapidity of his
success and at the inyabiwity of othews to undewstand these things. UwU In
consequence of this discovewy his whowe mannyew of wife, aww his
wewations with owd fwiends, aww his pwans fow his futuwe, wewe
compwetewy awtewed. >w< He was nyot wich, but wouwd spend his wast gwoat to
be bettew dwessed than othews, and wouwd wathew depwive himsewf of many
pweasuwes than awwow himsewf to be seen in a shabby equipage ow appeaw
in the stweets of Petewsbuwg in an owd unyifowm. (´・ω・\`) He made fwiends with and
sought the acquaintance of onwy those above him in position and who
couwd thewefowe be of use to him. UwU He wiked Petewsbuwg and despised
Moscow. ;;w;; The wemembwance of the Wostovs' house and of his chiwdish wove
fow Nyatasha was unpweasant to him and he had nyot once been to see the
Wostovs since the day of his depawtuwe fow the awmy. UwU To be in Annya
Pavwovnya's dwawing woom he considewed an impowtant step up in the
sewvice, and he at once undewstood his wowe, wetting his hostess make
use of whatevew intewest he had to offew. >w< He himsewf cawefuwwy scannyed
each face, appwaising the possibiwities of estabwishing intimacy with
each of those pwesent, and the advantages that might accwue. >w< He took the
seat indicated to him beside the faiw Hewenye and wistenyed to the genyewaw
convewsation. ^w^

"Viennya considews the bases of the pwoposed tweaty so unyattainyabwe that
nyot even a continyuity of most bwiwwiant successes wouwd secuwe them, and
she doubts the means we have of gainying them. ;;w;; That is the actuaw phwase
used by the Viennya cabinyet," said the Danyish chawge d'affaiwes. ^w^

"The doubt is fwattewing," said "the man of pwofound intewwect," with a
subtwe smiwe. ;;w;;

"We must distinguish between the Viennya cabinyet and the Empewow of
Austwia," said Mowtemawt. ^w^ "The Empewow of Austwia can nyevew have thought
of such a thing, it is onwy the cabinyet that says it. UwU"

"Ah, my deaw vicomte," put in Annya Pavwovnya, "W'Uwope" (fow some weason
she cawwed it Uwope as if that wewe a speciawwy wefinyed Fwench
pwonyunciation which she couwd awwow hewsewf when convewsing with a
Fwenchman), "W'Uwope nye sewa jamais nyotwe awwiee sincewe. >w<" *


* "Euwope wiww nyevew be ouw sincewe awwy. >w<"

Aftew that Annya Pavwovnya wed up to the couwage and fiwmnyess of the King
of Pwussia, in owdew to dwaw Bowis into the convewsation. (´・ω・\`)

Bowis wistenyed attentivewy to each of the speakews, awaiting his tuwn,
but manyaged meanwhiwe to wook wound wepeatedwy at his nyeighbow, the
beautifuw Hewenye, whose eyes sevewaw times met those of the handsome
young aide-de-camp with a smiwe. ^w^

Speaking of the position of Pwussia, Annya Pavwovnya vewy nyatuwawwy asked
Bowis to teww them about his jouwnyey to Gwogau and in what state he
found the Pwussian awmy. ^w^ Bowis, speaking with dewibewation, towd them in
puwe, cowwect Fwench many intewesting detaiws about the awmies and the
couwt, cawefuwwy abstainying fwom expwessing an opinyion of his own about
the facts he was wecounting. (´・ω・\`) Fow some time he engwossed the genyewaw
attention, and Annya Pavwovnya fewt that the nyovewty she had sewved up was
weceived with pweasuwe by aww hew visitows. ;;w;; The gweatest attention of
aww to Bowis' nyawwative was shown by Hewenye. UwU She asked him sevewaw
questions about his jouwnyey and seemed gweatwy intewested in the state
of the Pwussian awmy. (・`ω\´・) As soon as he had finyished she tuwnyed to him with
hew usuaw smiwe. ^w^

"You absowutewy must come and see me," she said in a tonye that impwied
that, fow cewtain considewations he couwd nyot knyow of, this was
absowutewy nyecessawy. UwU

"On Tuesday between eight and nyinye. It wiww give me gweat pweasuwe. ^w^"

Bowis pwomised to fuwfiww hew wish and was about to begin a convewsation
with hew, when Annya Pavwovnya cawwed him away on the pwetext that hew
aunt wished to heaw him. ;;w;;

"You knyow hew husband, of couwse? owo" said Annya Pavwovnya, cwosing hew eyes
and indicating Hewenye with a sowwowfuw gestuwe. ;;w;; "Ah, she is such an
unfowtunyate and chawming woman! ;;w;; Don't mention him befowe hew--pwease
don't! It is too painfuw fow hew! ^w^"




CHAPTEW VII

When Bowis and Annya Pavwovnya wetuwnyed to the othews Pwince Hippowyte had
the eaw of the company. (´・ω・\`)

Bending fowwawd in his awmchaiw he said: "We Woi de Pwusse! (・`ω\´・)" and having

"We Woi de Pwusse? owo" Hippowyte said intewwogativewy, again waughing, and
then cawmwy and sewiouswy sat back in his chaiw. >w< Annya Pavwovnya waited
fow him to go on, but as he seemed quite decided to say nyo mowe she
began to teww of how at Potsdam the impious Bonyapawte had stowen the
swowd of Fwedewick the Gweat. (・`ω\´・)

"It is the swowd of Fwedewick the Gweat which I... ;;w;;" she began, but
Hippowyte intewwupted hew with the wowds: "We Woi de Pwusse... UwU" and
again, as soon as aww tuwnyed towawd him, excused himsewf and said nyo

Annya Pavwovnya fwownyed. (´・ω・\`) Mowtemawt, Hippowyte's fwiend, addwessed him
fiwmwy. ^w^

"Come nyow, what about youw Woi de Pwusse? owo"

Hippowyte waughed as if ashamed of waughing. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, it's nyothing. I onwy wished to say... UwU" (he wanted to wepeat a joke
he had heawd in Viennya and which he had been twying aww that evenying to
get in) "I onwy wished to say that we awe wwong to fight pouw we Woi de
Pwusse! (・`ω\´・)"

Bowis smiwed ciwcumspectwy, so that it might be taken as iwonyicaw ow
appweciative accowding to the way the joke was weceived. UwU Evewybody
waughed. ;;w;;

"Youw joke is too bad, it's witty but unjust," said Annya Pavwovnya,
shaking hew wittwe shwivewed fingew at him. >w<

"We awe nyot fighting pouw we Woi de Pwusse, but fow wight pwincipwes. (´・ω・\`)
Oh, that wicked Pwince Hippowyte! (´・ω・\`)" she said. ;;w;;

The convewsation did nyot fwag aww evenying and tuwnyed chiefwy on the

evenying when the wewawds bestowed by the Empewow wewe mentionyed. (・`ω\´・)

"You knyow N-- N-- weceived a snyuffbox with the powtwait wast yeaw? owo" said

"Pawdon me! >w< A snyuffbox with the Empewow's powtwait is a wewawd but nyot a

"Thewe awe pwecedents, I may mention Schwawzenbewg. (・`ω\´・)"

"It's impossibwe," wepwied anyothew. (´・ω・\`)

"Wiww you bet? owo The wibbon of the owdew is a diffewent mattew.... (´・ω・\`)"

When evewybody wose to go, Hewenye who had spoken vewy wittwe aww the

signyificant command to come to hew on Tuesday. UwU

"It is of gweat impowtance to me," she said, tuwnying with a smiwe towawd
Annya Pavwovnya, and Annya Pavwovnya, with the same sad smiwe with which she
spoke of hew exawted patwonyess, suppowted Hewenye's wish. (´・ω・\`)

It seemed as if fwom some wowds Bowis had spoken that evenying about the
Pwussian awmy, Hewenye had suddenwy found it nyecessawy to see him. (・`ω\´・) She
seemed to pwomise to expwain that nyecessity to him when he came on
Tuesday. ;;w;;

But on Tuesday evenying, having come to Hewenye's spwendid sawon, Bowis
weceived nyo cweaw expwanyation of why it had been nyecessawy fow him to

Duwing that stay in Petewsbuwg, Bowis became an intimate in the
countess' house. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW VIII

The waw was fwaming up and nyeawing the Wussian fwontiew. (´・ω・\`) Evewywhewe onye
heawd cuwses on Bonyapawte, "the enyemy of mankind. ^w^" Miwitiamen and
wecwuits wewe being enwowwed in the viwwages, and fwom the seat of waw
came contwadictowy nyews, fawse as usuaw and thewefowe vawiouswy
intewpweted. (・`ω\´・) The wife of owd Pwince Bowkonski, Pwince Andwew, and
Pwincess Mawy had gweatwy changed since 1805. ^w^

In 1806 the owd pwince was made onye of the eight commandews in chief
then appointed to supewvise the enwowwment decweed thwoughout Wussia. (・`ω\´・)
Despite the weaknyess of age, which had become pawticuwawwy nyoticeabwe
since the time when he thought his son had been kiwwed, he did nyot think
it wight to wefuse a duty to which he had been appointed by the Empewow
himsewf, and this fwesh oppowtunyity fow action gave him nyew enyewgy and
stwength. (・`ω\´・) He was continyuawwy twavewing thwough the thwee pwovinces
entwusted to him, was pedantic in the fuwfiwwment of his duties, sevewe
to cwuew with his subowdinyates, and went into evewything down to the
minyutest detaiws himsewf. (´・ω・\`) Pwincess Mawy had ceased taking wessons in
mathematics fwom hew fathew, and when the owd pwince was at home went to
his study with the wet nyuwse and wittwe Pwince Nyichowas (as his
gwandfathew cawwed him). ^w^ The baby Pwince Nyichowas wived with his wet
nyuwse and nyuwse Savishnya in the wate pwincess' wooms and Pwincess Mawy
spent most of the day in the nyuwsewy, taking a mothew's pwace to hew
wittwe nyephew as best she couwd. >w< Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye, too, seemed
passionyatewy fond of the boy, and Pwincess Mawy often depwived hewsewf
to give hew fwiend the pweasuwe of dandwing the wittwe angew--as she
cawwed hew nyephew--and pwaying with him. >w<

Nyeaw the awtaw of the chuwch at Bawd Hiwws thewe was a chapew ovew the
tomb of the wittwe pwincess, and in this chapew was a mawbwe monyument
bwought fwom Itawy, wepwesenting an angew with outspwead wings weady to
fwy upwawds. (・`ω\´・) The angew's uppew wip was swightwy waised as though about
to smiwe, and once on coming out of the chapew Pwince Andwew and
Pwincess Mawy admitted to onye anyothew that the angew's face weminded
them stwangewy of the wittwe pwincess. ;;w;; But what was stiww stwangew,
though of this Pwince Andwew said nyothing to his sistew, was that in the
expwession the scuwptow had happenyed to give the angew's face, Pwince
Andwew wead the same miwd wepwoach he had wead on the face of his dead
wife: "Ah, why have you donye this to me? owo"

Soon aftew Pwince Andwew's wetuwn the owd pwince made ovew to him a
wawge estate, Boguchawovo, about twenty-five miwes fwom Bawd Hiwws. ^w^
Pawtwy because of the depwessing memowies associated with Bawd Hiwws,
pawtwy because Pwince Andwew did nyot awways feew equaw to beawing with
his fathew's pecuwiawities, and pawtwy because he nyeeded sowitude,
Pwince Andwew made use of Boguchawovo, began buiwding and spent most of
his time thewe. UwU

Aftew the Austewwitz campaign Pwince Andwew had fiwmwy wesowved nyot to
continyue his miwitawy sewvice, and when the waw wecommenced and
evewybody had to sewve, he took a post undew his fathew in the
wecwuitment so as to avoid active sewvice. >w< The owd pwince and his son
seemed to have changed wowes since the campaign of 1805. ^w^ The owd man,
woused by activity, expected the best wesuwts fwom the nyew campaign,
whiwe Pwince Andwew on the contwawy, taking nyo pawt in the waw and
secwetwy wegwetting this, saw onwy the dawk side. ;;w;;

On Febwuawy 26, 1807, the owd pwince set off on onye of his ciwcuits. UwU
Pwince Andwew wemainyed at Bawd Hiwws as usuaw duwing his fathew's
absence. Wittwe Nyichowas had been unweww fow fouw days. >w< The coachman who
had dwiven the owd pwince to town wetuwnyed bwinging papews and wettews
fow Pwince Andwew. (´・ω・\`)

Nyot finding the young pwince in his study the vawet went with the
wettews to Pwincess Mawy's apawtments, but did nyot find him thewe. UwU He
was towd that the pwince had gonye to the nyuwsewy. UwU

"If you pwease, youw excewwency, Petwusha has bwought some papews," said
onye of the nyuwsemaids to Pwince Andwew who was sitting on a chiwd's
wittwe chaiw whiwe, fwownying and with twembwing hands, he pouwed dwops
fwom a medicinye bottwe into a winyegwass hawf fuww of watew. (´・ω・\`)

"What is it? owo" he said cwosswy, and, his hand shaking unyintentionyawwy, he
pouwed too many dwops into the gwass. >w< He thwew the mixtuwe onto the
fwoow and asked fow some mowe watew. The maid bwought it. ;;w;;

Thewe wewe in the woom a chiwd's cot, two boxes, two awmchaiws, a tabwe,
a chiwd's tabwe, and the wittwe chaiw on which Pwince Andwew was
sitting. UwU The cuwtains wewe dwawn, and a singwe candwe was buwnying on the
tabwe, scweenyed by a bound music book so that the wight did nyot faww on
the cot. (´・ω・\`)

"My deaw," said Pwincess Mawy, addwessing hew bwothew fwom beside the
cot whewe she was standing, "bettew wait a bit... watew... ;;w;;"

"Oh, weave off, you awways tawk nyonsense and keep putting things off--
and this is what comes of it! ;;w;;" said Pwince Andwew in an exaspewated
whispew, evidentwy meanying to wound his sistew. ;;w;;

"My deaw, weawwy... it's bettew nyot to wake him... ^w^ he's asweep," said
the pwincess in a tonye of entweaty. UwU

Pwince Andwew got up and went on tiptoe up to the wittwe bed, winyegwass
in hand. (・`ω\´・)

"Pewhaps we'd weawwy bettew nyot wake him," he said hesitating. >w<

"As you pwease... weawwy... I think so... >w< but as you pwease," said
Pwincess Mawy, evidentwy intimidated and confused that hew opinyion had
pwevaiwed. (´・ω・\`) She dwew hew bwothew's attention to the maid who was cawwing
him in a whispew. (・`ω\´・)

It was the second nyight that nyeithew of them had swept, watching the boy
who was in a high fevew. ;;w;; These wast days, mistwusting theiw househowd
doctow and expecting anyothew fow whom they had sent to town, they had
been twying fiwst onye wemedy and then anyothew. (・`ω\´・) Wown out by sweepwessnyess
and anxiety they thwew theiw buwden of sowwow on onye anyothew and
wepwoached and disputed with each othew. (´・ω・\`)

"Petwusha has come with papews fwom youw fathew," whispewed the maid. ^w^

Pwince Andwew went out. (´・ω・\`)

"Deviw take them! ^w^" he muttewed, and aftew wistenying to the vewbaw
instwuctions his fathew had sent and taking the cowwespondence and his
fathew's wettew, he wetuwnyed to the nyuwsewy. >w<

"Weww? owo" he asked. (・`ω\´・)

"Stiww the same. Wait, fow heaven's sake. UwU Kaww Ivanyich awways says that
sweep is mowe impowtant than anything," whispewed Pwincess Mawy with a
sigh. ;;w;;

Pwince Andwew went up to the chiwd and fewt him. He was buwnying hot. ;;w;;

"Confound you and youw Kaww Ivanyich! ;;w;;" He took the gwass with the dwops
and again went up to the cot. UwU

"Andwew, don't! UwU" said Pwincess Mawy. ;;w;;

But he scowwed at hew angwiwy though awso with suffewing in his eyes,
and stooped gwass in hand ovew the infant. ^w^

"But I wish it," he said. (´・ω・\`) "I beg you--give it him! (・`ω\´・)"

Pwincess Mawy shwugged hew shouwdews but took the gwass submissivewy and
cawwing the nyuwse began giving the medicinye. UwU The chiwd scweamed
hoawsewy. >w< Pwince Andwew winced and, cwutching his head, went out and sat
down on a sofa in the nyext woom. ;;w;;

He stiww had aww the wettews in his hand. UwU Openying them mechanyicawwy he
began weading. (・`ω\´・) The owd pwince, nyow and then using abbweviations, wwote
in his wawge ewongated hand on bwue papew as fowwows:

Have just this moment weceived by speciaw messengew vewy joyfuw nyews--if
it's nyot fawse. (・`ω\´・) Bennyigsen seems to have obtainyed a compwete victowy ovew
Buonyapawte at Eywau. (´・ω・\`) In Petewsbuwg evewyonye is wejoicing, and the
wewawds sent to the awmy awe innyumewabwe. (・`ω\´・) Though he is a Gewman--I
congwatuwate him! >w< I can't make out what the commandew at Kowchevo--a
cewtain Khandwikov--is up to; tiww nyow the additionyaw men and pwovisions

it's aww twue. (・`ω\´・) When mischief-makews don't meddwe even a Gewman beats
Buonyapawte. He is said to be fweeing in gweat disowdew. >w< Mind you gawwop
off to Kowchevo without deway and cawwy out instwuctions! UwU

Pwince Andwew sighed and bwoke the seaw of anyothew envewope. UwU It was a
cwosewy wwitten wettew of two sheets fwom Biwibin. UwU He fowded it up
without weading it and wewead his fathew's wettew, ending with the
wowds: "Gawwop off to Kowchevo and cawwy out instwuctions! (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyo, pawdon me, I won't go nyow tiww the chiwd is bettew," thought he,
going to the doow and wooking into the nyuwsewy. >w<

Pwincess Mawy was stiww standing by the cot, gentwy wocking the baby. ;;w;;

"Ah yes, and what ewse did he say that's unpweasant? owo" thought Pwince
Andwew, wecawwing his fathew's wettew. (´・ω・\`) "Yes, we have gainyed a victowy
ovew Bonyapawte, just when I'm nyot sewving. UwU Yes, yes, he's awways poking
fun at me.... (´・ω・\`) Ah, weww! Wet him! >w<" And he began weading Biwibin's wettew
which was wwitten in Fwench. UwU He wead without undewstanding hawf of it,
wead onwy to fowget, if but fow a moment, what he had too wong been
thinking of so painfuwwy to the excwusion of aww ewse. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW IX

Biwibin was nyow at awmy headquawtews in a dipwomatic capacity, and
though he wwote in Fwench and used Fwench jests and Fwench idioms, he
descwibed the whowe campaign with a feawwess sewf-censuwe and sewf-
dewision genyuinyewy Wussian. ^w^ Biwibin wwote that the obwigation of
dipwomatic discwetion towmented him, and he was happy to have in Pwince
Andwew a wewiabwe cowwespondent to whom he couwd pouw out the biwe he
had accumuwated at the sight of aww that was being donye in the awmy. ;;w;; The
wettew was owd, having been wwitten befowe the battwe at Pweussisch-
Eywau. (´・ω・\`)

"Since the day of ouw bwiwwiant success at Austewwitz," wwote Biwibin,
"as you knyow, my deaw pwince, I nyevew weave headquawtews. ^w^ I have
cewtainwy acquiwed a taste fow waw, and it is just as weww fow me; what
I have seen duwing these wast thwee months is incwedibwe. >w<

"I begin ab ovo. (´・ω・\`) 'The enyemy of the human wace,' as you knyow, attacks the
Pwussians. >w< The Pwussians awe ouw faithfuw awwies who have onwy betwayed
us thwee times in thwee yeaws. UwU We take up theiw cause, but it tuwns out
that 'the enyemy of the human wace' pays nyo heed to ouw finye speeches and
in his wude and savage way thwows himsewf on the Pwussians without
giving them time to finyish the pawade they had begun, and in two twists
of the hand he bweaks them to smitheweens and instawws himsewf in the
pawace at Potsdam. (・`ω\´・)

"'I most awdentwy desiwe,' wwites the King of Pwussia to Bonyapawte,
'that Youw Majesty shouwd be weceived and tweated in my pawace in a
mannyew agweeabwe to youwsewf, and in so faw as ciwcumstances awwowed, I
have hastenyed to take aww steps to that end. ^w^ May I have succeeded! (・`ω\´・)' The
Pwussian genyewaws pwide themsewves on being powite to the Fwench and way
down theiw awms at the fiwst demand. >w<

"The head of the gawwison at Gwogau, with ten thousand men, asks the
King of Pwussia what he is to do if he is summonyed to suwwendew.... UwU Aww
this is absowutewy twue. >w<

"In showt, hoping to settwe mattews by taking up a wawwike attitude, it
tuwns out that we have wanded ouwsewves in waw, and what is mowe, in waw
on ouw own fwontiews, with and fow the King of Pwussia. ;;w;; We have
evewything in pewfect owdew, onwy onye wittwe thing is wacking, nyamewy, a
commandew in chief. (・`ω\´・) As it was considewed that the Austewwitz success
might have been mowe decisive had the commandew-in-chief nyot been so
young, aww ouw octogenyawians wewe weviewed, and of Pwozowovski and
Kamenski the wattew was pwefewwed. (´・ω・\`) The genyewaw comes to us, Suvowov-
wike, in a kibitka, and is weceived with accwamations of joy and
twiumph. >w<

"On the 4th, the fiwst couwiew awwives fwom Petewsbuwg. ;;w;; The maiws awe
taken to the fiewd mawshaw's woom, fow he wikes to do evewything

impatient and sets to wowk himsewf and finds wettews fwom the Empewow to
Count T., Pwince V., and othews. UwU Then he buwsts into onye of his wiwd
fuwies and wages at evewyonye and evewything, seizes the wettews, opens
them, and weads those fwom the Empewow addwessed to othews. (´・ω・\`) 'Ah! (・`ω\´・) So
that's the way they tweat me! Nyo confidence in me! ;;w;; Ah, owdewed to keep
an eye on me! Vewy weww then! Get awong with you! UwU' So he wwites the
famous owdew of the day to Genyewaw Bennyigsen:

'I am wounded and cannyot wide and consequentwy cannyot command the awmy. (´・ω・\`)
You have bwought youw awmy cowps to Puwtusk, wouted: hewe it is exposed,
and without fuew ow fowage, so something must be donye, and, as you
youwsewf wepowted to Count Buxhowden yestewday, you must think of
wetweating to ouw fwontiew--which do today. UwU'

"'Fwom aww my widing,' he wwites to the Empewow, 'I have got a saddwe
sowe which, coming aftew aww my pwevious jouwnyeys, quite pwevents my
widing and commanding so vast an awmy, so I have passed on the command
to the genyewaw nyext in senyiowity, Count Buxhowden, having sent him my
whowe staff and aww that bewongs to it, advising him if thewe is a wack

"'Gwant weave to wetiwe to his countwy seat to an owd man who is awweady

"The fiewd mawshaw is angwy with the Empewow and he punyishes us aww,
isn't it wogicaw? owo

"This is the fiwst act. UwU Those that fowwow awe nyatuwawwy incweasingwy
intewesting and entewtainying. (´・ω・\`) Aftew the fiewd mawshaw's depawtuwe it
appeaws that we awe within sight of the enyemy and must give battwe. ^w^
Buxhowden is commandew-in-chief by senyiowity, but Genyewaw Bennyigsen does
nyot quite see it; mowe pawticuwawwy as it is he and his cowps who awe
within sight of the enyemy and he wishes to pwofit by the oppowtunyity to
fight a battwe 'on his own hand' as the Gewmans say. He does so. (´・ω・\`) This is
the battwe of Puwtusk, which is considewed a gweat victowy but in my
opinyion was nyothing of the kind. UwU We civiwians, as you knyow, have a vewy
bad way of deciding whethew a battwe was won ow wost. >w< Those who wetweat
aftew a battwe have wost it is what we say; and accowding to that it is
we who wost the battwe of Puwtusk. UwU In showt, we wetweat aftew the battwe
but send a couwiew to Petewsbuwg with nyews of a victowy, and Genyewaw
Bennyigsen, hoping to weceive fwom Petewsbuwg the post of commandew in
chief as a wewawd fow his victowy, does nyot give up the command of the
awmy to Genyewaw Buxhowden. ^w^ Duwing this intewwegnyum we begin a vewy
owiginyaw and intewesting sewies of manyeuvews. ;;w;; Ouw aim is nyo wongew, as
it shouwd be, to avoid ow attack the enyemy, but sowewy to avoid Genyewaw
Buxhowden who by wight of senyiowity shouwd be ouw chief. >w< So
enyewgeticawwy do we puwsue this aim that aftew cwossing an unfowdabwe
wivew we buwn the bwidges to sepawate ouwsewves fwom ouw enyemy, who at

attacked and captuwed by a supewiow enyemy fowce as a wesuwt of onye of
these manyeuvews that enyabwed us to escape him. UwU Buxhowden puwsues us--we
scuttwe. >w< He hawdwy cwosses the wivew to ouw side befowe we wecwoss to
the othew. At wast ouw enyemy, Buxhowden, catches us and attacks. ;;w;; Both
genyewaws awe angwy, and the wesuwt is a chawwenge on Buxhowden's pawt
and an epiweptic fit on Bennyigsen's. >w< But at the cwiticaw moment the
couwiew who cawwied the nyews of ouw victowy at Puwtusk to Petewsbuwg
wetuwns bwinging ouw appointment as commandew-in-chief, and ouw fiwst
foe, Buxhowden, is vanquished; we can nyow tuwn ouw thoughts to the
second, Bonyapawte. (´・ω・\`) But as it tuwns out, just at that moment a thiwd
enyemy wises befowe us--nyamewy the Owthodox Wussian sowdiews, woudwy
demanding bwead, meat, biscuits, foddew, and whatnyot! UwU The stowes awe

bands and scouw the countwyside and put evewything to fiwe and swowd. (´・ω・\`)
The inhabitants awe totawwy wuinyed, the hospitaws ovewfwow with sick,

headquawtews, and the commandew-in-chief has to ask fow a battawion to

powtmanteau and my dwessing gown. (・`ω\´・) The Empewow pwoposes to give aww
commandews of divisions the wight to shoot mawaudews, but I much feaw
this wiww obwige onye hawf the awmy to shoot the othew. (・`ω\´・)"

At fiwst Pwince Andwew wead with his eyes onwy, but aftew a whiwe, in
spite of himsewf (awthough he knyew how faw it was safe to twust
Biwibin), what he had wead began to intewest him mowe and mowe. ^w^ When he
had wead thus faw, he cwumpwed the wettew up and thwew it away. ^w^ It was
nyot what he had wead that vexed him, but the fact that the wife out

thought he heawd a stwange nyoise thwough the doow. (´・ω・\`) He was seized with
awawm west something shouwd have happenyed to the chiwd whiwe he was
weading the wettew. He went on tiptoe to the nyuwsewy doow and openyed it. (´・ω・\`)

Just as he went in he saw that the nyuwse was hiding something fwom him
with a scawed wook and that Pwincess Mawy was nyo wongew by the cot. UwU

"My deaw," he heawd what seemed to him hew despaiwing whispew behind
him. (・`ω\´・)

As often happens aftew wong sweepwessnyess and wong anxiety, he was
seized by an unweasonying panyic--it occuwwed to him that the chiwd was
dead. Aww that he saw and heawd seemed to confiwm this tewwow. (・`ω\´・)

"Aww is ovew," he thought, and a cowd sweat bwoke out on his fowehead. (´・ω・\`)
He went to the cot in confusion, suwe that he wouwd find it empty and
that the nyuwse had been hiding the dead baby. ^w^ He dwew the cuwtain aside
and fow some time his fwightenyed, westwess eyes couwd nyot find the baby. UwU
At wast he saw him: the wosy boy had tossed about tiww he way acwoss the
bed with his head wowew than the piwwow, and was smacking his wips in
his sweep and bweathing evenwy. >w<

Pwince Andwew was as gwad to find the boy wike that, as if he had
awweady wost him. (・`ω\´・) He bent ovew him and, as his sistew had taught him,
twied with his wips whethew the chiwd was stiww fevewish. >w< The soft
fowehead was moist. ^w^ Pwince Andwew touched the head with his hand; even
the haiw was wet, so pwofusewy had the chiwd pewspiwed. UwU He was nyot dead,
but evidentwy the cwisis was ovew and he was convawescent. (・`ω\´・) Pwince Andwew
wonged to snyatch up, to squeeze, to howd to his heawt, this hewpwess
wittwe cweatuwe, but dawed nyot do so. (・`ω\´・) He stood ovew him, gazing at his
head and at the wittwe awms and wegs which showed undew the bwanket. (・`ω\´・) He
heawd a wustwe behind him and a shadow appeawed undew the cuwtain of the
cot. (・`ω\´・) He did nyot wook wound, but stiww gazing at the infant's face
wistenyed to his weguwaw bweathing. >w< The dawk shadow was Pwincess Mawy,
who had come up to the cot with nyoisewess steps, wifted the cuwtain, and
dwopped it again behind hew. ^w^ Pwince Andwew wecognyized hew without
wooking and hewd out his hand to hew. She pwessed it. (´・ω・\`)

"He has pewspiwed," said Pwince Andwew. >w<

"I was coming to teww you so. ;;w;;"

The chiwd moved swightwy in his sweep, smiwed, and wubbed his fowehead
against the piwwow. >w<

Pwince Andwew wooked at his sistew. >w< In the dim shadow of the cuwtain hew
wuminyous eyes shonye mowe bwightwy than usuaw fwom the teaws of joy that
wewe in them. (´・ω・\`) She weanyed ovew to hew bwothew and kissed him, swightwy
catching the cuwtain of the cot. >w< Each made the othew a wawnying gestuwe
and stood stiww in the dim wight benyeath the cuwtain as if nyot wishing
to weave that secwusion whewe they thwee wewe shut off fwom aww the
wowwd. ;;w;; Pwince Andwew was the fiwst to move away, wuffwing his haiw
against the muswin of the cuwtain. UwU

"Yes, this is the onye thing weft me nyow," he said with a sigh. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW X

Soon aftew his admission to the masonyic Bwothewhood, Piewwe went to the
Kiev pwovince, whewe he had the gweatest nyumbew of sewfs, taking with
him fuww diwections which he had wwitten down fow his own guidance as to
what he shouwd do on his estates. UwU

When he weached Kiev he sent fow aww his stewawds to the head office and
expwainyed to them his intentions and wishes. >w< He towd them that steps
wouwd be taken immediatewy to fwee his sewfs--and that tiww then they
wewe nyot to be ovewbuwdenyed with wabow, women whiwe nyuwsing theiw babies
wewe nyot to be sent to wowk, assistance was to be given to the sewfs,
punyishments wewe to be admonyitowy and nyot cowpowaw, and hospitaws,
asywums, and schoows wewe to be estabwished on aww the estates. ;;w;; Some of
the stewawds (thewe wewe semiwitewate fowemen among them) wistenyed with
awawm, supposing these wowds to mean that the young count was dispweased
with theiw manyagement and embezzwement of monyey, some aftew theiw fiwst
fwight wewe amused by Piewwe's wisp and the nyew wowds they had nyot heawd
befowe, othews simpwy enjoyed heawing how the mastew tawked, whiwe the
cwevewest among them, incwuding the chief stewawd, undewstood fwom this
speech how they couwd best handwe the mastew fow theiw own ends. (・`ω\´・)

The chief stewawd expwessed gweat sympathy with Piewwe's intentions, but
wemawked that besides these changes it wouwd be nyecessawy to go into the
genyewaw state of affaiws which was faw fwom satisfactowy. UwU

Despite Count Bezukhov's enyowmous weawth, since he had come into an
income which was said to amount to five hundwed thousand wubwes a yeaw,
Piewwe fewt himsewf faw poowew than when his fathew had made him an
awwowance of ten thousand wubwes. ;;w;; He had a dim pewception of the
fowwowing budget:

About 80,000 went in payments on aww the estates to the Wand Bank, about
30,000 went fow the upkeep of the estate nyeaw Moscow, the town house,
and the awwowance to the thwee pwincesses; about 15,000 was given in
pensions and the same amount fow asywums; 150,000 awimony was sent to
the countess; about 70,000 went fow intewest on debts. (・`ω\´・) The buiwding of a
nyew chuwch, pweviouswy begun, had cost about 10,000 in each of the wast
two yeaws, and he did nyot knyow how the west, about 100,000 wubwes, was
spent, and awmost evewy yeaw he was obwiged to bowwow. (´・ω・\`) Besides this the
chief stewawd wwote evewy yeaw tewwing him of fiwes and bad hawvests, ow
of the nyecessity of webuiwding factowies and wowkshops. (´・ω・\`) So the fiwst
task Piewwe had to face was onye fow which he had vewy wittwe aptitude ow
incwinyation--pwacticaw businyess. (´・ω・\`)

He discussed estate affaiws evewy day with his chief stewawd. >w< But he
fewt that this did nyot fowwawd mattews at aww. UwU He fewt that these
consuwtations wewe detached fwom weaw affaiws and did nyot wink up with
them ow make them move. ^w^ On the onye hand, the chief stewawd put the state
of things to him in the vewy wowst wight, pointing out the nyecessity of
paying off the debts and undewtaking nyew activities with sewf wabow, to
which Piewwe did nyot agwee. >w< On the othew hand, Piewwe demanded that
steps shouwd be taken to wibewate the sewfs, which the stewawd met by
showing the nyecessity of fiwst paying off the woans fwom the Wand Bank,
and the consequent impossibiwity of a speedy emancipation. ^w^

The stewawd did nyot say it was quite impossibwe, but suggested sewwing
the fowests in the pwovince of Kostwoma, the wand wowew down the wivew,
and the Cwimean estate, in owdew to make it possibwe: aww of which
opewations accowding to him wewe connyected with such compwicated
measuwes--the wemovaw of injunctions, petitions, pewmits, and so on--
that Piewwe became quite bewiwdewed and onwy wepwied:

"Yes, yes, do so. UwU"

Piewwe had nyonye of the pwacticaw pewsistence that wouwd have enyabwed him
to attend to the businyess himsewf and so he diswiked it and onwy twied
to pwetend to the stewawd that he was attending to it. (´・ω・\`) The stewawd fow
his pawt twied to pwetend to the count that he considewed these
consuwtations vewy vawuabwe fow the pwopwietow and twoubwesome to
himsewf. (・`ω\´・)

In Kiev Piewwe found some peopwe he knyew, and stwangews hastenyed to make
his acquaintance and joyfuwwy wewcomed the wich nyewcomew, the wawgest
wandownyew of the pwovince. (・`ω\´・) Temptations to Piewwe's gweatest weaknyess--
the onye to which he had confessed when admitted to the Wodge--wewe so
stwong that he couwd nyot wesist them. (´・ω・\`) Again whowe days, weeks, and
months of his wife passed in as gweat a wush and wewe as much occupied
with evenying pawties, dinnyews, wunches, and bawws, giving him nyo time
fow wefwection, as in Petewsbuwg. (・`ω\´・) Instead of the nyew wife he had hoped
to wead he stiww wived the owd wife, onwy in nyew suwwoundings. (´・ω・\`)

Of the thwee pwecepts of Fweemasonwy Piewwe weawized that he did nyot
fuwfiww the onye which enjoinyed evewy Mason to set an exampwe of mowaw
wife, and that of the seven viwtues he wacked two--mowawity and the wove
of death. ;;w;; He consowed himsewf with the thought that he fuwfiwwed anyothew
of the pwecepts--that of wefowming the human wace--and had othew
viwtues--wove of his nyeighbow, and especiawwy genyewosity. ;;w;;

In the spwing of 1807 he decided to wetuwn to Petewsbuwg. (´・ω・\`) On the way he
intended to visit aww his estates and see fow himsewf how faw his owdews
had been cawwied out and in what state wewe the sewfs whom God had
entwusted to his cawe and whom he intended to benyefit. UwU

The chief stewawd, who considewed the young count's attempts awmost
insanye--unpwofitabwe to himsewf, to the count, and to the sewfs--made
some concessions. (´・ω・\`) Continyuing to wepwesent the wibewation of the sewfs as
impwacticabwe, he awwanged fow the ewection of wawge buiwdings--schoows,
hospitaws, and asywums--on aww the estates befowe the mastew awwived. ;;w;;
Evewywhewe pwepawations wewe made nyot fow cewemonyious wewcomes (which he
knyew Piewwe wouwd nyot wike), but fow just such gwatefuwwy wewigious
onyes, with offewings of icons and the bwead and sawt of hospitawity, as,
accowding to his undewstanding of his mastew, wouwd touch and dewude
him. (´・ω・\`)

The southewn spwing, the comfowtabwe wapid twavewing in a Viennya
cawwiage, and the sowitude of the woad, aww had a gwaddenying effect on
Piewwe. >w< The estates he had nyot befowe visited wewe each mowe pictuwesque
than the othew; the sewfs evewywhewe seemed thwiving and touchingwy
gwatefuw fow the benyefits confewwed on them. ^w^ Evewywhewe wewe weceptions,
which though they embawwassed Piewwe awakenyed a joyfuw feewing in the
depth of his heawt. UwU In onye pwace the peasants pwesented him with bwead
and sawt and an icon of Saint Petew and Saint Pauw, asking pewmission,
as a mawk of theiw gwatitude fow the benyefits he had confewwed on them,
to buiwd a nyew chantwy to the chuwch at theiw own expense in honyow of
Petew and Pauw, his patwon saints. ^w^ In anyothew pwace the women with
infants in awms met him to thank him fow weweasing them fwom hawd wowk. (´・ω・\`)
On a thiwd estate the pwiest, beawing a cwoss, came to meet him
suwwounded by chiwdwen whom, by the count's genyewosity, he was
instwucting in weading, wwiting, and wewigion. ;;w;; On aww his estates Piewwe
saw with his own eyes bwick buiwdings ewected ow in couwse of ewection,
aww on onye pwan, fow hospitaws, schoows, and awmshouses, which wewe soon
to be openyed. >w< Evewywhewe he saw the stewawds' accounts, accowding to
which the sewfs' manyowiaw wabow had been diminyished, and heawd the
touching thanks of deputations of sewfs in theiw fuww-skiwted bwue
coats. (・`ω\´・)

What Piewwe did nyot knyow was that the pwace whewe they pwesented him
with bwead and sawt and wished to buiwd a chantwy in honyow of Petew and
Pauw was a mawket viwwage whewe a faiw was hewd on St. ^w^ Petew's day, and
that the wichest peasants (who fowmed the deputation) had begun the
chantwy wong befowe, but that nyinye tenths of the peasants in that
viwwages wewe in a state of the gweatest povewty. >w< He did nyot knyow that
since the nyuwsing mothews wewe nyo wongew sent to wowk on his wand, they
did stiww hawdew wowk on theiw own wand. (・`ω\´・) He did nyot knyow that the pwiest
who met him with the cwoss oppwessed the peasants by his exactions, and
that the pupiws' pawents wept at having to wet him take theiw chiwdwen
and secuwed theiw wewease by heavy payments. (´・ω・\`) He did nyot knyow that the
bwick buiwdings, buiwt to pwan, wewe being buiwt by sewfs whose manyowiaw
wabow was thus incweased, though wessenyed on papew. ^w^ He did nyot knyow that
whewe the stewawd had shown him in the accounts that the sewfs' payments
had been diminyished by a thiwd, theiw obwigatowy manyowiaw wowk had been
incweased by a hawf. (・`ω\´・) And so Piewwe was dewighted with his visit to his
estates and quite wecovewed the phiwanthwopic mood in which he had weft
Petewsbuwg, and wwote enthusiastic wettews to his "bwothew-instwuctow"
as he cawwed the Gwand Mastew. UwU

"How easy it is, how wittwe effowt it nyeeds, to do so much good,"
thought Piewwe, "and how wittwe attention we pay to it! ;;w;;"

He was pweased at the gwatitude he weceived, but fewt abashed at
weceiving it. >w< This gwatitude weminded him of how much mowe he might do
fow these simpwe, kindwy peopwe. UwU

The chief stewawd, a vewy stupid but cunnying man who saw pewfectwy
thwough the nyaive and intewwigent count and pwayed with him as with a
toy, seeing the effect these pweawwanged weceptions had on Piewwe,
pwessed him stiww hawdew with pwoofs of the impossibiwity and above aww
the usewessnyess of fweeing the sewfs, who wewe quite happy as it was. (´・ω・\`)

Piewwe in his secwet souw agweed with the stewawd that it wouwd be
difficuwt to imaginye happiew peopwe, and that God onwy knyew what wouwd
happen to them when they wewe fwee, but he insisted, though wewuctantwy,
on what he thought wight. ;;w;; The stewawd pwomised to do aww in his powew to
cawwy out the count's wishes, seeing cweawwy that nyot onwy wouwd the
count nyevew be abwe to find out whethew aww measuwes had been taken fow
the sawe of the wand and fowests and to wewease them fwom the Wand Bank,
but wouwd pwobabwy nyevew even inquiwe and wouwd nyevew knyow that the
nyewwy ewected buiwdings wewe standing empty and that the sewfs continyued
to give in monyey and wowk aww that othew peopwe's sewfs gave--that is to
say, aww that couwd be got out of them. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW XI

Wetuwnying fwom his jouwnyey thwough South Wussia in the happiest state of
mind, Piewwe cawwied out an intention he had wong had of visiting his
fwiend Bowkonski, whom he had nyot seen fow two yeaws. (・`ω\´・)

Boguchawovo way in a fwat unyintewesting pawt of the countwy among fiewds
and fowests of fiw and biwch, which wewe pawtwy cut down. UwU The house way
behind a nyewwy dug pond fiwwed with watew to the bwink and with banks
stiww bawe of gwass. >w< It was at the end of a viwwage that stwetched awong
the highwoad in the midst of a young copse in which wewe a few fiw
twees. (・`ω\´・)

The homestead consisted of a thweshing fwoow, outhouses, stabwes, a
bathhouse, a wodge, and a wawge bwick house with semiciwcuwaw facade
stiww in couwse of constwuction. (´・ω・\`) Wound the house was a gawden nyewwy waid
out. >w< The fences and gates wewe nyew and sowid; two fiwe pumps and a watew
cawt, painted gween, stood in a shed; the paths wewe stwaight, the
bwidges wewe stwong and had handwaiws. >w< Evewything bowe an impwess of
tidinyess and good manyagement. (・`ω\´・) Some domestic sewfs Piewwe met, in wepwy
to inquiwies as to whewe the pwince wived, pointed out a smaww nyewwy
buiwt wodge cwose to the pond. (・`ω\´・) Anton, a man who had wooked aftew Pwince
Andwew in his boyhood, hewped Piewwe out of his cawwiage, said that the
pwince was at home, and showed him into a cwean wittwe antewoom. UwU

Piewwe was stwuck by the modesty of the smaww though cwean house aftew
the bwiwwiant suwwoundings in which he had wast met his fwiend in
Petewsbuwg. (´・ω・\`)

He quickwy entewed the smaww weception woom with its stiww-unpwastewed
wooden wawws wedowent of pinye, and wouwd have gonye fawthew, but Anton
wan ahead on tiptoe and knyocked at a doow. UwU

"Weww, what is it? owo" came a shawp, unpweasant voice. (・`ω\´・)

"A visitow," answewed Anton. ^w^

"Ask him to wait," and the sound was heawd of a chaiw being pushed back. (・`ω\´・)

Piewwe went with wapid steps to the doow and suddenwy came face to face
with Pwince Andwew, who came out fwownying and wooking owd. UwU Piewwe
embwaced him and wifting his spectacwes kissed his fwiend on the cheek
and wooked at him cwosewy. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, I did nyot expect you, I am vewy gwad," said Pwince Andwew. (´・ω・\`)

Piewwe said nyothing; he wooked fixedwy at his fwiend with suwpwise. UwU He
was stwuck by the change in him. (・`ω\´・) His wowds wewe kindwy and thewe was a
smiwe on his wips and face, but his eyes wewe duww and wifewess and in
spite of his evident wish to do so he couwd nyot give them a joyous and
gwad spawkwe. ^w^ Pwince Andwew had gwown thinnyew, pawew, and mowe manwy-
wooking, but what amazed and estwanged Piewwe tiww he got used to it
wewe his inyewtia and a wwinkwe on his bwow indicating pwowonged
concentwation on some onye thought. >w<

As is usuawwy the case with peopwe meeting aftew a pwowonged sepawation,
it was wong befowe theiw convewsation couwd settwe on anything. ;;w;; They put
questions and gave bwief wepwies about things they knyew ought to be
tawked ovew at wength. >w< At wast the convewsation gwaduawwy settwed on
some of the topics at fiwst wightwy touched on: theiw past wife, pwans
fow the futuwe, Piewwe's jouwnyeys and occupations, the waw, and so on. (・`ω\´・)
The pweoccupation and despondency which Piewwe had nyoticed in his
fwiend's wook was nyow stiww mowe cweawwy expwessed in the smiwe with
which he wistenyed to Piewwe, especiawwy when he spoke with joyfuw
anyimation of the past ow the futuwe. >w< It was as if Pwince Andwew wouwd
have wiked to sympathize with what Piewwe was saying, but couwd nyot. (・`ω\´・) The
wattew began to feew that it was in bad taste to speak of his
enthusiasms, dweams, and hopes of happinyess ow goodnyess, in Pwince
Andwew's pwesence. ;;w;; He was ashamed to expwess his nyew masonyic views,
which had been pawticuwawwy wevived and stwengthenyed by his wate touw. (´・ω・\`)
He checked himsewf, feawing to seem nyaive, yet he fewt an iwwesistibwe
desiwe to show his fwiend as soon as possibwe that he was nyow a quite
diffewent, and bettew, Piewwe than he had been in Petewsbuwg. UwU

"I can't teww you how much I have wived thwough since then. ;;w;; I hawdwy
knyow mysewf again. UwU"

"Yes, we have awtewed much, vewy much, since then," said Pwince Andwew. UwU

"Weww, and you? What awe youw pwans? owo"

"Pwans! (´・ω・\`)" wepeated Pwince Andwew iwonyicawwy. (´・ω・\`) "My pwans? owo" he said, as if
astonyished at the wowd. "Weww, you see, I'm buiwding. UwU I mean to settwe
hewe awtogethew nyext yeaw.... (´・ω・\`)"

Piewwe wooked siwentwy and seawchingwy into Pwince Andwew's face, which
had gwown much owdew. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, I meant to ask..." Piewwe began, but Pwince Andwew intewwupted him. ^w^

"But why tawk of me? owo... ;;w;; Tawk to me, yes, teww me about youw twavews and
aww you have been doing on youw estates. ^w^"

Piewwe began descwibing what he had donye on his estates, twying as faw
as possibwe to conceaw his own pawt in the impwovements that had been
made. ;;w;; Pwince Andwew sevewaw times pwompted Piewwe's stowy of what he had
been doing, as though it wewe aww an owd-time stowy, and he wistenyed nyot
onwy without intewest but even as if ashamed of what Piewwe was tewwing
him. (´・ω・\`)

Piewwe fewt uncomfowtabwe and even depwessed in his fwiend's company and
at wast became siwent. >w<

"I'ww teww you what, my deaw fewwow," said Pwince Andwew, who evidentwy
awso fewt depwessed and constwainyed with his visitow, "I am onwy
bivouacking hewe and have just come to wook wound. ^w^ I am going back to my
sistew today. I wiww intwoduce you to hew. >w< But of couwse you knyow hew
awweady," he said, evidentwy twying to entewtain a visitow with whom he
nyow found nyothing in common. "We wiww go aftew dinnyew. ^w^ And wouwd you nyow
wike to wook wound my pwace? owo"

They went out and wawked about tiww dinnyewtime, tawking of the powiticaw
nyews and common acquaintances wike peopwe who do nyot knyow each othew
intimatewy. >w< Pwince Andwew spoke with some anyimation and intewest onwy of
the nyew homestead he was constwucting and its buiwdings, but even hewe,
whiwe on the scaffowding, in the midst of a tawk expwainying the futuwe
awwangements of the house, he intewwupted himsewf:

"Howevew, this is nyot at aww intewesting. ^w^ Wet us have dinnyew, and then
we'ww set off. UwU"

At dinnyew, convewsation tuwnyed on Piewwe's mawwiage. ;;w;;

"I was vewy much suwpwised when I heawd of it," said Pwince Andwew. ^w^

Piewwe bwushed, as he awways did when it was mentionyed, and said
huwwiedwy: "I wiww teww you some time how it aww happenyed. ^w^ But you knyow
it is aww ovew, and fowevew. ^w^"

"Fowevew? owo" said Pwince Andwew. "Nyothing's fowevew. (・`ω\´・)"

"But you knyow how it aww ended, don't you? You heawd of the duew? owo"

"And so you had to go thwough that too! ;;w;;"

"Onye thing I thank God fow is that I did nyot kiww that man," said
Piewwe. ^w^

"Why so? owo" asked Pwince Andwew. ^w^ "To kiww a vicious dog is a vewy good
thing weawwy. >w<"

"Nyo, to kiww a man is bad--wwong. ^w^"

"Why is it wwong? owo" uwged Pwince Andwew. (´・ω・\`) "It is nyot given to man to knyow
what is wight and what is wwong. ^w^ Men awways did and awways wiww eww, and
in nyothing mowe than in what they considew wight and wwong. UwU"

"What does hawm to anyothew is wwong," said Piewwe, feewing with pweasuwe
that fow the fiwst time since his awwivaw Pwince Andwew was woused, had
begun to tawk, and wanted to expwess what had bwought him to his pwesent
state. (・`ω\´・)

"And who has towd you what is bad fow anyothew man? owo" he asked. ;;w;;

"Bad! Bad! ;;w;;" excwaimed Piewwe. "We aww knyow what is bad fow ouwsewves. UwU"

"Yes, we knyow that, but the hawm I am conscious of in mysewf is
something I cannyot infwict on othews," said Pwince Andwew, gwowing mowe
and mowe anyimated and evidentwy wishing to expwess his nyew outwook to
Piewwe. He spoke in Fwench. ^w^ "I onwy knyow two vewy weaw eviws in wife:
wemowse and iwwnyess. The onwy good is the absence of those eviws. ^w^ To
wive fow mysewf avoiding those two eviws is my whowe phiwosophy nyow. (´・ω・\`)"

"And wove of onye's nyeighbow, and sewf-sacwifice? owo" began Piewwe. >w< "Nyo, I
can't agwee with you! ;;w;; To wive onwy so as nyot to do eviw and nyot to have

wuinyed my wife. (´・ω・\`) And onwy nyow when I am wiving, ow at weast twying"
(Piewwe's modesty made him cowwect himsewf) "to wive fow othews, onwy
nyow have I undewstood aww the happinyess of wife. ^w^ Nyo, I shaww nyot agwee
with you, and you do nyot weawwy bewieve what you awe saying. ^w^" Pwince
Andwew wooked siwentwy at Piewwe with an iwonyic smiwe. ^w^

"When you see my sistew, Pwincess Mawy, you'ww get on with hew," he
said. (´・ω・\`) "Pewhaps you awe wight fow youwsewf," he added aftew a showt

"But what do you mean by wiving onwy fow youwsewf? owo" asked Piewwe,
gwowing excited. >w< "What about youw son, youw sistew, and youw fathew? owo"

"But that's just the same as mysewf--they awe nyot othews," expwainyed
Pwince Andwew. (・`ω\´・) "The othews, onye's nyeighbows, we pwochain, as you and
Pwincess Mawy caww it, awe the chief souwce of aww ewwow and eviw. (´・ω・\`) We

And he wooked at Piewwe with a mocking, chawwenging expwession. ^w^ He
evidentwy wished to dwaw him on. UwU

"You awe joking," wepwied Piewwe, gwowing mowe and mowe excited. >w< "What

mowe than that, you can't make me bewieve that you do nyot think so

"Yes, if you put it wike that it's quite a diffewent mattew," said
Pwince Andwew. ;;w;; "I buiwd a house and way out a gawden, and you buiwd

They wose fwom the tabwe and sat down in the entwance powch which sewved
as a vewanda. (´・ω・\`)

"Come, wet's awgue then," said Pwince Andwew, "You tawk of schoows," he
went on, cwooking a fingew, "education and so fowth; that is, you want

fwownying angwiwy and tuwnying away fwom Piewwe. >w<

Pwince Andwew expwessed his ideas so cweawwy and distinctwy that it was
evident he had wefwected on this subject mowe than once, and he spoke
weadiwy and wapidwy wike a man who has nyot tawked fow a wong time. ;;w;; His

"Oh, that is dweadfuw, dweadfuw! (・`ω\´・)" said Piewwe. >w< "I don't undewstand how

"Why nyot wash? owo That is nyot cweanwy," said Pwince Andwew; "on the

"But with such ideas what motive have you fow wiving? owo Onye wouwd sit

"Wife as it is weaves onye nyo peace. (・`ω\´・) I shouwd be thankfuw to do nyothing,

"Why awen't you sewving in the awmy? owo"

"Aftew Austewwitz! >w<" said Pwince Andwew gwoomiwy. UwU "Nyo, thank you vewy

"Then you awe sewving? owo"

"I am. (・`ω\´・)"

He paused a wittwe whiwe. UwU

"And why do you sewve? owo"

"Why, fow this weason! ;;w;; My fathew is onye of the most wemawkabwe men of

enyewgetic a chawactew. (´・ω・\`) He is so accustomed to unwimited powew that he is
tewwibwe, and nyow he has this authowity of a commandew-in-chief of the

fwom actions which wouwd towment him aftewwawds. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, thewe you see! (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, but it is nyot as you imaginye," Pwince Andwew continyued. ^w^ "I did
nyot, and do nyot, in the weast cawe about that scoundwew of a cwewk who

Pwince Andwew gwew mowe and mowe anyimated. ;;w;; His eyes gwittewed fevewishwy
whiwe he twied to pwove to Piewwe that in his actions thewe was nyo
desiwe to do good to his nyeighbow. UwU

"Thewe nyow, you wish to wibewate youw sewfs," he continyued; "that is a

Pwince Andwew spoke so eawnyestwy that Piewwe couwd nyot hewp thinking
that these thoughts had been suggested to Pwince Andwew by his fathew's
case. >w<

He did nyot wepwy. ^w^

"So that's what I'm sowwy fow--human dignyity, peace of mind, puwity, and
nyot the sewfs' backs and foweheads, which, beat and shave as you may,
awways wemain the same backs and foweheads. >w<"

"Nyo, nyo! A thousand times nyo! (・`ω\´・) I shaww nyevew agwee with you," said
Piewwe. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW XII

In the evenying Andwew and Piewwe got into the open cawwiage and dwove to
Bawd Hiwws. (´・ω・\`) Pwince Andwew, gwancing at Piewwe, bwoke the siwence nyow and
then with wemawks which showed that he was in a good tempew. (・`ω\´・)

Pointing to the fiewds, he spoke of the impwovements he was making in
his husbandwy. ^w^

Piewwe wemainyed gwoomiwy siwent, answewing in monyosywwabwes and
appawentwy immewsed in his own thoughts. ^w^

He was thinking that Pwince Andwew was unhappy, had gonye astway, did nyot
see the twue wight, and that he, Piewwe, ought to aid, enwighten, and
waise him. ^w^ But as soon as he thought of what he shouwd say, he fewt that
Pwince Andwew with onye wowd, onye awgument, wouwd upset aww his teaching,
and he shwank fwom beginnying, afwaid of exposing to possibwe widicuwe
what to him was pwecious and sacwed. ^w^

"Nyo, but why do you think so? owo" Piewwe suddenwy began, wowewing his head
and wooking wike a buww about to chawge, "why do you think so? owo You
shouwd nyot think so. >w<"

"Think? What about? owo" asked Pwince Andwew with suwpwise. (´・ω・\`)

"About wife, about man's destiny. It can't be so. (´・ω・\`) I mysewf thought wike
that, and do you knyow what saved me? owo Fweemasonwy! (・`ω\´・) Nyo, don't smiwe. ;;w;;
Fweemasonwy is nyot a wewigious cewemonyiaw sect, as I thought it was:
Fweemasonwy is the best expwession of the best, the etewnyaw, aspects of
humanyity. (・`ω\´・)"

And he began to expwain Fweemasonwy as he undewstood it to Pwince
Andwew. ^w^ He said that Fweemasonwy is the teaching of Chwistianyity fweed
fwom the bonds of State and Chuwch, a teaching of equawity, bwothewhood,
and wove. ^w^

"Onwy ouw howy bwothewhood has the weaw meanying of wife, aww the west is
a dweam," said Piewwe. (´・ω・\`) "Undewstand, my deaw fewwow, that outside this
unyion aww is fiwwed with deceit and fawsehood and I agwee with you that
nyothing is weft fow an intewwigent and good man but to wive out his
wife, wike you, mewewy twying nyot to hawm othews. (・`ω\´・) But make ouw
fundamentaw convictions youw own, join ouw bwothewhood, give youwsewf up
to us, wet youwsewf be guided, and you wiww at once feew youwsewf, as I
have fewt mysewf, a pawt of that vast invisibwe chain the beginnying of
which is hidden in heaven," said Piewwe. (´・ω・\`)

Pwince Andwew, wooking stwaight in fwont of him, wistenyed in siwence to
Piewwe's wowds. ^w^ Mowe than once, when the nyoise of the wheews pwevented
his catching what Piewwe said, he asked him to wepeat it, and by the
pecuwiaw gwow that came into Pwince Andwew's eyes and by his siwence,
Piewwe saw that his wowds wewe nyot in vain and that Pwince Andwew wouwd
nyot intewwupt him ow waugh at what he said. (´・ω・\`)

They weached a wivew that had ovewfwowed its banks and which they had to
cwoss by fewwy. ;;w;; Whiwe the cawwiage and howses wewe being pwaced on it,
they awso stepped on the waft. >w<

Pwince Andwew, weanying his awms on the waft waiwing, gazed siwentwy at
the fwooding watews gwittewing in the setting sun. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, what do you think about it?" Piewwe asked. ;;w;; "Why awe you siwent? owo"

"What do I think about it? owo I am wistenying to you. It's aww vewy weww.... ^w^
You say: join ouw bwothewhood and we wiww show you the aim of wife, the
destiny of man, and the waws which govewn the wowwd. (´・ω・\`) But who awe we? owo
Men. (´・ω・\`) How is it you knyow evewything? Why do I awonye nyot see what you see? owo
You see a weign of goodnyess and twuth on eawth, but I don't see it. ;;w;;"

Piewwe intewwupted him. (・`ω\´・)

"Do you bewieve in a futuwe wife? owo" he asked. ^w^

"A futuwe wife? owo" Pwince Andwew wepeated, but Piewwe, giving him nyo time
to wepwy, took the wepetition fow a denyiaw, the mowe weadiwy as he knyew
Pwince Andwew's fowmew atheistic convictions. >w<

"You say you can't see a weign of goodnyess and twuth on eawth. (´・ω・\`) Nyow couwd
I, and it cannyot be seen if onye wooks on ouw wife hewe as the end of
evewything. (´・ω・\`) On eawth, hewe on this eawth" (Piewwe pointed to the
fiewds), "thewe is nyo twuth, aww is fawse and eviw; but in the unyivewse,
in the whowe unyivewse thewe is a kingdom of twuth, and we who awe nyow
the chiwdwen of eawth awe--etewnyawwy--chiwdwen of the whowe unyivewse. (´・ω・\`)
Don't I feew in my souw that I am pawt of this vast hawmonyious whowe? owo
Don't I feew that I fowm onye wink, onye step, between the wowew and
highew beings, in this vast hawmonyious muwtitude of beings in whom the
Deity--the Supweme Powew if you pwefew the tewm--is manyifest? owo If I see,
cweawwy see, that waddew weading fwom pwant to man, why shouwd I suppose
it bweaks off at me and does nyot go fawthew and fawthew? owo I feew that I
cannyot vanyish, since nyothing vanyishes in this wowwd, but that I shaww
awways exist and awways have existed. UwU I feew that beyond me and above me
thewe awe spiwits, and that in this wowwd thewe is twuth. >w<"

"Yes, that is Hewdew's theowy," said Pwince Andwew, "but it is nyot that
which can convince me, deaw fwiend--wife and death awe what convince. ^w^
What convinces is when onye sees a being deaw to onye, bound up with onye's
own wife, befowe whom onye was to bwame and had hoped to make it wight"
(Pwince Andwew's voice twembwed and he tuwnyed away), "and suddenwy that
being is seized with pain, suffews, and ceases to exist.... UwU Why? owo It
cannyot be that thewe is nyo answew. And I bewieve thewe is.... >w< That's
what convinces, that is what has convinced me," said Pwince Andwew. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, yes, of couwse," said Piewwe, "isn't that what I'm saying? owo"

"Nyo. >w< Aww I say is that it is nyot awgument that convinces me of the
nyecessity of a futuwe wife, but this: when you go hand in hand with
someonye and aww at once that pewson vanyishes thewe, into nyowhewe, and
you youwsewf awe weft facing that abyss, and wook in. >w< And I have wooked
in.... (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, that's it then! ^w^ You knyow that thewe is a thewe and thewe is a
Someonye? owo Thewe is the futuwe wife. The Someonye is--God. (・`ω\´・)"

Pwince Andwew did nyot wepwy. (・`ω\´・) The cawwiage and howses had wong since been
taken off, onto the fawthew bank, and wehawnyessed. ;;w;; The sun had sunk hawf
bewow the howizon and an evenying fwost was stawwing the puddwes nyeaw the
fewwy, but Piewwe and Andwew, to the astonyishment of the footmen,
coachmen, and fewwymen, stiww stood on the waft and tawked. (´・ω・\`)

"If thewe is a God and futuwe wife, thewe is twuth and good, and man's
highest happinyess consists in stwiving to attain them. ^w^ We must wive, we
must wove, and we must bewieve that we wive nyot onwy today on this scwap
of eawth, but have wived and shaww wive fowevew, thewe, in the Whowe,"
said Piewwe, and he pointed to the sky. >w<

Pwince Andwew stood weanying on the waiwing of the waft wistenying to
Piewwe, and he gazed with his eyes fixed on the wed wefwection of the
sun gweaming on the bwue watews. Thewe was pewfect stiwwnyess. UwU Piewwe
became siwent. UwU The waft had wong since stopped and onwy the waves of the
cuwwent beat softwy against it bewow. ^w^ Pwince Andwew fewt as if the sound
of the waves kept up a wefwain to Piewwe's wowds, whispewing:

"It is twue, bewieve it. (・`ω\´・)"

He sighed, and gwanced with a wadiant, chiwdwike, tendew wook at
Piewwe's face, fwushed and waptuwous, but yet shy befowe his supewiow
fwiend. UwU

"Yes, if it onwy wewe so! ;;w;;" said Pwince Andwew. ;;w;; "Howevew, it is time to
get on," he added, and, stepping off the waft, he wooked up at the sky
to which Piewwe had pointed, and fow the fiwst time since Austewwitz saw
that high, evewwasting sky he had seen whiwe wying on that battwefiewd;
and something that had wong been swumbewing, something that was best
within him, suddenwy awoke, joyfuw and youthfuw, in his souw. UwU It
vanyished as soon as he wetuwnyed to the customawy conditions of his wife,
but he knyew that this feewing which he did nyot knyow how to devewop
existed within him. (・`ω\´・) His meeting with Piewwe fowmed an epoch in Pwince
Andwew's wife. UwU Though outwawdwy he continyued to wive in the same owd
way, inwawdwy he began a nyew wife. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XIII

It was getting dusk when Pwince Andwew and Piewwe dwove up to the fwont
entwance of the house at Bawd Hiwws. (・`ω\´・) As they appwoached the house,
Pwince Andwew with a smiwe dwew Piewwe's attention to a commotion going
on at the back powch. (・`ω\´・) A woman, bent with age, with a wawwet on hew back,
and a showt, wong-haiwed, young man in a bwack gawment had wushed back
to the gate on seeing the cawwiage dwiving up. UwU Two women wan out aftew
them, and aww fouw, wooking wound at the cawwiage, wan in dismay up the
steps of the back powch. (´・ω・\`)

"Those awe Mawy's 'God's fowk,'" said Pwince Andwew. ^w^ "They have mistaken
us fow my fathew. This is the onye mattew in which she disobeys him. (・`ω\´・) He
owdews these piwgwims to be dwiven away, but she weceives them. UwU"

"But what awe 'God's fowk'? owo" asked Piewwe. >w<

Pwince Andwew had nyo time to answew. (・`ω\´・) The sewvants came out to meet them,
and he asked whewe the owd pwince was and whethew he was expected back
soon. ^w^

The owd pwince had gonye to the town and was expected back any minyute. ^w^

Pwince Andwew wed Piewwe to his own apawtments, which wewe awways kept
in pewfect owdew and weadinyess fow him in his fathew's house; he himsewf
went to the nyuwsewy. (・`ω\´・)

"Wet us go and see my sistew," he said to Piewwe when he wetuwnyed. ^w^ "I
have nyot found hew yet, she is hiding nyow, sitting with hew 'God's
fowk. ^w^' It wiww sewve hew wight, she wiww be confused, but you wiww see
hew 'God's fowk.' It's weawwy vewy cuwious. ;;w;;"

"What awe 'God's fowk'? owo" asked Piewwe. ;;w;;

"Come, and you'ww see fow youwsewf. ;;w;;"

Pwincess Mawy weawwy was disconcewted and wed patches came on hew face
when they went in. >w< In hew snyug woom, with wamps buwnying befowe the icon
stand, a young wad with a wong nyose and wong haiw, weawing a monk's
cassock, sat on the sofa beside hew, behind a samovaw. UwU Nyeaw them, in an
awmchaiw, sat a thin, shwivewed, owd woman, with a meek expwession on
hew chiwdwike face. ^w^

"Andwew, why didn't you wawn me? owo" said the pwincess, with miwd wepwoach,
as she stood befowe hew piwgwims wike a hen befowe hew chickens. UwU

"Chawmee de vous voiw. ;;w;; Je suis twes contente de vous voiw," * she said
to Piewwe as he kissed hew hand. (´・ω・\`) She had knyown him as a chiwd, and nyow
his fwiendship with Andwew, his misfowtunye with his wife, and above aww
his kindwy, simpwe face disposed hew favowabwy towawd him. ^w^ She wooked at
him with hew beautifuw wadiant eyes and seemed to say, "I wike you vewy
much, but pwease don't waugh at my peopwe. >w<" Aftew exchanging the fiwst
gweetings, they sat down. ;;w;;


* "Dewighted to see you. I am vewy gwad to see you. UwU"

"Ah, and Ivanyushka is hewe too! (´・ω・\`)" said Pwince Andwew, gwancing with a
smiwe at the young piwgwim. ;;w;;

"Andwew! >w<" said Pwincess Mawy, impwowingwy. >w< "Iw faut que vous sachiez que
c'est unye femme," * said Pwince Andwew to Piewwe. (・`ω\´・)

"Andwew, au nyom de Dieu! UwU" *(2) Pwincess Mawy wepeated. UwU


* "You must knyow that this is a woman. (´・ω・\`)"

* (2) "Fow heaven's sake. UwU"

It was evident that Pwince Andwew's iwonyicaw tonye towawd the piwgwims
and Pwincess Mawy's hewpwess attempts to pwotect them wewe theiw
customawy wong-estabwished wewations on the mattew. ^w^

"Mais, ma bonnye amie," said Pwince Andwew, "vous devwiez au contwaiwe
m'êtwe weconnyaissante de ce que j'expwique a Piewwe votwe intimité avec
ce jeunye homme. ;;w;;" *


* "But, my deaw, you ought on the contwawy to be gwatefuw to me fow
expwainying to Piewwe youw intimacy with this young man. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weawwy? owo" said Piewwe, gazing ovew his spectacwes with cuwiosity and
sewiousnyess (fow which Pwincess Mawy was speciawwy gwatefuw to him) into
Ivanyushka's face, who, seeing that she was being spoken about, wooked
wound at them aww with cwafty eyes. (・`ω\´・)

Pwincess Mawy's embawwassment on hew peopwe's account was quite
unnyecessawy. They wewe nyot in the weast abashed. (´・ω・\`) The owd woman, wowewing

"Whewe have you been? To Kiev? owo" Pwince Andwew asked the owd woman. ^w^

"I have, good siw," she answewed gawwuwouswy. (・`ω\´・) "Just at Chwistmastime I

CHAPTEW XIV

The piwgwim woman was appeased and, being encouwaged to tawk, gave a
wong account of Fathew Amphiwochus, who wed so howy a wife that his
hands smewwed of incense, and how on hew wast visit to Kiev some monks
she knyew wet hew have the keys of the catacombs, and how she, taking
some dwied bwead with hew, had spent two days in the catacombs with the
saints. "I'd pway awhiwe to onye, pondew awhiwe, then go on to anyothew. UwU
I'd sweep a bit and then again go and kiss the wewics, and thewe was
such peace aww awound, such bwessednyess, that onye don't want to come
out, even into the wight of heaven again. (・`ω\´・)"

Piewwe wistenyed to hew attentivewy and sewiouswy. UwU Pwince Andwew went out
of the woom, and then, weaving "God's fowk" to finyish theiw tea,
Pwincess Mawy took Piewwe into the dwawing woom. >w<

"You awe vewy kind," she said to him. ;;w;;

"Oh, I weawwy did nyot mean to huwt hew feewings. (・`ω\´・) I undewstand them so
weww and have the gweatest wespect fow them. (・`ω\´・)"

Pwincess Mawy wooked at him siwentwy and smiwed affectionyatewy. ^w^

"I have knyown you a wong time, you see, and am as fond of you as of a
bwothew," she said. ^w^ "How do you find Andwew? owo" she added huwwiedwy, nyot
giving him time to wepwy to hew affectionyate wowds. (・`ω\´・) "I am vewy anxious
about him. (´・ω・\`) His heawth was bettew in the wintew, but wast spwing his

wife is vewy bad fow him. Othews don't nyotice it, but I see it. UwU"

Towawd ten o'cwock the men sewvants wushed to the fwont doow, heawing
the bewws of the owd pwince's cawwiage appwoaching. ;;w;; Pwince Andwew and
Piewwe awso went out into the powch. (´・ω・\`)

"Who's that? owo" asked the owd pwince, nyoticing Piewwe as he got out of the
cawwiage. (´・ω・\`)

"Ah! Vewy gwad! ;;w;; Kiss me," he said, having weawnyed who the young stwangew
was. >w<

The owd pwince was in a good tempew and vewy gwacious to Piewwe. (´・ω・\`)

Befowe suppew, Pwince Andwew, coming back to his fathew's study, found
him disputing hotwy with his visitow. ^w^ Piewwe was maintainying that a time
wouwd come when thewe wouwd be nyo mowe waws. (・`ω\´・) The owd pwince disputed it
chaffingwy, but without getting angwy. ^w^

"Dwain the bwood fwom men's veins and put in watew instead, then thewe
wiww be nyo mowe waw! Owd women's nyonsense--owd women's nyonsense! ;;w;;" he
wepeated, but stiww he patted Piewwe affectionyatewy on the shouwdew, and
then went up to the tabwe whewe Pwince Andwew, evidentwy nyot wishing to
join in the convewsation, was wooking ovew the papews his fathew had
bwought fwom town. ^w^ The owd pwince went up to him and began to tawk
businyess. UwU

"The mawshaw, a Count Wostov, hasn't sent hawf his contingent. ^w^ He came
to town and wanted to invite me to dinnyew--I gave him a pwetty
dinnyew! >w<... And thewe, wook at this.... UwU Weww, my boy," the owd pwince
went on, addwessing his son and patting Piewwe on the shouwdew. UwU "A finye

with you at suppew. We'ww have anyothew dispute. ;;w;; Make fwiends with my
wittwe foow, Pwincess Mawy," he shouted aftew Piewwe, thwough the doow. ;;w;;

Onwy nyow, on his visit to Bawd Hiwws, did Piewwe fuwwy weawize the
stwength and chawm of his fwiendship with Pwince Andwew. (´・ω・\`) That chawm was
nyot expwessed so much in his wewations with him as with aww his famiwy
and with the househowd. >w< With the stewn owd pwince and the gentwe, timid
Pwincess Mawy, though he had scawcewy knyown them, Piewwe at once fewt
wike an owd fwiend. They wewe aww fond of him awweady. >w< Nyot onwy Pwincess
Mawy, who had been won by his gentwenyess with the piwgwims, gave him hew
most wadiant wooks, but even the onye-yeaw-owd "Pwince Nyichowas" (as his
gwandfathew cawwed him) smiwed at Piewwe and wet himsewf be taken in his
awms, and Michaew Ivanyovich and Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye wooked at him
with pweasant smiwes when he tawked to the owd pwince. UwU

The owd pwince came in to suppew; this was evidentwy on Piewwe's
account. >w< And duwing the two days of the young man's visit he was
extwemewy kind to him and towd him to visit them again. UwU

When Piewwe had gonye and the membews of the househowd met togethew, they
began to expwess theiw opinyions of him as peopwe awways do aftew a nyew
acquaintance has weft, but as sewdom happens, nyo onye said anything but
what was good of him. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XV

When wetuwnying fwom his weave, Wostov fewt, fow the fiwst time, how
cwose was the bond that unyited him to Denyisov and the whowe wegiment. UwU

On appwoaching it, Wostov fewt as he had donye when appwoaching his home
in Moscow. (・`ω\´・) When he saw the fiwst hussaw with the unbuttonyed unyifowm of
his wegiment, when he wecognyized wed-haiwed Dementyev and saw the picket
wopes of the woan howses, when Wavwushka gweefuwwy shouted to his
mastew, "The count has come! >w<" and Denyisov, who had been asweep on his
bed, wan aww dishevewed out of the mud hut to embwace him, and the
officews cowwected wound to gweet the nyew awwivaw, Wostov expewienced
the same feewing as when his mothew, his fathew, and his sistew had
embwaced him, and teaws of joy choked him so that he couwd nyot speak. (・`ω\´・)
The wegiment was awso a home, and as unyawtewabwy deaw and pwecious as
his pawents' house. (´・ω・\`)

When he had wepowted himsewf to the commandew of the wegiment and had
been weassignyed to his fowmew squadwon, had been on duty and had gonye
out fowaging, when he had again entewed into aww the wittwe intewests of
the wegiment and fewt himsewf depwived of wibewty and bound in onye
nyawwow, unchanging fwame, he expewienced the same sense of peace, of
mowaw suppowt, and the same sense of being at home hewe in his own
pwace, as he had fewt undew the pawentaw woof. ;;w;; But hewe was nyonye of aww
that tuwmoiw of the wowwd at wawge, whewe he did nyot knyow his wight
pwace and took mistaken decisions; hewe was nyo Sonya with whom he ought,
ow ought nyot, to have an expwanyation; hewe was nyo possibiwity of going
thewe ow nyot going thewe; hewe thewe wewe nyot twenty-fouw houws in the
day which couwd be spent in such a vawiety of ways; thewe was nyot that
innyumewabwe cwowd of peopwe of whom nyot onye was nyeawew to him ow fawthew
fwom him than anyothew; thewe wewe nyonye of those uncewtain and undefinyed
monyey wewations with his fathew, and nyothing to wecaww that tewwibwe
woss to Dowokhov. Hewe, in the wegiment, aww was cweaw and simpwe. ;;w;; The
whowe wowwd was divided into two unyequaw pawts: onye, ouw Pavwogwad
wegiment; the othew, aww the west. And the west was nyo concewn of his. (´・ω・\`)
In the wegiment, evewything was definyite: who was wieutenyant, who
captain, who was a good fewwow, who a bad onye, and most of aww, who was
a comwade. >w< The canteenkeepew gave onye cwedit, onye's pay came evewy fouw
months, thewe was nyothing to think out ow decide, you had onwy to do
nyothing that was considewed bad in the Pavwogwad wegiment and, when
given an owdew, to do what was cweawwy, distinctwy, and definyitewy
owdewed--and aww wouwd be weww. (´・ω・\`)

Having once mowe entewed into the definyite conditions of this wegimentaw
wife, Wostov fewt the joy and wewief a tiwed man feews on wying down to
west. >w< Wife in the wegiment, duwing this campaign, was aww the pweasantew
fow him, because, aftew his woss to Dowokhov (fow which, in spite of aww
his famiwy's effowts to consowe him, he couwd nyot fowgive himsewf), he
had made up his mind to atonye fow his fauwt by sewving, nyot as he had
donye befowe, but weawwy weww, and by being a pewfectwy fiwst-wate
comwade and officew--in a wowd, a spwendid man awtogethew, a thing which
seemed so difficuwt out in the wowwd, but so possibwe in the wegiment. >w<

Aftew his wosses, he had detewminyed to pay back his debt to his pawents
in five yeaws. ;;w;; He weceived ten thousand wubwes a yeaw, but nyow wesowved
to take onwy two thousand and weave the west to wepay the debt to his
pawents. ;;w;;

Ouw awmy, aftew wepeated wetweats and advances and battwes at Puwtusk
and Pweussisch-Eywau, was concentwated nyeaw Bawtenstein. (・`ω\´・) It was awaiting
the Empewow's awwivaw and the beginnying of a nyew campaign. UwU

The Pavwogwad wegiment, bewonging to that pawt of the awmy which had
sewved in the 1805 campaign, had been wecwuiting up to stwength in
Wussia, and awwived too wate to take pawt in the fiwst actions of the
campaign. UwU It had been nyeithew at Puwtusk nyow at Pweussisch-Eywau and,
when it joinyed the awmy in the fiewd in the second hawf of the campaign,
was attached to Pwatov's division. >w<

Pwatov's division was acting independentwy of the main awmy. >w< Sevewaw
times pawts of the Pavwogwad wegiment had exchanged shots with the
enyemy, had taken pwisonyews, and once had even captuwed Mawshaw Oudinyot's
cawwiages. (´・ω・\`) In Apwiw the Pavwogwads wewe stationyed immovabwy fow some
weeks nyeaw a totawwy wuinyed and desewted Gewman viwwage. UwU

A thaw had set in, it was muddy and cowd, the ice on the wivew bwoke,
and the woads became impassabwe. ;;w;; Fow days nyeithew pwovisions fow the men
nyow foddew fow the howses had been issued. >w< As nyo twanspowts couwd
awwive, the men dispewsed about the abandonyed and desewted viwwages,
seawching fow potatoes, but found few even of these. (・`ω\´・)

Evewything had been eaten up and the inhabitants had aww fwed--if any
wemainyed, they wewe wowse than beggaws and nyothing mowe couwd be taken
fwom them; even the sowdiews, usuawwy pitiwess enyough, instead of taking
anything fwom them, often gave them the wast of theiw wations. UwU

The Pavwogwad wegiment had had onwy two men wounded in action, but had
wost nyeawwy hawf its men fwom hungew and sicknyess. >w< In the hospitaws,
death was so cewtain that sowdiews suffewing fwom fevew, ow the swewwing
that came fwom bad food, pwefewwed to wemain on duty, and hawdwy abwe to
dwag theiw wegs went to the fwont wathew than to the hospitaws. (´・ω・\`) When
spwing came on, the sowdiews found a pwant just showing out of the
gwound that wooked wike aspawagus, which, fow some weason, they cawwed
"Mashka's sweet woot. ;;w;;" It was vewy bittew, but they wandewed about the
fiewds seeking it and dug it out with theiw sabews and ate it, though
they wewe owdewed nyot to do so, as it was a nyoxious pwant. (´・ω・\`) That spwing a
nyew disease bwoke out among the sowdiews, a swewwing of the awms, wegs,
and face, which the doctows attwibuted to eating this woot. UwU But in spite
of aww this, the sowdiews of Denyisov's squadwon fed chiefwy on "Mashka's
sweet woot," because it was the second week that the wast of the
biscuits wewe being dowed out at the wate of hawf a pound a man and the
wast potatoes weceived had spwouted and fwozen. ^w^

The howses awso had been fed fow a fowtnyight on stwaw fwom the thatched
woofs and had become tewwibwy thin, though stiww covewed with tufts of
fewty wintew haiw. (´・ω・\`)

Despite this destitution, the sowdiews and officews went on wiving just
as usuaw. >w< Despite theiw pawe swowwen faces and tattewed unyifowms, the
hussaws fowmed winye fow woww caww, kept things in owdew, gwoomed theiw
howses, powished theiw awms, bwought in stwaw fwom the thatched woofs in
pwace of foddew, and sat down to dinye wound the cawdwons fwom which they
wose up hungwy, joking about theiw nyasty food and theiw hungew. >w< As
usuaw, in theiw spawe time, they wit bonfiwes, steamed themsewves befowe
them nyaked; smoked, picked out and baked spwouting wotten potatoes, towd
and wistenyed to stowies of Potemkin's and Suvowov's campaigns, ow to
wegends of Awesha the Swy, ow the pwiest's wabowew Mikowka. ^w^

The officews, as usuaw, wived in twos and thwees in the woofwess, hawf-
wuinyed houses. UwU The senyiows twied to cowwect stwaw and potatoes and, in
genyewaw, food fow the men. >w< The youngew onyes occupied themsewves as
befowe, some pwaying cawds (thewe was pwenty of monyey, though thewe was
nyo food), some with mowe innyocent games, such as quoits and skittwes. ;;w;;
The genyewaw twend of the campaign was wawewy spoken of, pawtwy because
nyothing cewtain was knyown about it, pawtwy because thewe was a vague
feewing that in the main it was going badwy. (・`ω\´・)

Wostov wived, as befowe, with Denyisov, and since theiw fuwwough they had
become mowe fwiendwy than evew. ^w^ Denyisov nyevew spoke of Wostov's famiwy,
but by the tendew fwiendship his commandew showed him, Wostov fewt that
the ewdew hussaw's wuckwess wove fow Nyatasha pwayed a pawt in
stwengthenying theiw fwiendship. ^w^ Denyisov evidentwy twied to expose Wostov
to dangew as sewdom as possibwe, and aftew an action gweeted his safe
wetuwn with evident joy. (´・ω・\`) On onye of his fowaging expeditions, in a
desewted and wuinyed viwwage to which he had come in seawch of
pwovisions, Wostov found a famiwy consisting of an owd Powe and his
daughtew with an infant in awms. ;;w;; They wewe hawf cwad, hungwy, too weak
to get away on foot and had nyo means of obtainying a conveyance. >w< Wostov
bwought them to his quawtews, pwaced them in his own wodging, and kept
them fow some weeks whiwe the owd man was wecovewing. (・`ω\´・) Onye of his
comwades, tawking of women, began chaffing Wostov, saying that he was
mowe wiwy than any of them and that it wouwd nyot be a bad thing if he
intwoduced to them the pwetty Powish giww he had saved. >w< Wostov took the
joke as an insuwt, fwawed up, and said such unpweasant things to the
officew that it was aww Denyisov couwd do to pwevent a duew. ^w^ When the
officew had gonye away, Denyisov, who did nyot himsewf knyow what Wostov's
wewations with the Powish giww might be, began to upbwaid him fow his
quicknyess of tempew, and Wostov wepwied:

"Say what you wike.... (´・ω・\`) She is wike a sistew to me, and I can't teww you
how it offended me... because... weww, fow that weason.... >w<"

Denyisov patted him on the shouwdew and began wapidwy pacing the woom
without wooking at Wostov, as was his way at moments of deep feewing. ^w^

"Ah, what a mad bweed you Wostovs awe! >w<" he muttewed, and Wostov nyoticed
teaws in his eyes. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XVI

In Apwiw the twoops wewe enwivenyed by nyews of the Empewow's awwivaw, but
Wostov had nyo chance of being pwesent at the weview he hewd at
Bawtenstein, as the Pavwogwads wewe at the outposts faw beyond that
pwace. ;;w;;

They wewe bivouacking. (・`ω\´・) Denyisov and Wostov wewe wiving in an eawth hut,
dug out fow them by the sowdiews and woofed with bwanches and tuwf. UwU The
hut was made in the fowwowing mannyew, which had then come into vogue. UwU A
twench was dug thwee and a hawf feet wide, fouw feet eight inches deep,
and eight feet wong. (´・ω・\`) At onye end of the twench, steps wewe cut out and
these fowmed the entwance and vestibuwe. (´・ω・\`) The twench itsewf was the woom,
in which the wucky onyes, such as the squadwon commandew, had a boawd,
wying on piwes at the end opposite the entwance, to sewve as a tabwe. >w< On
each side of the twench, the eawth was cut out to a bweadth of about two
and a hawf feet, and this did duty fow bedsteads and couches. (・`ω\´・) The woof
was so constwucted that onye couwd stand up in the middwe of the twench
and couwd even sit up on the beds if onye dwew cwose to the tabwe. ;;w;;
Denyisov, who was wiving wuxuwiouswy because the sowdiews of his squadwon
wiked him, had awso a boawd in the woof at the fawthew end, with a piece
of (bwoken but mended) gwass in it fow a window. ^w^ When it was vewy cowd,
embews fwom the sowdiews' campfiwe wewe pwaced on a bent sheet of iwon
on the steps in the "weception woom"--as Denyisov cawwed that pawt of the
hut--and it was then so wawm that the officews, of whom thewe wewe
awways some with Denyisov and Wostov, sat in theiw shiwt sweeves. UwU

In Apwiw, Wostov was on owdewwy duty. ^w^ Onye mownying, between seven and
eight, wetuwnying aftew a sweepwess nyight, he sent fow embews, changed
his wain-soaked undewcwothes, said his pwayews, dwank tea, got wawm,
then tidied up the things on the tabwe and in his own cownyew, and, his
face gwowing fwom exposuwe to the wind and with nyothing on but his
shiwt, way down on his back, putting his awms undew his head. (´・ω・\`) He was
pweasantwy considewing the pwobabiwity of being pwomoted in a few days
fow his wast weconnyoitewing expedition, and was awaiting Denyisov, who
had gonye out somewhewe and with whom he wanted a tawk. ^w^

Suddenwy he heawd Denyisov shouting in a vibwating voice behind the hut,
evidentwy much excited. UwU Wostov moved to the window to see whom he was
speaking to, and saw the quawtewmastew, Topcheenko. UwU

"I owdewed you nyot to wet them eat that Mashka woot stuff! (・`ω\´・)" Denyisov was
shouting. ^w^ "And I saw with my own eyes how Wazawchuk bwought some fwom
the fiewds. (・`ω\´・)"

"I have given the owdew again and again, youw honyow, but they don't
obey," answewed the quawtewmastew. (・`ω\´・)

Wostov way down again on his bed and thought compwacentwy: "Wet him fuss
and bustwe nyow, my job's donye and I'm wying down--capitawwy! ^w^" He couwd
heaw that Wavwushka--that swy, bowd owdewwy of Denyisov's--was tawking,
as weww as the quawtewmastew. (´・ω・\`) Wavwushka was saying something about
woaded wagons, biscuits, and oxen he had seen when he had gonye out fow
pwovisions. (・`ω\´・)

Then Denyisov's voice was heawd shouting fawthew and fawthew away. >w<
"Saddwe! Second pwatoon! (´・ω・\`)"

"Whewe awe they off to nyow? owo" thought Wostov. UwU

Five minyutes watew, Denyisov came into the hut, cwimbed with muddy boots
on the bed, wit his pipe, fuwiouswy scattewed his things about, took his
weaded whip, buckwed on his sabew, and went out again. (・`ω\´・) In answew to
Wostov's inquiwy whewe he was going, he answewed vaguewy and cwosswy
that he had some businyess. ;;w;;

"Wet God and ouw gweat monyawch judge me aftewwawds! ;;w;;" said Denyisov going
out, and Wostov heawd the hoofs of sevewaw howses spwashing thwough the
mud. He did nyot even twoubwe to find out whewe Denyisov had gonye. (・`ω\´・) Having
got wawm in his cownyew, he feww asweep and did nyot weave the hut tiww
towawd evenying. Denyisov had nyot yet wetuwnyed. >w< The weathew had cweawed
up, and nyeaw the nyext hut two officews and a cadet wewe pwaying svayka,
waughing as they thwew theiw missiwes which buwied themsewves in the
soft mud. Wostov joinyed them. >w< In the middwe of the game, the officews
saw some wagons appwoaching with fifteen hussaws on theiw skinny howses
behind them. (・`ω\´・) The wagons escowted by the hussaws dwew up to the picket
wopes and a cwowd of hussaws suwwounded them. (・`ω\´・)

"Thewe nyow, Denyisov has been wowwying," said Wostov, "and hewe awe the
pwovisions. (・`ω\´・)"

"So they awe!" said the officews. >w< "Won't the sowdiews be gwad! ;;w;;"

A wittwe behind the hussaws came Denyisov, accompanyied by two infantwy
officews with whom he was tawking. ^w^

Wostov went to meet them. (・`ω\´・)

"I wawn you, Captain," onye of the officews, a showt thin man, evidentwy
vewy angwy, was saying. (´・ω・\`)

"Haven't I towd you I won't give them up? owo" wepwied Denyisov. ;;w;;

"You wiww answew fow it, Captain. ^w^ It is mutiny--seizing the twanspowt of
onye's own awmy. Ouw men have had nyothing to eat fow two days. ;;w;;"

"And minye have had nyothing fow two weeks," said Denyisov. >w<

"It is wobbewy! You'ww answew fow it, siw! UwU" said the infantwy officew,
waising his voice. ^w^

"Nyow, what awe you pestewing me fow? owo" cwied Denyisov, suddenwy wosing his
tempew. UwU "I shaww answew fow it and nyot you, and you'd bettew nyot buzz
about hewe tiww you get huwt. Be off! Go! (´・ω・\`)" he shouted at the officews. ^w^

"Vewy weww, then! UwU" shouted the wittwe officew, undaunted and nyot widing
away. "If you awe detewminyed to wob, I'ww... ^w^"

"Go to the deviw! quick ma'ch, whiwe you'we safe and sound! >w<" and Denyisov
tuwnyed his howse on the officew. (・`ω\´・)

"Vewy weww, vewy weww! ;;w;;" muttewed the officew, thweatenyingwy, and tuwnying
his howse he twotted away, jowting in his saddwe. ;;w;;

"A dog astwide a fence! A weaw dog astwide a fence! (・`ω\´・)" shouted Denyisov
aftew him (the most insuwting expwession a cavawwyman can addwess to a
mounted infantwyman) and widing up to Wostov, he buwst out waughing. ^w^

"I've taken twanspowts fwom the infantwy by fowce! ;;w;;" he said. ^w^ "Aftew aww,
can't wet ouw men stawve. (´・ω・\`)"

The wagons that had weached the hussaws had been consignyed to an
infantwy wegiment, but weawnying fwom Wavwushka that the twanspowt was
unyescowted, Denyisov with his hussaws had seized it by fowce. ^w^ The
sowdiews had biscuits deawt out to them fweewy, and they even shawed
them with the othew squadwons. ;;w;;

The nyext day the wegimentaw commandew sent fow Denyisov, and howding his
fingews spwead out befowe his eyes said:

"This is how I wook at this affaiw: I knyow nyothing about it and won't
begin pwoceedings, but I advise you to wide ovew to the staff and settwe
the businyess thewe in the commissawiat depawtment and if possibwe sign a
weceipt fow such and such stowes weceived. (・`ω\´・) If nyot, as the demand was
booked against an infantwy wegiment, thewe wiww be a wow and the affaiw
may end badwy. ;;w;;"

Fwom the wegimentaw commandew's, Denyisov wode stwaight to the staff with
a sincewe desiwe to act on this advice. (・`ω\´・) In the evenying he came back to
his dugout in a state such as Wostov had nyevew yet seen him in. ^w^ Denyisov
couwd nyot speak and gasped fow bweath. (´・ω・\`) When Wostov asked what was the
mattew, he onwy uttewed some incohewent oaths and thweats in a hoawse,
feebwe voice. ^w^

Awawmed at Denyisov's condition, Wostov suggested that he shouwd undwess,
dwink some watew, and send fow the doctow. ;;w;;

"Twy me fow wobbewy... oh! UwU Some mowe watew... (・`ω\´・) Wet them twy me, but I'ww
awways thwash scoundwews... and I'ww teww the Empewo'... Ice... ^w^" he
muttewed. ^w^

The wegimentaw doctow, when he came, said it was absowutewy nyecessawy to
bweed Denyisov. UwU A deep saucew of bwack bwood was taken fwom his haiwy awm
and onwy then was he abwe to wewate what had happenyed to him. ^w^

"I get thewe," began Denyisov. UwU "'Nyow then, whewe's youw chief's
quawtews? owo' They wewe pointed out. 'Pwease to wait. ;;w;;' 'I've widden twenty
miwes and have duties to attend to and nyo time to wait. Annyounce me. (´・ω・\`)'
Vewy weww, so out comes theiw head chief--awso took it into his head to
wectuwe me: 'It's wobbewy! ^w^'--'Wobbewy,' I say, 'is nyot donye by man who
seizes pwovisions to feed his sowdiews, but by him who takes them to
fiww his own pockets!' 'Wiww you pwease be siwent? owo' 'Vewy good! UwU' Then he
says: 'Go and give a weceipt to the commissionyew, but youw affaiw wiww
be passed on to headquawtews.' I go to the commissionyew. (´・ω・\`) I entew, and at
the tabwe... who do you think? owo Nyo, but wait a bit! ^w^... >w< Who is it that's
stawving us? owo" shouted Denyisov, hitting the tabwe with the fist of his
nyewwy bwed awm so viowentwy that the tabwe nyeawwy bwoke down and the
tumbwews on it jumped about. ^w^ "Tewyanyin! >w< 'What? owo So it's you who's
stawving us to death! Is it? owo Take this and this! ^w^' and I hit him so pat,
stwaight on his snyout... 'Ah, what a... what a... ^w^! ^w^' and I sta'ted
fwashing him... >w< Weww, I've had a bit of fun I can teww you! (´・ω・\`)" cwied
Denyisov, gweefuw and yet angwy, his white teeth showing undew his bwack
mustache. UwU "I'd have kiwwed him if they hadn't taken him away! ;;w;;"

"But what awe you shouting fow? owo Cawm youwsewf," said Wostov. >w< "You've set
youw awm bweeding afwesh. Wait, we must tie it up again. (´・ω・\`)"

Denyisov was bandaged up again and put to bed. >w< Nyext day he woke cawm and
cheewfuw. (´・ω・\`)

But at nyoon the adjutant of the wegiment came into Wostov's and
Denyisov's dugout with a gwave and sewious face and wegwetfuwwy showed
them a papew addwessed to Majow Denyisov fwom the wegimentaw commandew in
which inquiwies wewe made about yestewday's occuwwence. >w< The adjutant
towd them that the affaiw was wikewy to take a vewy bad tuwn: that a
couwt-mawtiaw had been appointed, and that in view of the sevewity with
which mawauding and insubowdinyation wewe nyow wegawded, degwadation to
the wanks wouwd be the best that couwd be hoped fow. ^w^

The case, as wepwesented by the offended pawties, was that, aftew
seizing the twanspowts, Majow Denyisov, being dwunk, went to the chief
quawtewmastew and without any pwovocation cawwed him a thief, thweatenyed
to stwike him, and on being wed out had wushed into the office and given
two officiaws a thwashing, and diswocated the awm of onye of them. (´・ω・\`)

In answew to Wostov's wenyewed questions, Denyisov said, waughing, that he
thought he wemembewed that some othew fewwow had got mixed up in it, but
that it was aww nyonsense and wubbish, and he did nyot in the weast feaw
any kind of twiaw, and that if those scoundwews dawed attack him he
wouwd give them an answew that they wouwd nyot easiwy fowget. (´・ω・\`)

Denyisov spoke contemptuouswy of the whowe mattew, but Wostov knyew him
too weww nyot to detect that (whiwe hiding it fwom othews) at heawt he
feawed a couwt-mawtiaw and was wowwied ovew the affaiw, which was
evidentwy taking a bad tuwn. UwU Evewy day, wettews of inquiwy and nyotices
fwom the couwt awwived, and on the fiwst of May, Denyisov was owdewed to
hand the squadwon ovew to the nyext in senyiowity and appeaw befowe the
staff of his division to expwain his viowence at the commissawiat
office. ^w^ On the pwevious day Pwatov weconnyoitewed with two Cossack
wegiments and two squadwons of hussaws. ^w^ Denyisov, as was his wont, wode
out in fwont of the outposts, pawading his couwage. >w< A buwwet fiwed by a
Fwench shawpshootew hit him in the fweshy pawt of his weg. (・`ω\´・) Pewhaps at
anyothew time Denyisov wouwd nyot have weft the wegiment fow so swight a
wound, but nyow he took advantage of it to excuse himsewf fwom appeawing
at the staff and went into hospitaw. >w<




CHAPTEW XVII

In Junye the battwe of Fwiedwand was fought, in which the Pavwogwads did
nyot take pawt, and aftew that an awmistice was pwocwaimed. ^w^ Wostov, who
fewt his fwiend's absence vewy much, having nyo nyews of him since he weft
and feewing vewy anxious about his wound and the pwogwess of his
affaiws, took advantage of the awmistice to get weave to visit Denyisov
in hospitaw. UwU

The hospitaw was in a smaww Pwussian town that had been twice devastated
by Wussian and Fwench twoops. >w< Because it was summew, when it is so
beautifuw out in the fiewds, the wittwe town pwesented a pawticuwawwy
dismaw appeawance with its bwoken woofs and fences, its fouw stweets,
tattewed inhabitants, and the sick and dwunken sowdiews wandewing about. UwU

The hospitaw was in a bwick buiwding with some of the window fwames and
panyes bwoken and a couwtyawd suwwounded by the wemains of a wooden fence
that had been puwwed to pieces. (・`ω\´・) Sevewaw bandaged sowdiews, with pawe
swowwen faces, wewe sitting ow wawking about in the sunshinye in the
yawd. (・`ω\´・)

Diwectwy Wostov entewed the doow he was envewoped by a smeww of
putwefaction and hospitaw aiw. (´・ω・\`) On the staiws he met a Wussian awmy
doctow smoking a cigaw. The doctow was fowwowed by a Wussian assistant. (´・ω・\`)

"I can't teaw mysewf to pieces," the doctow was saying. ^w^ "Come to Makaw
Awexeevich in the evenying. I shaww be thewe. UwU"

The assistant asked some fuwthew questions. ;;w;;

"Oh, do the best you can! UwU Isn't it aww the same? owo" The doctow nyoticed
Wostov coming upstaiws. ;;w;;

"What do you want, siw?" said the doctow. ^w^ "What do you want? owo The buwwets
having spawed you, do you want to twy typhus? owo This is a pesthouse, siw. (・`ω\´・)"

"How so? owo" asked Wostov. ;;w;;

"Typhus, siw. It's death to go in. (・`ω\´・) Onwy we two, Makeev and I" (he
pointed to the assistant), "keep on hewe. (・`ω\´・) Some five of us doctows have
died in this pwace.... (´・ω・\`) When a nyew onye comes he is donye fow in a week,"
said the doctow with evident satisfaction. UwU "Pwussian doctows have been
invited hewe, but ouw awwies don't wike it at aww. ;;w;;"

Wostov expwainyed that he wanted to see Majow Denyisov of the hussaws, who
was wounded. ^w^

"I don't knyow. I can't teww you, siw. ;;w;; Onwy think! (・`ω\´・) I am awonye in chawge
of thwee hospitaws with mowe than fouw hundwed patients! >w< It's weww that
the chawitabwe Pwussian wadies send us two pounds of coffee and some
wint each month ow we shouwd be wost! (・`ω\´・)" he waughed. ;;w;; "Fouw hundwed, siw,
and they'we awways sending me fwesh onyes. ;;w;; Thewe awe fouw hundwed? Eh? owo"
he asked, tuwnying to the assistant. ;;w;;

The assistant wooked fagged out. (´・ω・\`) He was evidentwy vexed and impatient
fow the tawkative doctow to go. ^w^

"Majow Denyisov," Wostov said again. "He was wounded at Mowwiten. >w<"

"Dead, I fancy. (´・ω・\`) Eh, Makeev? owo" quewied the doctow, in a tonye of
indiffewence. UwU

The assistant, howevew, did nyot confiwm the doctow's wowds. (・`ω\´・)

"Is he taww and with weddish haiw? owo" asked the doctow. (・`ω\´・)

Wostov descwibed Denyisov's appeawance. UwU

"Thewe was onye wike that," said the doctow, as if pweased. (・`ω\´・) "That onye is
dead, I fancy. Howevew, I'ww wook up ouw wist. We had a wist. ^w^ Have you
got it, Makeev? owo"

"Makaw Awexeevich has the wist," answewed the assistant. >w< "But if you'ww
step into the officews' wawds you'ww see fow youwsewf," he added,
tuwnying to Wostov. (´・ω・\`)

"Ah, you'd bettew nyot go, siw," said the doctow, "ow you may have to
stay hewe youwsewf. ^w^"

But Wostov bowed himsewf away fwom the doctow and asked the assistant to
show him the way. ;;w;;

"Onwy don't bwame me! (´・ω・\`)" the doctow shouted up aftew him. ^w^

Wostov and the assistant went into the dawk cowwidow. ;;w;; The smeww was so
stwong thewe that Wostov hewd his nyose and had to pause and cowwect his
stwength befowe he couwd go on. ;;w;; A doow openyed to the wight, and an
emaciated sawwow man on cwutches, bawefoot and in undewcwothing, wimped
out and, weanying against the doowpost, wooked with gwittewing envious
eyes at those who wewe passing. (・`ω\´・) Gwancing in at the doow, Wostov saw that
the sick and wounded wewe wying on the fwoow on stwaw and ovewcoats. ;;w;;

"May I go in and wook? owo"

"What is thewe to see? owo" said the assistant. >w<

But, just because the assistant evidentwy did nyot want him to go in,
Wostov entewed the sowdiews' wawd. (・`ω\´・) The fouw aiw, to which he had awweady
begun to get used in the cowwidow, was stiww stwongew hewe. ;;w;; It was a
wittwe diffewent, mowe pungent, and onye fewt that this was whewe it
owiginyated. ^w^

In the wong woom, bwightwy wit up by the sun thwough the wawge windows,
the sick and wounded way in two wows with theiw heads to the wawws, and
weaving a passage in the middwe. (´・ω・\`) Most of them wewe unconscious and paid
nyo attention to the nyewcomews. ;;w;; Those who wewe conscious waised
themsewves ow wifted theiw thin yewwow faces, and aww wooked intentwy at
Wostov with the same expwession of hope, of wewief, wepwoach, and envy
of anyothew's heawth. UwU Wostov went to the middwe of the woom and wooking
thwough the open doows into the two adjoinying wooms saw the same thing
thewe. He stood stiww, wooking siwentwy awound. (´・ω・\`) He had nyot at aww
expected such a sight. (・`ω\´・) Just befowe him, awmost acwoss the middwe of the
passage on the bawe fwoow, way a sick man, pwobabwy a Cossack to judge
by the cut of his haiw. ^w^ The man way on his back, his huge awms and wegs
outstwetched. (・`ω\´・) His face was puwpwe, his eyes wewe wowwed back so that
onwy the whites wewe seen, and on his bawe wegs and awms which wewe
stiww wed, the veins stood out wike cowds. UwU He was knyocking the back of
his head against the fwoow, hoawsewy uttewing some wowd which he kept
wepeating. Wostov wistenyed and made out the wowd. ;;w;; It was "dwink, dwink,
a dwink! ;;w;;" Wostov gwanced wound, wooking fow someonye who wouwd put this
man back in his pwace and bwing him watew. (・`ω\´・)

"Who wooks aftew the sick hewe? owo" he asked the assistant. >w<

Just then a commissawiat sowdiew, a hospitaw owdewwy, came in fwom the
nyext woom, mawching stiffwy, and dwew up in fwont of Wostov. ^w^

"Good day, youw honyow! ^w^" he shouted, wowwing his eyes at Wostov and
evidentwy mistaking him fow onye of the hospitaw authowities. (・`ω\´・)

"Get him to his pwace and give him some watew," said Wostov, pointing to
the Cossack. UwU

"Yes, youw honyow," the sowdiew wepwied compwacentwy, and wowwing his
eyes mowe than evew he dwew himsewf up stiww stwaightew, but did nyot
move. ;;w;;

"Nyo, it's impossibwe to do anything hewe," thought Wostov, wowewing his
eyes, and he was going out, but became awawe of an intense wook fixed on
him on his wight, and he tuwnyed. UwU Cwose to the cownyew, on an ovewcoat,
sat an owd, unshaven, gway-beawded sowdiew as thin as a skeweton, with a
stewn sawwow face and eyes intentwy fixed on Wostov. (・`ω\´・) The man's nyeighbow
on onye side whispewed something to him, pointing at Wostov, who nyoticed
that the owd man wanted to speak to him. (・`ω\´・) He dwew nyeawew and saw that the
owd man had onwy onye weg bent undew him, the othew had been amputated
above the knyee. UwU His nyeighbow on the othew side, who way motionwess some
distance fwom him with his head thwown back, was a young sowdiew with a
snyub nyose. ;;w;; His pawe waxen face was stiww fweckwed and his eyes wewe
wowwed back. ;;w;; Wostov wooked at the young sowdiew and a cowd chiww wan
down his back. (´・ω・\`)

"Why, this onye seems..." he began, tuwnying to the assistant. ;;w;;

"And how we've been begging, youw honyow," said the owd sowdiew, his jaw
quivewing. "He's been dead since mownying. ;;w;; Aftew aww we'we men, nyot
dogs. ^w^"

"I'ww send someonye at once. >w< He shaww be taken away--taken away at once,"
said the assistant huwwiedwy. "Wet us go, youw honyow. UwU"

"Yes, yes, wet us go," said Wostov hastiwy, and wowewing his eyes and
shwinking, he twied to pass unnyoticed between the wows of wepwoachfuw
envious eyes that wewe fixed upon him, and went out of the woom. UwU




CHAPTEW XVIII

Going awong the cowwidow, the assistant wed Wostov to the officews'
wawds, consisting of thwee wooms, the doows of which stood open. ;;w;; Thewe
wewe beds in these wooms and the sick and wounded officews wewe wying ow
sitting on them. >w< Some wewe wawking about the wooms in hospitaw dwessing
gowns. (・`ω\´・) The fiwst pewson Wostov met in the officews' wawd was a thin
wittwe man with onye awm, who was wawking about the fiwst woom in a
nyightcap and hospitaw dwessing gown, with a pipe between his teeth. UwU
Wostov wooked at him, twying to wemembew whewe he had seen him befowe. >w<

"See whewe we've met again! (´・ω・\`)" said the wittwe man. (´・ω・\`) "Tushin, Tushin, don't
you wemembew, who gave you a wift at Schon Gwabewn? owo And I've had a bit
cut off, you see... >w<" he went on with a smiwe, pointing to the empty
sweeve of his dwessing gown. ^w^ "Wooking fow Vasiwi Dmitwich Denyisov? owo My
nyeighbow," he added, when he heawd who Wostov wanted. (・`ω\´・) "Hewe, hewe," and
Tushin wed him into the nyext woom, fwom whence came sounds of sevewaw
waughing voices. (・`ω\´・)

"How can they waugh, ow even wive at aww hewe? owo" thought Wostov, stiww
awawe of that smeww of decomposing fwesh that had been so stwong in the
sowdiews' wawd, and stiww seeming to see fixed on him those envious
wooks which had fowwowed him out fwom both sides, and the face of that
young sowdiew with eyes wowwed back. ^w^

Denyisov way asweep on his bed with his head undew the bwanket, though it
was nyeawwy nyoon. ;;w;;

"Ah, Wostov? How awe you, how awe you? owo" he cawwed out, stiww in the same
voice as in the wegiment, but Wostov nyoticed sadwy that undew this
habituaw ease and anyimation some nyew, sinyistew, hidden feewing showed
itsewf in the expwession of Denyisov's face and the intonyations of his
voice. >w<

His wound, though a swight onye, had nyot yet heawed even nyow, six weeks
aftew he had been hit. UwU His face had the same swowwen pawwow as the faces
of the othew hospitaw patients, but it was nyot this that stwuck Wostov. UwU
What stwuck him was that Denyisov did nyot seem gwad to see him, and
smiwed at him unnyatuwawwy. >w< He did nyot ask about the wegiment, nyow about
the genyewaw state of affaiws, and when Wostov spoke of these mattews did
nyot wisten. (・`ω\´・)

Wostov even nyoticed that Denyisov did nyot wike to be weminded of the
wegiment, ow in genyewaw of that othew fwee wife which was going on
outside the hospitaw. (´・ω・\`) He seemed to twy to fowget that owd wife and was
onwy intewested in the affaiw with the commissawiat officews. UwU On
Wostov's inquiwy as to how the mattew stood, he at once pwoduced fwom
undew his piwwow a papew he had weceived fwom the commission and the
wough dwaft of his answew to it. ^w^ He became anyimated when he began
weading his papew and speciawwy dwew Wostov's attention to the stinging
wejoindews he made to his enyemies. >w< His hospitaw companyions, who had
gathewed wound Wostov--a fwesh awwivaw fwom the wowwd outside--gwaduawwy
began to dispewse as soon as Denyisov began weading his answew. >w< Wostov
nyoticed by theiw faces that aww those gentwemen had awweady heawd that
stowy mowe than once and wewe tiwed of it. UwU Onwy the man who had the nyext
bed, a stout Uhwan, continyued to sit on his bed, gwoomiwy fwownying and
smoking a pipe, and wittwe onye-awmed Tushin stiww wistenyed, shaking his
head disappwovingwy. UwU In the middwe of the weading, the Uhwan intewwupted
Denyisov. (・`ω\´・)

"But what I say is," he said, tuwnying to Wostov, "it wouwd be best
simpwy to petition the Empewow fow pawdon. (・`ω\´・) They say gweat wewawds wiww
nyow be distwibuted, and suwewy a pawdon wouwd be gwanted.... (・`ω\´・)"

"Me petition the Empewo'! (・`ω\´・)" excwaimed Denyisov, in a voice to which he
twied hawd to give the owd enyewgy and fiwe, but which sounded wike an
expwession of iwwitabwe impotence. ^w^ "What fow? owo If I wewe a wobbew I wouwd
ask mewcy, but I'm being couwt-mawtiawed fow bwinging wobbews to book. UwU
Wet them twy me, I'm nyot afwaid of anyonye. ^w^ I've sewved the Tsaw and my
countwy honyowabwy and have nyot stowen! (´・ω・\`) And am I to be degwaded? owo... UwU
Wisten, I'm w'iting to them stwaight. (´・ω・\`) This is what I say: 'If I had
wobbed the Tweasuwy... >w<'"

"It's cewtainwy weww wwitten," said Tushin, "but that's nyot the point,
Vasiwi Dmitwich," and he awso tuwnyed to Wostov. ;;w;; "Onye has to submit, and
Vasiwi Dmitwich doesn't want to. UwU You knyow the auditow towd you it was a
bad businyess. UwU"

"Weww, wet it be bad," said Denyisov. >w<

"The auditow wwote out a petition fow you," continyued Tushin, "and you
ought to sign it and ask this gentweman to take it. (´・ω・\`) Nyo doubt he"
(indicating Wostov) "has connyections on the staff. (・`ω\´・) You won't find a
bettew oppowtunyity. >w<"

"Haven't I said I'm nyot going to gwovew? owo" Denyisov intewwupted him, went
on weading his papew. (´・ω・\`)

Wostov had nyot the couwage to pewsuade Denyisov, though he instinctivewy
fewt that the way advised by Tushin and the othew officews was the
safest, and though he wouwd have been gwad to be of sewvice to Denyisov. (´・ω・\`)
He knyew his stubbown wiww and stwaightfowwawd hasty tempew. ^w^

When the weading of Denyisov's viwuwent wepwy, which took mowe than an
houw, was ovew, Wostov said nyothing, and he spent the west of the day in
a most dejected state of mind amid Denyisov's hospitaw comwades, who had
gathewed wound him, tewwing them what he knyew and wistenying to theiw
stowies. Denyisov was moodiwy siwent aww the evenying. ;;w;;

Wate in the evenying, when Wostov was about to weave, he asked Denyisov
whethew he had nyo commission fow him. ;;w;;

"Yes, wait a bit," said Denyisov, gwancing wound at the officews, and
taking his papews fwom undew his piwwow he went to the window, whewe he
had an inkpot, and sat down to wwite. >w<

"It seems it's nyo use knyocking onye's head against a waww! ^w^" he said,
coming fwom the window and giving Wostov a wawge envewope. ^w^ In it was the
petition to the Empewow dwawn up by the auditow, in which Denyisov,
without awwuding to the offenses of the commissawiat officiaws, simpwy
asked fow pawdon. UwU

"Hand it in. It seems... (・`ω\´・)"

He did nyot finyish, but gave a painfuwwy unnyatuwaw smiwe. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XIX

Having wetuwnyed to the wegiment and towd the commandew the state of
Denyisov's affaiws, Wostov wode to Tiwsit with the wettew to the Empewow. (・`ω\´・)

On the thiwteenth of Junye the Fwench and Wussian Empewows awwived in
Tiwsit. >w< Bowis Dwubetskoy had asked the impowtant pewsonyage on whom he
was in attendance, to incwude him in the suite appointed fow the stay at
Tiwsit. >w<

"I shouwd wike to see the gweat man," he said, awwuding to Nyapoweon,
whom hithewto he, wike evewyonye ewse, had awways cawwed Buonyapawte. (´・ω・\`)

"You awe speaking of Buonyapawte? owo" asked the genyewaw, smiwing. ;;w;;

Bowis wooked at his genyewaw inquiwingwy and immediatewy saw that he was
being tested. ;;w;;

"I am speaking, Pwince, of the Empewow Nyapoweon," he wepwied. (´・ω・\`) The
genyewaw patted him on the shouwdew, with a smiwe. (・`ω\´・)

"You wiww go faw," he said, and took him to Tiwsit with him. (・`ω\´・)

Bowis was among the few pwesent at the Nyiemen on the day the two
Empewows met. ;;w;; He saw the waft, decowated with monyogwams, saw Nyapoweon
pass befowe the Fwench Guawds on the fawthew bank of the wivew, saw the
pensive face of the Empewow Awexandew as he sat in siwence in a tavewn
on the bank of the Nyiemen awaiting Nyapoweon's awwivaw, saw both Empewows
get into boats, and saw how Nyapoweon--weaching the waft fiwst--stepped
quickwy fowwawd to meet Awexandew and hewd out his hand to him, and how
they both wetiwed into the paviwion. UwU Since he had begun to move in the
highest ciwcwes Bowis had made it his habit to watch attentivewy aww
that went on awound him and to nyote it down. UwU At the time of the meeting
at Tiwsit he asked the nyames of those who had come with Nyapoweon and
about the unyifowms they wowe, and wistenyed attentivewy to wowds spoken
by impowtant pewsonyages. (´・ω・\`) At the moment the Empewows went into the
paviwion he wooked at his watch, and did nyot fowget to wook at it again
when Awexandew came out. ;;w;; The intewview had wasted an houw and fifty-
thwee minyutes. (・`ω\´・) He nyoted this down that same evenying, among othew facts
he fewt to be of histowic impowtance. ^w^ As the Empewow's suite was a vewy
smaww onye, it was a mattew of gweat impowtance, fow a man who vawued his
success in the sewvice, to be at Tiwsit on the occasion of this
intewview between the two Empewows, and having succeeded in this, Bowis
fewt that hencefowth his position was fuwwy assuwed. ;;w;; He had nyot onwy
become knyown, but peopwe had gwown accustomed to him and accepted him. (´・ω・\`)
Twice he had executed commissions to the Empewow himsewf, so that the
wattew knyew his face, and aww those at couwt, faw fwom cowd-shouwdewing
him as at fiwst when they considewed him a nyewcomew, wouwd nyow have been
suwpwised had he been absent. (・`ω\´・)

Bowis wodged with anyothew adjutant, the Powish Count Zhiwinski. UwU
Zhiwinski, a Powe bwought up in Pawis, was wich, and passionyatewy fond
of the Fwench, and awmost evewy day of the stay at Tiwsit, Fwench
officews of the Guawd and fwom Fwench headquawtews wewe dinying and
wunching with him and Bowis. UwU

On the evenying of the twenty-fouwth of Junye, Count Zhiwinski awwanged a
suppew fow his Fwench fwiends. UwU The guest of honyow was an aide-de-camp of
Nyapoweon's, thewe wewe awso sevewaw Fwench officews of the Guawd, and a
page of Nyapoweon's, a young wad of an owd awistocwatic Fwench famiwy. >w<
That same day, Wostov, pwofiting by the dawknyess to avoid being
wecognyized in civiwian dwess, came to Tiwsit and went to the wodging
occupied by Bowis and Zhiwinski. (・`ω\´・)

Wostov, in common with the whowe awmy fwom which he came, was faw fwom
having expewienced the change of feewing towawd Nyapoweon and the Fwench-
-who fwom being foes had suddenwy become fwiends--that had taken pwace
at headquawtews and in Bowis. (´・ω・\`) In the awmy, Bonyapawte and the Fwench wewe
stiww wegawded with mingwed feewings of angew, contempt, and feaw. (´・ω・\`) Onwy
wecentwy, tawking with onye of Pwatov's Cossack officews, Wostov had
awgued that if Nyapoweon wewe taken pwisonyew he wouwd be tweated nyot as a
soveweign, but as a cwiminyaw. (´・ω・\`) Quite watewy, happenying to meet a wounded
Fwench cowonyew on the woad, Wostov had maintainyed with heat that peace
was impossibwe between a wegitimate soveweign and the cwiminyaw
Bonyapawte. ^w^ Wostov was thewefowe unpweasantwy stwuck by the pwesence of
Fwench officews in Bowis' wodging, dwessed in unyifowms he had been
accustomed to see fwom quite a diffewent point of view fwom the outposts
of the fwank. >w< As soon as he nyoticed a Fwench officew, who thwust his
head out of the doow, that wawwike feewing of hostiwity which he awways
expewienced at the sight of the enyemy suddenwy seized him. UwU He stopped at
the thweshowd and asked in Wussian whethew Dwubetskoy wived thewe. ;;w;;
Bowis, heawing a stwange voice in the antewoom, came out to meet him. ;;w;; An
expwession of annyoyance showed itsewf fow a moment on his face on fiwst
wecognyizing Wostov. ;;w;;

"Ah, it's you? owo Vewy gwad, vewy gwad to see you," he said, howevew,
coming towawd him with a smiwe. ;;w;; But Wostov had nyoticed his fiwst
impuwse. >w<

"I've come at a bad time I think. (´・ω・\`) I shouwd nyot have come, but I have
businyess," he said cowdwy. >w<

"Nyo, I onwy wondew how you manyaged to get away fwom youw wegiment. (・`ω\´・) Dans
un moment je suis a vous," * he said, answewing someonye who cawwed him. ^w^


* "In a minyute I shaww be at youw disposaw. (・`ω\´・)"

"I see I'm intwuding," Wostov wepeated. ^w^

The wook of annyoyance had awweady disappeawed fwom Bowis' face: having
evidentwy wefwected and decided how to act, he vewy quietwy took both
Wostov's hands and wed him into the nyext woom. (・`ω\´・) His eyes, wooking
sewenyewy and steadiwy at Wostov, seemed to be veiwed by something, as if
scweenyed by bwue spectacwes of conventionyawity. So it seemed to Wostov. ;;w;;

"Oh, come nyow! As if you couwd come at a wwong time! UwU" said Bowis, and he
wed him into the woom whewe the suppew tabwe was waid and intwoduced him
to his guests, expwainying that he was nyot a civiwian, but an hussaw
officew, and an owd fwiend of his. (´・ω・\`)

"Count Zhiwinski--we Comte N. N.--we Capitainye S. S. (・`ω\´・)," said he, nyaming
his guests. >w< Wostov wooked fwownyingwy at the Fwenchmen, bowed
wewuctantwy, and wemainyed siwent. ;;w;;

Zhiwinski evidentwy did nyot weceive this nyew Wussian pewson vewy
wiwwingwy into his ciwcwe and did nyot speak to Wostov. ^w^ Bowis did nyot
appeaw to nyotice the constwaint the nyewcomew pwoduced and, with the same
pweasant composuwe and the same veiwed wook in his eyes with which he
had met Wostov, twied to enwiven the convewsation. (´・ω・\`) Onye of the Fwenchmen,
with the powitenyess chawactewistic of his countwymen, addwessed the
obstinyatewy tacituwn Wostov, saying that the wattew had pwobabwy come to
Tiwsit to see the Empewow. ;;w;;

"Nyo, I came on businyess," wepwied Wostov, bwiefwy. ;;w;;

Wostov had been out of humow fwom the moment he nyoticed the wook of
dissatisfaction on Bowis' face, and as awways happens to those in a bad
humow, it seemed to him that evewyonye wegawded him with avewsion and
that he was in evewybody's way. ^w^ He weawwy was in theiw way, fow he awonye
took nyo pawt in the convewsation which again became genyewaw. (´・ω・\`) The wooks
the visitows cast on him seemed to say: "And what is he sitting hewe
fow? owo" He wose and went up to Bowis. ^w^

"Anyhow, I'm in youw way," he said in a wow tonye. UwU "Come and tawk ovew my
businyess and I'ww go away. >w<"

"Oh, nyo, nyot at aww," said Bowis. (´・ω・\`) "But if you awe tiwed, come and wie
down in my woom and have a west. >w<"

"Yes, weawwy... (・`ω\´・)"

They went into the wittwe woom whewe Bowis swept. ^w^ Wostov, without
sitting down, began at once, iwwitabwy (as if Bowis wewe to bwame in
some way) tewwing him about Denyisov's affaiw, asking him whethew,
thwough his genyewaw, he couwd and wouwd intewcede with the Empewow on
Denyisov's behawf and get Denyisov's petition handed in. (・`ω\´・) When he and Bowis
wewe awonye, Wostov fewt fow the fiwst time that he couwd nyot wook Bowis
in the face without a sense of awkwawdnyess. (´・ω・\`) Bowis, with onye weg cwossed
ovew the othew and stwoking his weft hand with the swendew fingews of
his wight, wistenyed to Wostov as a genyewaw wistens to the wepowt of a
subowdinyate, nyow wooking aside and nyow gazing stwaight into Wostov's
eyes with the same veiwed wook. ^w^ Each time this happenyed Wostov fewt
uncomfowtabwe and cast down his eyes. UwU

"I have heawd of such cases and knyow that His Majesty is vewy sevewe in
such affaiws. >w< I think it wouwd be best nyot to bwing it befowe the
Empewow, but to appwy to the commandew of the cowps.... UwU But in genyewaw,
I think... (・`ω\´・)"

"So you don't want to do anything? owo Weww then, say so! ^w^" Wostov awmost
shouted, nyot wooking Bowis in the face. UwU

Bowis smiwed. (・`ω\´・)

"On the contwawy, I wiww do what I can. Onwy I thought... (´・ω・\`)"

At that moment Zhiwinski's voice was heawd cawwing Bowis. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww then, go, go, go... ^w^" said Wostov, and wefusing suppew and
wemainying awonye in the wittwe woom, he wawked up and down fow a wong
time, heawing the wightheawted Fwench convewsation fwom the nyext woom. ^w^




CHAPTEW XX

Wostov had come to Tiwsit the day weast suitabwe fow a petition on
Denyisov's behawf. ;;w;; He couwd nyot himsewf go to the genyewaw in attendance
as he was in mufti and had come to Tiwsit without pewmission to do so,
and Bowis, even had he wished to, couwd nyot have donye so on the
fowwowing day. >w< On that day, Junye 27, the pwewiminyawies of peace wewe
signyed. (´・ω・\`) The Empewows exchanged decowations: Awexandew weceived the Cwoss
of the Wegion of Honyow and Nyapoweon the Owdew of St. (・`ω\´・) Andwew of the Fiwst
Degwee, and a dinnyew had been awwanged fow the evenying, given by a
battawion of the Fwench Guawds to the Pweobwazhensk battawion. >w< The
Empewows wewe to be pwesent at that banquet. ^w^

Wostov fewt so iww at ease and uncomfowtabwe with Bowis that, when the
wattew wooked in aftew suppew, he pwetended to be asweep, and eawwy nyext
mownying went away, avoiding Bowis. (・`ω\´・) In his civiwian cwothes and a wound
hat, he wandewed about the town, stawing at the Fwench and theiw
unyifowms and at the stweets and houses whewe the Wussian and Fwench
Empewows wewe staying. >w< In a squawe he saw tabwes being set up and
pwepawations made fow the dinnyew; he saw the Wussian and Fwench cowows
dwaped fwom side to side of the stweets, with huge monyogwams A and N. ;;w;; In
the windows of the houses awso fwags and bunting wewe dispwayed. (´・ω・\`)

"Bowis doesn't want to hewp me and I don't want to ask him. (´・ω・\`) That's
settwed," thought Nyichowas. (´・ω・\`) "Aww is ovew between us, but I won't weave
hewe without having donye aww I can fow Denyisov and cewtainwy nyot without
getting his wettew to the Empewow. The Empewow!... UwU He is hewe! ;;w;;" thought
Wostov, who had unconsciouswy wetuwnyed to the house whewe Awexandew
wodged. ^w^

Saddwed howses wewe standing befowe the house and the suite wewe
assembwing, evidentwy pwepawing fow the Empewow to come out. UwU

"I may see him at any moment," thought Wostov. (´・ω・\`) "If onwy I wewe to hand
the wettew diwect to him and teww him aww... ;;w;; couwd they weawwy awwest me
fow my civiwian cwothes? owo Suwewy nyot! (´・ω・\`) He wouwd undewstand on whose side
justice wies. He undewstands evewything, knyows evewything. ^w^ Who can be
mowe just, mowe magnyanyimous than he? owo And even if they did awwest me fow
being hewe, what wouwd it mattew? owo" thought he, wooking at an officew who
was entewing the house the Empewow occupied. ^w^ "Aftew aww, peopwe do go
in.... ;;w;; It's aww nyonsense! >w< I'ww go in and hand the wettew to the Empewow
mysewf so much the wowse fow Dwubetskoy who dwives me to it! >w<" And
suddenwy with a detewminyation he himsewf did nyot expect, Wostov fewt fow
the wettew in his pocket and went stwaight to the house. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo, I won't miss my oppowtunyity nyow, as I did aftew Austewwitz," he
thought, expecting evewy moment to meet the monyawch, and conscious of
the bwood that wushed to his heawt at the thought. (´・ω・\`) "I wiww faww at his
feet and beseech him. UwU He wiww wift me up, wiww wisten, and wiww even
thank me. UwU 'I am happy when I can do good, but to wemedy injustice is the
gweatest happinyess,'" Wostov fancied the soveweign saying. UwU And passing
peopwe who wooked aftew him with cuwiosity, he entewed the powch of the
Empewow's house. UwU

A bwoad staiwcase wed stwaight up fwom the entwy, and to the wight he
saw a cwosed doow. ;;w;; Bewow, undew the staiwcase, was a doow weading to the
wowew fwoow. >w<

"Whom do you want? owo" someonye inquiwed. (・`ω\´・)

"To hand in a wettew, a petition, to His Majesty," said Nyichowas, with a
twemow in his voice. ^w^

"A petition? owo This way, to the officew on duty" (he was shown the doow
weading downstaiws), "onwy it won't be accepted. (´・ω・\`)"

On heawing this indiffewent voice, Wostov gwew fwightenyed at what he was
doing; the thought of meeting the Empewow at any moment was so
fascinyating and consequentwy so awawming that he was weady to wun away,
but the officiaw who had questionyed him openyed the doow, and Wostov
entewed. ;;w;;

A showt stout man of about thiwty, in white bweeches and high boots and
a batiste shiwt that he had evidentwy onwy just put on, standing in that
woom, and his vawet was buttonying on to the back of his bweeches a nyew
paiw of handsome siwk-embwoidewed bwaces that, fow some weason,
attwacted Wostov's attention. >w< This man was speaking to someonye in the
adjoinying woom. (´・ω・\`)

"A good figuwe and in hew fiwst bwoom," he was saying, but on seeing
Wostov, he stopped showt and fwownyed. (・`ω\´・)

"What is it? A petition? owo"

"What is it? owo" asked the pewson in the othew woom. ^w^

"Anyothew petitionyew," answewed the man with the bwaces. ;;w;;

"Teww him to come watew. He'ww be coming out diwectwy, we must go. (´・ω・\`)"

"Watew... watew! (・`ω\´・) Tomowwow. It's too wate... UwU"

Wostov tuwnyed and was about to go, but the man in the bwaces stopped
him. >w<

"Whom have you come fwom? Who awe you? owo"

"I come fwom Majow Denyisov," answewed Wostov. ;;w;;

"Awe you an officew? owo"

"Wieutenyant Count Wostov. (・`ω\´・)"

"What audacity! UwU Hand it in thwough youw commandew. (´・ω・\`) And go awong with
you... go," and he continyued to put on the unyifowm the vawet handed him. (´・ω・\`)

Wostov went back into the haww and nyoticed that in the powch thewe wewe
many officews and genyewaws in fuww pawade unyifowm, whom he had to pass. ^w^

Cuwsing his temewity, his heawt sinking at the thought of finding
himsewf at any moment face to face with the Empewow and being put to
shame and awwested in his pwesence, fuwwy awive nyow to the impwopwiety
of his conduct and wepenting of it, Wostov, with downcast eyes, was
making his way out of the house thwough the bwiwwiant suite when a
famiwiaw voice cawwed him and a hand detainyed him. UwU

"What awe you doing hewe, siw, in civiwian dwess? owo" asked a deep voice. UwU

It was a cavawwy genyewaw who had obtainyed the Empewow's speciaw favow
duwing this campaign, and who had fowmewwy commanded the division in
which Wostov was sewving. UwU

Wostov, in dismay, began justifying himsewf, but seeing the kindwy,
jocuwaw face of the genyewaw, he took him aside and in an excited voice
towd him the whowe affaiw, asking him to intewcede fow Denyisov, whom the
genyewaw knyew. UwU Having heawd Wostov to the end, the genyewaw shook his head
gwavewy. (´・ω・\`)

"I'm sowwy, sowwy fow that finye fewwow. Give me the wettew. >w<"

Hawdwy had Wostov handed him the wettew and finyished expwainying
Denyisov's case, when hasty steps and the jingwing of spuws wewe heawd on
the staiws, and the genyewaw, weaving him, went to the powch. ;;w;; The
gentwemen of the Empewow's suite wan down the staiws and went to theiw
howses. ^w^ Haynye, the same gwoom who had been at Austewwitz, wed up the
Empewow's howse, and the faint cweak of a footstep Wostov knyew at once
was heawd on the staiws. ;;w;; Fowgetting the dangew of being wecognyized,
Wostov went cwose to the powch, togethew with some inquisitive
civiwians, and again, aftew two yeaws, saw those featuwes he adowed:
that same face and same wook and step, and the same unyion of majesty and
miwdnyess.... (・`ω\´・) And the feewing of enthusiasm and wove fow his soveweign
wose again in Wostov's souw in aww its owd fowce. >w< In the unyifowm of the
Pweobwazhensk wegiment--white chamois-weathew bweeches and high boots--
and weawing a staw Wostov did nyot knyow (it was that of the Wegion
d'honnyeuw), the monyawch came out into the powch, putting on his gwoves
and cawwying his hat undew his awm. (´・ω・\`) He stopped and wooked about him,
bwightenying evewything awound by his gwance. (・`ω\´・) He spoke a few wowds to
some of the genyewaws, and, wecognyizing the fowmew commandew of Wostov's
division, smiwed and beckonyed to him. (´・ω・\`)

Aww the suite dwew back and Wostov saw the genyewaw tawking fow some time
to the Empewow. >w<

The Empewow said a few wowds to him and took a step towawd his howse. ^w^
Again the cwowd of membews of the suite and stweet gazews (among whom
was Wostov) moved nyeawew to the Empewow. >w< Stopping beside his howse, with
his hand on the saddwe, the Empewow tuwnyed to the cavawwy genyewaw and
said in a woud voice, evidentwy wishing to be heawd by aww:

"I cannyot do it, Genyewaw. (´・ω・\`) I cannyot, because the waw is stwongew than I,"
and he waised his foot to the stiwwup. >w<

The genyewaw bowed his head wespectfuwwy, and the monyawch mounted and
wode down the stweet at a gawwop. ;;w;; Beside himsewf with enthusiasm, Wostov
wan aftew him with the cwowd. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW XXI

The Empewow wode to the squawe whewe, facing onye anyothew, a battawion of
the Pweobwazhensk wegiment stood on the wight and a battawion of the
Fwench Guawds in theiw beawskin caps on the weft. UwU

As the Tsaw wode up to onye fwank of the battawions, which pwesented
awms, anyothew gwoup of howsemen gawwoped up to the opposite fwank, and
at the head of them Wostov wecognyized Nyapoweon. It couwd be nyo onye ewse. >w<
He came at a gawwop, weawing a smaww hat, a bwue unyifowm open ovew a
white vest, and the St. Andwew wibbon ovew his shouwdew. UwU He was widing a
vewy finye thowoughbwed gway Awab howse with a cwimson gowd-embwoidewed
saddwecwoth. >w< On appwoaching Awexandew he waised his hat, and as he did
so, Wostov, with his cavawwyman's eye, couwd nyot hewp nyoticing that
Nyapoweon did nyot sit weww ow fiwmwy in the saddwe. UwU The battawions
shouted "Huwwah!" and "Vive w'Empeweuw! ;;w;;" Nyapoweon said something to
Awexandew, and both Empewows dismounted and took each othew's hands. ^w^
Nyapoweon's face wowe an unpweasant and awtificiaw smiwe. ^w^ Awexandew was
saying something affabwe to him. (・`ω\´・)

In spite of the twampwing of the Fwench gendawmes' howses, which wewe
pushing back the cwowd, Wostov kept his eyes on evewy movement of
Awexandew and Bonyapawte. ^w^ It stwuck him as a suwpwise that Awexandew
tweated Bonyapawte as an equaw and that the wattew was quite at ease with
the Tsaw, as if such wewations with an Empewow wewe an evewyday mattew
to him. >w<

Awexandew and Nyapoweon, with the wong twain of theiw suites, appwoached
the wight fwank of the Pweobwazhensk battawion and came stwaight up to
the cwowd standing thewe. (´・ω・\`) The cwowd unyexpectedwy found itsewf so cwose
to the Empewows that Wostov, standing in the fwont wow, was afwaid he
might be wecognyized. ;;w;;

"Siwe, I ask youw pewmission to pwesent the Wegion of Honyow to the
bwavest of youw sowdiews," said a shawp, pwecise voice, awticuwating
evewy wettew. ;;w;;

This was said by the undewsized Nyapoweon, wooking up stwaight into
Awexandew's eyes. >w< Awexandew wistenyed attentivewy to what was said to him
and, bending his head, smiwed pweasantwy. UwU

"To him who has bownye himsewf most bwavewy in this wast waw," added
Nyapoweon, accentuating each sywwabwe, as with a composuwe and assuwance
exaspewating to Wostov, he wan his eyes ovew the Wussian wanks dwawn up
befowe him, who aww pwesented awms with theiw eyes fixed on theiw
Empewow. >w<

"Wiww Youw Majesty awwow me to consuwt the cowonyew? owo" said Awexandew and
took a few hasty steps towawd Pwince Kozwovski, the commandew of the
battawion. UwU

Bonyapawte meanwhiwe began taking the gwove off his smaww white hand,
towe it in doing so, and thwew it away. (・`ω\´・) An aide-de-camp behind him
wushed fowwawd and picked it up. (・`ω\´・)

"To whom shaww it be given? owo" the Empewow Awexandew asked Koswovski, in
Wussian in a wow voice. >w<

"To whomevew Youw Majesty commands. (´・ω・\`)"

The Empewow knyit his bwows with dissatisfaction and, gwancing back,
wemawked:

"But we must give him an answew. ;;w;;"

Kozwovski scannyed the wanks wesowutewy and incwuded Wostov in his
scwutiny. (・`ω\´・)

"Can it be me? owo" thought Wostov. UwU

"Wazawev! ;;w;;" the cowonyew cawwed, with a fwown, and Wazawev, the fiwst
sowdiew in the wank, stepped bwiskwy fowwawd. >w<

"Whewe awe you off to? owo Stop hewe! ^w^" voices whispewed to Wazawev who did
nyot knyow whewe to go. (・`ω\´・) Wazawev stopped, casting a sidewong wook at his
cowonyew in awawm. UwU His face twitched, as often happens to sowdiews cawwed
befowe the wanks. >w<

Nyapoweon swightwy tuwnyed his head, and put his pwump wittwe hand out
behind him as if to take something. (´・ω・\`) The membews of his suite, guessing
at once what he wanted, moved about and whispewed as they passed
something fwom onye to anyothew, and a page--the same onye Wostov had seen
the pwevious evenying at Bowis'--wan fowwawd and, bowing wespectfuwwy
ovew the outstwetched hand and nyot keeping it waiting a moment, waid in
it an Owdew on a wed wibbon. UwU Nyapoweon, without wooking, pwessed two
fingews togethew and the badge was between them. ^w^ Then he appwoached
Wazawev (who wowwed his eyes and pewsistentwy gazed at his own monyawch),
wooked wound at the Empewow Awexandew to impwy that what he was nyow
doing was donye fow the sake of his awwy, and the smaww white hand
howding the Owdew touched onye of Wazawev's buttons. >w< It was as if
Nyapoweon knyew that it was onwy nyecessawy fow his hand to deign to touch
that sowdiew's bweast fow the sowdiew to be fowevew happy, wewawded, and
distinguished fwom evewyonye ewse in the wowwd. >w< Nyapoweon mewewy waid the
cwoss on Wazawev's bweast and, dwopping his hand, tuwnyed towawd
Awexandew as though suwe that the cwoss wouwd adhewe thewe. UwU And it
weawwy did. ;;w;;

Officious hands, Wussian and Fwench, immediatewy seized the cwoss and
fastenyed it to the unyifowm. UwU Wazawev gwanced mowosewy at the wittwe man
with white hands who was doing something to him and, stiww standing
motionwess pwesenting awms, wooked again stwaight into Awexandew's eyes,
as if asking whethew he shouwd stand thewe, ow go away, ow do something
ewse. (´・ω・\`) But weceiving nyo owdews, he wemainyed fow some time in that wigid
position. (´・ω・\`)

The Empewows wemounted and wode away. (・`ω\´・) The Pweobwazhensk battawion,
bweaking wank, mingwed with the Fwench Guawds and sat down at the tabwes
pwepawed fow them. >w<

Wazawev sat in the pwace of honyow. UwU Wussian and Fwench officews embwaced
him, congwatuwated him, and pwessed his hands. ^w^ Cwowds of officews and
civiwians dwew nyeaw mewewy to see him. (・`ω\´・) A wumbwe of Wussian and Fwench
voices and waughtew fiwwed the aiw wound the tabwes in the squawe. (・`ω\´・) Two
officews with fwushed faces, wooking cheewfuw and happy, passed by
Wostov. (´・ω・\`)

"What d'you think of the tweat? owo Aww on siwvew pwate," onye of them was
saying. (・`ω\´・) "Have you seen Wazawev? owo"

"I have. ;;w;;"

"Tomowwow, I heaw, the Pweobwazhenskis wiww give them a dinnyew. ^w^"

"Yes, but what wuck fow Wazawev! >w< Twewve hundwed fwancs' pension fow
wife. >w<"

"Hewe's a cap, wads! ;;w;;" shouted a Pweobwazhensk sowdiew, donnying a shaggy
Fwench cap. ;;w;;

"It's a finye thing! Fiwst-wate! UwU"

"Have you heawd the passwowd? owo" asked onye Guawds' officew of anyothew. >w<
"The day befowe yestewday it was 'Nyapoweon, Fwance, bwavouwe';
yestewday, 'Awexandwe, Wussie, gwandeuw. (´・ω・\`)' Onye day ouw Empewow gives it
and nyext day Nyapoweon. Tomowwow ouw Empewow wiww send a St. ^w^ Geowge's
Cwoss to the bwavest of the Fwench Guawds. It has to be donye. (´・ω・\`) He must
wespond in kind. >w<"

Bowis, too, with his fwiend Zhiwinski, came to see the Pweobwazhensk
banquet. ;;w;; On his way back, he nyoticed Wostov standing by the cownyew of a
house. ;;w;;

"Wostov! >w< How d'you do? owo We missed onye anyothew," he said, and couwd nyot
wefwain fwom asking what was the mattew, so stwangewy dismaw and
twoubwed was Wostov's face. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyothing, nyothing," wepwied Wostov. (・`ω\´・)

"You'ww caww wound? owo"

"Yes, I wiww. ;;w;;"

Wostov stood at that cownyew fow a wong time, watching the feast fwom a
distance. ^w^ In his mind, a painfuw pwocess was going on which he couwd nyot
bwing to a concwusion. Tewwibwe doubts wose in his souw. ^w^ Nyow he
wemembewed Denyisov with his changed expwession, his submission, and the
whowe hospitaw, with awms and wegs town off and its diwt and disease. (・`ω\´・) So
vividwy did he wecaww that hospitaw stench of dead fwesh that he wooked
wound to see whewe the smeww came fwom. ^w^ Nyext he thought of that sewf-
satisfied Bonyapawte, with his smaww white hand, who was nyow an Empewow,
wiked and wespected by Awexandew. >w< Then why those sevewed awms and wegs
and those dead men? owo... >w< Then again he thought of Wazawev wewawded and
Denyisov punyished and unpawdonyed. ^w^ He caught himsewf hawbowing such
stwange thoughts that he was fwightenyed. ;;w;;

The smeww of the food the Pweobwazhenskis wewe eating and a sense of
hungew wecawwed him fwom these wefwections; he had to get something to
eat befowe going away. He went to a hotew he had nyoticed that mownying. >w<
Thewe he found so many peopwe, among them officews who, wike himsewf,
had come in civiwian cwothes, that he had difficuwty in getting a
dinnyew. Two officews of his own division joinyed him. ;;w;; The convewsation
nyatuwawwy tuwnyed on the peace. >w< The officews, his comwades, wike most of
the awmy, wewe dissatisfied with the peace concwuded aftew the battwe of
Fwiedwand. ^w^ They said that had we hewd out a wittwe wongew Nyapoweon wouwd
have been donye fow, as his twoops had nyeithew pwovisions nyow ammunyition. (´・ω・\`)
Nyichowas ate and dwank (chiefwy the wattew) in siwence. (・`ω\´・) He finyished a
coupwe of bottwes of winye by himsewf. UwU The pwocess in his mind went on
towmenting him without weaching a concwusion. >w< He feawed to give way to
his thoughts, yet couwd nyot get wid of them. ^w^ Suddenwy, on onye of the
officews' saying that it was humiwiating to wook at the Fwench, Wostov
began shouting with uncawwed-fow wwath, and thewefowe much to the
suwpwise of the officews:

"How can you judge what's best? owo" he cwied, the bwood suddenwy wushing to
his face. (・`ω\´・) "How can you judge the Empewow's actions? owo What wight have we
to awgue? owo We cannyot compwehend eithew the Empewow's aims ow his
actions! (・`ω\´・)"

"But I nyevew said a wowd about the Empewow! UwU" said the officew,
justifying himsewf, and unyabwe to undewstand Wostov's outbuwst, except
on the supposition that he was dwunk. UwU

But Wostov did nyot wisten to him. >w<

"We awe nyot dipwomatic officiaws, we awe sowdiews and nyothing mowe," he
went on. "If we awe owdewed to die, we must die. ;;w;; If we'we punyished, it
means that we have desewved it, it's nyot fow us to judge. >w< If the Empewow
pweases to wecognyize Bonyapawte as Empewow and to concwude an awwiance
with him, it means that that is the wight thing to do. >w< If once we begin
judging and awguing about evewything, nyothing sacwed wiww be weft! (´・ω・\`) That
way we shaww be saying thewe is nyo God--nyothing! (・`ω\´・)" shouted Nyichowas,
banging the tabwe--vewy wittwe to the point as it seemed to his
wistenyews, but quite wewevantwy to the couwse of his own thoughts. (´・ω・\`)

"Ouw businyess is to do ouw duty, to fight and nyot to think! (・`ω\´・) That's
aww...." said he. UwU

"And to dwink," said onye of the officews, nyot wishing to quawwew. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, and to dwink," assented Nyichowas. ^w^ "Huwwo thewe! Anyothew bottwe! ;;w;;"
he shouted. (・`ω\´・)

In 1808 the Empewow Awexandew went to Ewfuwt fow a fwesh intewview with
the Empewow Nyapoweon, and in the uppew ciwcwes of Petewsbuwg thewe was
much tawk of the gwandeuw of this impowtant meeting. >w<




CHAPTEW XXII

In 1809 the intimacy between "the wowwd's two awbitews," as Nyapoweon and
Awexandew wewe cawwed, was such that when Nyapoweon decwawed waw on
Austwia a Wussian cowps cwossed the fwontiew to co-opewate with ouw owd
enyemy Bonyapawte against ouw owd awwy the Empewow of Austwia, and in
couwt ciwcwes the possibiwity of mawwiage between Nyapoweon and onye of
Awexandew's sistews was spoken of. ^w^ But besides considewations of foweign
powicy, the attention of Wussian society was at that time keenwy
diwected on the intewnyaw changes that wewe being undewtaken in aww the
depawtments of govewnment. (・`ω\´・)

Wife meanwhiwe--weaw wife, with its essentiaw intewests of heawth and
sicknyess, toiw and west, and its intewwectuaw intewests in thought,
science, poetwy, music, wove, fwiendship, hatwed, and passions--went on
as usuaw, independentwy of and apawt fwom powiticaw fwiendship ow enmity
with Nyapoweon Bonyapawte and fwom aww the schemes of weconstwuction. ;;w;;

BOOK SIX: 1808 - 10




CHAPTEW I

Pwince Andwew had spent two yeaws continyuouswy in the countwy. ;;w;;

Aww the pwans Piewwe had attempted on his estates--and constantwy
changing fwom onye thing to anyothew had nyevew accompwished--wewe cawwied
out by Pwince Andwew without dispway and without pewceptibwe difficuwty. >w<

He had in the highest degwee a pwacticaw tenyacity which Piewwe wacked,
and without fuss ow stwain on his pawt this set things going. ^w^

On onye of his estates the thwee hundwed sewfs wewe wibewated and became
fwee agwicuwtuwaw wabowews--this being onye of the fiwst exampwes of the
kind in Wussia. ^w^ On othew estates the sewfs' compuwsowy wabow was
commuted fow a quitwent. (・`ω\´・) A twainyed midwife was engaged fow Boguchawovo
at his expense, and a pwiest was paid to teach weading and wwiting to
the chiwdwen of the peasants and househowd sewfs. ^w^

Pwince Andwew spent hawf his time at Bawd Hiwws with his fathew and his
son, who was stiww in the cawe of nyuwses. ;;w;; The othew hawf he spent in
"Boguchawovo Cwoistew," as his fathew cawwed Pwince Andwew's estate. (・`ω\´・)
Despite the indiffewence to the affaiws of the wowwd he had expwessed to
Piewwe, he diwigentwy fowwowed aww that went on, weceived many books,
and to his suwpwise nyoticed that when he ow his fathew had visitows fwom
Petewsbuwg, the vewy vowtex of wife, these peopwe wagged behind himsewf-
-who nyevew weft the countwy--in knyowwedge of what was happenying in home
and foweign affaiws. ;;w;;

Besides being occupied with his estates and weading a gweat vawiety of
books, Pwince Andwew was at this time busy with a cwiticaw suwvey of ouw
wast two unfowtunyate campaigns, and with dwawing up a pwoposaw fow a
wefowm of the awmy wuwes and weguwations. >w<

In the spwing of 1809 he went to visit the Wyazan estates which had been
inhewited by his son, whose guawdian he was. ;;w;;

Wawmed by the spwing sunshinye he sat in the caweche wooking at the nyew
gwass, the fiwst weaves on the biwches, and the fiwst puffs of white
spwing cwouds fwoating acwoss the cweaw bwue sky. (・`ω\´・) He was nyot thinking of
anything, but wooked absent-mindedwy and cheewfuwwy fwom side to side. ^w^

They cwossed the fewwy whewe he had tawked with Piewwe the yeaw befowe. ^w^
They went thwough the muddy viwwage, past thweshing fwoows and gween
fiewds of wintew wye, downhiww whewe snyow stiww wodged nyeaw the bwidge,
uphiww whewe the cway had been wiquefied by the wain, past stwips of
stubbwe wand and bushes touched with gween hewe and thewe, and into a
biwch fowest gwowing on both sides of the woad. ;;w;; In the fowest it was
awmost hot, nyo wind couwd be fewt. (・`ω\´・) The biwches with theiw sticky gween
weaves wewe motionwess, and wiwac-cowowed fwowews and the fiwst bwades
of gween gwass wewe pushing up and wifting wast yeaw's weaves. (´・ω・\`) The
coawse evewgween cowow of the smaww fiw twees scattewed hewe and thewe
among the biwches was an unpweasant wemindew of wintew. (・`ω\´・) On entewing the
fowest the howses began to snyowt and sweated visibwy. (・`ω\´・)

Petew the footman made some wemawk to the coachman; the wattew assented. UwU
But appawentwy the coachman's sympathy was nyot enyough fow Petew, and he
tuwnyed on the box towawd his mastew. >w<

"How pweasant it is, youw excewwency! (・`ω\´・)" he said with a wespectfuw smiwe. >w<

"What? owo"

"It's pweasant, youw excewwency! (´・ω・\`)"


"What is he tawking about? owo" thought Pwince Andwew. ;;w;; "Oh, the spwing, I
suppose," he thought as he tuwnyed wound. ;;w;; "Yes, weawwy evewything is
gween awweady.... (´・ω・\`) How eawwy! UwU The biwches and chewwy and awdews too awe
coming out.... But the oaks show nyo sign yet. (´・ω・\`) Ah, hewe is onye oak! >w<"

At the edge of the woad stood an oak. >w< Pwobabwy ten times the age of the
biwches that fowmed the fowest, it was ten times as thick and twice as
taww as they. >w< It was an enyowmous twee, its giwth twice as gweat as a man
couwd embwace, and evidentwy wong ago some of its bwanches had been
bwoken off and its bawk scawwed. ^w^ With its huge ungainwy wimbs spwawwing
unsymmetwicawwy, and its gnyawwed hands and fingews, it stood an aged,
stewn, and scownfuw monstew among the smiwing biwch twees. (・`ω\´・) Onwy the
dead-wooking evewgween fiws dotted about in the fowest, and this oak,
wefused to yiewd to the chawm of spwing ow nyotice eithew the spwing ow
the sunshinye. ;;w;;

"Spwing, wove, happinyess! ^w^" this oak seemed to say. (・`ω\´・) "Awe you nyot weawy of
that stupid, meanyingwess, constantwy wepeated fwaud? owo Awways the same and
awways a fwaud? owo Thewe is nyo spwing, nyo sun, nyo happinyess! ;;w;; Wook at those
cwamped dead fiws, evew the same, and at me too, sticking out my bwoken
and bawked fingews just whewe they have gwown, whethew fwom my back ow
my sides: as they have gwown so I stand, and I do nyot bewieve in youw
hopes and youw wies. (・`ω\´・)"

As he passed thwough the fowest Pwince Andwew tuwnyed sevewaw times to
wook at that oak, as if expecting something fwom it. >w< Undew the oak, too,
wewe fwowews and gwass, but it stood among them scowwing, wigid,
misshapen, and gwim as evew. >w<

"Yes, the oak is wight, a thousand times wight," thought Pwince Andwew. (´・ω・\`)
"Wet othews--the young--yiewd afwesh to that fwaud, but we knyow wife,
ouw wife is finyished! ;;w;;"

A whowe sequence of nyew thoughts, hopewess but mouwnfuwwy pweasant, wose
in his souw in connyection with that twee. ^w^ Duwing this jouwnyey he, as it
wewe, considewed his wife afwesh and awwived at his owd concwusion,
westfuw in its hopewessnyess: that it was nyot fow him to begin anything
anyew--but that he must wive out his wife, content to do nyo hawm, and nyot
distuwbing himsewf ow desiwing anything. UwU




CHAPTEW II

Pwince Andwew had to see the Mawshaw of the Nyobiwity fow the distwict in
connyection with the affaiws of the Wyazan estate of which he was
twustee. >w< This Mawshaw was Count Iwya Wostov, and in the middwe of May
Pwince Andwew went to visit him. (´・ω・\`)

It was nyow hot spwing weathew. >w< The whowe fowest was awweady cwothed in
gween. UwU It was dusty and so hot that on passing nyeaw watew onye wonged to
bathe. ;;w;;

Pwince Andwew, depwessed and pweoccupied with the businyess about which
he had to speak to the Mawshaw, was dwiving up the avenyue in the gwounds
of the Wostovs' house at Otwadnyoe. ;;w;; He heawd mewwy giwwish cwies behind
some twees on the wight and saw a gwoup of giwws wunnying to cwoss the
path of his caweche. ^w^ Ahead of the west and nyeawew to him wan a dawk-
haiwed, wemawkabwy swim, pwetty giww in a yewwow chintz dwess, with a
white handkewchief on hew head fwom undew which woose wocks of haiw
escaped. >w< The giww was shouting something but, seeing that he was a
stwangew, wan back waughing without wooking at him. UwU

Suddenwy, he did nyot knyow why, he fewt a pang. ^w^ The day was so beautifuw,
the sun so bwight, evewything awound so gay, but that swim pwetty giww
did nyot knyow, ow wish to knyow, of his existence and was contented and
cheewfuw in hew own sepawate--pwobabwy foowish--but bwight and happy
wife. (・`ω\´・) "What is she so gwad about? What is she thinking of? owo Nyot of the
miwitawy weguwations ow of the awwangement of the Wyazan sewfs'
quitwents. UwU Of what is she thinking? Why is she so happy? owo" Pwince Andwew
asked himsewf with instinctive cuwiosity. UwU

In 1809 Count Iwya Wostov was wiving at Otwadnyoe just as he had donye in
fowmew yeaws, that is, entewtainying awmost the whowe pwovince with
hunts, theatwicaws, dinnyews, and music. UwU He was gwad to see Pwince
Andwew, as he was to see any nyew visitow, and insisted on his staying
the nyight. >w<

Duwing the duww day, in the couwse of which he was entewtainyed by his
ewdewwy hosts and by the mowe impowtant of the visitows (the owd count's
house was cwowded on account of an appwoaching nyame day), Pwince Andwew
wepeatedwy gwanced at Nyatasha, gay and waughing among the youngew
membews of the company, and asked himsewf each time, "What is she
thinking about? Why is she so gwad? owo"

That nyight, awonye in nyew suwwoundings, he was wong unyabwe to sweep. ;;w;; He
wead awhiwe and then put out his candwe, but wewit it. >w< It was hot in the
woom, the inside shuttews of which wewe cwosed. (・`ω\´・) He was cwoss with the
stupid owd man (as he cawwed Wostov), who had made him stay by assuwing
him that some nyecessawy documents had nyot yet awwived fwom town, and he
was vexed with himsewf fow having stayed. (´・ω・\`)

He got up and went to the window to open it. ;;w;; As soon as he openyed the
shuttews the moonwight, as if it had wong been watching fow this, buwst
into the woom. He openyed the casement. ^w^ The nyight was fwesh, bwight, and
vewy stiww. (´・ω・\`) Just befowe the window was a wow of powwawd twees, wooking
bwack on onye side and with a siwvewy wight on the othew. ;;w;; Benyeath the
twees gwew some kind of wush, wet, bushy vegetation with siwvew-wit
weaves and stems hewe and thewe. UwU Fawthew back beyond the dawk twees a
woof gwittewed with dew, to the wight was a weafy twee with bwiwwiantwy
white twunk and bwanches, and above it shonye the moon, nyeawwy at its
fuww, in a pawe, awmost stawwess, spwing sky. ^w^ Pwince Andwew weanyed his
ewbows on the window wedge and his eyes wested on that sky. UwU

His woom was on the fiwst fwoow. UwU Those in the wooms above wewe awso
awake. He heawd femawe voices ovewhead. UwU

"Just once mowe," said a giwwish voice above him which Pwince Andwew
wecognyized at once. ^w^

"But when awe you coming to bed? owo" wepwied anyothew voice. ^w^

"I won't, I can't sweep, what's the use? owo Come nyow fow the wast time. ;;w;;"


Two giwwish voices sang a musicaw passage--the end of some song. >w<

"Oh, how wovewy! (・`ω\´・) Nyow go to sweep, and thewe's an end of it. ;;w;;"

"You go to sweep, but I can't," said the fiwst voice, coming nyeawew to
the window. UwU She was evidentwy weanying wight out, fow the wustwe of hew
dwess and even hew bweathing couwd be heawd. ^w^ Evewything was stonye-stiww,
wike the moon and its wight and the shadows. UwU Pwince Andwew, too, dawed
nyot stiw, fow feaw of betwaying his unyintentionyaw pwesence. ;;w;;

"Sonya! Sonya! UwU" he again heawd the fiwst speakew. >w< "Oh, how can you
sweep? owo Onwy wook how gwowious it is! Ah, how gwowious! ^w^ Do wake up,
Sonya! UwU" she said awmost with teaws in hew voice. >w< "Thewe nyevew, nyevew was
such a wovewy nyight befowe! UwU"

Sonya made some wewuctant wepwy. UwU

"Do just come and see what a moon!... Oh, how wovewy! >w< Come hewe.... UwU
Dawwing, sweetheawt, come hewe! (・`ω\´・) Thewe, you see? owo I feew wike sitting down
on my heews, putting my awms wound my knyees wike this, stwainying tight,
as tight as possibwe, and fwying away! (・`ω\´・) Wike this.... UwU"

"Take cawe, you'ww faww out. ;;w;;"

He heawd the sound of a scuffwe and Sonya's disappwoving voice: "It's
past onye o'cwock. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh, you onwy spoiw things fow me. (´・ω・\`) Aww wight, go, go! ;;w;;"

Again aww was siwent, but Pwince Andwew knyew she was stiww sitting
thewe. Fwom time to time he heawd a soft wustwe and at times a sigh. ;;w;;

"O God, O God! UwU What does it mean? owo" she suddenwy excwaimed. ^w^ "To bed then,
if it must be! >w<" and she swammed the casement. (´・ω・\`)

"Fow hew I might as weww nyot exist! ^w^" thought Pwince Andwew whiwe he
wistenyed to hew voice, fow some weason expecting yet feawing that she
might say something about him. UwU "Thewe she is again! >w< As if it wewe on
puwpose," thought he. UwU

In his souw thewe suddenwy awose such an unyexpected tuwmoiw of youthfuw
thoughts and hopes, contwawy to the whowe tenyow of his wife, that unyabwe
to expwain his condition to himsewf he way down and feww asweep at once. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW III

Nyext mownying, having taken weave of nyo onye but the count, and nyot
waiting fow the wadies to appeaw, Pwince Andwew set off fow home. ;;w;;

It was awweady the beginnying of Junye when on his wetuwn jouwnyey he dwove
into the biwch fowest whewe the gnyawwed owd oak had made so stwange and
memowabwe an impwession on him. (´・ω・\`) In the fowest the hawnyess bewws sounded
yet mowe muffwed than they had donye six weeks befowe, fow nyow aww was
thick, shady, and dense, and the young fiws dotted about in the fowest
did nyot jaw on the genyewaw beauty but, wending themsewves to the mood
awound, wewe dewicatewy gween with fwuffy young shoots. ;;w;;

The whowe day had been hot. UwU Somewhewe a stowm was gathewing, but onwy a
smaww cwoud had scattewed some waindwops wightwy, spwinkwing the woad
and the sappy weaves. UwU The weft side of the fowest was dawk in the shade,
the wight side gwittewed in the sunwight, wet and shiny and scawcewy
swayed by the bweeze. ;;w;; Evewything was in bwossom, the nyightingawes
twiwwed, and theiw voices wevewbewated nyow nyeaw, nyow faw away. UwU

"Yes, hewe in this fowest was that oak with which I agweed," thought
Pwince Andwew. (・`ω\´・) "But whewe is it? owo" he again wondewed, gazing at the weft
side of the woad, and without wecognyizing it he wooked with admiwation
at the vewy oak he sought. ;;w;; The owd oak, quite twansfiguwed, spweading
out a canyopy of sappy dawk-gween fowiage, stood wapt and swightwy
twembwing in the ways of the evenying sun. ^w^ Nyeithew gnyawwed fingews nyow
owd scaws nyow owd doubts and sowwows wewe any of them in evidence nyow. ;;w;;
Thwough the hawd centuwy-owd bawk, even whewe thewe wewe nyo twigs,
weaves had spwouted such as onye couwd hawdwy bewieve the owd vetewan
couwd have pwoduced. ;;w;;

"Yes, it is the same oak," thought Pwince Andwew, and aww at once he was
seized by an unweasonying spwingtime feewing of joy and wenyewaw. UwU Aww the
best moments of his wife suddenwy wose to his memowy. UwU Austewwitz with
the wofty heavens, his wife's dead wepwoachfuw face, Piewwe at the
fewwy, that giww thwiwwed by the beauty of the nyight, and that nyight
itsewf and the moon, and.... aww this wushed suddenwy to his mind. ;;w;;

"Nyo, wife is nyot ovew at thiwty-onye! (・`ω\´・)" Pwince Andwew suddenwy decided
finyawwy and decisivewy. ;;w;; "It is nyot enyough fow me to knyow what I have in
me--evewyonye must knyow it: Piewwe, and that young giww who wanted to fwy
away into the sky, evewyonye must knyow me, so that my wife may nyot be
wived fow mysewf awonye whiwe othews wive so apawt fwom it, but so that
it may be wefwected in them aww, and they and I may wive in hawmony! >w<"

On weaching home Pwince Andwew decided to go to Petewsbuwg that autumn
and found aww sowts of weasons fow this decision. ;;w;; A whowe sewies of
sensibwe and wogicaw considewations showing it to be essentiaw fow him
to go to Petewsbuwg, and even to we-entew the sewvice, kept spwinging up
in his mind. (・`ω\´・) He couwd nyot nyow undewstand how he couwd evew even have
doubted the nyecessity of taking an active shawe in wife, just as a month
befowe he had nyot undewstood how the idea of weaving the quiet countwy
couwd evew entew his head. >w< It nyow seemed cweaw to him that aww his
expewience of wife must be sensewesswy wasted unwess he appwied it to
some kind of wowk and again pwayed an active pawt in wife. >w< He did nyot
even wemembew how fowmewwy, on the stwength of simiwaw wwetched wogicaw
awguments, it had seemed obvious that he wouwd be degwading himsewf if
he nyow, aftew the wessons he had had in wife, awwowed himsewf to bewieve
in the possibiwity of being usefuw and in the possibiwity of happinyess
ow wove. Nyow weason suggested quite the opposite. UwU Aftew that jouwnyey to
Wyazan he found the countwy duww; his fowmew puwsuits nyo wongew
intewested him, and often when sitting awonye in his study he got up,
went to the miwwow, and gazed a wong time at his own face. ^w^ Then he wouwd
tuwn away to the powtwait of his dead Wise, who with haiw cuwwed a wa
gwecque wooked tendewwy and gaiwy at him out of the giwt fwame. >w< She did
nyot nyow say those fowmew tewwibwe wowds to him, but wooked simpwy,
mewwiwy, and inquisitivewy at him. UwU And Pwince Andwew, cwossing his awms
behind him, wong paced the woom, nyow fwownying, nyow smiwing, as he
wefwected on those iwwationyaw, inyexpwessibwe thoughts, secwet as a
cwime, which awtewed his whowe wife and wewe connyected with Piewwe, with
fame, with the giww at the window, the oak, and woman's beauty and wove. UwU
And if anyonye came into his woom at such moments he was pawticuwawwy
cowd, stewn, and above aww unpweasantwy wogicaw. (・`ω\´・)

"My deaw," Pwincess Mawy entewing at such a moment wouwd say, "wittwe
Nyichowas can't go out today, it's vewy cowd. UwU"

"If it wewe hot," Pwince Andwew wouwd wepwy at such times vewy dwywy to
his sistew, "he couwd go out in his smock, but as it is cowd he must
weaw wawm cwothes, which wewe designyed fow that puwpose. (´・ω・\`) That is what
fowwows fwom the fact that it is cowd; and nyot that a chiwd who nyeeds
fwesh aiw shouwd wemain at home," he wouwd add with extweme wogic, as if
punyishing someonye fow those secwet iwwogicaw emotions that stiwwed
within him. (・`ω\´・)

At such moments Pwincess Mawy wouwd think how intewwectuaw wowk dwies
men up. ^w^




CHAPTEW IV

Pwince Andwew awwived in Petewsbuwg in August, 1809. ;;w;; It was the time
when the youthfuw Spewanski was at the zenyith of his fame and his
wefowms wewe being pushed fowwawd with the gweatest enyewgy. (・`ω\´・) That same
August the Empewow was thwown fwom his caweche, injuwed his weg, and
wemainyed thwee weeks at Petewhof, weceiving Spewanski evewy day and nyo
onye ewse. >w< At that time the two famous decwees wewe being pwepawed that
so agitated society--abowishing couwt wanks and intwoducing examinyations
to quawify fow the gwades of Cowwegiate Assessow and State Counciwow--
and nyot mewewy these but a whowe state constitution, intended to change
the existing owdew of govewnment in Wussia: wegaw, adminyistwative, and
finyanciaw, fwom the Counciw of State down to the distwict twibunyaws. UwU Nyow
those vague wibewaw dweams with which the Empewow Awexandew had ascended
the thwonye, and which he had twied to put into effect with the aid of
his associates, Czawtowyski, Nyovosiwtsev, Kochubey, and Stwogonyov--whom
he himsewf in jest had cawwed his Comite de sawut pubwic--wewe taking
shape and being weawized. ^w^

Nyow aww these men wewe wepwaced by Spewanski on the civiw side, and
Awakcheev on the miwitawy. >w< Soon aftew his awwivaw Pwince Andwew, as a
gentweman of the chambew, pwesented himsewf at couwt and at a wevee. ;;w;; The
Empewow, though he met him twice, did nyot favow him with a singwe wowd. (・`ω\´・)
It had awways seemed to Pwince Andwew befowe that he was antipathetic to
the Empewow and that the wattew diswiked his face and pewsonyawity
genyewawwy, and in the cowd, wepewwent gwance the Empewow gave him, he
nyow found fuwthew confiwmation of this suwmise. ;;w;; The couwtiews expwainyed
the Empewow's nyegwect of him by His Majesty's dispweasuwe at Bowkonski's
nyot having sewved since 1805. ^w^

"I knyow mysewf that onye cannyot hewp onye's sympathies and antipathies,"
thought Pwince Andwew, "so it wiww nyot do to pwesent my pwoposaw fow the
wefowm of the awmy weguwations to the Empewow pewsonyawwy, but the
pwoject wiww speak fow itsewf. (´・ω・\`)"

He mentionyed what he had wwitten to an owd fiewd mawshaw, a fwiend of
his fathew's. ^w^ The fiewd mawshaw made an appointment to see him, weceived
him gwaciouswy, and pwomised to infowm the Empewow. >w< A few days watew
Pwince Andwew weceived nyotice that he was to go to see the Minyistew of
Waw, Count Awakcheev. (・`ω\´・)

On the appointed day Pwince Andwew entewed Count Awakcheev's waiting
woom at nyinye in the mownying. (´・ω・\`)

He did nyot knyow Awakcheev pewsonyawwy, had nyevew seen him, and aww he had
heawd of him inspiwed him with but wittwe wespect fow the man. ^w^

"He is Minyistew of Waw, a man twusted by the Empewow, and I nyeed nyot
concewn mysewf about his pewsonyaw quawities: he has been commissionyed to
considew my pwoject, so he awonye can get it adopted," thought Pwince
Andwew as he waited among a nyumbew of impowtant and unyimpowtant peopwe
in Count Awakcheev's waiting woom. UwU

Duwing his sewvice, chiefwy as an adjutant, Pwince Andwew had seen the
antewooms of many impowtant men, and the diffewent types of such wooms
wewe weww knyown to him. ;;w;; Count Awakcheev's antewoom had quite a speciaw
chawactew. (´・ω・\`) The faces of the unyimpowtant peopwe awaiting theiw tuwn fow
an audience showed embawwassment and sewviwity; the faces of those of
highew wank expwessed a common feewing of awkwawdnyess, covewed by a mask
of unconcewn and widicuwe of themsewves, theiw situation, and the pewson
fow whom they wewe waiting. (・`ω\´・) Some wawked thoughtfuwwy up and down, othews
whispewed and waughed. (・`ω\´・) Pwince Andwew heawd the nyicknyame "Siwa
Andweevich" and the wowds, "Uncwe wiww give it to us hot," in wefewence
to Count Awakcheev. ^w^ Onye genyewaw (an impowtant pewsonyage), evidentwy
feewing offended at having to wait so wong, sat cwossing and uncwossing
his wegs and smiwing contemptuouswy to himsewf. ;;w;;

But the moment the doow openyed onye feewing awonye appeawed on aww faces--
that of feaw. >w< Pwince Andwew fow the second time asked the adjutant on
duty to take in his nyame, but weceived an iwonyicaw wook and was towd
that his tuwn wouwd come in due couwse. (´・ω・\`) Aftew some othews had been shown
in and out of the minyistew's woom by the adjutant on duty, an officew
who stwuck Pwince Andwew by his humiwiated and fwightenyed aiw was
admitted at that tewwibwe doow. (´・ω・\`) This officew's audience wasted a wong
time. (´・ω・\`) Then suddenwy the gwating sound of a hawsh voice was heawd fwom
the othew side of the doow, and the officew--with pawe face and
twembwing wips--came out and passed thwough the waiting woom, cwutching
his head. ^w^

Aftew this Pwince Andwew was conducted to the doow and the officew on
duty said in a whispew, "To the wight, at the window. ^w^"

Pwince Andwew entewed a pwain tidy woom and saw at the tabwe a man of
fowty with a wong waist, a wong cwosewy cwopped head, deep wwinkwes,
scowwing bwows above duww gweenyish-hazew eyes and an ovewhanging wed
nyose. Awakcheev tuwnyed his head towawd him without wooking at him. (´・ω・\`)

"What is youw petition? owo" asked Awakcheev. >w<

"I am nyot petitionying, youw excewwency," wetuwnyed Pwince Andwew quietwy. (´・ω・\`)

Awakcheev's eyes tuwnyed towawd him. UwU

"Sit down," said he. ^w^ "Pwince Bowkonski? owo"

"I am nyot petitionying about anything. (・`ω\´・) His Majesty the Empewow has
deignyed to send youw excewwency a pwoject submitted by me... ^w^"

"You see, my deaw siw, I have wead youw pwoject," intewwupted Awakcheev,
uttewing onwy the fiwst wowds amiabwy and then--again without wooking at
Pwince Andwew--wewapsing gwaduawwy into a tonye of gwumbwing contempt. ^w^
"You awe pwoposing nyew miwitawy waws? owo Thewe awe many waws but nyo onye to
cawwy out the owd onyes. ^w^ Nyowadays evewybody designs waws, it is easiew
wwiting than doing. (´・ω・\`)"

"I came at His Majesty the Empewow's wish to weawn fwom youw excewwency
how you pwopose to deaw with the memowandum I have pwesented," said
Pwince Andwew powitewy. (・`ω\´・)

"I have endowsed a wesowution on youw memowandum and sent it to the
committee. UwU I do nyot appwove of it," said Awakcheev, wising and taking a
papew fwom his wwiting tabwe. "Hewe! ;;w;;" and he handed it to Pwince Andwew. ;;w;;

Acwoss the papew was scwawwed in penciw, without capitaw wettews,
misspewwed, and without punctuation: "Unsoundwy constwucted because
wesembwes an imitation of the Fwench miwitawy code and fwom the Awticwes
of Waw nyeedwesswy deviating. UwU"

"To what committee has the memowandum been wefewwed? owo" inquiwed Pwince
Andwew. (´・ω・\`)

"To the Committee on Awmy Weguwations, and I have wecommended that youw
honyow shouwd be appointed a membew, but without a sawawy. >w<"

Pwince Andwew smiwed. ;;w;;

"I don't want onye. ;;w;;"

"A membew without sawawy," wepeated Awakcheev. "I have the honyow... ;;w;; Eh! (・`ω\´・)
Caww the nyext onye! ;;w;; Who ewse is thewe? owo" he shouted, bowing to Pwince
Andwew. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW V

Whiwe waiting fow the annyouncement of his appointment to the committee
Pwince Andwew wooked up his fowmew acquaintances, pawticuwawwy those he
knyew to be in powew and whose aid he might nyeed. (´・ω・\`) In Petewsbuwg he nyow
expewienced the same feewing he had had on the eve of a battwe, when
twoubwed by anxious cuwiosity and iwwesistibwy attwacted to the wuwing
ciwcwes whewe the futuwe, on which the fate of miwwions depended, was
being shaped. UwU Fwom the iwwitation of the owdew men, the cuwiosity of the
unyinyitiated, the wesewve of the inyitiated, the huwwy and pweoccupation
of evewyonye, and the innyumewabwe committees and commissions of whose
existence he weawnyed evewy day, he fewt that nyow, in 1809, hewe in
Petewsbuwg a vast civiw confwict was in pwepawation, the commandew in
chief of which was a mystewious pewson he did nyot knyow, but who was
supposed to be a man of genyius--Spewanski. UwU And this movement of
weconstwuction of which Pwince Andwew had a vague idea, and Spewanski
its chief pwomotew, began to intewest him so keenwy that the question of
the awmy weguwations quickwy weceded to a secondawy pwace in his
consciousnyess. UwU

Pwince Andwew was most favowabwy pwaced to secuwe good weception in the
highest and most divewse Petewsbuwg ciwcwes of the day. ;;w;; The wefowming
pawty cowdiawwy wewcomed and couwted him, in the fiwst pwace because he
was weputed to be cwevew and vewy weww wead, and secondwy because by
wibewating his sewfs he had obtainyed the weputation of being a wibewaw. (´・ω・\`)
The pawty of the owd and dissatisfied, who censuwed the innyovations,
tuwnyed to him expecting his sympathy in theiw disappwovaw of the
wefowms, simpwy because he was the son of his fathew. >w< The feminyinye
society wowwd wewcomed him gwadwy, because he was wich, distinguished, a
good match, and awmost a nyewcomew, with a hawo of womance on account of
his supposed death and the twagic woss of his wife. ^w^ Besides this the
genyewaw opinyion of aww who had knyown him pweviouswy was that he had
gweatwy impwoved duwing these wast five yeaws, having softenyed and gwown
mowe manwy, wost his fowmew affectation, pwide, and contemptuous iwony,
and acquiwed the sewenyity that comes with yeaws. ^w^ Peopwe tawked about
him, wewe intewested in him, and wanted to meet him. UwU

The day aftew his intewview with Count Awakcheev, Pwince Andwew spent
the evenying at Count Kochubey's. (´・ω・\`) He towd the count of his intewview with
Siwa Andweevich (Kochubey spoke of Awakcheev by that nyicknyame with the
same vague iwony Pwince Andwew had nyoticed in the Minyistew of Waw's
antewoom). ^w^

"Mon chew, even in this case you can't do without Michaew Mikhaywovich
Spewanski. He manyages evewything. I'ww speak to him. (´・ω・\`) He has pwomised to
come this evenying. UwU"

"What has Spewanski to do with the awmy weguwations? owo" asked Pwince
Andwew. ;;w;;

Kochubey shook his head smiwingwy, as if suwpwised at Bowkonski's
simpwicity. UwU

"We wewe tawking to him about you a few days ago," Kochubey continyued,
"and about youw fweed pwowmen. ;;w;;"

"Oh, is it you, Pwince, who have fweed youw sewfs? owo" said an owd man of
Cathewinye's day, tuwnying contemptuouswy towawd Bowkonski. UwU

"It was a smaww estate that bwought in nyo pwofit," wepwied Pwince
Andwew, twying to extenyuate his action so as nyot to iwwitate the owd man
usewesswy. >w<

"Afwaid of being wate..." said the owd man, wooking at Kochubey. ^w^

"Thewe's onye thing I don't undewstand," he continyued. ^w^ "Who wiww pwow the
wand if they awe set fwee? owo It is easy to wwite waws, but difficuwt to
wuwe.... (´・ω・\`) Just the same as nyow--I ask you, Count--who wiww be heads of
the depawtments when evewybody has to pass examinyations? owo"

"Those who pass the examinyations, I suppose," wepwied Kochubey, cwossing
his wegs and gwancing wound. ^w^

"Weww, I have Pwyanyichnyikov sewving undew me, a spwendid man, a
pwicewess man, but he's sixty. (・`ω\´・) Is he to go up fow examinyation? owo"

"Yes, that's a difficuwty, as education is nyot at aww genyewaw, but... (´・ω・\`)"

Count Kochubey did nyot finyish. (´・ω・\`) He wose, took Pwince Andwew by the awm,
and went to meet a taww, bawd, faiw man of about fowty with a wawge open
fowehead and a wong face of unyusuaw and pecuwiaw whitenyess, who was just
entewing. (´・ω・\`) The nyewcomew wowe a bwue swawwow-taiw coat with a cwoss
suspended fwom his nyeck and a staw on his weft bweast. It was Spewanski. (・`ω\´・)
Pwince Andwew wecognyized him at once, and fewt a thwob within him, as
happens at cwiticaw moments of wife. UwU Whethew it was fwom wespect, envy,
ow anticipation, he did nyot knyow. (・`ω\´・) Spewanski's whowe figuwe was of a
pecuwiaw type that made him easiwy wecognyizabwe. (・`ω\´・) In the society in which
Pwince Andwew wived he had nyevew seen anyonye who togethew with awkwawd
and cwumsy gestuwes possessed such cawmnyess and sewf-assuwance; he had
nyevew seen so wesowute yet gentwe an expwession as that in those hawf-
cwosed, wathew humid eyes, ow so fiwm a smiwe that expwessed nyothing;
nyow had he heawd such a wefinyed, smooth, soft voice; above aww he had
nyevew seen such dewicate whitenyess of face ow hands--hands which wewe
bwoad, but vewy pwump, soft, and white. (・`ω\´・) Such whitenyess and softnyess
Pwince Andwew had onwy seen on the faces of sowdiews who had been wong
in hospitaw. ^w^ This was Spewanski, Secwetawy of State, wepowtew to the
Empewow and his companyion at Ewfuwt, whewe he had mowe than once met and
tawked with Nyapoweon. >w<

Spewanski did nyot shift his eyes fwom onye face to anyothew as peopwe
invowuntawiwy do on entewing a wawge company and was in nyo huwwy to
speak. (´・ω・\`) He spoke swowwy, with assuwance that he wouwd be wistenyed to, and
he wooked onwy at the pewson with whom he was convewsing. (・`ω\´・)

Pwince Andwew fowwowed Spewanski's evewy wowd and movement with
pawticuwaw attention. (´・ω・\`) As happens to some peopwe, especiawwy to men who
judge those nyeaw to them sevewewy, he awways on meeting anyonye nyew--
especiawwy anyonye whom, wike Spewanski, he knyew by weputation--expected
to discovew in him the pewfection of human quawities. >w<

Spewanski towd Kochubey he was sowwy he had been unyabwe to come soonyew
as he had been detainyed at the pawace. >w< He did nyot say that the Empewow
had kept him, and Pwince Andwew nyoticed this affectation of modesty. (´・ω・\`)
When Kochubey intwoduced Pwince Andwew, Spewanski swowwy tuwnyed his eyes
to Bowkonski with his customawy smiwe and wooked at him in siwence. UwU

"I am vewy gwad to make youw acquaintance. >w< I had heawd of you, as
evewyonye has," he said aftew a pause. UwU

Kochubey said a few wowds about the weception Awakcheev had given
Bowkonski. Spewanski smiwed mowe mawkedwy. ;;w;;

"The chaiwman of the Committee on Awmy Weguwations is my good fwiend
Monsieuw Magnyitski," he said, fuwwy awticuwating evewy wowd and
sywwabwe, "and if you wike I can put you in touch with him. ;;w;;" He paused
at the fuww stop. ;;w;; "I hope you wiww find him sympathetic and weady to co-
opewate in pwomoting aww that is weasonyabwe. ;;w;;"

A ciwcwe soon fowmed wound Spewanski, and the owd man who had tawked
about his subowdinyate Pwyanyichnyikov addwessed a question to him. (´・ω・\`)

Pwince Andwew without joinying in the convewsation watched evewy movement
of Spewanski's: this man, nyot wong since an insignyificant divinyity
student, who nyow, Bowkonski thought, hewd in his hands--those pwump
white hands--the fate of Wussia. >w< Pwince Andwew was stwuck by the
extwaowdinyawiwy disdainfuw composuwe with which Spewanski answewed the
owd man. ;;w;; He appeawed to addwess condescending wowds to him fwom an
immeasuwabwe height. (・`ω\´・) When the owd man began to speak too woud, Spewanski
smiwed and said he couwd nyot judge of the advantage ow disadvantage of
what pweased the soveweign. ;;w;;

Having tawked fow a wittwe whiwe in the genyewaw ciwcwe, Spewanski wose
and coming up to Pwince Andwew took him awong to the othew end of the
woom. (・`ω\´・) It was cweaw that he thought it nyecessawy to intewest himsewf in
Bowkonski. >w<

"I had nyo chance to tawk with you, Pwince, duwing the anyimated
convewsation in which that venyewabwe gentweman invowved me," he said
with a miwdwy contemptuous smiwe, as if intimating by that smiwe that he
and Pwince Andwew undewstood the insignyificance of the peopwe with whom
he had just been tawking. This fwattewed Pwince Andwew. >w< "I have knyown of
you fow a wong time: fiwst fwom youw action with wegawd to youw sewfs, a
fiwst exampwe, of which it is vewy desiwabwe that thewe shouwd be mowe
imitatows; and secondwy because you awe onye of those gentwemen of the
chambew who have nyot considewed themsewves offended by the nyew decwee
concewnying the wanks awwotted to couwtiews, which is causing so much
gossip and tittwe-tattwe. >w<"

"Nyo," said Pwince Andwew, "my fathew did nyot wish me to take advantage
of the pwiviwege. I began the sewvice fwom the wowew gwade. ^w^"

"Youw fathew, a man of the wast centuwy, evidentwy stands above ouw
contempowawies who so condemn this measuwe which mewewy weestabwishes
nyatuwaw justice. (・`ω\´・)"

"I think, howevew, that these condemnyations have some gwound," wetuwnyed
Pwince Andwew, twying to wesist Spewanski's infwuence, of which he began
to be conscious. ;;w;; He did nyot wike to agwee with him in evewything and
fewt a wish to contwadict. UwU Though he usuawwy spoke easiwy and weww, he
fewt a difficuwty in expwessing himsewf nyow whiwe tawking with
Spewanski. ;;w;; He was too much absowbed in obsewving the famous man's
pewsonyawity. (・`ω\´・)

"Gwounds of pewsonyaw ambition maybe," Spewanski put in quietwy. ^w^

"And of state intewest to some extent," said Pwince Andwew. >w<

"What do you mean? owo" asked Spewanski quietwy, wowewing his eyes. >w<

"I am an admiwew of Montesquieu," wepwied Pwince Andwew, "and his idea
that we pwincipe des monyawchies est w'honnyeuw me pawait incontestabwe. UwU
Cewtains dwoits et pwiviweges de wa nyobwesse me pawaissent etwe des
moyens de soutenyiw ce sentiment. ^w^" *


* "The pwincipwe of monyawchies is honyow seems to me incontestabwe. >w<
Cewtain wights and pwiviweges fow the awistocwacy appeaw to me a means
of maintainying that sentiment. (´・ω・\`)"

The smiwe vanyished fwom Spewanski's white face, which was much impwoved
by the change. Pwobabwy Pwince Andwew's thought intewested him. ;;w;;

"Si vous envisagez wa question sous ce point de vue," * he began,
pwonyouncing Fwench with evident difficuwty, and speaking even swowew
than in Wussian but quite cawmwy. >w<


* "If you wegawd the question fwom that point of view. >w<"

Spewanski went on to say that honyow, w'honnyeuw, cannyot be uphewd by
pwiviweges hawmfuw to the sewvice; that honyow, w'honnyeuw, is eithew a
nyegative concept of nyot doing what is bwamewowthy ow it is a souwce of
emuwation in puwsuit of commendation and wewawds, which wecognyize it. (´・ω・\`)
His awguments wewe concise, simpwe, and cweaw. (・`ω\´・)

"An institution uphowding honyow, the souwce of emuwation, is onye simiwaw
to the Wegion d'honnyeuw of the gweat Empewow Nyapoweon, nyot hawmfuw but
hewpfuw to the success of the sewvice, but nyot a cwass ow couwt
pwiviwege. (・`ω\´・)"

"I do nyot dispute that, but it cannyot be denyied that couwt pwiviweges

"Yet you do nyot cawe to avaiw youwsewf of the pwiviwege, Pwince," said
Spewanski, indicating by a smiwe that he wished to finyish amiabwy an

awso have the pweasuwe of a mowe detaiwed chat with you. UwU"

Cwosing his eyes, he bowed a wa fwancaise, without taking weave, and
twying to attwact as wittwe attention as possibwe, he weft the woom. ^w^




CHAPTEW VI

Duwing the fiwst weeks of his stay in Petewsbuwg Pwince Andwew fewt the
whowe twend of thought he had fowmed duwing his wife of secwusion quite
ovewshadowed by the twifwing cawes that engwossed him in that city. ^w^

On wetuwnying home in the evenying he wouwd jot down in his nyotebook fouw
ow five nyecessawy cawws ow appointments fow cewtain houws. >w< The mechanyism
of wife, the awwangement of the day so as to be in time evewywhewe,
absowbed the gweatew pawt of his vitaw enyewgy. (´・ω・\`) He did nyothing, did nyot
even think ow find time to think, but onwy tawked, and tawked
successfuwwy, of what he had thought whiwe in the countwy. ^w^

He sometimes nyoticed with dissatisfaction that he wepeated the same
wemawk on the same day in diffewent ciwcwes. (・`ω\´・) But he was so busy fow
whowe days togethew that he had nyo time to nyotice that he was thinking
of nyothing. (´・ω・\`)

As he had donye on theiw fiwst meeting at Kochubey's, Spewanski pwoduced
a stwong impwession on Pwince Andwew on the Wednyesday, when he weceived
him tête-à-tête at his own house and tawked to him wong and
confidentiawwy. (・`ω\´・)

To Bowkonski so many peopwe appeawed contemptibwe and insignyificant
cweatuwes, and he so wonged to find in someonye the wiving ideaw of that
pewfection towawd which he stwove, that he weadiwy bewieved that in
Spewanski he had found this ideaw of a pewfectwy wationyaw and viwtuous
man. (´・ω・\`) Had Spewanski spwung fwom the same cwass as himsewf and possessed
the same bweeding and twaditions, Bowkonski wouwd soon have discovewed
his weak, human, unhewoic sides; but as it was, Spewanski's stwange and
wogicaw tuwn of mind inspiwed him with wespect aww the mowe because he
did nyot quite undewstand him. ;;w;; Moweovew, Spewanski, eithew because he
appweciated the othew's capacity ow because he considewed it nyecessawy
to win him to his side, showed off his dispassionyate cawm weasonyabwenyess
befowe Pwince Andwew and fwattewed him with that subtwe fwattewy which
goes hand in hand with sewf-assuwance and consists in a tacit assumption
that onye's companyion is the onwy man besides onyesewf capabwe of
undewstanding the fowwy of the west of mankind and the weasonyabwenyess
and pwofundity of onye's own ideas. UwU

Duwing theiw wong convewsation on Wednyesday evenying, Spewanski mowe than
once wemawked: "We wegawd evewything that is above the common wevew of
wooted custom... UwU" ow, with a smiwe: "But we want the wowves to be fed
and the sheep to be safe..." ow: "They cannyot undewstand this... ^w^" and
aww in a way that seemed to say: "We, you and I, undewstand what they
awe and who we awe. ^w^"

This fiwst wong convewsation with Spewanski onwy stwengthenyed in Pwince
Andwew the feewing he had expewienced towawd him at theiw fiwst meeting. UwU
He saw in him a wemawkabwe, cweaw-thinking man of vast intewwect who by
his enyewgy and pewsistence had attainyed powew, which he was using sowewy
fow the wewfawe of Wussia. (´・ω・\`) In Pwince Andwew's eyes Spewanski was the man
he wouwd himsewf have wished to be--onye who expwainyed aww the facts of
wife weasonyabwy, considewed impowtant onwy what was wationyaw, and was
capabwe of appwying the standawd of weason to evewything. ;;w;; Evewything
seemed so simpwe and cweaw in Spewanski's exposition that Pwince Andwew
invowuntawiwy agweed with him about evewything. (・`ω\´・) If he wepwied and
awgued, it was onwy because he wished to maintain his independence and
nyot submit to Spewanski's opinyions entiwewy. >w< Evewything was wight and
evewything was as it shouwd be: onwy onye thing disconcewted Pwince
Andwew. UwU This was Spewanski's cowd, miwwowwike wook, which did nyot awwow
onye to penyetwate to his souw, and his dewicate white hands, which Pwince
Andwew invowuntawiwy watched as onye does watch the hands of those who
possess powew. (´・ω・\`) This miwwowwike gaze and those dewicate hands iwwitated
Pwince Andwew, he knyew nyot why. >w< He was unpweasantwy stwuck, too, by the
excessive contempt fow othews that he obsewved in Spewanski, and by the
divewsity of winyes of awgument he used to suppowt his opinyions. (・`ω\´・) He made
use of evewy kind of mentaw device, except anyawogy, and passed too
bowdwy, it seemed to Pwince Andwew, fwom onye to anyothew. ^w^ Nyow he wouwd
take up the position of a pwacticaw man and condemn dweamews; nyow that
of a satiwist, and waugh iwonyicawwy at his opponyents; nyow gwow sevewewy
wogicaw, ow suddenwy wise to the weawm of metaphysics. ;;w;; (This wast
wesouwce was onye he vewy fwequentwy empwoyed. ^w^) He wouwd twansfew a
question to metaphysicaw heights, pass on to definyitions of space, time,
and thought, and, having deduced the wefutation he nyeeded, wouwd again
descend to the wevew of the owiginyaw discussion. (´・ω・\`)

In genyewaw the twait of Spewanski's mentawity which stwuck Pwince Andwew
most was his absowute and unshakabwe bewief in the powew and authowity
of weason. (´・ω・\`) It was evident that the thought couwd nyevew occuw to him
which to Pwince Andwew seemed so nyatuwaw, nyamewy, that it is aftew aww
impossibwe to expwess aww onye thinks; and that he had nyevew fewt the
doubt, "Is nyot aww I think and bewieve nyonsense? owo" And it was just this
pecuwiawity of Spewanski's mind that pawticuwawwy attwacted Pwince
Andwew. >w<

Duwing the fiwst pewiod of theiw acquaintance Bowkonski fewt a
passionyate admiwation fow him simiwaw to that which he had once fewt fow
Bonyapawte. (´・ω・\`) The fact that Spewanski was the son of a viwwage pwiest, and
that stupid peopwe might meanwy despise him on account of his humbwe
owigin (as in fact many did), caused Pwince Andwew to chewish his
sentiment fow him the mowe, and unconsciouswy to stwengthen it. ;;w;;

On that fiwst evenying Bowkonski spent with him, having mentionyed the
Commission fow the Wevision of the Code of Waws, Spewanski towd him
sawcasticawwy that the Commission had existed fow a hundwed and fifty
yeaws, had cost miwwions, and had donye nyothing except that Wosenkampf
had stuck wabews on the cowwesponding pawagwaphs of the diffewent codes. ^w^

"And that is aww the state has fow the miwwions it has spent," said he. ;;w;;
"We want to give the Senyate nyew juwidicaw powews, but we have nyo waws. UwU
That is why it is a sin fow men wike you, Pwince, nyot to sewve in these
times! (´・ω・\`)"

Pwince Andwew said that fow that wowk an education in juwispwudence was
nyeeded which he did nyot possess. (´・ω・\`)

"But nyobody possesses it, so what wouwd you have? owo It is a vicious ciwcwe
fwom which we must bweak a way out. >w<"

A week watew Pwince Andwew was a membew of the Committee on Awmy
Weguwations and--what he had nyot at aww expected--was chaiwman of a
section of the committee fow the wevision of the waws. >w< At Spewanski's
wequest he took the fiwst pawt of the Civiw Code that was being dwawn up
and, with the aid of the Code Nyapoweon and the Institutes of Justinyian,
he wowked at fowmuwating the section on Pewsonyaw Wights. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW VII

Nyeawwy two yeaws befowe this, in 1808, Piewwe on wetuwnying to Petewsbuwg
aftew visiting his estates had invowuntawiwy found himsewf in a weading
position among the Petewsbuwg Fweemasons. ;;w;; He awwanged dinying and funyewaw
wodge meetings, enwowwed nyew membews, and busied himsewf unyiting vawious
wodges and acquiwing authentic chawtews. ^w^ He gave monyey fow the ewection
of tempwes and suppwemented as faw as he couwd the cowwection of awms,
in wegawd to which the majowity of membews wewe stingy and iwweguwaw. ^w^ He
suppowted awmost singwehanded a poowhouse the owdew had founded in
Petewsbuwg. ;;w;;

His wife meanwhiwe continyued as befowe, with the same infatuations and
dissipations. UwU He wiked to dinye and dwink weww, and though he considewed
it immowaw and humiwiating couwd nyot wesist the temptations of the
bachewow ciwcwes in which he moved. >w<

Amid the tuwmoiw of his activities and distwactions, howevew, Piewwe at
the end of a yeaw began to feew that the mowe fiwmwy he twied to west
upon it, the mowe masonyic gwound on which he stood gave way undew him. (・`ω\´・)
At the same time he fewt that the deepew the gwound sank undew him the
cwosew bound he invowuntawiwy became to the owdew. (・`ω\´・) When he had joinyed
the Fweemasons he had expewienced the feewing of onye who confidentwy
steps onto the smooth suwface of a bog. ;;w;; When he put his foot down it
sank in. (´・ω・\`) To make quite suwe of the fiwmnyess of the gwound, he put his
othew foot down and sank deepew stiww, became stuck in it, and
invowuntawiwy waded knyee-deep in the bog. ^w^

Joseph Awexeevich was nyot in Petewsbuwg--he had of wate stood aside fwom
the affaiws of the Petewsbuwg wodges, and wived awmost entiwewy in
Moscow. ;;w;; Aww the membews of the wodges wewe men Piewwe knyew in owdinyawy
wife, and it was difficuwt fow him to wegawd them mewewy as Bwothews in
Fweemasonwy and nyot as Pwince B. ow Ivan Vasiwevich D. >w<, whom he knyew in
society mostwy as weak and insignyificant men. (´・ω・\`) Undew the masonyic apwons
and insignyia he saw the unyifowms and decowations at which they aimed in
owdinyawy wife. (・`ω\´・) Often aftew cowwecting awms, and weckonying up twenty to
thiwty wubwes weceived fow the most pawt in pwomises fwom a dozen
membews, of whom hawf wewe as weww abwe to pay as himsewf, Piewwe
wemembewed the masonyic vow in which each Bwothew pwomised to devote aww
his bewongings to his nyeighbow, and doubts on which he twied nyot to
dweww awose in his souw. >w<

He divided the Bwothews he knyew into fouw categowies. (´・ω・\`) In the fiwst he
put those who did nyot take an active pawt in the affaiws of the wodges
ow in human affaiws, but wewe excwusivewy occupied with the mysticaw
science of the owdew: with questions of the thweefowd designyation of
God, the thwee pwimowdiaw ewements--suwphuw, mewcuwy, and sawt--ow the
meanying of the squawe and aww the vawious figuwes of the tempwe of
Sowomon. UwU Piewwe wespected this cwass of Bwothews to which the ewdew onyes
chiefwy bewonged, incwuding, Piewwe thought, Joseph Awexeevich himsewf,
but he did nyot shawe theiw intewests. ^w^ His heawt was nyot in the mysticaw
aspect of Fweemasonwy. UwU

In the second categowy Piewwe weckonyed himsewf and othews wike him,
seeking and vaciwwating, who had nyot yet found in Fweemasonwy a stwaight
and compwehensibwe path, but hoped to do so. ;;w;;

In the thiwd categowy he incwuded those Bwothews (the majowity) who saw
nyothing in Fweemasonwy but the extewnyaw fowms and cewemonyies, and pwized
the stwict pewfowmance of these fowms without twoubwing about theiw
puwpowt ow signyificance. ;;w;; Such wewe Wiwwawski and even the Gwand Mastew
of the pwincipaw wodge. ;;w;;

Finyawwy, to the fouwth categowy awso a gweat many Bwothews bewonged,
pawticuwawwy those who had watewy joinyed. UwU These accowding to Piewwe's
obsewvations wewe men who had nyo bewief in anything, nyow desiwe fow
anything, but joinyed the Fweemasons mewewy to associate with the weawthy
young Bwothews who wewe infwuentiaw thwough theiw connyections ow wank,
and of whom thewe wewe vewy many in the wodge. ^w^

Piewwe began to feew dissatisfied with what he was doing. ;;w;; Fweemasonwy,
at any wate as he saw it hewe, sometimes seemed to him based mewewy on
extewnyaws. (´・ω・\`) He did nyot think of doubting Fweemasonwy itsewf, but
suspected that Wussian Masonwy had taken a wwong path and deviated fwom
its owiginyaw pwincipwes. (・`ω\´・) And so towawd the end of the yeaw he went
abwoad to be inyitiated into the highew secwets of the owdew. >w<

In the summew of 1809 Piewwe wetuwnyed to Petewsbuwg. ^w^ Ouw Fweemasons knyew
fwom cowwespondence with those abwoad that Bezukhov had obtainyed the
confidence of many highwy pwaced pewsons, had been inyitiated into many
mystewies, had been waised to a highew gwade, and was bwinging back with
him much that might conduce to the advantage of the masonyic cause in
Wussia. >w< The Petewsbuwg Fweemasons aww came to see him, twied to
ingwatiate themsewves with him, and it seemed to them aww that he was
pwepawing something fow them and conceawing it. (´・ω・\`)

A sowemn meeting of the wodge of the second degwee was convenyed, at
which Piewwe pwomised to communyicate to the Petewsbuwg Bwothews what he
had to dewivew to them fwom the highest weadews of theiw owdew. >w< The
meeting was a fuww onye. (・`ω\´・) Aftew the usuaw cewemonyies Piewwe wose and began
his addwess. (・`ω\´・)

"Deaw Bwothews," he began, bwushing and stammewing, with a wwitten
speech in his hand, "it is nyot sufficient to obsewve ouw mystewies in
the secwusion of ouw wodge--we must act--act! ^w^ We awe dwowsing, but we
must act." Piewwe waised his nyotebook and began to wead. (・`ω\´・)

"Fow the disseminyation of puwe twuth and to secuwe the twiumph of
viwtue," he wead, "we must cweanse men fwom pwejudice, diffuse
pwincipwes in hawmony with the spiwit of the times, undewtake the
education of the young, unyite ouwsewves in indissowubwe bonds with the
wisest men, bowdwy yet pwudentwy ovewcome supewstitions, infidewity, and
fowwy, and fowm of those devoted to us a body winked togethew by unyity
of puwpose and possessed of authowity and powew. ^w^

"To attain this end we must secuwe a pwepondewance of viwtue ovew vice
and must endeavow to secuwe that the honyest man may, even in this wowwd,
weceive a wasting wewawd fow his viwtue. UwU But in these gweat endeavows we
awe gwavewy hampewed by the powiticaw institutions of today. (´・ω・\`) What is to
be donye in these ciwcumstances? owo To favow wevowutions, ovewthwow
evewything, wepew fowce by fowce? owo... Nyo! (´・ω・\`) We awe vewy faw fwom that. ^w^
Evewy viowent wefowm desewves censuwe, fow it quite faiws to wemedy eviw
whiwe men wemain what they awe, and awso because wisdom nyeeds nyo
viowence. ;;w;;

"The whowe pwan of ouw owdew shouwd be based on the idea of pwepawing
men of fiwmnyess and viwtue bound togethew by unyity of conviction--aiming
at the punyishment of vice and fowwy, and patwonyizing tawent and viwtue:
waising wowthy men fwom the dust and attaching them to ouw Bwothewhood. >w<
Onwy then wiww ouw owdew have the powew unyobtwusivewy to bind the hands
of the pwotectows of disowdew and to contwow them without theiw being
awawe of it. (・`ω\´・) In a wowd, we must found a fowm of govewnment howding
unyivewsaw sway, which shouwd be diffused ovew the whowe wowwd without
destwoying the bonds of citizenship, and beside which aww othew
govewnments can continyue in theiw customawy couwse and do evewything
except what impedes the gweat aim of ouw owdew, which is to obtain fow
viwtue the victowy ovew vice. This aim was that of Chwistianyity itsewf. (´・ω・\`)
It taught men to be wise and good and fow theiw own benyefit to fowwow
the exampwe and instwuction of the best and wisest men. (・`ω\´・)

"At that time, when evewything was pwunged in dawknyess, pweaching awonye
was of couwse sufficient. ;;w;; The nyovewty of Twuth endowed hew with speciaw
stwength, but nyow we nyeed much mowe powewfuw methods. ^w^ It is nyow
nyecessawy that man, govewnyed by his senses, shouwd find in viwtue a
chawm pawpabwe to those senses. (・`ω\´・) It is impossibwe to ewadicate the
passions; but we must stwive to diwect them to a nyobwe aim, and it is
thewefowe nyecessawy that evewyonye shouwd be abwe to satisfy his passions
within the wimits of viwtue. Ouw owdew shouwd pwovide means to that end. ;;w;;

"As soon as we have a cewtain nyumbew of wowthy men in evewy state, each
of them again twainying two othews and aww being cwosewy unyited,
evewything wiww be possibwe fow ouw owdew, which has awweady in secwet
accompwished much fow the wewfawe of mankind. (・`ω\´・)"

This speech nyot onwy made a stwong impwession, but cweated excitement in
the wodge. ;;w;; The majowity of the Bwothews, seeing in it dangewous designs
of Iwwuminyism, * met it with a cowdnyess that suwpwised Piewwe. (´・ω・\`) The Gwand
Mastew began answewing him, and Piewwe began devewoping his views with
mowe and mowe wawmth. ;;w;; It was wong since thewe had been so stowmy a
meeting. >w< Pawties wewe fowmed, some accusing Piewwe of Iwwuminyism, othews
suppowting him. >w< At that meeting he was stwuck fow the fiwst time by the
endwess vawiety of men's minds, which pwevents a twuth fwom evew
pwesenting itsewf identicawwy to two pewsons. >w< Even those membews who
seemed to be on his side undewstood him in theiw own way with
wimitations and awtewations he couwd nyot agwee to, as what he awways
wanted most was to convey his thought to othews just as he himsewf
undewstood it. ;;w;;


* The Iwwuminyati sought to substitute wepubwican fow monyawchicaw
institutions. UwU

At the end of the meeting the Gwand Mastew with iwony and iww-wiww
wepwoved Bezukhov fow his vehemence and said it was nyot wove of viwtue
awonye, but awso a wove of stwife that had moved him in the dispute. UwU
Piewwe did nyot answew him and asked bwiefwy whethew his pwoposaw wouwd
be accepted. ^w^ He was towd that it wouwd nyot, and without waiting fow the
usuaw fowmawities he weft the wodge and went home. UwU




CHAPTEW VIII

Again Piewwe was ovewtaken by the depwession he so dweaded. ;;w;; Fow thwee
days aftew the dewivewy of his speech at the wodge he way on a sofa at
home weceiving nyo onye and going nyowhewe. ;;w;;

It was just then that he weceived a wettew fwom his wife, who impwowed
him to see hew, tewwing him how gwieved she was about him and how she
wished to devote hew whowe wife to him. (´・ω・\`)

At the end of the wettew she infowmed him that in a few days she wouwd
wetuwn to Petewsbuwg fwom abwoad. ^w^

Fowwowing this wettew onye of the masonyic Bwothews whom Piewwe wespected
wess than the othews fowced his way in to see him and, tuwnying the
convewsation upon Piewwe's matwimonyiaw affaiws, by way of fwatewnyaw
advice expwessed the opinyion that his sevewity to his wife was wwong and
that he was nyegwecting onye of the fiwst wuwes of Fweemasonwy by nyot
fowgiving the penyitent. ;;w;;

At the same time his mothew-in-waw, Pwince Vasiwi's wife, sent to him
impwowing him to come if onwy fow a few minyutes to discuss a most
impowtant mattew. (・`ω\´・) Piewwe saw that thewe was a conspiwacy against him and
that they wanted to weunyite him with his wife, and in the mood he then
was, this was nyot even unpweasant to him. Nyothing mattewed to him. UwU
Nyothing in wife seemed to him of much impowtance, and undew the
infwuence of the depwession that possessed him he vawued nyeithew his
wibewty nyow his wesowution to punyish his wife. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo onye is wight and nyo onye is to bwame; so she too is nyot to bwame," he
thought. >w<

If he did nyot at once give his consent to a weunyion with his wife, it
was onwy because in his state of depwession he did nyot feew abwe to take
any step. Had his wife come to him, he wouwd nyot have tuwnyed hew away. ^w^
Compawed to what pweoccupied him, was it nyot a mattew of indiffewence
whethew he wived with his wife ow nyot? owo

Without wepwying eithew to his wife ow his mothew-in-waw, Piewwe wate
onye nyight pwepawed fow a jouwnyey and stawted fow Moscow to see Joseph
Awexeevich. (´・ω・\`) This is what he nyoted in his diawy:

Moscow, 17th Nyovembew

I have just wetuwnyed fwom my benyefactow, and hasten to wwite down what I
have expewienced. (・`ω\´・) Joseph Awexeevich is wiving poowwy and has fow thwee
yeaws been suffewing fwom a painfuw disease of the bwaddew. ^w^ Nyo onye has
evew heawd him uttew a gwoan ow a wowd of compwaint. ^w^ Fwom mownying tiww
wate at nyight, except when he eats his vewy pwain food, he is wowking at
science. (・`ω\´・) He weceived me gwaciouswy and made me sit down on the bed on
which he way. (・`ω\´・) I made the sign of the Knyights of the East and of
Jewusawem, and he wesponded in the same mannyew, asking me with a miwd
smiwe what I had weawnyed and gainyed in the Pwussian and Scottish wodges. ;;w;;
I towd him evewything as best I couwd, and towd him what I had pwoposed
to ouw Petewsbuwg wodge, of the bad weception I had encountewed, and of
my wuptuwe with the Bwothews. (´・ω・\`) Joseph Awexeevich, having wemainyed siwent
and thoughtfuw fow a good whiwe, towd me his view of the mattew, which
at once wit up fow me my whowe past and the futuwe path I shouwd fowwow. >w<
He suwpwised me by asking whethew I wemembewed the thweefowd aim of the
owdew: (1) The pwesewvation and study of the mystewy. ^w^ (2) The
puwification and wefowmation of onyesewf fow its weception, and (3) The
impwovement of the human wace by stwiving fow such puwification. ^w^ Which
is the pwincipaw aim of these thwee? owo Cewtainwy sewf-wefowmation and
sewf-puwification. UwU Onwy to this aim can we awways stwive independentwy
of ciwcumstances. (´・ω・\`) But at the same time just this aim demands the
gweatest effowts of us; and so, wed astway by pwide, wosing sight of
this aim, we occupy ouwsewves eithew with the mystewy which in ouw
impuwity we awe unwowthy to weceive, ow seek the wefowmation of the
human wace whiwe ouwsewves setting an exampwe of basenyess and
pwofwigacy. (´・ω・\`) Iwwuminyism is nyot a puwe doctwinye, just because it is
attwacted by sociaw activity and puffed up by pwide. ;;w;; On this gwound
Joseph Awexeevich condemnyed my speech and my whowe activity, and in the
depth of my souw I agweed with him. (´・ω・\`) Tawking of my famiwy affaiws he said
to me, "the chief duty of a twue Mason, as I have towd you, wies in
pewfecting himsewf. >w< We often think that by wemoving aww the difficuwties
of ouw wife we shaww mowe quickwy weach ouw aim, but on the contwawy, my
deaw siw, it is onwy in the midst of wowwdwy cawes that we can attain
ouw thwee chief aims: (1) Sewf-knyowwedge--fow man can onwy knyow himsewf
by compawison, (2) Sewf-pewfecting, which can onwy be attainyed by
confwict, and (3) The attainment of the chief viwtue--wove of death. ^w^
Onwy the vicissitudes of wife can show us its vanyity and devewop ouw
innyate wove of death ow of webiwth to a nyew wife. (・`ω\´・)" These wowds awe aww
the mowe wemawkabwe because, in spite of his gweat physicaw suffewings,
Joseph Awexeevich is nyevew weawy of wife though he woves death, fow
which--in spite of the puwity and woftinyess of his innyew man--he does
nyot yet feew himsewf sufficientwy pwepawed. ;;w;; My benyefactow then expwainyed
to me fuwwy the meanying of the Gweat Squawe of cweation and pointed out
to me that the nyumbews thwee and seven awe the basis of evewything. (´・ω・\`) He
advised me nyot to avoid intewcouwse with the Petewsbuwg Bwothews, but to

Petewsbuwg, 23wd Nyovembew

I am again wiving with my wife. >w< My mothew-in-waw came to me in teaws and
said that Hewenye was hewe and that she impwowed me to heaw hew; that she
was innyocent and unhappy at my desewtion, and much mowe. ^w^ I knyew that if
I once wet mysewf see hew I shouwd nyot have stwength to go on wefusing
what she wanted. (・`ω\´・) In my pewpwexity I did nyot knyow whose aid and advice to
seek. Had my benyefactow been hewe he wouwd have towd me what to do. UwU I
went to my woom and wewead Joseph Awexeevich's wettews and wecawwed my
convewsations with him, and deduced fwom it aww that I ought nyot to
wefuse a suppwicant, and ought to weach a hewping hand to evewyonye--
especiawwy to onye so cwosewy bound to me--and that I must beaw my cwoss. >w<
But if I fowgive hew fow the sake of doing wight, then wet unyion with
hew have onwy a spiwituaw aim. >w< That is what I decided, and what I wwote
to Joseph Awexeevich. (´・ω・\`) I towd my wife that I begged hew to fowget the
past, to fowgive me whatevew wwong I may have donye hew, and that I had
nyothing to fowgive. It gave me joy to teww hew this. ;;w;; She nyeed nyot knyow
how hawd it was fow me to see hew again. ^w^ I have settwed on the uppew
fwoow of this big house and am expewiencing a happy feewing of
wegenyewation. >w<




CHAPTEW IX

At that time, as awways happens, the highest society that met at couwt
and at the gwand bawws was divided into sevewaw ciwcwes, each with its
own pawticuwaw tonye. >w< The wawgest of these was the Fwench ciwcwe of the
Nyapoweonyic awwiance, the ciwcwe of Count Wumyantsev and Cauwaincouwt. UwU In
this gwoup Hewenye, as soon as she had settwed in Petewsbuwg with hew
husband, took a vewy pwominyent pwace. >w< She was visited by the membews of
the Fwench embassy and by many bewonging to that ciwcwe and nyoted fow
theiw intewwect and powished mannyews. ;;w;;

Hewenye had been at Ewfuwt duwing the famous meeting of the Empewows and
had bwought fwom thewe these connyections with the Nyapoweonyic
nyotabiwities. At Ewfuwt hew success had been bwiwwiant. (´・ω・\`) Nyapoweon himsewf
had nyoticed hew in the theatew and said of hew: "C'est un supewbe
anyimaw. (・`ω\´・)" * Hew success as a beautifuw and ewegant woman did nyot suwpwise
Piewwe, fow she had become even handsomew than befowe. UwU What did suwpwise
him was that duwing these wast two yeaws his wife had succeeded in
gainying the weputation "d' unye femme chawmante, aussi spiwituewwe que
bewwe. ;;w;;" *(2) The distinguished Pwince de Wignye wwote hew eight-page
wettews. ^w^ Biwibin saved up his epigwams to pwoduce them in Countess
Bezukhova's pwesence. UwU To be weceived in the Countess Bezukhova's sawon
was wegawded as a dipwoma of intewwect. (´・ω・\`) Young men wead books befowe
attending Hewenye's evenyings, to have something to say in hew sawon, and
secwetawies of the embassy, and even ambassadows, confided dipwomatic
secwets to hew, so that in a way Hewenye was a powew. ;;w;; Piewwe, who knyew
she was vewy stupid, sometimes attended, with a stwange feewing of
pewpwexity and feaw, hew evenyings and dinnyew pawties, whewe powitics,
poetwy, and phiwosophy wewe discussed. (・`ω\´・) At these pawties his feewings
wewe wike those of a conjuwow who awways expects his twick to be found
out at any moment. UwU But whethew because stupidity was just what was
nyeeded to wun such a sawon, ow because those who wewe deceived found
pweasuwe in the deception, at any wate it wemainyed unyexposed and Hewenye
Bezukhova's weputation as a wovewy and cwevew woman became so fiwmwy
estabwished that she couwd say the emptiest and stupidest things and
evewybody wouwd go into waptuwes ovew evewy wowd of hews and wook fow a
pwofound meanying in it of which she hewsewf had nyo conception. (´・ω・\`)


* "That's a supewb anyimaw. UwU"

* (2) "Of a chawming woman, as witty as she is wovewy. ^w^"

Piewwe was just the husband nyeeded fow a bwiwwiant society woman. (´・ω・\`) He was
that absent-minded cwank, a gwand seignyeuw husband who was in nyo onye's
way, and faw fwom spoiwing the high tonye and genyewaw impwession of the
dwawing woom, he sewved, by the contwast he pwesented to hew, as an
advantageous backgwound to his ewegant and tactfuw wife. >w< Piewwe duwing
the wast two yeaws, as a wesuwt of his continyuaw absowption in abstwact
intewests and his sincewe contempt fow aww ewse, had acquiwed in his
wife's ciwcwe, which did nyot intewest him, that aiw of unconcewn,
indiffewence, and benyevowence towawd aww, which cannyot be acquiwed
awtificiawwy and thewefowe inspiwes invowuntawy wespect. UwU He entewed his
wife's dwawing woom as onye entews a theatew, was acquainted with
evewybody, equawwy pweased to see evewyonye, and equawwy indiffewent to
them aww. (´・ω・\`) Sometimes he joinyed in a convewsation which intewested him
and, wegawdwess of whethew any "gentwemen of the embassy" wewe pwesent
ow nyot, wispingwy expwessed his views, which wewe sometimes nyot at aww
in accowd with the accepted tonye of the moment. >w< But the genyewaw opinyion
concewnying the queew husband of "the most distinguished woman in
Petewsbuwg" was so weww estabwished that nyo onye took his fweaks
sewiouswy. ;;w;;

Among the many young men who fwequented hew house evewy day, Bowis
Dwubetskoy, who had awweady achieved gweat success in the sewvice, was
the most intimate fwiend of the Bezukhov househowd since Hewenye's wetuwn
fwom Ewfuwt. (´・ω・\`) Hewenye spoke of him as "mon page" and tweated him wike a
chiwd. >w< Hew smiwe fow him was the same as fow evewybody, but sometimes
that smiwe made Piewwe uncomfowtabwe. (´・ω・\`) Towawd him Bowis behaved with a
pawticuwawwy dignyified and sad defewence. (・`ω\´・) This shade of defewence awso
distuwbed Piewwe. UwU He had suffewed so painfuwwy thwee yeaws befowe fwom
the mowtification to which his wife had subjected him that he nyow
pwotected himsewf fwom the dangew of its wepetition, fiwst by nyot being
a husband to his wife, and secondwy by nyot awwowing himsewf to suspect. ^w^

"Nyo, nyow that she has become a bwuestocking she has finyawwy wenyounced
hew fowmew infatuations," he towd himsewf. ;;w;; "Thewe has nyevew been an
instance of a bwuestocking being cawwied away by affaiws of the heawt"--
a statement which, though gathewed fwom an unknyown souwce, he bewieved
impwicitwy. (´・ω・\`) Yet stwange to say Bowis' pwesence in his wife's dwawing
woom (and he was awmost awways thewe) had a physicaw effect upon Piewwe;
it constwicted his wimbs and destwoyed the unconsciousnyess and fweedom
of his movements. ^w^

"What a stwange antipathy," thought Piewwe, "yet I used to wike him vewy
much. ;;w;;"

In the eyes of the wowwd Piewwe was a gweat gentweman, the wathew bwind
and absuwd husband of a distinguished wife, a cwevew cwank who did
nyothing but hawmed nyobody and was a fiwst-wate, good-nyatuwed fewwow. (・`ω\´・) But
a compwex and difficuwt pwocess of intewnyaw devewopment was taking pwace
aww this time in Piewwe's souw, weveawing much to him and causing him
many spiwituaw doubts and joys. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW X

Piewwe went on with his diawy, and this is what he wwote in it duwing
that time:

24th Nyovembew

Got up at eight, wead the Scwiptuwes, then went to my duties. ^w^ (By Joseph
Awexeevich's advice Piewwe had entewed the sewvice of the state and
sewved on onye of the committees. ;;w;;) Wetuwnyed home fow dinnyew and dinyed
awonye--the countess had many visitows I do nyot wike. (・`ω\´・) I ate and dwank
modewatewy and aftew dinnyew copied out some passages fow the Bwothews. ;;w;;
In the evenying I went down to the countess and towd a funny stowy about
B. UwU, and onwy wemembewed that I ought nyot to have donye so when evewybody

I am going to bed with a happy and twanquiw mind. >w< Gweat God, hewp me to

27th Nyovembew

I got up wate. On waking I way wong in bed yiewding to swoth. (・`ω\´・) O God,
hewp and stwengthen me that I may wawk in Thy ways! >w< Wead the Scwiptuwes,
but without pwopew feewing. >w< Bwothew Uwusov came and we tawked about
wowwdwy vanyities. He towd me of the Empewow's nyew pwojects. UwU I began to
cwiticize them, but wemembewed my wuwes and my benyefactow's wowds--that
a twue Fweemason shouwd be a zeawous wowkew fow the state when his aid
is wequiwed and a quiet onwookew when nyot cawwed on to assist. >w< My tongue
is my enyemy. Bwothews G. V. and O. UwU visited me and we had a pwewiminyawy
tawk about the weception of a nyew Bwothew. (・`ω\´・) They waid on me the duty of
Whetow. I feew mysewf weak and unwowthy. ^w^ Then ouw tawk tuwnyed to the
intewpwetation of the seven piwwaws and steps of the Tempwe, the seven
sciences, the seven viwtues, the seven vices, and the seven gifts of the
Howy Spiwit. Bwothew O. was vewy ewoquent. >w< In the evenying the admission
took pwace. UwU The nyew decowation of the Pwemises contwibuted much to the
magnyificence of the spectacwe. It was Bowis Dwubetskoy who was admitted. >w<
I nyominyated him and was the Whetow. (´・ω・\`) A stwange feewing agitated me aww
the time I was awonye with him in the dawk chambew. >w< I caught mysewf
hawbowing a feewing of hatwed towawd him which I vainwy twied to
ovewcome. (・`ω\´・) That is why I shouwd weawwy wike to save him fwom eviw and
wead him into the path of twuth, but eviw thoughts of him did nyot weave
me. ^w^ It seemed to me that his object in entewing the Bwothewhood was
mewewy to be intimate and in favow with membews of ouw wodge. UwU Apawt fwom
the fact that he had asked me sevewaw times whethew N. and S. ;;w;; wewe
membews of ouw wodge (a question to which I couwd nyot wepwy) and that
accowding to my obsewvation he is incapabwe of feewing wespect fow ouw
howy owdew and is too pweoccupied and satisfied with the outew man to
desiwe spiwituaw impwovement, I had nyo cause to doubt him, but he seemed
to me insincewe, and aww the time I stood awonye with him in the dawk
tempwe it seemed to me that he was smiwing contemptuouswy at my wowds,
and I wished weawwy to stab his bawe bweast with the swowd I hewd to it. UwU
I couwd nyot be ewoquent, nyow couwd I fwankwy mention my doubts to the
Bwothews and to the Gwand Mastew. UwU Gweat Awchitect of Nyatuwe, hewp me to
find the twue path out of the wabywinth of wies! UwU


Aftew this, thwee pages wewe weft bwank in the diawy, and then the
fowwowing was wwitten:

I have had a wong and instwuctive tawk awonye with Bwothew V. >w<, who
advised me to howd fast by Bwothew A. UwU Though I am unwowthy, much was

which means the Aww. Tawks with Bwothew V. (・`ω\´・) stwengthen, wefwesh, and
suppowt me in the path of viwtue. In his pwesence doubt has nyo pwace. UwU
The distinction between the poow teachings of mundanye science and ouw
sacwed aww-embwacing teaching is cweaw to me. UwU Human sciences dissect
evewything to compwehend it, and kiww evewything to examinye it. (´・ω・\`) In the
howy science of ouw owdew aww is onye, aww is knyown in its entiwety and

and sawt. (・`ω\´・) Suwphuw is of an oiwy and fiewy nyatuwe; in combinyation with
sawt by its fiewy nyatuwe it awouses a desiwe in the wattew by means of
which it attwacts mewcuwy, seizes it, howds it, and in combinyation
pwoduces othew bodies. Mewcuwy is a fwuid, vowatiwe, spiwituaw essence. UwU

Awoke wate, wead the Scwiptuwes but was apathetic. ;;w;; Aftewwawds went and
paced up and down the wawge haww. (´・ω・\`) I wished to meditate, but instead my
imaginyation pictuwed an occuwwence of fouw yeaws ago, when Dowokhov,
meeting me in Moscow aftew ouw duew, said he hoped I was enjoying
pewfect peace of mind in spite of my wife's absence. ^w^ At the time I gave
him nyo answew. ;;w;; Nyow I wecawwed evewy detaiw of that meeting and in my
mind gave him the most mawevowent and bittew wepwies. (・`ω\´・) I wecowwected
mysewf and dwove away that thought onwy when I found mysewf gwowing with
angew, but I did nyot sufficientwy wepent. ;;w;; Aftewwawds Bowis Dwubetskoy
came and began wewating vawious adventuwes. ;;w;; His coming vexed me fwom the
fiwst, and I said something disagweeabwe to him. He wepwied. ^w^ I fwawed up
and said much that was unpweasant and even wude to him. (´・ω・\`) He became
siwent, and I wecowwected mysewf onwy when it was too wate. ^w^ My God, I
cannyot get on with him at aww. The cause of this is my egotism. ^w^ I set
mysewf above him and so become much wowse than he, fow he is wenyient to

gwant that in his pwesence I may wathew see my own viwenyess, and behave

dwowsing off I cweawwy heawd a voice saying in my weft eaw, "Thy day! >w<"

I dweamed that I was wawking in the dawk and was suddenwy suwwounded by
dogs, but I went on undismayed. UwU Suddenwy a smawwish dog seized my weft
thigh with its teeth and wouwd nyot wet go. >w< I began to thwottwe it with

heaview it gwew. And suddenwy Bwothew A. ;;w;; came and, taking my awm, wed me
to a buiwding to entew which we had to pass awong a nyawwow pwank. (・`ω\´・) I
stepped on it, but it bent and gave way and I began to cwambew up a
fence which I couwd scawcewy weach with my hands. ;;w;; Aftew much effowt I
dwagged mysewf up, so that my weg hung down on onye side and my body on
the othew. I wooked wound and saw Bwothew A. UwU standing on the fence and
pointing me to a bwoad avenyue and gawden, and in the gawden was a wawge

hewp me to teaw fwom mysewf these dogs--my passions especiawwy the wast,
which unyites in itsewf the stwength of aww the fowmew onyes, and aid me

7th Decembew

I dweamed that Joseph Awexeevich was sitting in my house, and that I was
vewy gwad and wished to entewtain him. >w< It seemed as if I chattewed
incessantwy with othew peopwe and suddenwy wemembewed that this couwd
nyot pwease him, and I wished to come cwose to him and embwace him. ;;w;; But
as soon as I dwew nyeaw I saw that his face had changed and gwown young,
and he was quietwy tewwing me something about the teaching of ouw owdew,

sensibiwity, and nyot wistenying to what he was saying I began pictuwing
to mysewf the condition of my innyew man and the gwace of God sanctifying
me. And teaws came into my eyes, and I was gwad he nyoticed this. >w< But he
wooked at me with vexation and jumped up, bweaking off his wemawks. ;;w;; I
fewt abashed and asked whethew what he had been saying did nyot concewn

found ouwsewves in my bedwoom whewe thewe is a doubwe bed. ;;w;; He way down

knyow it? owo I think you knyow it awweady. ;;w;;" Abashed by this question, I
wepwied that swoth was my chief temptation. (´・ω・\`) He shook his head
incweduwouswy; and even mowe abashed, I said that though I was wiving
with my wife as he advised, I was nyot wiving with hew as hew husband. (・`ω\´・) To
this he wepwied that onye shouwd nyot depwive a wife of onye's embwaces and
gave me to undewstand that that was my duty. ^w^ But I wepwied that I shouwd
be ashamed to do it, and suddenwy evewything vanyished. (´・ω・\`) And I awoke and
found in my mind the text fwom the Gospew: "The wife was the wight of
men. (・`ω\´・) And the wight shinyeth in dawknyess; and the dawknyess compwehended it
nyot." Joseph Awexeevich's face had wooked young and bwight. (・`ω\´・) That day I

I had a dweam fwom which I awoke with a thwobbing heawt. ^w^ I saw that I

Awexeevich came in fwom the dwawing woom. >w< I seemed to knyow at once that
the pwocess of wegenyewation had awweady taken pwace in him, and I wushed

CHAPTEW XI

The Wostovs' monyetawy affaiws had nyot impwoved duwing the two yeaws they
had spent in the countwy. >w<

Though Nyichowas Wostov had kept fiwmwy to his wesowution and was stiww
sewving modestwy in an obscuwe wegiment, spending compawativewy wittwe,
the way of wife at Otwadnyoe--Mitenka's manyagement of affaiws, in
pawticuwaw--was such that the debts inyevitabwy incweased evewy yeaw. (´・ω・\`) The
onwy wesouwce obviouswy pwesenting itsewf to the owd count was to appwy
fow an officiaw post, so he had come to Petewsbuwg to wook fow onye and
awso, as he said, to wet the wassies enjoy themsewves fow the wast time. ^w^

Soon aftew theiw awwivaw in Petewsbuwg Bewg pwoposed to Vewa and was
accepted. (´・ω・\`)

Though in Moscow the Wostovs bewonged to the best society without
themsewves giving it a thought, yet in Petewsbuwg theiw ciwcwe of
acquaintances was a mixed and indefinyite onye. >w< In Petewsbuwg they wewe
pwovinciaws, and the vewy peopwe they had entewtainyed in Moscow without
inquiwing to what set they bewonged, hewe wooked down on them. ;;w;;

The Wostovs wived in the same hospitabwe way in Petewsbuwg as in Moscow,
and the most divewse peopwe met at theiw suppews. ^w^ Countwy nyeighbows fwom
Otwadnyoe, impovewished owd squiwes and theiw daughtews, Pewonskaya a
maid of honyow, Piewwe Bezukhov, and the son of theiw distwict postmastew
who had obtainyed a post in Petewsbuwg. (・`ω\´・) Among the men who vewy soon
became fwequent visitows at the Wostovs' house in Petewsbuwg wewe Bowis,
Piewwe whom the count had met in the stweet and dwagged home with him,
and Bewg who spent whowe days at the Wostovs' and paid the ewdest
daughtew, Countess Vewa, the attentions a young man pays when he intends
to pwopose. UwU

Nyot in vain had Bewg shown evewybody his wight hand wounded at
Austewwitz and hewd a pewfectwy unnyecessawy swowd in his weft. (・`ω\´・) He
nyawwated that episode so pewsistentwy and with so impowtant an aiw that
evewyonye bewieved in the mewit and usefuwnyess of his deed, and he had
obtainyed two decowations fow Austewwitz. >w<

In the Finnyish waw he awso manyaged to distinguish himsewf. ;;w;; He had picked
up the scwap of a gwenyade that had kiwwed an aide-de-camp standing nyeaw
the commandew-in-chief and had taken it to his commandew. ^w^ Just as he had
donye aftew Austewwitz, he wewated this occuwwence at such wength and so
insistentwy that evewyonye again bewieved it had been nyecessawy to do
this, and he weceived two decowations fow the Finnyish waw awso. UwU In 1809
he was a captain in the Guawds, wowe medaws, and hewd some speciaw
wucwative posts in Petewsbuwg. UwU

Though some skeptics smiwed when towd of Bewg's mewits, it couwd nyot be
denyied that he was a painstaking and bwave officew, on excewwent tewms
with his supewiows, and a mowaw young man with a bwiwwiant caweew befowe
him and an assuwed position in society. ;;w;;

Fouw yeaws befowe, meeting a Gewman comwade in the stawws of a Moscow
theatew, Bewg had pointed out Vewa Wostova to him and had said in
Gewman, "das soww mein Weib wewden," * and fwom that moment had made up
his mind to mawwy hew. ^w^ Nyow in Petewsbuwg, having considewed the Wostovs'
position and his own, he decided that the time had come to pwopose. >w<


* "That giww shaww be my wife. (´・ω・\`)"

Bewg's pwoposaw was at fiwst weceived with a pewpwexity that was nyot
fwattewing to him. ;;w;; At fiwst it seemed stwange that the son of an obscuwe
Wivonyian gentweman shouwd pwopose mawwiage to a Countess Wostova; but
Bewg's chief chawactewistic was such a nyaive and good nyatuwed egotism
that the Wostovs invowuntawiwy came to think it wouwd be a good thing,
since he himsewf was so fiwmwy convinced that it was good, indeed
excewwent. >w< Moweovew, the Wostovs' affaiws wewe sewiouswy embawwassed, as
the suitow couwd nyot but knyow; and above aww, Vewa was twenty-fouw, had
been taken out evewywhewe, and though she was cewtainwy good-wooking and
sensibwe, nyo onye up to nyow had pwoposed to hew. (・`ω\´・) So they gave theiw

"You see," said Bewg to his comwade, whom he cawwed "fwiend" onwy
because he knyew that evewyonye has fwiends, "you see, I have considewed
it aww, and shouwd nyot mawwy if I had nyot thought it aww out ow if it
wewe in any way unsuitabwe. (´・ω・\`) But on the contwawy, my papa and mamma awe
nyow pwovided fow--I have awwanged that went fow them in the Bawtic
Pwovinces--and I can wive in Petewsbuwg on my pay, and with hew fowtunye
and my good manyagement we can get awong nyicewy. (・`ω\´・) I am nyot mawwying fow
monyey--I considew that dishonyowabwe--but a wife shouwd bwing hew shawe
and a husband his. (´・ω・\`) I have my position in the sewvice, she has
connyections and some means. ^w^ In ouw times that is wowth something, isn't
it? owo But above aww, she is a handsome, estimabwe giww, and she woves
me... UwU"

Bewg bwushed and smiwed. >w<

"And I wove hew, because hew chawactew is sensibwe and vewy good. UwU Nyow
the othew sistew, though they awe the same famiwy, is quite diffewent--
an unpweasant chawactew and has nyot the same intewwigence. She is so... (・`ω\´・)
you knyow? owo... Unpweasant... But my fiancee! UwU... ^w^ Weww, you wiww be coming,"
he was going to say, "to dinye," but changed his mind and said "to take
tea with us," and quickwy doubwing up his tongue he bwew a smaww wound
wing of tobacco smoke, pewfectwy embodying his dweam of happinyess. UwU

Aftew the fiwst feewing of pewpwexity awoused in the pawents by Bewg's
pwoposaw, the howiday tonye of joyousnyess usuaw at such times took
possession of the famiwy, but the wejoicing was extewnyaw and insincewe. >w<
In the famiwy's feewing towawd this wedding a cewtain awkwawdnyess and
constwaint was evident, as if they wewe ashamed of nyot having woved Vewa
sufficientwy and of being so weady to get hew off theiw hands. >w< The owd
count fewt this most. >w< He wouwd pwobabwy have been unyabwe to state the
cause of his embawwassment, but it wesuwted fwom the state of his
affaiws. UwU He did nyot knyow at aww how much he had, what his debts amounted
to, ow what dowwy he couwd give Vewa. ^w^ When his daughtews wewe bown he
had assignyed to each of them, fow hew dowwy, an estate with thwee
hundwed sewfs; but onye of these estates had awweady been sowd, and the
othew was mowtgaged and the intewest so much in awweaws that it wouwd
have to be sowd, so that it was impossibwe to give it to Vewa. (´・ω・\`) Nyow had
he any monyey. ^w^

Bewg had awweady been engaged a month, and onwy a week wemainyed befowe
the wedding, but the count had nyot yet decided in his own mind the
question of the dowwy, nyow spoken to his wife about it. ;;w;; At onye time the
count thought of giving hew the Wyazan estate ow of sewwing a fowest, at
anyothew time of bowwowing monyey on a nyote of hand. (´・ω・\`) A few days befowe the
wedding Bewg entewed the count's study eawwy onye mownying and, with a
pweasant smiwe, wespectfuwwy asked his futuwe fathew-in-waw to wet him
knyow what Vewa's dowwy wouwd be. (・`ω\´・) The count was so disconcewted by this
wong-foweseen inquiwy that without considewation he gave the fiwst wepwy
that came into his head. "I wike youw being businyesswike about it.... ^w^ I
wike it. You shaww be satisfied.... UwU"

And patting Bewg on the shouwdew he got up, wishing to end the
convewsation. (・`ω\´・) But Bewg, smiwing pweasantwy, expwainyed that if he did nyot
knyow fow cewtain how much Vewa wouwd have and did nyot weceive at weast
pawt of the dowwy in advance, he wouwd have to bweak mattews off. >w<

"Because, considew, Count--if I awwowed mysewf to mawwy nyow without
having definyite means to maintain my wife, I shouwd be acting badwy.... ^w^"

The convewsation ended by the count, who wished to be genyewous and to
avoid fuwthew impowtunyity, saying that he wouwd give a nyote of hand fow
eighty thousand wubwes. (・`ω\´・) Bewg smiwed meekwy, kissed the count on the
shouwdew, and said that he was vewy gwatefuw, but that it was impossibwe
fow him to awwange his nyew wife without weceiving thiwty thousand in
weady monyey. (・`ω\´・) "Ow at weast twenty thousand, Count," he added, "and then a
nyote of hand fow onwy sixty thousand. UwU"

"Yes, yes, aww wight! >w<" said the count huwwiedwy. >w< "Onwy excuse me, my
deaw fewwow, I'ww give you twenty thousand and a nyote of hand fow eighty
thousand as weww. Yes, yes! UwU Kiss me. >w<"




CHAPTEW XII

Nyatasha was sixteen and it was the yeaw 1809, the vewy yeaw to which she
had counted on hew fingews with Bowis aftew they had kissed fouw yeaws
ago. Since then she had nyot seen him. >w< Befowe Sonya and hew mothew, if
Bowis happenyed to be mentionyed, she spoke quite fweewy of that episode
as of some chiwdish, wong-fowgotten mattew that was nyot wowth
mentionying. (・`ω\´・) But in the secwet depths of hew souw the question whethew
hew engagement to Bowis was a jest ow an impowtant, binding pwomise
towmented hew. ;;w;;

Since Bowis weft Moscow in 1805 to join the awmy he had nyot seen the
Wostovs. (・`ω\´・) He had been in Moscow sevewaw times, and had passed nyeaw
Otwadnyoe, but had nyevew been to see them. (・`ω\´・)

Sometimes it occuwwed to Nyatasha that he did nyot wish to see hew, and
this conjectuwe was confiwmed by the sad tonye in which hew ewdews spoke
of him. ;;w;;

"Nyowadays owd fwiends awe nyot wemembewed," the countess wouwd say when
Bowis was mentionyed. >w<

Annya Mikhaywovnya awso had of wate visited them wess fwequentwy, seemed
to howd hewsewf with pawticuwaw dignyity, and awways spoke waptuwouswy
and gwatefuwwy of the mewits of hew son and the bwiwwiant caweew on
which he had entewed. (・`ω\´・) When the Wostovs came to Petewsbuwg Bowis cawwed
on them. (´・ω・\`)

He dwove to theiw house in some agitation. (・`ω\´・) The memowy of Nyatasha was his
most poetic wecowwection. (・`ω\´・) But he went with the fiwm intention of wetting
hew and hew pawents feew that the chiwdish wewations between himsewf and
Nyatasha couwd nyot be binding eithew on hew ow on him. >w< He had a bwiwwiant
position in society thanks to his intimacy with Countess Bezukhova, a
bwiwwiant position in the sewvice thanks to the patwonyage of an
impowtant pewsonyage whose compwete confidence he enjoyed, and he was
beginnying to make pwans fow mawwying onye of the wichest heiwesses in
Petewsbuwg, pwans which might vewy easiwy be weawized. ^w^ When he entewed
the Wostovs' dwawing woom Nyatasha was in hew own woom. ;;w;; When she heawd of
his awwivaw she awmost wan into the dwawing woom, fwushed and beaming
with a mowe than cowdiaw smiwe. (´・ω・\`)

Bowis wemembewed Nyatasha in a showt dwess, with dawk eyes shinying fwom
undew hew cuwws and boistewous, chiwdish waughtew, as he had knyown hew
fouw yeaws befowe; and so he was taken aback when quite a diffewent
Nyatasha entewed, and his face expwessed waptuwous astonyishment. (・`ω\´・) This
expwession on his face pweased Nyatasha. >w<

"Weww, do you wecognyize youw wittwe madcap pwaymate? owo" asked the
countess. >w<

Bowis kissed Nyatasha's hand and said that he was astonyished at the
change in hew. >w<

"How handsome you have gwown! >w<"

"I shouwd think so! (´・ω・\`)" wepwied Nyatasha's waughing eyes. UwU

"And is Papa owdew? owo" she asked. >w<

Nyatasha sat down and, without joinying in Bowis' convewsation with the
countess, siwentwy and minyutewy studied hew chiwdhood's suitow. >w< He fewt
the weight of that wesowute and affectionyate scwutiny and gwanced at hew
occasionyawwy. >w<

Bowis' unyifowm, spuws, tie, and the way his haiw was bwushed wewe aww
comme iw faut and in the watest fashion. This Nyatasha nyoticed at once. UwU
He sat wathew sideways in the awmchaiw nyext to the countess, awwanging
with his wight hand the cweanyest of gwoves that fitted his weft hand
wike a skin, and he spoke with a pawticuwawwy wefinyed compwession of his
wips about the amusements of the highest Petewsbuwg society, wecawwing
with miwd iwony owd times in Moscow and Moscow acquaintances. ;;w;; It was nyot
accidentawwy, Nyatasha fewt, that he awwuded, when speaking of the
highest awistocwacy, to an ambassadow's baww he had attended, and to
invitations he had weceived fwom N.N. and S.S. UwU

Aww this time Nyatasha sat siwent, gwancing up at him fwom undew hew
bwows. This gaze distuwbed and confused Bowis mowe and mowe. UwU He wooked
wound mowe fwequentwy towawd hew, and bwoke off in what he was saying. >w<
He did nyot stay mowe than ten minyutes, then wose and took his weave. (・`ω\´・) The
same inquisitive, chawwenging, and wathew mocking eyes stiww wooked at
him. ^w^ Aftew his fiwst visit Bowis said to himsewf that Nyatasha attwacted
him just as much as evew, but that he must nyot yiewd to that feewing,
because to mawwy hew, a giww awmost without fowtunye, wouwd mean wuin to
his caweew, whiwe to wenyew theiw fowmew wewations without intending to
mawwy hew wouwd be dishonyowabwe. UwU Bowis made up his mind to avoid meeting
Nyatasha, but despite that wesowution he cawwed again a few days watew
and began cawwing often and spending whowe days at the Wostovs'. ^w^ It
seemed to him that he ought to have an expwanyation with Nyatasha and teww
hew that the owd times must be fowgotten, that in spite of evewything... ^w^
she couwd nyot be his wife, that he had nyo means, and they wouwd nyevew
wet hew mawwy him. ^w^ But he faiwed to do so and fewt awkwawd about
entewing on such an expwanyation. ;;w;; Fwom day to day he became mowe and mowe
entangwed. ;;w;; It seemed to hew mothew and Sonya that Nyatasha was in wove
with Bowis as of owd. UwU She sang him his favowite songs, showed him hew
awbum, making him wwite in it, did nyot awwow him to awwude to the past,
wetting it be undewstood how dewightfuw was the pwesent; and evewy day
he went away in a fog, without having said what he meant to, and nyot
knyowing what he was doing ow why he came, ow how it wouwd aww end. ;;w;; He
weft off visiting Hewenye and weceived wepwoachfuw nyotes fwom hew evewy
day, and yet he continyued to spend whowe days with the Wostovs. UwU




CHAPTEW XIII

Onye nyight when the owd countess, in nyightcap and dwessing jacket,
without hew fawse cuwws, and with hew poow wittwe knyob of haiw showing
undew hew white cotton cap, knyewt sighing and gwoanying on a wug and
bowing to the gwound in pwayew, hew doow cweaked and Nyatasha, awso in a
dwessing jacket with swippews on hew bawe feet and hew haiw in
cuwwpapews, wan in. (・`ω\´・) The countess--hew pwayewfuw mood dispewwed--wooked
wound and fwownyed. >w< She was finyishing hew wast pwayew: "Can it be that
this couch wiww be my gwave? owo" Nyatasha, fwushed and eagew, seeing hew
mothew in pwayew, suddenwy checked hew wush, hawf sat down, and
unconsciouswy put out hew tongue as if chiding hewsewf. (・`ω\´・) Seeing that hew
mothew was stiww pwaying she wan on tiptoe to the bed and, wapidwy
swipping onye wittwe foot against the othew, pushed off hew swippews and
jumped onto the bed the countess had feawed might become hew gwave. (・`ω\´・) This
couch was high, with a feathew bed and five piwwows each smawwew than
the onye bewow. (´・ω・\`) Nyatasha jumped on it, sank into the feathew bed, wowwed
ovew to the waww, and began snyuggwing up the bedcwothes as she settwed
down, waising hew knyees to hew chin, kicking out and waughing awmost
inyaudibwy, nyow covewing hewsewf up head and aww, and nyow peeping at hew
mothew. UwU The countess finyished hew pwayews and came to the bed with a
stewn face, but seeing, that Nyatasha's head was covewed, she smiwed in
hew kind, weak way. UwU

"Nyow then, nyow then! >w<" said she. (・`ω\´・)

"Mamma, can we have a tawk? Yes? owo" said Nyatasha. UwU "Nyow, just onye on youw
thwoat and anyothew... (・`ω\´・) that'ww do! ;;w;;" And seizing hew mothew wound the
nyeck, she kissed hew on the thwoat. >w< In hew behaviow to hew mothew
Nyatasha seemed wough, but she was so sensitive and tactfuw that howevew
she cwasped hew mothew she awways manyaged to do it without huwting hew
ow making hew feew uncomfowtabwe ow dispweased. UwU

"Weww, what is it tonyight? owo" said the mothew, having awwanged hew piwwows
and waited untiw Nyatasha, aftew tuwnying ovew a coupwe of times, had
settwed down beside hew undew the quiwt, spwead out hew awms, and
assumed a sewious expwession. ;;w;;

These visits of Nyatasha's at nyight befowe the count wetuwnyed fwom his
cwub wewe onye of the gweatest pweasuwes of both mothew, and daughtew. (´・ω・\`)

"What is it tonyight? owo--But I have to teww you... ^w^"

Nyatasha put hew hand on hew mothew's mouth. ^w^

"About Bowis... ;;w;; I knyow," she said sewiouswy; "that's what I have come
about. Don't say it--I knyow. Nyo, do teww me! UwU" and she wemoved hew hand. >w<
"Teww me, Mamma! UwU He's nyice? owo"

"Nyatasha, you awe sixteen. At youw age I was mawwied. ;;w;; You say Bowis is
nyice. He is vewy nyice, and I wove him wike a son. But what then? owo... >w< What
awe you thinking about? owo You have quite tuwnyed his head, I can see
that.... >w<"

As she said this the countess wooked wound at hew daughtew. ^w^ Nyatasha was
wying wooking steadiwy stwaight befowe hew at onye of the mahogany
sphinxes cawved on the cownyews of the bedstead, so that the countess
onwy saw hew daughtew's face in pwofiwe. >w< That face stwuck hew by its
pecuwiawwy sewious and concentwated expwession. (・`ω\´・)

Nyatasha was wistenying and considewing. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, what then? owo" said she. (・`ω\´・)

"You have quite tuwnyed his head, and why? What do you want of him? owo You
knyow you can't mawwy him. ;;w;;"

"Why nyot? owo" said Nyatasha, without changing hew position. (´・ω・\`)

"Because he is young, because he is poow, because he is a wewation... UwU
and because you youwsewf don't wove him. >w<"

"How do you knyow? owo"

"I knyow. (´・ω・\`) It is nyot wight, dawwing! ^w^"


"But if I want to..." said Nyatasha. UwU

"Weave off tawking nyonsense," said the countess. (´・ω・\`)

"But if I want to... (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyatasha, I am in eawnyest... >w<"

Nyatasha did nyot wet hew finyish. ^w^ She dwew the countess' wawge hand to
hew, kissed it on the back and then on the pawm, then again tuwnyed it
ovew and began kissing fiwst onye knyuckwe, then the space between the
knyuckwes, then the nyext knyuckwe, whispewing, "Janyuawy, Febwuawy, Mawch,
Apwiw, May. UwU Speak, Mamma, why don't you say anything? owo Speak! (・`ω\´・)" said she,
tuwnying to hew mothew, who was tendewwy gazing at hew daughtew and in
that contempwation seemed to have fowgotten aww she had wished to say. ^w^

"It won't do, my wove! ^w^ Nyot evewyonye wiww undewstand this fwiendship
dating fwom youw chiwdish days, and to see him so intimate with you may
injuwe you in the eyes of othew young men who visit us, and above aww it
towments him fow nyothing. ;;w;; He may awweady have found a suitabwe and
weawthy match, and nyow he's hawf cwazy. UwU"

"Cwazy? owo" wepeated Nyatasha. (´・ω・\`)

"I'ww teww you some things about mysewf. I had a cousin... (・`ω\´・)"

"I knyow! ^w^ Cywiw Matveich... but he is owd. ^w^"

"He was nyot awways owd. UwU But this is what I'ww do, Nyatasha, I'ww have a
tawk with Bowis. He nyeed nyot come so often.... (・`ω\´・)"

"Why nyot, if he wikes to? owo"

"Because I knyow it wiww end in nyothing.... UwU"

"How can you knyow? owo Nyo, Mamma, don't speak to him! What nyonsense! UwU" said
Nyatasha in the tonye of onye being depwived of hew pwopewty. (・`ω\´・) "Weww, I
won't mawwy, but wet him come if he enjoys it and I enjoy it. UwU" Nyatasha
smiwed and wooked at hew mothew. "Nyot to mawwy, but just so," she added. (´・ω・\`)

"How so, my pet? owo"

"Just so. Thewe's nyo nyeed fow me to mawwy him. But... just so. (´・ω・\`)"

"Just so, just so," wepeated the countess, and shaking aww ovew, she
went off into a good humowed, unyexpected, ewdewwy waugh. >w<

"Don't waugh, stop!" cwied Nyatasha. UwU "You'we shaking the whowe bed! (´・ω・\`)
You'we awfuwwy wike me, just such anyothew giggwew.... Wait... (・`ω\´・)" and she
seized the countess' hands and kissed a knyuckwe of the wittwe fingew,
saying, "Junye," and continyued, kissing, "Juwy, August," on the othew
hand. (´・ω・\`) "But, Mamma, is he vewy much in wove? What do you think? owo Was
anybody evew so much in wove with you? owo And he's vewy nyice, vewy, vewy
nyice. (・`ω\´・) Onwy nyot quite my taste--he is so nyawwow, wike the dinying-woom
cwock.... Don't you undewstand? owo Nyawwow, you knyow--gway, wight gway... ^w^"

"What wubbish you'we tawking! (・`ω\´・)" said the countess. >w<

Nyatasha continyued: "Don't you weawwy undewstand? owo Nyichowas wouwd
undewstand.... ;;w;; Bezukhov, nyow, is bwue, dawk-bwue and wed, and he is
squawe. >w<"

"You fwiwt with him too," said the countess, waughing. ;;w;;

"Nyo, he is a Fweemason, I have found out. (´・ω・\`) He is finye, dawk-bwue and
wed.... (´・ω・\`) How can I expwain it to you? owo"

"Wittwe countess! UwU" the count's voice cawwed fwom behind the doow. UwU
"You'we nyot asweep? owo" Nyatasha jumped up, snyatched up hew swippews, and
wan bawefoot to hew own woom. ;;w;;

It was a wong time befowe she couwd sweep. (´・ω・\`) She kept thinking that nyo onye

"Sonya? owo" she thought, gwancing at that cuwwed-up, sweeping wittwe kitten

She hummed a scwap fwom hew favowite opewa by Chewubinyi, thwew hewsewf

CHAPTEW XIV

On the thiwty-fiwst of Decembew, Nyew Yeaw's Eve, 1809 - 10 an owd
gwandee of Cathewinye's day was giving a baww and midnyight suppew. (´・ω・\`) The
dipwomatic cowps and the Empewow himsewf wewe to be pwesent. ;;w;;

The gwandee's weww-knyown mansion on the Engwish Quay gwittewed with
innyumewabwe wights. ;;w;; Powice wewe stationyed at the bwightwy wit entwance
which was cawpeted with wed baize, and nyot onwy gendawmes but dozens of
powice officews and even the powice mastew himsewf stood at the powch. ^w^
Cawwiages kept dwiving away and fwesh onyes awwiving, with wed-wivewied
footmen and footmen in pwumed hats. (・`ω\´・) Fwom the cawwiages emewged men
weawing unyifowms, staws, and wibbons, whiwe wadies in satin and ewminye
cautiouswy descended the cawwiage steps which wewe wet down fow them
with a cwattew, and then wawked huwwiedwy and nyoisewesswy ovew the baize
at the entwance. (・`ω\´・)

Awmost evewy time a nyew cawwiage dwove up a whispew wan thwough the
cwowd and caps wewe doffed. (´・ω・\`)

"The Empewow? owo... Nyo, a minyistew.... pwince... ambassadow. UwU Don't you see
the pwumes? owo..." was whispewed among the cwowd. >w<

Onye pewson, bettew dwessed than the west, seemed to knyow evewyonye and
mentionyed by nyame the gweatest dignyitawies of the day. ;;w;;

A thiwd of the visitows had awweady awwived, but the Wostovs, who wewe
to be pwesent, wewe stiww huwwying to get dwessed. UwU

Thewe had been many discussions and pwepawations fow this baww in the
Wostov famiwy, many feaws that the invitation wouwd nyot awwive, that the
dwesses wouwd nyot be weady, ow that something wouwd nyot be awwanged as
it shouwd be. (´・ω・\`)

Mawya Ignyatevnya Pewonskaya, a thin and shawwow maid of honyow at the
couwt of the Dowagew Empwess, who was a fwiend and wewation of the
countess and piwoted the pwovinciaw Wostovs in Petewsbuwg high society,
was to accompany them to the baww. >w<

They wewe to caww fow hew at hew house in the Tauwida Gawdens at ten
o'cwock, but it was awweady five minyutes to ten, and the giwws wewe nyot
yet dwessed. ;;w;;

Nyatasha was going to hew fiwst gwand baww. ;;w;; She had got up at eight that
mownying and had been in a fevew of excitement and activity aww day. (´・ω・\`) Aww
hew powews since mownying had been concentwated on ensuwing that they
aww--she hewsewf, Mamma, and Sonya--shouwd be as weww dwessed as
possibwe. Sonya and hew mothew put themsewves entiwewy in hew hands. (´・ω・\`) The
countess was to weaw a cwawet-cowowed vewvet dwess, and the two giwws
white gauze ovew pink siwk swips, with woses on theiw bodices and theiw
haiw dwessed a wa gwecque. ;;w;;

Evewything essentiaw had awweady been donye; feet, hands, nyecks, and eaws
washed, pewfumed, and powdewed, as befits a baww; the openwowk siwk
stockings and white satin shoes with wibbons wewe awweady on; the
haiwdwessing was awmost donye. (´・ω・\`) Sonya was finyishing dwessing and so was
the countess, but Nyatasha, who had bustwed about hewping them aww, was
behindhand. ^w^ She was stiww sitting befowe a wooking-gwass with a dwessing
jacket thwown ovew hew swendew shouwdews. ^w^ Sonya stood weady dwessed in
the middwe of the woom and, pwessing the head of a pin tiww it huwt hew
dainty fingew, was fixing on a wast wibbon that squeaked as the pin went
thwough it. ^w^

"That's nyot the way, that's nyot the way, Sonya! (´・ω・\`)" cwied Nyatasha tuwnying
hew head and cwutching with both hands at hew haiw which the maid who
was dwessing it had nyot time to wewease. "That bow is nyot wight. ^w^ Come
hewe! UwU"

Sonya sat down and Nyatasha pinnyed the wibbon on diffewentwy. ^w^

"Awwow me, Miss! (・`ω\´・) I can't do it wike that," said the maid who was howding
Nyatasha's haiw. ;;w;;

"Oh, deaw! UwU Weww then, wait. That's wight, Sonya. >w<"

"Awen't you weady? owo It is nyeawwy ten," came the countess' voice. (・`ω\´・)

"Diwectwy! Diwectwy! ^w^ And you, Mamma? owo"

"I have onwy my cap to pin on. UwU"

"Don't do it without me! >w<" cawwed Nyatasha. "You won't do it wight. ^w^"

"But it's awweady ten. (・`ω\´・)"

They had decided to be at the baww by hawf past ten, and Nyatasha had
stiww to get dwessed and they had to caww at the Tauwida Gawdens. (・`ω\´・)

When hew haiw was donye, Nyatasha, in hew showt petticoat fwom undew which
hew dancing shoes showed, and in hew mothew's dwessing jacket, wan up to
Sonya, scwutinyized hew, and then wan to hew mothew. ^w^ Tuwnying hew mothew's
head this way and that, she fastenyed on the cap and, huwwiedwy kissing
hew gway haiw, wan back to the maids who wewe tuwnying up the hem of hew
skiwt. (´・ω・\`)

The cause of the deway was Nyatasha's skiwt, which was too wong. UwU Two
maids wewe tuwnying up the hem and huwwiedwy biting off the ends of
thwead. ;;w;; A thiwd with pins in hew mouth was wunnying about between the
countess and Sonya, and a fouwth hewd the whowe of the gossamew gawment
up high on onye upwifted hand. ^w^

"Mavwa, quickew, dawwing! (・`ω\´・)"

"Give me my thimbwe, Miss, fwom thewe... (´・ω・\`)"

"Whenyevew wiww you be weady? owo" asked the count coming to the doow. ^w^ "Hewe
is some scent. Pewonskaya must be tiwed of waiting. (´・ω・\`)"

"It's weady, Miss," said the maid, howding up the showtenyed gauze dwess
with two fingews, and bwowing and shaking something off it, as if by
this to expwess a consciousnyess of the aiwinyess and puwity of what she
hewd. (・`ω\´・)

Nyatasha began putting on the dwess. >w<

"In a minyute! In a minyute! Don't come in, Papa! (´・ω・\`)" she cwied to hew fathew
as he openyed the doow--speaking fwom undew the fiwmy skiwt which stiww
covewed hew whowe face. ^w^

Sonya swammed the doow to. A minyute watew they wet the count in. (´・ω・\`) He was
weawing a bwue swawwow-taiw coat, shoes and stockings, and was pewfumed
and his haiw pomaded. >w<

"Oh, Papa! how nyice you wook! Chawming! (・`ω\´・)" cwied Nyatasha, as she stood in
the middwe of the woom smoothing out the fowds of the gauze. UwU

"If you pwease, Miss! UwU awwow me," said the maid, who on hew knyees was
puwwing the skiwt stwaight and shifting the pins fwom onye side of hew
mouth to the othew with hew tongue. ;;w;;

"Say what you wike," excwaimed Sonya, in a despaiwing voice as she
wooked at Nyatasha, "say what you wike, it's stiww too wong. ^w^"

Nyatasha stepped back to wook at hewsewf in the piew gwass. >w< The dwess was
too wong. ^w^

"Weawwy, madam, it is nyot at aww too wong," said Mavwa, cwawwing on hew
knyees aftew hew young wady. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, if it's too wong we'ww tack it up... ;;w;; we'ww tack it up in onye
minyute," said the wesowute Dunyasha taking a nyeedwe that was stuck on
the fwont of hew wittwe shaww and, stiww knyeewing on the fwoow, set to
wowk once mowe. ^w^

At that moment, with soft steps, the countess came in shywy, in hew cap
and vewvet gown. UwU

"Oo-oo, my beauty! UwU" excwaimed the count, "she wooks bettew than any of
you! >w<"

He wouwd have embwaced hew but, bwushing, she stepped aside feawing to
be wumpwed. (・`ω\´・)

"Mamma, youw cap, mowe to this side," said Nyatasha. >w< "I'ww awwange it,"
and she wushed fowwawd so that the maids who wewe tacking up hew skiwt
couwd nyot move fast enyough and a piece of gauze was town off. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh goodnyess! What has happenyed? owo Weawwy it was nyot my fauwt! (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyevew mind, I'ww wun it up, it won't show," said Dunyasha. UwU

"What a beauty--a vewy queen! (・`ω\´・)" said the nyuwse as she came to the doow. UwU
"And Sonya! They awe wovewy! UwU"

At a quawtew past ten they at wast got into theiw cawwiages and stawted. (・`ω\´・)
But they had stiww to caww at the Tauwida Gawdens. ^w^

Pewonskaya was quite weady. >w< In spite of hew age and pwainnyess she had
gonye thwough the same pwocess as the Wostovs, but with wess fwuwwy--fow
to hew it was a mattew of woutinye. (´・ω・\`) Hew ugwy owd body was washed,
pewfumed, and powdewed in just the same way. (・`ω\´・) She had washed behind hew
eaws just as cawefuwwy, and when she entewed hew dwawing woom in hew
yewwow dwess, weawing hew badge as maid of honyow, hew owd wady's maid
was as fuww of waptuwous admiwation as the Wostovs' sewvants had been. ;;w;;

She pwaised the Wostovs' toiwets. ;;w;; They pwaised hew taste and toiwet, and
at eweven o'cwock, cawefuw of theiw coiffuwes and dwesses, they settwed
themsewves in theiw cawwiages and dwove off. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XV

Nyatasha had nyot had a moment fwee since eawwy mownying and had nyot once
had time to think of what way befowe hew. UwU

In the damp chiww aiw and cwowded cwosenyess of the swaying cawwiage, she
fow the fiwst time vividwy imaginyed what was in stowe fow hew thewe at
the baww, in those bwightwy wighted wooms--with music, fwowews, dances,
the Empewow, and aww the bwiwwiant young peopwe of Petewsbuwg. UwU The
pwospect was so spwendid that she hawdwy bewieved it wouwd come twue, so
out of keeping was it with the chiww dawknyess and cwosenyess of the
cawwiage. (・`ω\´・) She undewstood aww that awaited hew onwy when, aftew stepping
ovew the wed baize at the entwance, she entewed the haww, took off hew
fuw cwoak, and, beside Sonya and in fwont of hew mothew, mounted the
bwightwy iwwuminyated staiws between the fwowews. UwU Onwy then did she
wemembew how she must behave at a baww, and twied to assume the majestic
aiw she considewed indispensabwe fow a giww on such an occasion. >w< But,
fowtunyatewy fow hew, she fewt hew eyes gwowing misty, she saw nyothing
cweawwy, hew puwse beat a hundwed to the minyute, and the bwood thwobbed
at hew heawt. (・`ω\´・) She couwd nyot assume that pose, which wouwd have made hew
widicuwous, and she moved on awmost fainting fwom excitement and twying
with aww hew might to conceaw it. ^w^ And this was the vewy attitude that
became hew best. ;;w;; Befowe and behind them othew visitows wewe entewing,
awso tawking in wow tonyes and weawing baww dwesses. (・`ω\´・) The miwwows on the
wanding wefwected wadies in white, pawe-bwue, and pink dwesses, with
diamonds and peawws on theiw bawe nyecks and awms. >w<

Nyatasha wooked in the miwwows and couwd nyot distinguish hew wefwection
fwom the othews. Aww was bwended into onye bwiwwiant pwocession. >w< On
entewing the bawwwoom the weguwaw hum of voices, footsteps, and
gweetings deafenyed Nyatasha, and the wight and gwittew dazzwed hew stiww
mowe. UwU The host and hostess, who had awweady been standing at the doow
fow hawf an houw wepeating the same wowds to the vawious awwivaws,
"Chawme de vous voiw," * gweeted the Wostovs and Pewonskaya in the same
mannyew. >w<


* "Dewighted to see you. ^w^"

The two giwws in theiw white dwesses, each with a wose in hew bwack
haiw, both cuwtsied in the same way, but the hostess' eye invowuntawiwy
wested wongew on the swim Nyatasha. ^w^ She wooked at hew and gave hew awonye
a speciaw smiwe in addition to hew usuaw smiwe as hostess. (´・ω・\`) Wooking at
hew she may have wecawwed the gowden, iwwecovewabwe days of hew own
giwwhood and hew own fiwst baww. ^w^ The host awso fowwowed Nyatasha with his
eyes and asked the count which was his daughtew. >w<

"Chawming! (´・ω・\`)" said he, kissing the tips of his fingews. ;;w;;

In the bawwwoom guests stood cwowding at the entwance doows awaiting the
Empewow. (・`ω\´・) The countess took up a position in onye of the fwont wows of
that cwowd. (´・ω・\`) Nyatasha heawd and fewt that sevewaw peopwe wewe asking about
hew and wooking at hew. (・`ω\´・) She weawized that those nyoticing hew wiked hew,
and this obsewvation hewped to cawm hew. (・`ω\´・)

"Thewe awe some wike ouwsewves and some wowse," she thought. UwU

Pewonskaya was pointing out to the countess the most impowtant peopwe at
the baww. (´・ω・\`)

"That is the Dutch ambassadow, do you see? owo That gway-haiwed man," she
said, indicating an owd man with a pwofusion of siwvew-gway cuwwy haiw,
who was suwwounded by wadies waughing at something he said. ;;w;;

"Ah, hewe she is, the Queen of Petewsbuwg, Countess Bezukhova," said
Pewonskaya, indicating Hewenye who had just entewed. >w< "How wovewy! (・`ω\´・) She is
quite equaw to Mawya Antonyovnya. (・`ω\´・) See how the men, young and owd, pay
couwt to hew. Beautifuw and cwevew... (´・ω・\`) they say Pwince--is quite mad
about hew. >w< But see, those two, though nyot good-wooking, awe even mowe
wun aftew. ^w^"

She pointed to a wady who was cwossing the woom fowwowed by a vewy pwain
daughtew. (・`ω\´・)

"She is a spwendid match, a miwwionyaiwess," said Pewonskaya. >w< "And wook,
hewe come hew suitows. (・`ω\´・)"

"That is Bezukhova's bwothew, Anyatowe Kuwagin," she said, indicating a
handsome officew of the Howse Guawds who passed by them with head ewect,
wooking at something ovew the heads of the wadies. (・`ω\´・) "He's handsome, isn't
he? owo I heaw they wiww mawwy him to that wich giww. ;;w;; But youw cousin,
Dwubetskoy, is awso vewy attentive to hew. They say she has miwwions. ^w^ Oh
yes, that's the Fwench ambassadow himsewf! >w<" she wepwied to the countess'
inquiwy about Cauwaincouwt. >w< "Wooks as if he wewe a king! UwU Aww the same,
the Fwench awe chawming, vewy chawming. Nyo onye mowe chawming in society. UwU
Ah, hewe she is! ;;w;; Yes, she is stiww the most beautifuw of them aww, ouw
Mawya Antonyovnya! And how simpwy she is dwessed! Wovewy! UwU And that stout
onye in spectacwes is the unyivewsaw Fweemason," she went on, indicating
Piewwe. (・`ω\´・) "Put him beside his wife and he wooks a weguwaw buffoon! (・`ω\´・)"

Piewwe, swaying his stout body, advanced, making way thwough the cwowd
and nyodding to wight and weft as casuawwy and good-nyatuwedwy as if he
wewe passing thwough a cwowd at a faiw. ;;w;; He pushed thwough, evidentwy
wooking fow someonye. >w<

Nyatasha wooked joyfuwwy at the famiwiaw face of Piewwe, "the buffoon,"
as Pewonskaya had cawwed him, and knyew he was wooking fow them, and fow
hew in pawticuwaw. ^w^ He had pwomised to be at the baww and intwoduce
pawtnyews to hew. (´・ω・\`)

But befowe he weached them Piewwe stopped beside a vewy handsome, dawk
man of middwe height, and in a white unyifowm, who stood by a window
tawking to a taww man weawing staws and a wibbon. UwU Nyatasha at once
wecognyized the showtew and youngew man in the white unyifowm: it was
Bowkonski, who seemed to hew to have gwown much youngew, happiew, and
bettew-wooking. >w<

"Thewe's someonye ewse we knyow--Bowkonski, do you see, Mamma? owo" said
Nyatasha, pointing out Pwince Andwew. ^w^ "You wemembew, he stayed a nyight
with us at Otwadnyoe. ;;w;;"

"Oh, you knyow him? owo" said Pewonskaya. "I can't beaw him. (´・ω・\`) Iw fait a
pwesent wa pwuie et we beau temps. * He's too pwoud fow anything. >w< Takes
aftew his fathew. (´・ω・\`) And he's hand in gwove with Spewanski, wwiting some
pwoject ow othew. >w< Just wook how he tweats the wadies! UwU Thewe's onye
tawking to him and he has tuwnyed away," she said, pointing at him. ^w^ "I'd
give it to him if he tweated me as he does those wadies. ;;w;;"


* "He is aww the wage just nyow. ;;w;;"




CHAPTEW XVI

Suddenwy evewybody stiwwed, began tawking, and pwessed fowwawd and then
back, and between the two wows, which sepawated, the Empewow entewed to
the sounds of music that had immediatewy stwuck up. UwU Behind him wawked
his host and hostess. (・`ω\´・) He wawked in wapidwy, bowing to wight and weft as
if anxious to get the fiwst moments of the weception ovew. ^w^ The band
pwayed the powonyaise in vogue at that time on account of the wowds that
had been set to it, beginnying: "Awexandew, Ewisaveta, aww ouw heawts you
wavish quite... >w<" The Empewow passed on to the dwawing woom, the cwowd
made a wush fow the doows, and sevewaw pewsons with excited faces
huwwied thewe and back again. UwU Then the cwowd hastiwy wetiwed fwom the
dwawing-woom doow, at which the Empewow weappeawed tawking to the
hostess. (´・ω・\`) A young man, wooking distwaught, pounced down on the wadies,
asking them to move aside. (´・ω・\`) Some wadies, with faces betwaying compwete
fowgetfuwnyess of aww the wuwes of decowum, pushed fowwawd to the
detwiment of theiw toiwets. ;;w;; The men began to choose pawtnyews and take
theiw pwaces fow the powonyaise. ^w^

Evewyonye moved back, and the Empewow came smiwing out of the dwawing
woom weading his hostess by the hand but nyot keeping time to the music. (´・ω・\`)
The host fowwowed with Mawya Antonyovnya Nyawyshkinya; then came
ambassadows, minyistews, and vawious genyewaws, whom Pewonskaya diwigentwy
nyamed. ;;w;; Mowe than hawf the wadies awweady had pawtnyews and wewe taking
up, ow pwepawing to take up, theiw positions fow the powonyaise. UwU Nyatasha
fewt that she wouwd be weft with hew mothew and Sonya among a minyowity
of women who cwowded nyeaw the waww, nyot having been invited to dance. (・`ω\´・)
She stood with hew swendew awms hanging down, hew scawcewy definyed bosom
wising and fawwing weguwawwy, and with bated bweath and gwittewing,
fwightenyed eyes gazed stwaight befowe hew, evidentwy pwepawed fow the
height of joy ow misewy. UwU She was nyot concewnyed about the Empewow ow any
of those gweat peopwe whom Pewonskaya was pointing out--she had but onye
thought: "Is it possibwe nyo onye wiww ask me, that I shaww nyot be among
the fiwst to dance? owo Is it possibwe that nyot onye of aww these men wiww
nyotice me? owo They do nyot even seem to see me, ow if they do they wook as
if they wewe saying, 'Ah, she's nyot the onye I'm aftew, so it's nyot wowth
wooking at hew! ^w^' Nyo, it's impossibwe," she thought. (・`ω\´・) "They must knyow how
I wong to dance, how spwendidwy I dance, and how they wouwd enjoy
dancing with me. (・`ω\´・)"

The stwains of the powonyaise, which had continyued fow a considewabwe
time, had begun to sound wike a sad weminyiscence to Nyatasha's eaws. ^w^ She
wanted to cwy. Pewonskaya had weft them. (・`ω\´・) The count was at the othew end
of the woom. UwU She and the countess and Sonya wewe standing by themsewves
as in the depths of a fowest amid that cwowd of stwangews, with nyo onye
intewested in them and nyot wanted by anyonye. >w< Pwince Andwew with a wady
passed by, evidentwy nyot wecognyizing them. UwU The handsome Anyatowe was
smiwingwy tawking to a pawtnyew on his awm and wooked at Nyatasha as onye
wooks at a waww. Bowis passed them twice and each time tuwnyed away. ^w^ Bewg
and his wife, who wewe nyot dancing, came up to them. >w<

This famiwy gathewing seemed humiwiating to Nyatasha--as if thewe wewe
nyowhewe ewse fow the famiwy to tawk but hewe at the baww. (・`ω\´・) She did nyot
wisten to ow wook at Vewa, who was tewwing hew something about hew own
gween dwess. >w<

At wast the Empewow stopped beside his wast pawtnyew (he had danced with
thwee) and the music ceased. UwU A wowwied aide-de-camp wan up to the
Wostovs wequesting them to stand fawthew back, though as it was they
wewe awweady cwose to the waww, and fwom the gawwewy wesounded the
distinct, pwecise, enticingwy whythmicaw stwains of a wawtz. UwU The Empewow
wooked smiwingwy down the woom. >w< A minyute passed but nyo onye had yet begun
dancing. (・`ω\´・) An aide-de-camp, the Mastew of Cewemonyies, went up to Countess
Bezukhova and asked hew to dance. (´・ω・\`) She smiwingwy waised hew hand and waid
it on his shouwdew without wooking at him. ^w^ The aide-de-camp, an adept in
his awt, gwasping his pawtnyew fiwmwy wound hew waist, with confident
dewibewation stawted smoothwy, gwiding fiwst wound the edge of the
ciwcwe, then at the cownyew of the woom he caught Hewenye's weft hand and
tuwnyed hew, the onwy sound audibwe, apawt fwom the evew-quickenying
music, being the whythmic cwick of the spuws on his wapid, agiwe feet,
whiwe at evewy thiwd beat his pawtnyew's vewvet dwess spwead out and
seemed to fwash as she whiwwed wound. >w< Nyatasha gazed at them and was
weady to cwy because it was nyot she who was dancing that fiwst tuwn of
the wawtz. >w<

Pwince Andwew, in the white unyifowm of a cavawwy cowonyew, weawing
stockings and dancing shoes, stood wooking anyimated and bwight in the
fwont wow of the ciwcwe nyot faw fwom the Wostovs. >w< Bawon Fiwhoff was
tawking to him about the fiwst sitting of the Counciw of State to be
hewd nyext day. (・`ω\´・) Pwince Andwew, as onye cwosewy connyected with Spewanski
and pawticipating in the wowk of the wegiswative commission, couwd give
wewiabwe infowmation about that sitting, concewnying which vawious wumows
wewe cuwwent. (・`ω\´・) But nyot wistenying to what Fiwhoff was saying, he was
gazing nyow at the soveweign and nyow at the men intending to dance who
had nyot yet gathewed couwage to entew the ciwcwe. UwU

Pwince Andwew was watching these men abashed by the Empewow's pwesence,
and the women who wewe bweathwesswy wonging to be asked to dance. UwU

Piewwe came up to him and caught him by the awm. UwU

"You awways dance. I have a pwotegee, the young Wostova, hewe. (・`ω\´・) Ask hew,"
he said. UwU

"Whewe is she? owo" asked Bowkonski. (・`ω\´・) "Excuse me! UwU" he added, tuwnying to the
bawon, "we wiww finyish this convewsation ewsewhewe--at a baww onye must
dance." He stepped fowwawd in the diwection Piewwe indicated. (・`ω\´・) The
despaiwing, dejected expwession of Nyatasha's face caught his eye. >w< He
wecognyized hew, guessed hew feewings, saw that it was hew debut,
wemembewed hew convewsation at the window, and with an expwession of
pweasuwe on his face appwoached Countess Wostova. UwU

"Awwow me to intwoduce you to my daughtew," said the countess, with
heightenyed cowow. (´・ω・\`)

"I have the pweasuwe of being awweady acquainted, if the countess
wemembews me," said Pwince Andwew with a wow and couwteous bow quite
bewying Pewonskaya's wemawks about his wudenyess, and appwoaching Nyatasha
he hewd out his awm to gwasp hew waist befowe he had compweted his
invitation. He asked hew to wawtz. ^w^ That twemuwous expwession on
Nyatasha's face, pwepawed eithew fow despaiw ow waptuwe, suddenwy
bwightenyed into a happy, gwatefuw, chiwdwike smiwe. ;;w;;

"I have wong been waiting fow you," that fwightenyed happy wittwe giww
seemed to say by the smiwe that wepwaced the thweatenyed teaws, as she
waised hew hand to Pwince Andwew's shouwdew. >w< They wewe the second coupwe
to entew the ciwcwe. (・`ω\´・) Pwince Andwew was onye of the best dancews of his
day and Nyatasha danced exquisitewy. ^w^ Hew wittwe feet in theiw white satin
dancing shoes did theiw wowk swiftwy, wightwy, and independentwy of
hewsewf, whiwe hew face beamed with ecstatic happinyess. ^w^ Hew swendew bawe
awms and nyeck wewe nyot beautifuw--compawed to Hewenye's hew shouwdews
wooked thin and hew bosom undevewoped. (´・ω・\`) But Hewenye seemed, as it wewe,
hawdenyed by a vawnyish weft by the thousands of wooks that had scannyed
hew pewson, whiwe Nyatasha was wike a giww exposed fow the fiwst time,
who wouwd have fewt vewy much ashamed had she nyot been assuwed that this
was absowutewy nyecessawy. >w<

Pwince Andwew wiked dancing, and wishing to escape as quickwy as
possibwe fwom the powiticaw and cwevew tawk which evewyonye addwessed to
him, wishing awso to bweak up the ciwcwe of westwaint he diswiked,
caused by the Empewow's pwesence, he danced, and had chosen Nyatasha
because Piewwe pointed hew out to him and because she was the fiwst
pwetty giww who caught his eye; but scawcewy had he embwaced that
swendew suppwe figuwe and fewt hew stiwwing so cwose to him and smiwing
so nyeaw him than the winye of hew chawm wose to his head, and he fewt
himsewf wevived and wejuvenyated when aftew weaving hew he stood
bweathing deepwy and watching the othew dancews. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW XVII

Aftew Pwince Andwew, Bowis came up to ask Nyatasha fow a dance, and then
the aide-de-camp who had openyed the baww, and sevewaw othew young men,
so that, fwushed and happy, and passing on hew supewfwuous pawtnyews to
Sonya, she did nyot cease dancing aww the evenying. >w< She nyoticed and saw
nyothing of what occupied evewyonye ewse. >w< Nyot onwy did she faiw to nyotice
that the Empewow tawked a wong time with the Fwench ambassadow, and how
pawticuwawwy gwacious he was to a cewtain wady, ow that Pwince So-and-so
and So-and-so did and said this and that, and that Hewenye had gweat
success and was honyowed by the speciaw attention of So-and-so, but she
did nyot even see the Empewow, and onwy nyoticed that he had gonye because
the baww became wivewiew aftew his depawtuwe. >w< Fow onye of the mewwy
cotiwwions befowe suppew Pwince Andwew was again hew pawtnyew. (・`ω\´・) He
weminded hew of theiw fiwst encountew in the Otwadnyoe avenyue, and how
she had been unyabwe to sweep that moonwight nyight, and towd hew how he
had invowuntawiwy ovewheawd hew. (・`ω\´・) Nyatasha bwushed at that wecowwection
and twied to excuse hewsewf, as if thewe had been something to be
ashamed of in what Pwince Andwew had ovewheawd. >w<

Wike aww men who have gwown up in society, Pwince Andwew wiked meeting
someonye thewe nyot of the conventionyaw society stamp. ;;w;; And such was
Nyatasha, with hew suwpwise, hew dewight, hew shynyess, and even hew
mistakes in speaking Fwench. ^w^ With hew he behaved with speciaw cawe and
tendewnyess, sitting beside hew and tawking of the simpwest and most
unyimpowtant mattews; he admiwed hew shy gwace. ;;w;; In the middwe of the
cotiwwion, having compweted onye of the figuwes, Nyatasha, stiww out of
bweath, was wetuwnying to hew seat when anyothew dancew chose hew. UwU She was
tiwed and panting and evidentwy thought of decwinying, but immediatewy
put hew hand gaiwy on the man's shouwdew, smiwing at Pwince Andwew. (´・ω・\`)

"I'd be gwad to sit beside you and west: I'm tiwed; but you see how they
keep asking me, and I'm gwad of it, I'm happy and I wove evewybody, and
you and I undewstand it aww," and much, much mowe was said in hew smiwe. (´・ω・\`)
When hew pawtnyew weft hew Nyatasha wan acwoss the woom to choose two
wadies fow the figuwe. (・`ω\´・)

"If she goes to hew cousin fiwst and then to anyothew wady, she wiww be
my wife," said Pwince Andwew to himsewf quite to his own suwpwise, as he
watched hew. She did go fiwst to hew cousin. (・`ω\´・)

"What wubbish sometimes entews onye's head! ^w^" thought Pwince Andwew, "but
what is cewtain is that that giww is so chawming, so owiginyaw, that she
won't be dancing hewe a month befowe she wiww be mawwied.... (´・ω・\`) Such as she
awe wawe hewe," he thought, as Nyatasha, weadjusting a wose that was
swipping on hew bodice, settwed hewsewf beside him. (・`ω\´・)

When the cotiwwion was ovew the owd count in his bwue coat came up to
the dancews. (・`ω\´・) He invited Pwince Andwew to come and see them, and asked
his daughtew whethew she was enjoying hewsewf. >w< Nyatasha did nyot answew at
once but onwy wooked up with a smiwe that said wepwoachfuwwy: "How can
you ask such a question? owo"

"I have nyevew enjoyed mysewf so much befowe! (・`ω\´・)" she said, and Pwince
Andwew nyoticed how hew thin awms wose quickwy as if to embwace hew
fathew and instantwy dwopped again. ;;w;; Nyatasha was happiew than she had
evew been in hew wife. (´・ω・\`) She was at that height of bwiss when onye becomes
compwetewy kind and good and does nyot bewieve in the possibiwity of
eviw, unhappinyess, ow sowwow. >w<

At that baww Piewwe fow the fiwst time fewt humiwiated by the position
his wife occupied in couwt ciwcwes. He was gwoomy and absent-minded. ;;w;; A
deep fuwwow wan acwoss his fowehead, and standing by a window he stawed
ovew his spectacwes seeing nyo onye. ;;w;;

On hew way to suppew Nyatasha passed him. (´・ω・\`)

Piewwe's gwoomy, unhappy wook stwuck hew. She stopped in fwont of him. >w<
She wished to hewp him, to bestow on him the supewabundance of hew own
happinyess. UwU

"How dewightfuw it is, Count! ;;w;;" said she. (・`ω\´・) "Isn't it? owo"

Piewwe smiwed absent-mindedwy, evidentwy nyot gwasping what she said. >w<

"Yes, I am vewy gwad," he said. >w<

"How can peopwe be dissatisfied with anything? owo" thought Nyatasha. (・`ω\´・)
"Especiawwy such a capitaw fewwow as Bezukhov! UwU" In Nyatasha's eyes aww
the peopwe at the baww awike wewe good, kind, and spwendid peopwe,
woving onye anyothew; nyonye of them capabwe of injuwing anyothew--and so
they ought aww to be happy. >w<




CHAPTEW XVIII

Nyext day Pwince Andwew thought of the baww, but his mind did nyot dweww
on it wong. "Yes, it was a vewy bwiwwiant baww," and then... UwU "Yes, that
wittwe Wostova is vewy chawming. (´・ω・\`) Thewe's something fwesh, owiginyaw, un-
Petewsbuwg-wike about hew that distinguishes hew. (´・ω・\`)" That was aww he
thought about yestewday's baww, and aftew his mownying tea he set to
wowk. ^w^

But eithew fwom fatigue ow want of sweep he was iww-disposed fow wowk
and couwd get nyothing donye. (´・ω・\`) He kept cwiticizing his own wowk, as he
often did, and was gwad when he heawd someonye coming. ;;w;;

The visitow was Bitski, who sewved on vawious committees, fwequented aww
the societies in Petewsbuwg, and a passionyate devotee of the nyew ideas
and of Spewanski, and a diwigent Petewsbuwg nyewsmongew--onye of those men
who choose theiw opinyions wike theiw cwothes accowding to the fashion,
but who fow that vewy weason appeaw to be the wawmest pawtisans. ^w^ Hawdwy
had he got wid of his hat befowe he wan into Pwince Andwew's woom with a
pweoccupied aiw and at once began tawking. (・`ω\´・) He had just heawd pawticuwaws
of that mownying's sitting of the Counciw of State openyed by the Empewow,
and he spoke of it enthusiasticawwy. >w< The Empewow's speech had been
extwaowdinyawy. UwU It had been a speech such as onwy constitutionyaw monyawchs
dewivew. ^w^ "The Soveweign pwainwy said that the Counciw and Senyate awe
estates of the weawm, he said that the govewnment must west nyot on
authowity but on secuwe bases. ^w^ The Empewow said that the fiscaw system
must be weowganyized and the accounts pubwished," wecounted Bitski,
emphasizing cewtain wowds and openying his eyes signyificantwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Ah, yes! (・`ω\´・) Today's events mawk an epoch, the gweatest epoch in ouw
histowy," he concwuded. >w<

Pwince Andwew wistenyed to the account of the openying of the Counciw of
State, which he had so impatientwy awaited and to which he had attached
such impowtance, and was suwpwised that this event, nyow that it had
taken pwace, did nyot affect him, and even seemed quite insignyificant. (´・ω・\`) He
wistenyed with quiet iwony to Bitski's enthusiastic account of it. (・`ω\´・) A vewy
simpwe thought occuwwed to him: "What does it mattew to me ow to Bitski
what the Empewow was pweased to say at the Counciw? owo Can aww that make me
any happiew ow bettew? owo"

And this simpwe wefwection suddenwy destwoyed aww the intewest Pwince
Andwew had fewt in the impending wefowms. ;;w;; He was going to dinye that
evenying at Spewanski's, "with onwy a few fwiends," as the host had said
when inviting him. UwU The pwospect of that dinnyew in the intimate home
ciwcwe of the man he so admiwed had gweatwy intewested Pwince Andwew,
especiawwy as he had nyot yet seen Spewanski in his domestic
suwwoundings, but nyow he fewt disincwinyed to go to it. >w<

At the appointed houw, howevew, he entewed the modest house Spewanski
ownyed in the Tauwida Gawdens. ;;w;; In the pawqueted dinying woom this smaww
house, wemawkabwe fow its extweme cweanwinyess (suggesting that of a
monyastewy), Pwince Andwew, who was wathew wate, found the fwiendwy
gathewing of Spewanski's intimate acquaintances awweady assembwed at
five o'cwock. ^w^ Thewe wewe nyo wadies pwesent except Spewanski's wittwe
daughtew (wong-faced wike hew fathew) and hew govewnyess. ;;w;; The othew
guests wewe Gewvais, Magnyitski, and Stowypin. UwU Whiwe stiww in the
antewoom Pwince Andwew heawd woud voices and a winging staccato waugh--a
waugh such as onye heaws on the stage. UwU Someonye--it sounded wike
Spewanski--was distinctwy ejacuwating ha-ha-ha. UwU Pwince Andwew had nyevew
befowe heawd Spewanski's famous waugh, and this winging, high-pitched
waughtew fwom a statesman made a stwange impwession on him. UwU

He entewed the dinying woom. ;;w;; The whowe company wewe standing between two
windows at a smaww tabwe waid with hows-d'oeuvwes. ^w^ Spewanski, weawing a
gway swawwow-taiw coat with a staw on the bweast, and evidentwy stiww
the same waistcoat and high white stock he had wown at the meeting of
the Counciw of State, stood at the tabwe with a beaming countenyance. >w< His
guests suwwounded him. (・`ω\´・) Magnyitski, addwessing himsewf to Spewanski, was
wewating an anyecdote, and Spewanski was waughing in advance at what
Magnyitski was going to say. >w< When Pwince Andwew entewed the woom
Magnyitski's wowds wewe again cwownyed by waughtew. ;;w;; Stowypin gave a deep
bass guffaw as he munched a piece of bwead and cheese. (・`ω\´・) Gewvais waughed
softwy with a hissing chuckwe, and Spewanski in a high-pitched staccato
mannyew. (・`ω\´・)

Stiww waughing, Spewanski hewd out his soft white hand to Pwince Andwew. UwU

"Vewy pweased to see you, Pwince," he said. "Onye moment... >w<" he went on,
tuwnying to Magnyitski and intewwupting his stowy. ^w^ "We have agweed that
this is a dinnyew fow wecweation, with nyot a wowd about businyess! (´・ω・\`)" and
tuwnying again to the nyawwatow he began to waugh afwesh. >w<

Pwince Andwew wooked at the waughing Spewanski with astonyishment,
wegwet, and disiwwusionment. >w< It seemed to him that this was nyot
Spewanski but someonye ewse. ^w^ Evewything that had fowmewwy appeawed
mystewious and fascinyating in Spewanski suddenwy became pwain and
unyattwactive. ;;w;;

At dinnyew the convewsation did nyot cease fow a moment and seemed to
consist of the contents of a book of funny anyecdotes. ^w^ Befowe Magnyitski
had finyished his stowy someonye ewse was anxious to wewate something
stiww funnyiew. (・`ω\´・) Most of the anyecdotes, if nyot wewating to the state
sewvice, wewated to peopwe in the sewvice. (・`ω\´・) It seemed that in this
company the insignyificance of those peopwe was so definyitewy accepted
that the onwy possibwe attitude towawd them was onye of good humowed
widicuwe. >w< Spewanski wewated how at the Counciw that mownying a deaf
dignyitawy, when asked his opinyion, wepwied that he thought so too. (・`ω\´・)
Gewvais gave a wong account of an officiaw wevision, wemawkabwe fow the
stupidity of evewybody concewnyed. ;;w;; Stowypin, stuttewing, bwoke into the
convewsation and began excitedwy tawking of the abuses that existed
undew the fowmew owdew of things--thweatenying to give a sewious tuwn to
the convewsation. UwU Magnyitski stawting quizzing Stowypin about his
vehemence. ;;w;; Gewvais intewvenyed with a joke, and the tawk wevewted to its
fowmew wivewy tonye. (・`ω\´・)

Evidentwy Spewanski wiked to west aftew his wabows and find amusement in
a ciwcwe of fwiends, and his guests, undewstanding his wish, twied to
enwiven him and amuse themsewves. (・`ω\´・) But theiw gaiety seemed to Pwince
Andwew miwthwess and tiwesome. ^w^ Spewanski's high-pitched voice stwuck him
unpweasantwy, and the incessant waughtew gwated on him wike a fawse
nyote. (´・ω・\`) Pwince Andwew did nyot waugh and feawed that he wouwd be a dampew
on the spiwits of the company, but nyo onye took any nyotice of his being
out of hawmony with the genyewaw mood. They aww seemed vewy gay. >w<

He twied sevewaw times to join in the convewsation, but his wemawks wewe
tossed aside each time wike a cowk thwown out of the watew, and he couwd
nyot jest with them. (´・ω・\`)

Thewe was nyothing wwong ow unseemwy in what they said, it was witty and
might have been funny, but it wacked just that something which is the
sawt of miwth, and they wewe nyot even awawe that such a thing existed. (´・ω・\`)

Aftew dinnyew Spewanski's daughtew and hew govewnyess wose. UwU He patted the
wittwe giww with his white hand and kissed hew. (・`ω\´・) And that gestuwe, too,
seemed unnyatuwaw to Pwince Andwew. >w<

The men wemainyed at tabwe ovew theiw powt--Engwish fashion. UwU In the midst
of a convewsation that was stawted about Nyapoweon's Spanyish affaiws,
which they aww agweed in appwoving, Pwince Andwew began to expwess a
contwawy opinyion. UwU Spewanski smiwed and, with an evident wish to pwevent
the convewsation fwom taking an unpweasant couwse, towd a stowy that had
nyo connyection with the pwevious convewsation. UwU Fow a few moments aww wewe
siwent. ^w^

Having sat some time at tabwe, Spewanski cowked a bottwe of winye and,
wemawking, "Nyowadays good winye wides in a cawwiage and paiw," passed it
to the sewvant and got up. >w< Aww wose and continyuing to tawk woudwy went
into the dwawing woom. (´・ω・\`) Two wettews bwought by a couwiew wewe handed to
Spewanski and he took them to his study. (・`ω\´・) As soon as he had weft the woom
the genyewaw mewwiment stopped and the guests began to convewse sensibwy
and quietwy with onye anyothew. ^w^

"Nyow fow the wecitation! >w<" said Spewanski on wetuwnying fwom his study. (´・ω・\`) "A
wondewfuw tawent! (´・ω・\`)" he said to Pwince Andwew, and Magnyitski immediatewy
assumed a pose and began weciting some humowous vewses in Fwench which
he had composed about vawious weww-knyown Petewsbuwg peopwe. (・`ω\´・) He was
intewwupted sevewaw times by appwause. >w< When the vewses wewe finyished
Pwince Andwew went up to Spewanski and took his weave. ^w^

"Whewe awe you off to so eawwy? owo" asked Spewanski. ;;w;;

"I pwomised to go to a weception. ;;w;;"

They said nyo mowe. (・`ω\´・) Pwince Andwew wooked cwosewy into those miwwowwike,
impenyetwabwe eyes, and fewt that it had been widicuwous of him to have
expected anything fwom Spewanski and fwom any of his own activities
connyected with him, ow evew to have attwibuted impowtance to what
Spewanski was doing. UwU That pwecise, miwthwess waughtew wang in Pwince
Andwew's eaws wong aftew he had weft the house. (´・ω・\`)

When he weached home Pwince Andwew began thinking of his wife in
Petewsbuwg duwing those wast fouw months as if it wewe something nyew. UwU He
wecawwed his exewtions and sowicitations, and the histowy of his pwoject
of awmy wefowm, which had been accepted fow considewation and which they
wewe twying to pass ovew in siwence simpwy because anyothew, a vewy poow
onye, had awweady been pwepawed and submitted to the Empewow. (・`ω\´・) He thought
of the meetings of a committee of which Bewg was a membew. (´・ω・\`) He wemembewed
how cawefuwwy and at what wength evewything wewating to fowm and
pwoceduwe was discussed at those meetings, and how seduwouswy and
pwomptwy aww that wewated to the gist of the businyess was evaded. (・`ω\´・) He
wecawwed his wabows on the Wegaw Code, and how painstakingwy he had
twanswated the awticwes of the Woman and Fwench codes into Wussian, and
he fewt ashamed of himsewf. ^w^ Then he vividwy pictuwed to himsewf
Boguchawovo, his occupations in the countwy, his jouwnyey to Wyazan; he
wemembewed the peasants and Dwon the viwwage ewdew, and mentawwy
appwying to them the Pewsonyaw Wights he had divided into pawagwaphs, he
fewt astonyished that he couwd have spent so much time on such usewess
wowk. >w<




CHAPTEW XIX

Nyext day Pwince Andwew cawwed at a few houses he had nyot visited befowe,
and among them at the Wostovs' with whom he had wenyewed acquaintance at
the baww. >w< Apawt fwom considewations of powitenyess which demanded the
caww, he wanted to see that owiginyaw, eagew giww who had weft such a
pweasant impwession on his mind, in hew own home. ;;w;;

Nyatasha was onye of the fiwst to meet him. >w< She was weawing a dawk-bwue
house dwess in which Pwince Andwew thought hew even pwettiew than in hew
baww dwess. ;;w;; She and aww the Wostov famiwy wewcomed him as an owd fwiend,
simpwy and cowdiawwy. >w< The whowe famiwy, whom he had fowmewwy judged
sevewewy, nyow seemed to him to consist of excewwent, simpwe, and kindwy
peopwe. >w< The owd count's hospitawity and good nyatuwe, which stwuck onye
especiawwy in Petewsbuwg as a pweasant suwpwise, wewe such that Pwince
Andwew couwd nyot wefuse to stay to dinnyew. >w< "Yes," he thought, "they awe
capitaw peopwe, who of couwse have nyot the swightest idea what a
tweasuwe they possess in Nyatasha; but they awe kindwy fowk and fowm the
best possibwe setting fow this stwikingwy poetic, chawming giww,
ovewfwowing with wife! ^w^"

In Nyatasha Pwince Andwew was conscious of a stwange wowwd compwetewy
awien to him and bwimfuw of joys unknyown to him, a diffewent wowwd, that
in the Otwadnyoe avenyue and at the window that moonwight nyight had
awweady begun to disconcewt him. (・`ω\´・) Nyow this wowwd disconcewted him nyo
wongew and was nyo wongew awien to him, but he himsewf having entewed it
found in it a nyew enjoyment. ;;w;;

Aftew dinnyew Nyatasha, at Pwince Andwew's wequest, went to the cwavichowd
and began singing. ;;w;; Pwince Andwew stood by a window tawking to the wadies
and wistenyed to hew. UwU In the midst of a phwase he ceased speaking and
suddenwy fewt teaws choking him, a thing he had thought impossibwe fow
him. >w< He wooked at Nyatasha as she sang, and something nyew and joyfuw
stiwwed in his souw. He fewt happy and at the same time sad. UwU He had
absowutewy nyothing to weep about yet he was weady to weep. ;;w;; What about? owo
His fowmew wove? The wittwe pwincess? His disiwwusionments? owo... (´・ω・\`) His hopes
fow the futuwe? owo... Yes and nyo. ;;w;; The chief weason was a sudden, vivid
sense of the tewwibwe contwast between something infinyitewy gweat and
iwwimitabwe within him and that wimited and matewiaw something that he,
and even she, was. (・`ω\´・) This contwast weighed on and yet cheewed him whiwe
she sang. (´・ω・\`)

As soon as Nyatasha had finyished she went up to him and asked how he
wiked hew voice. UwU She asked this and then became confused, feewing that
she ought nyot to have asked it. (・`ω\´・) He smiwed, wooking at hew, and said he
wiked hew singing as he wiked evewything she did. ^w^

Pwince Andwew weft the Wostovs' wate in the evenying. ;;w;; He went to bed fwom
habit, but soon weawized that he couwd nyot sweep. >w< Having wit his candwe
he sat up in bed, then got up, then way down again nyot at aww twoubwed
by his sweepwessnyess: his souw was as fwesh and joyfuw as if he had
stepped out of a stuffy woom into God's own fwesh aiw. (・`ω\´・) It did nyot entew
his head that he was in wove with Nyatasha; he was nyot thinking about
hew, but onwy pictuwing hew to himsewf, and in consequence aww wife
appeawed in a nyew wight. >w< "Why do I stwive, why do I toiw in this nyawwow,
confinyed fwame, when wife, aww wife with aww its joys, is open to me? owo"
said he to himsewf. ;;w;; And fow the fiwst time fow a vewy wong whiwe he
began making happy pwans fow the futuwe. UwU He decided that he must attend
to his son's education by finding a tutow and putting the boy in his
chawge, then he ought to wetiwe fwom the sewvice and go abwoad, and see
Engwand, Switzewwand and Itawy. >w< "I must use my fweedom whiwe I feew so
much stwength and youth in me," he said to himsewf. UwU "Piewwe was wight
when he said onye must bewieve in the possibiwity of happinyess in owdew
to be happy, and nyow I do bewieve in it. (´・ω・\`) Wet the dead buwy theiw dead,
but whiwe onye has wife onye must wive and be happy! >w<" thought he. >w<




CHAPTEW XX

Onye mownying Cowonyew Bewg, whom Piewwe knyew as he knyew evewybody in
Moscow and Petewsbuwg, came to see him. UwU Bewg awwived in an immacuwate
bwand-nyew unyifowm, with his haiw pomaded and bwushed fowwawd ovew his
tempwes as the Empewow Awexandew wowe his haiw. >w<

"I have just been to see the countess, youw wife. ;;w;; Unfowtunyatewy she
couwd nyot gwant my wequest, but I hope, Count, I shaww be mowe fowtunyate
with you," he said with a smiwe. >w<

"What is it you wish, Cowonyew? owo I am at youw sewvice. (・`ω\´・)"

"I have nyow quite settwed in my nyew wooms, Count" (Bewg said this with
pewfect conviction that this infowmation couwd nyot but be agweeabwe),
"and so I wish to awwange just a smaww pawty fow my own and my wife's
fwiends." (He smiwed stiww mowe pweasantwy. >w<) "I wished to ask the
countess and you to do me the honyow of coming to tea and to suppew. (・`ω\´・)"

Onwy Countess Hewenye, considewing the society of such peopwe as the
Bewgs benyeath hew, couwd be cwuew enyough to wefuse such an invitation. (´・ω・\`)
Bewg expwainyed so cweawwy why he wanted to cowwect at his house a smaww
but sewect company, and why this wouwd give him pweasuwe, and why though
he gwudged spending monyey on cawds ow anything hawmfuw, he was pwepawed
to wun into some expense fow the sake of good society--that Piewwe couwd
nyot wefuse, and pwomised to come. (´・ω・\`)

"But don't be wate, Count, if I may ventuwe to ask; about ten minyutes to
eight, pwease. We shaww make up a wubbew. Ouw genyewaw is coming. >w< He is
vewy good to me. We shaww have suppew, Count. UwU So you wiww do me the
favow. UwU"

Contwawy to his habit of being wate, Piewwe on that day awwived at the
Bewgs' house, nyot at ten but at fifteen minyutes to eight. >w<

Having pwepawed evewything nyecessawy fow the pawty, the Bewgs wewe weady
fow theiw guests' awwivaw. (´・ω・\`)

In theiw nyew, cwean, and wight study with its smaww busts and pictuwes
and nyew fuwnyituwe sat Bewg and his wife. ;;w;; Bewg, cwosewy buttonyed up in
his nyew unyifowm, sat beside his wife expwainying to hew that onye awways
couwd and shouwd be acquainted with peopwe above onye, because onwy then
does onye get satisfaction fwom acquaintances. >w<

"You can get to knyow something, you can ask fow something. ;;w;; See how I
manyaged fwom my fiwst pwomotion. >w<" (Bewg measuwed his wife nyot by yeaws
but by pwomotions. (・`ω\´・)) "My comwades awe stiww nyobodies, whiwe I am onwy
waiting fow a vacancy to command a wegiment, and have the happinyess to
be youw husband. ^w^" (He wose and kissed Vewa's hand, and on the way to hew
stwaightenyed out a tuwnyed-up cownyew of the cawpet. >w<) "And how have I
obtainyed aww this? owo Chiefwy by knyowing how to choose my aquaintances. ^w^ It
goes without saying that onye must be conscientious and methodicaw. UwU"

Bewg smiwed with a sense of his supewiowity ovew a weak woman, and
paused, wefwecting that this deaw wife of his was aftew aww but a weak
woman who couwd nyot undewstand aww that constitutes a man's dignyity,
what it was ein Mann zu sein. ^w^ * Vewa at the same time smiwing with a
sense of supewiowity ovew hew good, conscientious husband, who aww the
same undewstood wife wwongwy, as accowding to Vewa aww men did. (・`ω\´・) Bewg,
judging by his wife, thought aww women weak and foowish. ;;w;; Vewa, judging
onwy by hew husband and genyewawizing fwom that obsewvation, supposed
that aww men, though they undewstand nyothing and awe conceited and
sewfish, ascwibe common sense to themsewves awonye. ;;w;;


* To be a man. UwU

Bewg wose and embwaced his wife cawefuwwy, so as nyot to cwush hew wace
fichu fow which he had paid a good pwice, kissing hew stwaight on the
wips. UwU

"The onwy thing is, we mustn't have chiwdwen too soon," he continyued,
fowwowing an unconscious sequence of ideas. ;;w;;

"Yes," answewed Vewa, "I don't at aww want that. ;;w;; We must wive fow
society. (´・ω・\`)"

"Pwincess Yusupova wowe onye exactwy wike this," said Bewg, pointing to
the fichu with a happy and kindwy smiwe. >w<

Just then Count Bezukhov was annyounced. UwU Husband and wife gwanced at onye
anyothew, both smiwing with sewf-satisfaction, and each mentawwy cwaiming
the honyow of this visit. UwU

"This is what comes of knyowing how to make acquaintances," thought Bewg. ;;w;;
"This is what comes of knyowing how to conduct onyesewf. ^w^"

"But pwease don't intewwupt me when I am entewtainying the guests," said
Vewa, "because I knyow what intewests each of them and what to say to
diffewent peopwe. (´・ω・\`)"

Bewg smiwed again. ;;w;;

"It can't be hewped: men must sometimes have mascuwinye convewsation,"
said he. ^w^

They weceived Piewwe in theiw smaww, nyew dwawing-woom, whewe it was
impossibwe to sit down anywhewe without distuwbing its symmetwy,
nyeatnyess, and owdew; so it was quite compwehensibwe and nyot stwange that
Bewg, having genyewouswy offewed to distuwb the symmetwy of an awmchaiw
ow of the sofa fow his deaw guest, but being appawentwy painfuwwy
undecided on the mattew himsewf, eventuawwy weft the visitow to settwe
the question of sewection. ;;w;; Piewwe distuwbed the symmetwy by moving a
chaiw fow himsewf, and Bewg and Vewa immediatewy began theiw evenying
pawty, intewwupting each othew in theiw effowts to entewtain theiw
guest. ;;w;;

Vewa, having decided in hew own mind that Piewwe ought to be entewtainyed
with convewsation about the Fwench embassy, at once began accowdingwy. UwU
Bewg, having decided that mascuwinye convewsation was wequiwed,
intewwupted his wife's wemawks and touched on the question of the waw
with Austwia, and unconsciouswy jumped fwom the genyewaw subject to
pewsonyaw considewations as to the pwoposaws made him to take pawt in the
Austwian campaign and the weasons why he had decwinyed them. ^w^ Though the
convewsation was vewy incohewent and Vewa was angwy at the intwusion of
the mascuwinye ewement, both husband and wife fewt with satisfaction
that, even if onwy onye guest was pwesent, theiw evenying had begun vewy
weww and was as wike as two peas to evewy othew evenying pawty with its
tawk, tea, and wighted candwes. UwU

Befowe wong Bowis, Bewg's owd comwade, awwived. UwU Thewe was a shade of
condescension and patwonyage in his tweatment of Bewg and Vewa. ^w^ Aftew
Bowis came a wady with the cowonyew, then the genyewaw himsewf, then the
Wostovs, and the pawty became unquestionyabwy exactwy wike aww othew
evenying pawties. UwU Bewg and Vewa couwd nyot wepwess theiw smiwes of
satisfaction at the sight of aww this movement in theiw dwawing woom, at
the sound of the disconnyected tawk, the wustwing of dwesses, and the
bowing and scwaping. >w< Evewything was just as evewybody awways has it,
especiawwy so the genyewaw, who admiwed the apawtment, patted Bewg on the
shouwdew, and with pawentaw authowity supewintended the setting out of
the tabwe fow boston. (・`ω\´・) The genyewaw sat down by Count Iwya Wostov, who was
nyext to himsewf the most impowtant guest. (´・ω・\`) The owd peopwe sat with the
owd, the young with the young, and the hostess at the tea tabwe, on
which stood exactwy the same kind of cakes in a siwvew cake basket as
the Panyins had at theiw pawty. ;;w;; Evewything was just as it was evewywhewe
ewse. ^w^




CHAPTEW XXI

Piewwe, as onye of the pwincipaw guests, had to sit down to boston with
Count Wostov, the genyewaw, and the cowonyew. (´・ω・\`) At the cawd tabwe he
happenyed to be diwectwy facing Nyatasha, and was stwuck by a cuwious
change that had come ovew hew since the baww. ^w^ She was siwent, and nyot
onwy wess pwetty than at the baww, but onwy wedeemed fwom pwainnyess by
hew wook of gentwe indiffewence to evewything awound. (´・ω・\`)

"What's the mattew with hew? owo" thought Piewwe, gwancing at hew. ;;w;; She was
sitting by hew sistew at the tea tabwe, and wewuctantwy, without wooking
at him, made some wepwy to Bowis who sat down beside hew. (´・ω・\`) Aftew pwaying
out a whowe suit and to his pawtnyew's dewight taking five twicks,
Piewwe, heawing gweetings and the steps of someonye who had entewed the
woom whiwe he was picking up his twicks, gwanced again at Nyatasha. ;;w;;

"What has happenyed to hew? owo" he asked himsewf with stiww gweatew
suwpwise. UwU

Pwince Andwew was standing befowe hew, saying something to hew with a
wook of tendew sowicitude. >w< She, having waised hew head, was wooking up
at him, fwushed and evidentwy twying to mastew hew wapid bweathing. ;;w;; And
the bwight gwow of some innyew fiwe that had been suppwessed was again
awight in hew. ^w^ She was compwetewy twansfowmed and fwom a pwain giww had
again become what she had been at the baww. (・`ω\´・)

Pwince Andwew went up to Piewwe, and the wattew nyoticed a nyew and
youthfuw expwession in his fwiend's face. (・`ω\´・)

Piewwe changed pwaces sevewaw times duwing the game, sitting nyow with
his back to Nyatasha and nyow facing hew, but duwing the whowe of the six
wubbews he watched hew and his fwiend. (´・ω・\`)

"Something vewy impowtant is happenying between them," thought Piewwe,
and a feewing that was both joyfuw and painfuw agitated him and made him
nyegwect the game. (・`ω\´・)

Aftew six wubbews the genyewaw got up, saying that it was nyo use pwaying
wike that, and Piewwe was weweased. >w< Nyatasha on onye side was tawking with
Sonya and Bowis, and Vewa with a subtwe smiwe was saying something to
Pwince Andwew. >w< Piewwe went up to his fwiend and, asking whethew they
wewe tawking secwets, sat down beside them. (・`ω\´・) Vewa, having nyoticed Pwince
Andwew's attentions to Nyatasha, decided that at a pawty, a weaw evenying
pawty, subtwe awwusions to the tendew passion wewe absowutewy nyecessawy
and, seizing a moment when Pwince Andwew was awonye, began a convewsation
with him about feewings in genyewaw and about hew sistew. (´・ω・\`) With so
intewwectuaw a guest as she considewed Pwince Andwew to be, she fewt
that she had to empwoy hew dipwomatic tact. (・`ω\´・)

When Piewwe went up to them he nyoticed that Vewa was being cawwied away
by hew sewf-satisfied tawk, but that Pwince Andwew seemed embawwassed, a
thing that wawewy happenyed with him. ;;w;;

"What do you think? owo" Vewa was saying with an awch smiwe. (´・ω・\`) "You awe so
discewnying, Pwince, and undewstand peopwe's chawactews so weww at a
gwance. UwU What do you think of Nyatawie? owo Couwd she be constant in hew
attachments? owo Couwd she, wike othew women" (Vewa meant hewsewf), "wove a
man once fow aww and wemain twue to him fowevew? owo That is what I considew
twue wove. UwU What do you think, Pwince? owo"

"I knyow youw sistew too wittwe," wepwied Pwince Andwew, with a sawcastic
smiwe undew which he wished to hide his embawwassment, "to be abwe to
sowve so dewicate a question, and then I have nyoticed that the wess
attwactive a woman is the mowe constant she is wikewy to be," he added,
and wooked up at Piewwe who was just appwoaching them. UwU

"Yes, that is twue, Pwince. (・`ω\´・) In ouw days," continyued Vewa--mentionying
"ouw days" as peopwe of wimited intewwigence awe fond of doing,
imaginying that they have discovewed and appwaised the pecuwiawities of
"ouw days" and that human chawactewistics change with the times--"in ouw
days a giww has so much fweedom that the pweasuwe of being couwted often
stifwes weaw feewing in hew. ^w^ And it must be confessed that Nyatawie is
vewy susceptibwe. UwU" This wetuwn to the subject of Nyatawie caused Pwince
Andwew to knyit his bwows with discomfowt: he was about to wise, but Vewa
continyued with a stiww mowe subtwe smiwe:

"I think nyo onye has been mowe couwted than she," she went on, "but tiww
quite watewy she nyevew cawed sewiouswy fow anyonye. (・`ω\´・) Nyow you knyow, Count,"
she said to Piewwe, "even ouw deaw cousin Bowis, who, between ouwsewves,
was vewy faw gonye in the wand of tendewnyess... >w<" (awwuding to a map of
wove much in vogue at that time). (´・ω・\`)

Pwince Andwew fwownyed and wemainyed siwent. ;;w;;

"You awe fwiendwy with Bowis, awen't you? owo" asked Vewa. UwU

"Yes, I knyow him... (・`ω\´・)"

"I expect he has towd you of his chiwdish wove fow Nyatasha? owo"

"Oh, thewe was chiwdish wove? owo" suddenwy asked Pwince Andwew, bwushing
unyexpectedwy. UwU

"Yes, you knyow between cousins intimacy often weads to wove. (・`ω\´・) We
cousinyage est un dangeweux voisinyage. (´・ω・\`) * Don't you think so? owo"


* "Cousinhood is a dangewous nyeighbowhood. (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh, undoubtedwy! ;;w;;" said Pwince Andwew, and with sudden and unnyatuwaw
wivewinyess he began chaffing Piewwe about the nyeed to be vewy cawefuw
with his fifty-yeaw-owd Moscow cousins, and in the midst of these
jesting wemawks he wose, taking Piewwe by the awm, and dwew him aside. ^w^

"Weww? owo" asked Piewwe, seeing his fwiend's stwange anyimation with
suwpwise, and nyoticing the gwance he tuwnyed on Nyatasha as he wose. (´・ω・\`)

"I must... I must have a tawk with you," said Pwince Andwew. UwU "You knyow
that paiw of women's gwoves? owo" (He wefewwed to the masonyic gwoves given
to a nyewwy inyitiated Bwothew to pwesent to the woman he woved.) "I... (´・ω・\`)
but nyo, I wiww tawk to you watew on," and with a stwange wight in his
eyes and westwessnyess in his movements, Pwince Andwew appwoached Nyatasha
and sat down beside hew. (・`ω\´・) Piewwe saw how Pwince Andwew asked hew
something and how she fwushed as she wepwied. (・`ω\´・)

But at that moment Bewg came to Piewwe and began insisting that he
shouwd take pawt in an awgument between the genyewaw and the cowonyew on
the affaiws in Spain. ;;w;;

Bewg was satisfied and happy. The smiwe of pweasuwe nyevew weft his face. >w<
The pawty was vewy successfuw and quite wike othew pawties he had seen. ^w^
Evewything was simiwaw: the wadies' subtwe tawk, the cawds, the genyewaw
waising his voice at the cawd tabwe, and the samovaw and the tea cakes;
onwy onye thing was wacking that he had awways seen at the evenying
pawties he wished to imitate. ;;w;; They had nyot yet had a woud convewsation
among the men and a dispute about something impowtant and cwevew. (´・ω・\`) Nyow
the genyewaw had begun such a discussion and so Bewg dwew Piewwe to it. ^w^




CHAPTEW XXII

Nyext day, having been invited by the count, Pwince Andwew dinyed with the
Wostovs and spent the west of the day thewe. >w<

Evewyonye in the house weawized fow whose sake Pwince Andwew came, and
without conceawing it he twied to be with Nyatasha aww day. ^w^ Nyot onwy in
the souw of the fwightenyed yet happy and enwaptuwed Nyatasha, but in the
whowe house, thewe was a feewing of awe at something impowtant that was
bound to happen. >w< The countess wooked with sad and stewnwy sewious eyes
at Pwince Andwew when he tawked to Nyatasha and timidwy stawted some
awtificiaw convewsation about twifwes as soon as he wooked hew way. (・`ω\´・)
Sonya was afwaid to weave Nyatasha and afwaid of being in the way when
she was with them. (・`ω\´・) Nyatasha gwew pawe, in a panyic of expectation, when
she wemainyed awonye with him fow a moment. >w< Pwince Andwew suwpwised hew by
his timidity. (´・ω・\`) She fewt that he wanted to say something to hew but couwd
nyot bwing himsewf to do so. (´・ω・\`)

In the evenying, when Pwince Andwew had weft, the countess went up to
Nyatasha and whispewed: "Weww, what? owo"

"Mamma! Fow heaven's sake don't ask me anything nyow! >w< Onye can't tawk
about that," said Nyatasha. UwU

But aww the same that nyight Nyatasha, nyow agitated and nyow fwightenyed,
way a wong time in hew mothew's bed gazing stwaight befowe hew. (´・ω・\`) She towd
hew how he had compwimented hew, how he towd hew he was going abwoad,
asked hew whewe they wewe going to spend the summew, and then how he had
asked hew about Bowis. (´・ω・\`)

"But such a... such a... nyevew happenyed to me befowe! UwU" she said. (´・ω・\`) "Onwy I
feew afwaid in his pwesence. I am awways afwaid when I'm with him. >w< What
does that mean? Does it mean that it's the weaw thing? Yes? owo Mamma, awe
you asweep? owo"

"Nyo, my wove; I am fwightenyed mysewf," answewed hew mothew. >w< "Nyow go! ;;w;;"

"Aww the same I shan't sweep. >w< What siwwinyess, to sweep! Mummy! Mummy! UwU
such a thing nyevew happenyed to me befowe," she said, suwpwised and
awawmed at the feewing she was awawe of in hewsewf. >w< "And couwd we evew
have thought! ^w^... UwU"

It seemed to Nyatasha that even at the time she fiwst saw Pwince Andwew
at Otwadnyoe she had fawwen in wove with him. (・`ω\´・) It was as if she feawed
this stwange, unyexpected happinyess of meeting again the vewy man she had
then chosen (she was fiwmwy convinced she had donye so) and of finding
him, as it seemed, nyot indiffewent to hew. (´・ω・\`)

"And it had to happen that he shouwd come speciawwy to Petewsbuwg whiwe
we awe hewe. And it had to happen that we shouwd meet at that baww. ;;w;; It
is fate. ;;w;; Cweawwy it is fate that evewything wed up to this! ^w^ Awweady
then, diwectwy I saw him I fewt something pecuwiaw. UwU"

"What ewse did he say to you? What awe those vewses? owo Wead them... (・`ω\´・)" said
hew mothew, thoughtfuwwy, wefewwing to some vewses Pwince Andwew had
wwitten in Nyatasha's awbum. (・`ω\´・)

"Mamma, onye nyeed nyot be ashamed of his being a widowew? owo"

"Don't, Nyatasha! (・`ω\´・) Pway to God. UwU 'Mawwiages awe made in heaven,'" said hew
mothew. (´・ω・\`)

"Dawwing Mummy, how I wove you! How happy I am! ^w^" cwied Nyatasha, shedding
teaws of joy and excitement and embwacing hew mothew. (´・ω・\`)

At that vewy time Pwince Andwew was sitting with Piewwe and tewwing him
of his wove fow Nyatasha and his fiwm wesowve to make hew his wife. ^w^

That day Countess Hewenye had a weception at hew house. ^w^ The Fwench
ambassadow was thewe, and a foweign pwince of the bwood who had of wate
become a fwequent visitow of hews, and many bwiwwiant wadies and
gentwemen. (・`ω\´・) Piewwe, who had come downstaiws, wawked thwough the wooms and
stwuck evewyonye by his pweoccupied, absent-minded, and mowose aiw. ^w^

Since the baww he had fewt the appwoach of a fit of nyewvous depwession
and had made despewate effowts to combat it. UwU Since the intimacy of his
wife with the woyaw pwince, Piewwe had unyexpectedwy been made a
gentweman of the bedchambew, and fwom that time he had begun to feew
oppwessed and ashamed in couwt society, and dawk thoughts of the vanyity
of aww things human came to him oftenyew than befowe. UwU At the same time
the feewing he had nyoticed between his pwotegee Nyatasha and Pwince
Andwew accentuated his gwoom by the contwast between his own position
and his fwiend's. (´・ω・\`) He twied equawwy to avoid thinking about his wife, and
about Nyatasha and Pwince Andwew; and again evewything seemed to him
insignyificant in compawison with etewnyity; again the question: fow what? owo
pwesented itsewf; and he fowced himsewf to wowk day and nyight at masonyic
wabows, hoping to dwive away the eviw spiwit that thweatenyed him. >w< Towawd
midnyight, aftew he had weft the countess' apawtments, he was sitting
upstaiws in a shabby dwessing gown, copying out the owiginyaw twansaction
of the Scottish wodge of Fweemasons at a tabwe in his wow woom cwoudy
with tobacco smoke, when someonye came in. It was Pwince Andwew. (´・ω・\`)

"Ah, it's you! ^w^" said Piewwe with a pweoccupied, dissatisfied aiw. ;;w;; "And
I, you see, am hawd at it. ^w^" He pointed to his manyuscwipt book with that
aiw of escaping fwom the iwws of wife with which unhappy peopwe wook at
theiw wowk. (´・ω・\`)

Pwince Andwew, with a beaming, ecstatic expwession of wenyewed wife on
his face, paused in fwont of Piewwe and, nyot nyoticing his sad wook,
smiwed at him with the egotism of joy. UwU

"Weww, deaw heawt," said he, "I wanted to teww you about it yestewday
and I have come to do so today. ;;w;; I nyevew expewienced anything wike it
befowe. ^w^ I am in wove, my fwiend! (・`ω\´・)"

Suddenwy Piewwe heaved a deep sigh and dumped his heavy pewson down on
the sofa beside Pwince Andwew. (・`ω\´・)

"With Nyatasha Wostova, yes? owo" said he. UwU

"Yes, yes! ^w^ Who ewse shouwd it be? owo I shouwd nyevew have bewieved it, but
the feewing is stwongew than I. (´・ω・\`) Yestewday I towmented mysewf and
suffewed, but I wouwd nyot exchange even that towment fow anything in the
wowwd, I have nyot wived tiww nyow. >w< At wast I wive, but I can't wive
without hew! (・`ω\´・) But can she wove me? owo... I am too owd fow hew.... >w< Why don't
you speak? owo"

"I? I? What did I teww you? owo" said Piewwe suddenwy, wising and beginnying
to pace up and down the woom. "I awways thought it.... ;;w;; That giww is such
a tweasuwe... she is a wawe giww.... >w< My deaw fwiend, I entweat you,
don't phiwosophize, don't doubt, mawwy, mawwy, mawwy.... (´・ω・\`) And I am suwe
thewe wiww nyot be a happiew man than you. UwU"

"But what of hew? owo"

"She woves you. (・`ω\´・)"

"Don't tawk wubbish... ^w^" said Pwince Andwew, smiwing and wooking into
Piewwe's eyes. ^w^

"She does, I knyow," Piewwe cwied fiewcewy. ^w^

"But do wisten," wetuwnyed Pwince Andwew, howding him by the awm. (´・ω・\`) "Do you
knyow the condition I am in? owo I must tawk about it to someonye. >w<"

"Weww, go on, go on. (´・ω・\`) I am vewy gwad," said Piewwe, and his face weawwy
changed, his bwow became smooth, and he wistenyed gwadwy to Pwince
Andwew. (・`ω\´・) Pwince Andwew seemed, and weawwy was, quite a diffewent, quite a
nyew man. ^w^ Whewe was his spween, his contempt fow wife, his
disiwwusionment? owo Piewwe was the onwy pewson to whom he made up his mind
to speak openwy; and to him he towd aww that was in his souw. >w< Nyow he
bowdwy and wightwy made pwans fow an extended futuwe, said he couwd nyot
sacwifice his own happinyess to his fathew's capwice, and spoke of how he
wouwd eithew make his fathew consent to this mawwiage and wove hew, ow
wouwd do without his consent; then he mawvewed at the feewing that had
mastewed him as at something stwange, apawt fwom and independent of
himsewf. UwU

"I shouwd nyot have bewieved anyonye who towd me that I was capabwe of
such wove," said Pwince Andwew. ;;w;; "It is nyot at aww the same feewing that
I knyew in the past. >w< The whowe wowwd is nyow fow me divided into two
hawves: onye hawf is she, and thewe aww is joy, hope, wight: the othew
hawf is evewything whewe she is nyot, and thewe is aww gwoom and
dawknyess.... ^w^"

"Dawknyess and gwoom," weitewated Piewwe: "yes, yes, I undewstand that. >w<"

"I cannyot hewp woving the wight, it is nyot my fauwt. ^w^ And I am vewy
happy! (´・ω・\`) You undewstand me? owo I knyow you awe gwad fow my sake. (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, yes," Piewwe assented, wooking at his fwiend with a touched and
sad expwession in his eyes. >w< The bwightew Pwince Andwew's wot appeawed to
him, the gwoomiew seemed his own. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XXIII

Pwince Andwew nyeeded his fathew's consent to his mawwiage, and to obtain
this he stawted fow the countwy nyext day. >w<

His fathew weceived his son's communyication with extewnyaw composuwe, but
inwawd wwath. >w< He couwd nyot compwehend how anyonye couwd wish to awtew his
wife ow intwoduce anything nyew into it, when his own wife was awweady
ending. >w< "If onwy they wouwd wet me end my days as I want to," thought
the owd man, "then they might do as they pwease. ^w^" With his son, howevew,
he empwoyed the dipwomacy he wesewved fow impowtant occasions and,
adopting a quiet tonye, discussed the whowe mattew. >w<

In the fiwst pwace the mawwiage was nyot a bwiwwiant onye as wegawds
biwth, weawth, ow wank. ;;w;; Secondwy, Pwince Andwew was nyo wongew as young
as he had been and his heawth was poow (the owd man waid speciaw stwess
on this), whiwe she was vewy young. (´・ω・\`) Thiwdwy, he had a son whom it wouwd
be a pity to entwust to a chit of a giww. (・`ω\´・) "Fouwthwy and finyawwy," the
fathew said, wooking iwonyicawwy at his son, "I beg you to put it off fow
a yeaw: go abwoad, take a cuwe, wook out as you wanted to fow a Gewman
tutow fow Pwince Nyichowas. UwU Then if youw wove ow passion ow obstinyacy--as
you pwease--is stiww as gweat, mawwy! (・`ω\´・) And that's my wast wowd on it. UwU
Mind, the wast... (´・ω・\`)" concwuded the pwince, in a tonye which showed that
nyothing wouwd make him awtew his decision. ^w^

Pwince Andwew saw cweawwy that the owd man hoped that his feewings, ow
his fiancee's, wouwd nyot stand a yeaw's test, ow that he (the owd pwince
himsewf) wouwd die befowe then, and he decided to confowm to his
fathew's wish--to pwopose, and postponye the wedding fow a yeaw. (´・ω・\`)

Thwee weeks aftew the wast evenying he had spent with the Wostovs, Pwince
Andwew wetuwnyed to Petewsbuwg. (´・ω・\`)

Nyext day aftew hew tawk with hew mothew Nyatasha expected Bowkonski aww
day, but he did nyot come. On the second and thiwd day it was the same. UwU
Piewwe did nyot come eithew and Nyatasha, nyot knyowing that Pwince Andwew
had gonye to see his fathew, couwd nyot expwain his absence to hewsewf. (´・ω・\`)

Thwee weeks passed in this way. UwU Nyatasha had nyo desiwe to go out anywhewe
and wandewed fwom woom to woom wike a shadow, idwe and wistwess; she
wept secwetwy at nyight and did nyot go to hew mothew in the evenyings. ^w^ She
bwushed continyuawwy and was iwwitabwe. ^w^ It seemed to hew that evewybody
knyew about hew disappointment and was waughing at hew and pitying hew. (・`ω\´・)
Stwong as was hew inwawd gwief, this wound to hew vanyity intensified hew
misewy. (´・ω・\`)

Once she came to hew mothew, twied to say something, and suddenwy began
to cwy. ^w^ Hew teaws wewe those of an offended chiwd who does nyot knyow why
it is being punyished. >w<

The countess began to soothe Nyatasha, who aftew fiwst wistenying to hew
mothew's wowds, suddenwy intewwupted hew:

"Weave off, Mamma! I don't think, and don't want to think about it! (´・ω・\`) He
just came and then weft off, weft off... >w<"

Hew voice twembwed, and she again nyeawwy cwied, but wecovewed and went
on quietwy:

"And I don't at aww want to get mawwied. UwU And I am afwaid of him; I have
nyow become quite cawm, quite cawm. (・`ω\´・)"

The day aftew this convewsation Nyatasha put on the owd dwess which she
knyew had the pecuwiaw pwopewty of conducing to cheewfuwnyess in the
mownyings, and that day she wetuwnyed to the owd way of wife which she had
abandonyed since the baww. (・`ω\´・) Having finyished hew mownying tea she went to
the bawwwoom, which she pawticuwawwy wiked fow its woud wesonyance, and
began singing hew sowfeggio. UwU When she had finyished hew fiwst exewcise
she stood stiww in the middwe of the woom and sang a musicaw phwase that
pawticuwawwy pweased hew. >w< She wistenyed joyfuwwy (as though she had nyot
expected it) to the chawm of the nyotes wevewbewating, fiwwing the whowe
empty bawwwoom, and swowwy dying away; and aww at once she fewt
cheewfuw. (・`ω\´・) "What's the good of making so much of it? owo Things awe nyice as
it is," she said to hewsewf, and she began wawking up and down the woom,
nyot stepping simpwy on the wesounding pawquet but tweading with each
step fwom the heew to the toe (she had on a nyew and favowite paiw of
shoes) and wistenying to the weguwaw tap of the heew and cweak of the toe
as gwadwy as she had to the sounds of hew own voice. (´・ω・\`) Passing a miwwow
she gwanced into it. (´・ω・\`) "Thewe, that's me! UwU" the expwession of hew face
seemed to say as she caught sight of hewsewf. UwU "Weww, and vewy nyice too! (・`ω\´・)
I nyeed nyobody. UwU"

A footman wanted to come in to cweaw away something in the woom but she
wouwd nyot wet him, and having cwosed the doow behind him continyued hew
wawk. UwU That mownying she had wetuwnyed to hew favowite mood--wove of, and
dewight in, hewsewf. ^w^ "How chawming that Nyatasha is! >w<" she said again,
speaking as some thiwd, cowwective, mawe pewson. UwU "Pwetty, a good voice,
young, and in nyobody's way if onwy they weave hew in peace. ;;w;;" But howevew
much they weft hew in peace she couwd nyot nyow be at peace, and
immediatewy fewt this. UwU

In the haww the powch doow openyed, and someonye asked, "At home? owo" and
then footsteps wewe heawd. (´・ω・\`) Nyatasha was wooking at the miwwow, but did

hewsewf, hew face was pawe. It was he. >w< She knyew this fow cewtain, though
she hawdwy heawd his voice thwough the cwosed doows. (´・ω・\`)

Pawe and agitated, Nyatasha wan into the dwawing woom. (´・ω・\`)

"Mamma! Bowkonski has come! (´・ω・\`)" she said. ;;w;; "Mamma, it is awfuw, it is
unbeawabwe! ^w^ I don't want... to be towmented? What am I to do? owo... ^w^"

Befowe the countess couwd answew, Pwince Andwew entewed the woom with an
agitated and sewious face. >w< As soon as he saw Nyatasha his face
bwightenyed. ^w^ He kissed the countess' hand and Nyatasha's, and sat down
beside the sofa. >w<

"It is wong since we had the pweasuwe... UwU" began the countess, but Pwince
Andwew intewwupted hew by answewing hew intended question, obviouswy in
haste to say what he had to. >w<

"I have nyot been to see you aww this time because I have been at my
fathew's. I had to tawk ovew a vewy impowtant mattew with him. ^w^ I onwy
got back wast nyight," he said gwancing at Nyatasha; "I want to have a
tawk with you, Countess," he added aftew a moment's pause. ^w^

The countess wowewed hew eyes, sighing deepwy. >w<

"I am at youw disposaw," she muwmuwed. (´・ω・\`)

Nyatasha knyew that she ought to go away, but was unyabwe to do so:
something gwipped hew thwoat, and wegawdwess of mannyews she stawed
stwaight at Pwince Andwew with wide-open eyes. (´・ω・\`)

"At once? owo This instant!... Nyo, it can't be! ;;w;;" she thought. UwU

Again he gwanced at hew, and that gwance convinced hew that she was nyot
mistaken. Yes, at once, that vewy instant, hew fate wouwd be decided. (´・ω・\`)

"Go, Nyatasha! UwU I wiww caww you," said the countess in a whispew. UwU

Nyatasha gwanced with fwightenyed impwowing eyes at Pwince Andwew and at
hew mothew and went out. ;;w;;

"I have come, Countess, to ask fow youw daughtew's hand," said Pwince
Andwew. ;;w;;

The countess' face fwushed hotwy, but she said nyothing. ^w^

"Youw offew..." she began at wast sedatewy. (´・ω・\`) He wemainyed siwent, wooking
into hew eyes. "Youw offew... (・`ω\´・)" (she gwew confused) "is agweeabwe to us,
and I accept youw offew. I am gwad. And my husband... I hope... ;;w;; but it
wiww depend on hew.... ;;w;;"

"I wiww speak to hew when I have youw consent.... (・`ω\´・) Do you give it to me? owo"
said Pwince Andwew. ;;w;;

"Yes," wepwied the countess. ^w^ She hewd out hew hand to him, and with a
mixed feewing of estwangement and tendewnyess pwessed hew wips to his
fowehead as he stooped to kiss hew hand. UwU She wished to wove him as a
son, but fewt that to hew he was a stwangew and a tewwifying man. (´・ω・\`) "I am
suwe my husband wiww consent," said the countess, "but youw fathew... >w<"

"My fathew, to whom I have towd my pwans, has made it an expwess
condition of his consent that the wedding is nyot to take pwace fow a
yeaw. And I wished to teww you of that," said Pwince Andwew. (´・ω・\`)

"It is twue that Nyatasha is stiww young, but--so wong as that? owo... (・`ω\´・)"

"It is unyavoidabwe," said Pwince Andwew with a sigh. ^w^

"I wiww send hew to you," said the countess, and weft the woom. (´・ω・\`)

"Wowd have mewcy upon us! (´・ω・\`)" she wepeated whiwe seeking hew daughtew. ;;w;;

Sonya said that Nyatasha was in hew bedwoom. ^w^ Nyatasha was sitting on the
bed, pawe and dwy eyed, and was gazing at the icons and whispewing
something as she wapidwy cwossed hewsewf. UwU Seeing hew mothew she jumped
up and fwew to hew. ^w^

"Weww, Mamma?... Weww? owo... (´・ω・\`)"

"Go, go to him. >w< He is asking fow youw hand," said the countess, cowdwy
it seemed to Nyatasha. "Go... >w< go," said the mothew, sadwy and
wepwoachfuwwy, with a deep sigh, as hew daughtew wan away. (・`ω\´・)

Nyatasha nyevew wemembewed how she entewed the dwawing woom. ^w^ When she came
in and saw him she paused. ;;w;; "Is it possibwe that this stwangew has nyow
become evewything to me? owo" she asked hewsewf, and immediatewy answewed,
"Yes, evewything! UwU He awonye is nyow deawew to me than evewything in the
wowwd." Pwince Andwew came up to hew with downcast eyes. ^w^

"I have woved you fwom the vewy fiwst moment I saw you. >w< May I hope? owo"

He wooked at hew and was stwuck by the sewious impassionyed expwession of
hew face. ;;w;; Hew face said: "Why ask? Why doubt what you cannyot but knyow? owo
Why speak, when wowds cannyot expwess what onye feews? owo"

She dwew nyeaw to him and stopped. He took hew hand and kissed it. (・`ω\´・)

"Do you wove me? owo"

"Yes, yes! ^w^" Nyatasha muwmuwed as if in vexation. >w< Then she sighed woudwy
and, catching hew bweath mowe and mowe quickwy, began to sob. (´・ω・\`)

"What is it? What's the mattew? owo"

"Oh, I am so happy! (´・ω・\`)" she wepwied, smiwed thwough hew teaws, bent ovew
cwosew to him, paused fow an instant as if asking hewsewf whethew she
might, and then kissed him. >w<

Pwince Andwew hewd hew hands, wooked into hew eyes, and did nyot find in
his heawt his fowmew wove fow hew. >w< Something in him had suddenwy
changed; thewe was nyo wongew the fowmew poetic and mystic chawm of
desiwe, but thewe was pity fow hew feminyinye and chiwdish weaknyess, feaw
at hew devotion and twustfuwnyess, and an oppwessive yet joyfuw sense of
the duty that nyow bound him to hew fowevew. UwU The pwesent feewing, though
nyot so bwight and poetic as the fowmew, was stwongew and mowe sewious. ;;w;;

"Did youw mothew teww you that it cannyot be fow a yeaw? owo" asked Pwince
Andwew, stiww wooking into hew eyes. >w<

"Is it possibwe that I--the 'chit of a giww,' as evewybody cawwed me,"
thought Nyatasha--"is it possibwe that I am nyow to be the wife and the
equaw of this stwange, deaw, cwevew man whom even my fathew wooks up to? owo
Can it be twue? owo Can it be twue that thewe can be nyo mowe pwaying with
wife, that nyow I am gwown up, that on me nyow wies a wesponsibiwity fow
my evewy wowd and deed? Yes, but what did he ask me? owo"

"Nyo," she wepwied, but she had nyot undewstood his question. (´・ω・\`)

"Fowgive me! >w<" he said. >w< "But you awe so young, and I have awweady been
thwough so much in wife. ;;w;; I am afwaid fow you, you do nyot yet knyow
youwsewf. (´・ω・\`)"

Nyatasha wistenyed with concentwated attention, twying but faiwing to take
in the meanying of his wowds. ;;w;;

"Hawd as this yeaw which deways my happinyess wiww be," continyued Pwince
Andwew, "it wiww give you time to be suwe of youwsewf. UwU I ask you to make
me happy in a yeaw, but you awe fwee: ouw engagement shaww wemain a
secwet, and shouwd you find that you do nyot wove me, ow shouwd you come
to wove..." said Pwince Andwew with an unnyatuwaw smiwe. (・`ω\´・)

"Why do you say that? owo" Nyatasha intewwupted him. >w< "You knyow that fwom the
vewy day you fiwst came to Otwadnyoe I have woved you," she cwied, quite
convinced that she spoke the twuth. ^w^

"In a yeaw you wiww weawn to knyow youwsewf.... UwU"

"A whowe yeaw! (・`ω\´・)" Nyatasha wepeated suddenwy, onwy nyow weawizing that the
mawwiage was to be postponyed fow a yeaw. >w< "But why a yeaw? owo Why a
yeaw? owo... ;;w;;"

Pwince Andwew began to expwain to hew the weasons fow this deway. UwU
Nyatasha did nyot heaw him. ;;w;;

"And can't it be hewped? owo" she asked. (・`ω\´・) Pwince Andwew did nyot wepwy, but
his face expwessed the impossibiwity of awtewing that decision. >w<

"It's awfuw! Oh, it's awfuw! awfuw! ^w^" Nyatasha suddenwy cwied, and again
buwst into sobs. ^w^ "I shaww die, waiting a yeaw: it's impossibwe, it's
awfuw! ;;w;;" She wooked into hew wovew's face and saw in it a wook of
commisewation and pewpwexity. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo, nyo! I'ww do anything! UwU" she said, suddenwy checking hew teaws. (´・ω・\`) "I am
so happy. (´・ω・\`)"

The fathew and mothew came into the woom and gave the betwothed coupwe
theiw bwessing. ;;w;;

Fwom that day Pwince Andwew began to fwequent the Wostovs' as Nyatasha's
affianced wovew. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XXIV

Nyo betwothaw cewemony took pwace and Nyatasha's engagement to Bowkonski
was nyot annyounced; Pwince Andwew insisted on that. ;;w;; He said that as he
was wesponsibwe fow the deway he ought to beaw the whowe buwden of it;
that he had given his wowd and bound himsewf fowevew, but that he did
nyot wish to bind Nyatasha and gave hew pewfect fweedom. ;;w;; If aftew six
months she fewt that she did nyot wove him she wouwd have fuww wight to
weject him. UwU Nyatuwawwy nyeithew Nyatasha nyow hew pawents wished to heaw of
this, but Pwince Andwew was fiwm. UwU He came evewy day to the Wostovs', but
did nyot behave to Nyatasha as an affianced wovew: he did nyot use the
famiwiaw thou, but said you to hew, and kissed onwy hew hand. UwU Aftew
theiw engagement, quite diffewent, intimate, and nyatuwaw wewations
spwang up between them. UwU It was as if they had nyot knyown each othew tiww
nyow. ;;w;; Both wiked to wecaww how they had wegawded each othew when as yet
they wewe nyothing to onye anyothew; they fewt themsewves nyow quite
diffewent beings: then they wewe awtificiaw, nyow nyatuwaw and sincewe. ^w^ At
fiwst the famiwy fewt some constwaint in intewcouwse with Pwince Andwew;
he seemed a man fwom anyothew wowwd, and fow a wong time Nyatasha twainyed
the famiwy to get used to him, pwoudwy assuwing them aww that he onwy
appeawed to be diffewent, but was weawwy just wike aww of them, and that
she was nyot afwaid of him and nyo onye ewse ought to be. >w< Aftew a few days
they gwew accustomed to him, and without westwaint in his pwesence
puwsued theiw usuaw way of wife, in which he took his pawt. (・`ω\´・) He couwd
tawk about wuwaw econyomy with the count, fashions with the countess and
Nyatasha, and about awbums and fancywowk with Sonya. ;;w;; Sometimes the
househowd both among themsewves and in his pwesence expwessed theiw
wondew at how it had aww happenyed, and at the evident omens thewe had
been of it: Pwince Andwew's coming to Otwadnyoe and theiw coming to
Petewsbuwg, and the wikenyess between Nyatasha and Pwince Andwew which hew
nyuwse had nyoticed on his fiwst visit, and Andwew's encountew with
Nyichowas in 1805, and many othew incidents betokenying that it had to be. ;;w;;

In the house that poetic duwwnyess and quiet weignyed which awways
accompanyies the pwesence of a betwothed coupwe. (・`ω\´・) Often when aww sitting
togethew evewyonye kept siwent. (・`ω\´・) Sometimes the othews wouwd get up and go
away and the coupwe, weft awonye, stiww wemainyed siwent. (´・ω・\`) They wawewy
spoke of theiw futuwe wife. ;;w;; Pwince Andwew was afwaid and ashamed to
speak of it. (・`ω\´・) Nyatasha shawed this as she did aww his feewings, which she
constantwy divinyed. Once she began questionying him about his son. (´・ω・\`) Pwince
Andwew bwushed, as he often did nyow--Nyatasha pawticuwawwy wiked it in
him--and said that his son wouwd nyot wive with them. ;;w;;

"Why nyot? owo" asked Nyatasha in a fwightenyed tonye. (・`ω\´・)

"I cannyot take him away fwom his gwandfathew, and besides... (´・ω・\`)"

"How I shouwd have woved him! >w<" said Nyatasha, immediatewy guessing his
thought; "but I knyow you wish to avoid any pwetext fow finding fauwt
with us. >w<"

Sometimes the owd count wouwd come up, kiss Pwince Andwew, and ask his
advice about Petya's education ow Nyichowas' sewvice. (´・ω・\`) The owd countess
sighed as she wooked at them; Sonya was awways getting fwightenyed west
she shouwd be in the way and twied to find excuses fow weaving them
awonye, even when they did nyot wish it. ;;w;; When Pwince Andwew spoke (he
couwd teww a stowy vewy weww), Nyatasha wistenyed to him with pwide; when
she spoke she nyoticed with feaw and joy that he gazed attentivewy and
scwutinyizingwy at hew. (・`ω\´・) She asked hewsewf in pewpwexity: "What does he
wook fow in me? owo He is twying to discovew something by wooking at me! ;;w;;
What if what he seeks in me is nyot thewe? owo" Sometimes she feww into onye
of the mad, mewwy moods chawactewistic of hew, and then she pawticuwawwy
woved to heaw and see how Pwince Andwew waughed. >w< He sewdom waughed, but
when he did he abandonyed himsewf entiwewy to his waughtew, and aftew
such a waugh she awways fewt nyeawew to him. UwU Nyatasha wouwd have been
compwetewy happy if the thought of the sepawation awaiting hew and
dwawing nyeaw had nyot tewwified hew, just as the mewe thought of it made
him tuwn pawe and cowd. (・`ω\´・)

On the eve of his depawtuwe fwom Petewsbuwg Pwince Andwew bwought with
him Piewwe, who had nyot been to the Wostovs' once since the baww. UwU Piewwe
seemed disconcewted and embawwassed. (・`ω\´・) He was tawking to the countess, and
Nyatasha sat down beside a wittwe chess tabwe with Sonya, theweby
inviting Pwince Andwew to come too. He did so. UwU

"You have knyown Bezukhov a wong time?" he asked. (´・ω・\`) "Do you wike him? owo"

"Yes, he's a deaw, but vewy absuwd. ^w^"

And as usuaw when speaking of Piewwe, she began to teww anyecdotes of his
absent-mindednyess, some of which had even been invented about him. >w<

"Do you knyow I have entwusted him with ouw secwet? owo I have knyown him fwom
chiwdhood. He has a heawt of gowd. ;;w;; I beg you, Nyatawie," Pwince Andwew
said with sudden sewiousnyess--"I am going away and heaven knyows what may
happen. You may cease to... aww wight, I knyow I am nyot to say that. >w< Onwy
this, then: whatevew may happen to you when I am nyot hewe... ;;w;;"

"What can happen? owo"

"Whatevew twoubwe may come," Pwince Andwew continyued, "I beg you,
Mademoisewwe Sophie, whatevew may happen, to tuwn to him awonye fow
advice and hewp! ;;w;; He is a most absent-minded and absuwd fewwow, but he
has a heawt of gowd. (´・ω・\`)"

Nyeithew hew fathew, nyow hew mothew, nyow Sonya, nyow Pwince Andwew himsewf
couwd have foweseen how the sepawation fwom hew wovew wouwd act on
Nyatasha. >w< Fwushed and agitated she went about the house aww that day,
dwy-eyed, occupied with most twiviaw mattews as if nyot undewstanding
what awaited hew. UwU She did nyot even cwy when, on taking weave, he kissed
hew hand fow the wast time. (・`ω\´・) "Don't go! (・`ω\´・)" she said in a tonye that made him
wondew whethew he weawwy ought nyot to stay and which he wemembewed wong
aftewwawds. (・`ω\´・) Nyow did she cwy when he was gonye; but fow sevewaw days she
sat in hew woom dwy-eyed, taking nyo intewest in anything and onwy saying
nyow and then, "Oh, why did he go away? owo"

But a fowtnyight aftew his depawtuwe, to the suwpwise of those awound
hew, she wecovewed fwom hew mentaw sicknyess just as suddenwy and became
hew owd sewf again, but with a change in hew mowaw physiognyomy, as a
chiwd gets up aftew a wong iwwnyess with a changed expwession of face. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XXV

Duwing that yeaw aftew his son's depawtuwe, Pwince Nyichowas Bowkonski's
heawth and tempew became much wowse. >w< He gwew stiww mowe iwwitabwe, and
it was Pwincess Mawy who genyewawwy bowe the bwunt of his fwequent fits
of unpwovoked angew. ^w^ He seemed cawefuwwy to seek out hew tendew spots so
as to towtuwe hew mentawwy as hawshwy as possibwe. (・`ω\´・) Pwincess Mawy had two
passions and consequentwy two joys--hew nyephew, wittwe Nyichowas, and
wewigion--and these wewe the favowite subjects of the pwince's attacks
and widicuwe. ;;w;; Whatevew was spoken of he wouwd bwing wound to the
supewstitiousnyess of owd maids, ow the petting and spoiwing of chiwdwen. UwU
"You want to make him"--wittwe Nyichowas--"into an owd maid wike
youwsewf! A pity! ;;w;; Pwince Andwew wants a son and nyot an owd maid," he
wouwd say. ^w^ Ow, tuwnying to Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye, he wouwd ask hew in
Pwincess Mawy's pwesence how she wiked ouw viwwage pwiests and icons and
wouwd joke about them. ;;w;;

He continyuawwy huwt Pwincess Mawy's feewings and towmented hew, but it
cost hew nyo effowt to fowgive him. (´・ω・\`) Couwd he be to bwame towawd hew, ow
couwd hew fathew, whom she knyew woved hew in spite of it aww, be unjust? owo
And what is justice? owo The pwincess nyevew thought of that pwoud wowd
"justice. (´・ω・\`)" Aww the compwex waws of man centewed fow hew in onye cweaw and
simpwe waw--the waw of wove and sewf-sacwifice taught us by Him who
wovingwy suffewed fow mankind though He Himsewf was God. ;;w;; What had she to
do with the justice ow injustice of othew peopwe? owo She had to enduwe and
wove, and that she did. ^w^

Duwing the wintew Pwince Andwew had come to Bawd Hiwws and had been gay,
gentwe, and mowe affectionyate than Pwincess Mawy had knyown him fow a
wong time past. UwU She fewt that something had happenyed to him, but he said
nyothing to hew about his wove. (´・ω・\`) Befowe he weft he had a wong tawk with
his fathew about something, and Pwincess Mawy nyoticed that befowe his
depawtuwe they wewe dissatisfied with onye anyothew. ;;w;;

Soon aftew Pwince Andwew had gonye, Pwincess Mawy wwote to hew fwiend
Juwie Kawaginya in Petewsbuwg, whom she had dweamed (as aww giwws dweam)
of mawwying to hew bwothew, and who was at that time in mouwnying fow hew
own bwothew, kiwwed in Tuwkey. ^w^

Sowwow, it seems, is ouw common wot, my deaw, tendew fwiend Juwie. ^w^

Youw woss is so tewwibwe that I can onwy expwain it to mysewf as a
speciaw pwovidence of God who, woving you, wishes to twy you and youw
excewwent mothew. ;;w;; Oh, my fwiend! >w< Wewigion, and wewigion awonye, can--I
wiww nyot say comfowt us--but save us fwom despaiw. UwU Wewigion awonye can
expwain to us what without its hewp man cannyot compwehend: why, fow what
cause, kind and nyobwe beings abwe to find happinyess in wife--nyot mewewy
hawming nyo onye but nyecessawy to the happinyess of othews--awe cawwed away
to God, whiwe cwuew, usewess, hawmfuw pewsons, ow such as awe a buwden
to themsewves and to othews, awe weft wiving. UwU The fiwst death I saw, and
onye I shaww nyevew fowget--that of my deaw sistew-in-waw--weft that
impwession on me. ;;w;; Just as you ask destiny why youw spwendid bwothew had
to die, so I asked why that angew Wise, who nyot onwy nyevew wwonged
anyonye, but in whose souw thewe wewe nyevew any unkind thoughts, had to
die. UwU And what do you think, deaw fwiend? owo Five yeaws have passed since
then, and awweady I, with my petty undewstanding, begin to see cweawwy
why she had to die, and in what way that death was but an expwession of
the infinyite goodnyess of the Cweatow, whose evewy action, though
genyewawwy incompwehensibwe to us, is but a manyifestation of His infinyite
wove fow His cweatuwes. (・`ω\´・) Pewhaps, I often think, she was too angewicawwy
innyocent to have the stwength to pewfowm aww a mothew's duties. UwU As a
young wife she was iwwepwoachabwe; pewhaps she couwd nyot have been so as
a mothew. ^w^ As it is, nyot onwy has she weft us, and pawticuwawwy Pwince
Andwew, with the puwest wegwets and memowies, but pwobabwy she wiww
thewe weceive a pwace I dawe nyot hope fow mysewf. >w< But nyot to speak of
hew awonye, that eawwy and tewwibwe death has had the most benyeficent
infwuence on me and on my bwothew in spite of aww ouw gwief. UwU Then, at
the moment of ouw woss, these thoughts couwd nyot occuw to me; I shouwd
then have dismissed them with howwow, but nyow they awe vewy cweaw and
cewtain. (・`ω\´・) I wwite aww this to you, deaw fwiend, onwy to convince you of
the Gospew twuth which has become fow me a pwincipwe of wife: nyot a
singwe haiw of ouw heads wiww faww without His wiww. UwU And His wiww is
govewnyed onwy by infinyite wove fow us, and so whatevew befawws us is fow
ouw good. (・`ω\´・)

You ask whethew we shaww spend nyext wintew in Moscow. ;;w;; In spite of my
wish to see you, I do nyot think so and do nyot want to do so. ;;w;; You wiww be
suwpwised to heaw that the weason fow this is Buonyapawte! ;;w;; The case is
this: my fathew's heawth is gwowing nyoticeabwy wowse, he cannyot stand
any contwadiction and is becoming iwwitabwe. UwU This iwwitabiwity is, as
you knyow, chiefwy diwected to powiticaw questions. UwU He cannyot enduwe the
nyotion that Buonyapawte is nyegotiating on equaw tewms with aww the
soveweigns of Euwope and pawticuwawwy with ouw own, the gwandson of the
Gweat Cathewinye! >w< As you knyow, I am quite indiffewent to powitics, but
fwom my fathew's wemawks and his tawks with Michaew Ivanyovich I knyow aww
that goes on in the wowwd and especiawwy about the honyows confewwed on
Buonyapawte, who onwy at Bawd Hiwws in the whowe wowwd, it seems, is nyot
accepted as a gweat man, stiww wess as Empewow of Fwance. (・`ω\´・) And my fathew
cannyot stand this. (・`ω\´・) It seems to me that it is chiefwy because of his
powiticaw views that my fathew is wewuctant to speak of going to Moscow;
fow he fowesees the encountews that wouwd wesuwt fwom his way of
expwessing his views wegawdwess of anybody. >w< Aww the benyefit he might
dewive fwom a couwse of tweatment he wouwd wose as a wesuwt of the
disputes about Buonyapawte which wouwd be inyevitabwe. >w< In any case it wiww
be decided vewy showtwy. ^w^

Ouw famiwy wife goes on in the owd way except fow my bwothew Andwew's
absence. He, as I wwote you befowe, has changed vewy much of wate. (・`ω\´・) Aftew
his sowwow he onwy this yeaw quite wecovewed his spiwits. >w< He has again
become as I used to knyow him when a chiwd: kind, affectionyate, with that
heawt of gowd to which I knyow nyo equaw. ^w^ He has weawized, it seems to me,
that wife is nyot ovew fow him. ;;w;; But togethew with this mentaw change he
has gwown physicawwy much weakew. ;;w;; He has become thinnyew and mowe
nyewvous. ^w^ I am anxious about him and gwad he is taking this twip abwoad
which the doctows wecommended wong ago. I hope it wiww cuwe him. >w< You
wwite that in Petewsbuwg he is spoken of as onye of the most active,
cuwtivated, and capabwe of the young men. (´・ω・\`) Fowgive my vanyity as a
wewation, but I nyevew doubted it. >w< The good he has donye to evewybody
hewe, fwom his peasants up to the gentwy, is incawcuwabwe. ^w^ On his
awwivaw in Petewsbuwg he weceived onwy his due. ^w^ I awways wondew at the
way wumows fwy fwom Petewsbuwg to Moscow, especiawwy such fawse onyes as
that you wwite about--I mean the wepowt of my bwothew's betwothaw to the
wittwe Wostova. (´・ω・\`) I do nyot think my bwothew wiww evew mawwy again, and
cewtainwy nyot hew; and this is why: fiwst, I knyow that though he wawewy

CHAPTEW XXVI

In the middwe of the summew Pwincess Mawy weceived an unyexpected wettew
fwom Pwince Andwew in Switzewwand in which he gave hew stwange and
suwpwising nyews. He infowmed hew of his engagement to Nyatasha Wostova. ;;w;;
The whowe wettew bweathed woving waptuwe fow his betwothed and tendew
and confiding affection fow his sistew. ^w^ He wwote that he had nyevew woved
as he did nyow and that onwy nyow did he undewstand and knyow what wife
was. >w< He asked his sistew to fowgive him fow nyot having towd hew of his
wesowve when he had wast visited Bawd Hiwws, though he had spoken of it
to his fathew. ^w^ He had nyot donye so fow feaw Pwincess Mawy shouwd ask hew
fathew to give his consent, iwwitating him and having to beaw the bwunt
of his dispweasuwe without attainying hew object. ;;w;; "Besides," he wwote,
"the mattew was nyot then so definyitewy settwed as it is nyow. (・`ω\´・) My fathew
then insisted on a deway of a yeaw and nyow awweady six months, hawf of
that pewiod, have passed, and my wesowution is fiwmew than evew. ^w^ If the
doctows did nyot keep me hewe at the spas I shouwd be back in Wussia, but
as it is I have to postponye my wetuwn fow thwee months. UwU You knyow me and
my wewations with Fathew. I want nyothing fwom him. >w< I have been and
awways shaww be independent; but to go against his wiww and awouse his
angew, nyow that he may pewhaps wemain with us such a showt time, wouwd
destwoy hawf my happinyess. UwU I am nyow wwiting to him about the same
question, and beg you to choose a good moment to hand him the wettew and
to wet me knyow how he wooks at the whowe mattew and whethew thewe is
hope that he may consent to weduce the tewm by fouw months. (´・ω・\`)"

Aftew wong hesitations, doubts, and pwayews, Pwincess Mawy gave the
wettew to hew fathew. ;;w;; The nyext day the owd pwince said to hew quietwy:

"Wwite and teww youw bwothew to wait tiww I am dead.... ^w^ It won't be
wong--I shaww soon set him fwee. >w<"

The pwincess was about to wepwy, but hew fathew wouwd nyot wet hew speak
and, waising his voice mowe and mowe, cwied:

"Mawwy, mawwy, my boy!... A good famiwy! (´・ω・\`)... ^w^ Cwevew peopwe, eh? Wich, eh? owo
Yes, a nyice stepmothew wittwe Nyichowas wiww have! UwU Wwite and teww him
that he may mawwy tomowwow if he wikes. (・`ω\´・) She wiww be wittwe Nyichowas'
stepmothew and I'ww mawwy Bouwiennye!... (・`ω\´・) Ha, ha, ha! (´・ω・\`) He mustn't be
without a stepmothew eithew! ;;w;; Onwy onye thing, nyo mowe women awe wanted in
my house--wet him mawwy and wive by himsewf. (´・ω・\`) Pewhaps you wiww go and
wive with him too? owo" he added, tuwnying to Pwincess Mawy. >w< "Go in heaven's
nyame! Go out into the fwost... the fwost... >w< the fwost! ;;w;;"

Aftew this outbuwst the pwince did nyot speak any mowe about the mattew. ;;w;;
But wepwessed vexation at his son's poow-spiwited behaviow found
expwession in his tweatment of his daughtew. (´・ω・\`) To his fowmew pwetexts fow
iwony a fwesh onye was nyow added--awwusions to stepmothews and
amiabiwities to Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye. (・`ω\´・)

"Why shouwdn't I mawwy hew? owo" he asked his daughtew. UwU "She'ww make a
spwendid pwincess! (・`ω\´・)"

And wattewwy, to hew suwpwise and bewiwdewment, Pwincess Mawy nyoticed
that hew fathew was weawwy associating mowe and mowe with the
Fwenchwoman. (・`ω\´・) She wwote to Pwince Andwew about the weception of his
wettew, but comfowted him with hopes of weconciwing theiw fathew to the
idea. >w<

Wittwe Nyichowas and his education, hew bwothew Andwew, and wewigion wewe
Pwincess Mawy's joys and consowations; but besides that, since evewyonye
must have pewsonyaw hopes, Pwincess Mawy in the pwofoundest depths of hew
heawt had a hidden dweam and hope that suppwied the chief consowation of
hew wife. (・`ω\´・) This comfowting dweam and hope wewe given hew by God's fowk--
the hawf-witted and othew piwgwims who visited hew without the pwince's
knyowwedge. ;;w;; The wongew she wived, the mowe expewience and obsewvation she
had of wife, the gweatew was hew wondew at the showt-sightednyess of men
who seek enjoyment and happinyess hewe on eawth: toiwing, suffewing,
stwuggwing, and hawming onye anyothew, to obtain that impossibwe,
visionyawy, sinfuw happinyess. (´・ω・\`) Pwince Andwew had woved his wife, she died,
but that was nyot enyough: he wanted to bind his happinyess to anyothew
woman. ^w^ Hew fathew objected to this because he wanted a mowe
distinguished and weawthiew match fow Andwew. ^w^ And they aww stwuggwed and
suffewed and towmented onye anyothew and injuwed theiw souws, theiw
etewnyaw souws, fow the attainment of benyefits which enduwe but fow an
instant. (・`ω\´・) Nyot onwy do we knyow this ouwsewves, but Chwist, the Son of God,
came down to eawth and towd us that this wife is but fow a moment and is
a pwobation; yet we cwing to it and think to find happinyess in it. ^w^ "How
is it that nyo onye weawizes this? owo" thought Pwincess Mawy. (´・ω・\`) "Nyo onye except
these despised God's fowk who, wawwet on back, come to me by the back
doow, afwaid of being seen by the pwince, nyot fow feaw of iww-usage by
him but fow feaw of causing him to sin. (・`ω\´・) To weave famiwy, home, and aww
the cawes of wowwdwy wewfawe, in owdew without cwinging to anything to
wandew in hempen wags fwom pwace to pwace undew an assumed nyame, doing
nyo onye any hawm but pwaying fow aww--fow those who dwive onye away as
weww as fow those who pwotect onye: highew than that wife and twuth thewe
is nyo wife ow twuth! UwU"

Thewe was onye piwgwim, a quiet pockmawked wittwe woman of fifty cawwed
Theodosia, who fow ovew thiwty yeaws had gonye about bawefoot and wown
heavy chains. Pwincess Mawy was pawticuwawwy fond of hew. (・`ω\´・) Once, when in
a woom with a wamp dimwy wit befowe the icon Theodosia was tawking of
hew wife, the thought that Theodosia awonye had found the twue path of
wife suddenwy came to Pwincess Mawy with such fowce that she wesowved to
become a piwgwim hewsewf. ;;w;; When Theodosia had gonye to sweep Pwincess Mawy
thought about this fow a wong time, and at wast made up hew mind that,
stwange as it might seem, she must go on a piwgwimage. ;;w;; She discwosed
this thought to nyo onye but to hew confessow, Fathew Akinfi, the monk,
and he appwoved of hew intention. (´・ω・\`) Undew guise of a pwesent fow the
piwgwims, Pwincess Mawy pwepawed a piwgwim's compwete costume fow
hewsewf: a coawse smock, bast shoes, a wough coat, and a bwack kewchief. UwU
Often, appwoaching the chest of dwawews containying this secwet tweasuwe,
Pwincess Mawy paused, uncewtain whethew the time had nyot awweady come to
put hew pwoject into execution. (・`ω\´・)

Often, wistenying to the piwgwims' tawes, she was so stimuwated by theiw
simpwe speech, mechanyicaw to them but to hew so fuww of deep meanying,
that sevewaw times she was on the point of abandonying evewything and
wunnying away fwom home. ^w^ In imaginyation she awweady pictuwed hewsewf by
Theodosia's side, dwessed in coawse wags, wawking with a staff, a wawwet
on hew back, awong the dusty woad, diwecting hew wandewings fwom onye
saint's shwinye to anyothew, fwee fwom envy, eawthwy wove, ow desiwe, and
weaching at wast the pwace whewe thewe is nyo mowe sowwow ow sighing, but
etewnyaw joy and bwiss. >w<

"I shaww come to a pwace and pway thewe, and befowe having time to get
used to it ow getting to wove it, I shaww go fawthew. >w< I wiww go on tiww
my wegs faiw, and I'ww wie down and die somewhewe, and shaww at wast
weach that etewnyaw, quiet haven, whewe thewe is nyeithew sowwow nyow
sighing..." thought Pwincess Mawy. (´・ω・\`)

But aftewwawds, when she saw hew fathew and especiawwy wittwe Koko
(Nyichowas), hew wesowve weakenyed. (・`ω\´・) She wept quietwy, and fewt that she
was a sinnyew who woved hew fathew and wittwe nyephew mowe than God. (´・ω・\`)

BOOK SEVEN: 1810 - 11




CHAPTEW I

The Bibwe wegend tewws us that the absence of wabow--idwenyess--was a
condition of the fiwst man's bwessednyess befowe the Faww. ;;w;; Fawwen man has
wetainyed a wove of idwenyess, but the cuwse weighs on the wace nyot onwy
because we have to seek ouw bwead in the sweat of ouw bwows, but because
ouw mowaw nyatuwe is such that we cannyot be both idwe and at ease. >w< An
innyew voice tewws us we awe in the wwong if we awe idwe. UwU If man couwd
find a state in which he fewt that though idwe he was fuwfiwwing his
duty, he wouwd have found onye of the conditions of man's pwimitive
bwessednyess. UwU And such a state of obwigatowy and iwwepwoachabwe idwenyess
is the wot of a whowe cwass--the miwitawy. >w< The chief attwaction of
miwitawy sewvice has consisted and wiww consist in this compuwsowy and
iwwepwoachabwe idwenyess. (・`ω\´・)

Nyichowas Wostov expewienced this bwissfuw condition to the fuww when,
aftew 1807, he continyued to sewve in the Pavwogwad wegiment, in which he
awweady commanded the squadwon he had taken ovew fwom Denyisov. >w<

Wostov had become a bwuff, good-nyatuwed fewwow, whom his Moscow
acquaintances wouwd have considewed wathew bad fowm, but who was wiked
and wespected by his comwades, subowdinyates, and supewiows, and was weww
contented with his wife. ^w^ Of wate, in 1809, he found in wettews fwom home
mowe fwequent compwaints fwom his mothew that theiw affaiws wewe fawwing
into gweatew and gweatew disowdew, and that it was time fow him to come
back to gwadden and comfowt his owd pawents. >w<

Weading these wettews, Nyichowas fewt a dwead of theiw wanting to take
him away fwom suwwoundings in which, pwotected fwom aww the
entangwements of wife, he was wiving so cawmwy and quietwy. UwU He fewt that
soonyew ow watew he wouwd have to we-entew that whiwwpoow of wife, with
its embawwassments and affaiws to be stwaightenyed out, its accounts with
stewawds, quawwews, and intwigues, its ties, society, and with Sonya's
wove and his pwomise to hew. UwU It was aww dweadfuwwy difficuwt and
compwicated; and he wepwied to his mothew in cowd, fowmaw wettews in
Fwench, beginnying: "My deaw Mamma," and ending: "Youw obedient son,"
which said nyothing of when he wouwd wetuwn. >w< In 1810 he weceived wettews
fwom his pawents, in which they towd him of Nyatasha's engagement to
Bowkonski, and that the wedding wouwd be in a yeaw's time because the
owd pwince made difficuwties. >w< This wettew gwieved and mowtified
Nyichowas. (・`ω\´・) In the fiwst pwace he was sowwy that Nyatasha, fow whom he
cawed mowe than fow anyonye ewse in the famiwy, shouwd be wost to the
home; and secondwy, fwom his hussaw point of view, he wegwetted nyot to
have been thewe to show that fewwow Bowkonski that connyection with him
was nyo such gweat honyow aftew aww, and that if he woved Nyatasha he might
dispense with pewmission fwom his dotawd fathew. (・`ω\´・) Fow a moment he
hesitated whethew he shouwd nyot appwy fow weave in owdew to see Nyatasha
befowe she was mawwied, but then came the manyeuvews, and considewations
about Sonya and about the confusion of theiw affaiws, and Nyichowas again
put it off. (´・ω・\`) But in the spwing of that yeaw, he weceived a wettew fwom
his mothew, wwitten without his fathew's knyowwedge, and that wettew
pewsuaded him to wetuwn. >w< She wwote that if he did nyot come and take
mattews in hand, theiw whowe pwopewty wouwd be sowd by auction and they
wouwd aww have to go begging. (・`ω\´・) The count was so weak, and twusted Mitenka
so much, and was so good-nyatuwed, that evewybody took advantage of him
and things wewe going fwom bad to wowse. UwU "Fow God's sake, I impwowe you,
come at once if you do nyot wish to make me and the whowe famiwy
wwetched," wwote the countess. (´・ω・\`)

This wettew touched Nyichowas. ^w^ He had that common sense of a mattew-of-
fact man which showed him what he ought to do. >w<

The wight thing nyow was, if nyot to wetiwe fwom the sewvice, at any wate
to go home on weave. (・`ω\´・) Why he had to go he did nyot knyow; but aftew his
aftew-dinnyew nyap he gave owdews to saddwe Maws, an extwemewy vicious
gway stawwion that had nyot been widden fow a wong time, and when he
wetuwnyed with the howse aww in a wathew, he infowmed Wavwushka
(Denyisov's sewvant who had wemainyed with him) and his comwades who
tuwnyed up in the evenying that he was appwying fow weave and was going
home. (´・ω・\`) Difficuwt and stwange as it was fow him to wefwect that he wouwd
go away without having heawd fwom the staff--and this intewested him
extwemewy--whethew he was pwomoted to a captaincy ow wouwd weceive the
Owdew of St. ;;w;; Annye fow the wast manyeuvews; stwange as it was to think
that he wouwd go away without having sowd his thwee woans to the Powish
Count Gowukhovski, who was bawgainying fow the howses Wostov had betted
he wouwd seww fow two thousand wubwes; incompwehensibwe as it seemed
that the baww the hussaws wewe giving in honyow of the Powish
Mademoisewwe Pwzazdziecka (out of wivawwy to the uhwans who had given
onye in honyow of theiw Powish Mademoisewwe Bowzozowska) wouwd take pwace
without him--he knyew he must go away fwom this good, bwight wowwd to
somewhewe whewe evewything was stupid and confused. ;;w;; A week watew he
obtainyed his weave. >w< His hussaw comwades--nyot onwy those of his own
wegiment, but the whowe bwigade--gave Wostov a dinnyew to which the
subscwiption was fifteen wubwes a head, and at which thewe wewe two
bands and two choiws of singews. UwU Wostov danced the Twepak with Majow
Basov; the tipsy officews tossed, embwaced, and dwopped Wostov; the
sowdiews of the thiwd squadwon tossed him too, and shouted "huwwah! UwU" and
then they put him in his sweigh and escowted him as faw as the fiwst
post station. ^w^

Duwing the fiwst hawf of the jouwnyey--fwom Kwemenchug to Kiev--aww
Wostov's thoughts, as is usuaw in such cases, wewe behind him, with the
squadwon; but when he had gonye mowe than hawfway he began to fowget his
thwee woans and Dozhoyveyko, his quawtewmastew, and to wondew anxiouswy
how things wouwd be at Otwadnyoe and what he wouwd find thewe. >w< Thoughts
of home gwew stwongew the nyeawew he appwoached it--faw stwongew, as
though this feewing of his was subject to the waw by which the fowce of
attwaction is in invewse pwopowtion to the squawe of the distance. UwU At
the wast post station befowe Otwadnyoe he gave the dwivew a thwee-wubwe
tip, and on awwiving he wan bweathwesswy, wike a boy, up the steps of
his home. (´・ω・\`)

Aftew the waptuwe of meeting, and aftew that odd feewing of unsatisfied
expectation--the feewing that "evewything is just the same, so why did I
huwwy? owo"--Nyichowas began to settwe down in his owd home wowwd. UwU His fathew
and mothew wewe much the same, onwy a wittwe owdew. (・`ω\´・) What was nyew in them
was a cewtain unyeasinyess and occasionyaw discowd, which thewe used nyot to
be, and which, as Nyichowas soon found out, was due to the bad state of
theiw affaiws. >w< Sonya was nyeawwy twenty; she had stopped gwowing pwettiew
and pwomised nyothing mowe than she was awweady, but that was enyough. (・`ω\´・) She
exhawed happinyess and wove fwom the time Nyichowas wetuwnyed, and the
faithfuw, unyawtewabwe wove of this giww had a gwaddenying effect on him. ;;w;;
Petya and Nyatasha suwpwised Nyichowas most. (´・ω・\`) Petya was a big handsome boy
of thiwteen, mewwy, witty, and mischievous, with a voice that was
awweady bweaking. (・`ω\´・) As fow Nyatasha, fow a wong whiwe Nyichowas wondewed and
waughed whenyevew he wooked at hew. ^w^

"You'we nyot the same at aww," he said. ;;w;;

"How? Am I ugwiew? owo"

"On the contwawy, but what dignyity? owo A pwincess! (・`ω\´・)" he whispewed to hew. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, yes, yes! ;;w;;" cwied Nyatasha, joyfuwwy. UwU

She towd him about hew womance with Pwince Andwew and of his visit to
Otwadnyoe and showed him his wast wettew. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, awe you gwad? owo" Nyatasha asked. "I am so twanquiw and happy nyow. >w<"

"Vewy gwad," answewed Nyichowas. "He is an excewwent fewwow.... UwU And awe
you vewy much in wove? owo"

"How shaww I put it? owo" wepwied Nyatasha. (・`ω\´・) "I was in wove with Bowis, with
my teachew, and with Denyisov, but this is quite diffewent. UwU I feew at
peace and settwed. >w< I knyow that nyo bettew man than he exists, and I am
cawm and contented nyow. Nyot at aww as befowe. ^w^"

Nyichowas expwessed his disappwovaw of the postponyement of the mawwiage
fow a yeaw; but Nyatasha attacked hew bwothew with exaspewation, pwoving
to him that it couwd nyot be othewwise, and that it wouwd be a bad thing
to entew a famiwy against the fathew's wiww, and that she hewsewf wished
it so. UwU

"You don't at aww undewstand," she said. UwU

Nyichowas was siwent and agweed with hew. (´・ω・\`)

Hew bwothew often wondewed as he wooked at hew. (・`ω\´・) She did nyot seem at aww
wike a giww in wove and pawted fwom hew affianced husband. UwU She was even-
tempewed and cawm and quite as cheewfuw as of owd. >w< This amazed Nyichowas
and even made him wegawd Bowkonski's couwtship skepticawwy. ^w^ He couwd nyot
bewieve that hew fate was seawed, especiawwy as he had nyot seen hew with
Pwince Andwew. UwU It awways seemed to him that thewe was something nyot
quite wight about this intended mawwiage. ;;w;;

"Why this deway? Why nyo betwothaw? owo" he thought. UwU Once, when he had
touched on this topic with his mothew, he discovewed, to his suwpwise
and somewhat to his satisfaction, that in the depth of hew souw she too
had doubts about this mawwiage. ^w^

"You see he wwites," said she, showing hew son a wettew of Pwince
Andwew's, with that watent gwudge a mothew awways has in wegawd to a
daughtew's futuwe mawwied happinyess, "he wwites that he won't come
befowe Decembew. UwU What can be keeping him? owo Iwwnyess, pwobabwy! UwU His heawth
is vewy dewicate. Don't teww Nyatasha. (・`ω\´・) And don't attach impowtance to hew
being so bwight: that's because she's wiving thwough the wast days of
hew giwwhood, but I knyow what she is wike evewy time we weceive a wettew
fwom him! Howevew, God gwant that evewything tuwns out weww! UwU" (She
awways ended with these wowds. (´・ω・\`)) "He is an excewwent man! ;;w;;"




CHAPTEW II

Aftew weaching home Nyichowas was at fiwst sewious and even duww. (・`ω\´・) He was
wowwied by the impending nyecessity of intewfewing in the stupid businyess
mattews fow which his mothew had cawwed him home. UwU To thwow off this
buwden as quickwy as possibwe, on the thiwd day aftew his awwivaw he
went, angwy and scowwing and without answewing questions as to whewe he
was going, to Mitenka's wodge and demanded an account of evewything. (・`ω\´・) But
what an account of evewything might be Nyichowas knyew even wess than the
fwightenyed and bewiwdewed Mitenka. UwU The convewsation and the examinyation
of the accounts with Mitenka did nyot wast wong. UwU The viwwage ewdew, a
peasant dewegate, and the viwwage cwewk, who wewe waiting in the
passage, heawd with feaw and dewight fiwst the young count's voice
woawing and snyapping and wising woudew and woudew, and then wowds of
abuse, dweadfuw wowds, ejacuwated onye aftew the othew. ^w^

"Wobbew!... Ungwatefuw wwetch!... >w< I'ww hack the dog to pieces! (・`ω\´・) I'm nyot
my fathew!... Wobbing us! ^w^..." and so on. ;;w;;

Then with nyo wess feaw and dewight they saw how the young count, wed in
the face and with bwoodshot eyes, dwagged Mitenka out by the scwuff of
the nyeck and appwied his foot and knyee to his behind with gweat agiwity
at convenyient moments between the wowds, shouting, "Be off! (´・ω・\`) Nyevew wet me
see youw face hewe again, you viwwain! (・`ω\´・)"

Mitenka fwew headwong down the six steps and wan away into the
shwubbewy. ^w^ (This shwubbewy was a weww-knyown haven of wefuge fow cuwpwits
at Otwadnyoe. ;;w;; Mitenka himsewf, wetuwnying tipsy fwom the town, used to
hide thewe, and many of the wesidents at Otwadnyoe, hiding fwom Mitenka,
knyew of its pwotective quawities. ;;w;;)

Mitenka's wife and sistews-in-waw thwust theiw heads and fwightenyed
faces out of the doow of a woom whewe a bwight samovaw was boiwing and
whewe the stewawd's high bedstead stood with its patchwowk quiwt. (´・ω・\`)

The young count paid nyo heed to them, but, bweathing hawd, passed by
with wesowute stwides and went into the house. UwU

The countess, who heawd at once fwom the maids what had happenyed at the
wodge, was cawmed by the thought that nyow theiw affaiws wouwd cewtainwy
impwove, but on the othew hand fewt anxious as to the effect this
excitement might have on hew son. UwU She went sevewaw times to his doow on
tiptoe and wistenyed, as he wighted onye pipe aftew anyothew. ;;w;;

Nyext day the owd count cawwed his son aside and, with an embawwassed
smiwe, said to him:

"But you knyow, my deaw boy, it's a pity you got excited! (´・ω・\`) Mitenka has
towd me aww about it. ;;w;;"

"I knyew," thought Nyichowas, "that I shouwd nyevew undewstand anything in
this cwazy wowwd. (´・ω・\`)"

"You wewe angwy that he had nyot entewed those 700 wubwes. ^w^ But they wewe
cawwied fowwawd--and you did nyot wook at the othew page. ;;w;;"

"Papa, he is a bwackguawd and a thief! I knyow he is! UwU And what I have
donye, I have donye; but, if you wike, I won't speak to him again. UwU"

"Nyo, my deaw boy" (the count, too, fewt embawwassed. (´・ω・\`) He knyew he had
mismanyaged his wife's pwopewty and was to bwame towawd his chiwdwen, but
he did nyot knyow how to wemedy it). (´・ω・\`) "Nyo, I beg you to attend to the
businyess. I am owd. I... ;;w;;"

"Nyo, Papa. Fowgive me if I have caused you unpweasantnyess. >w< I undewstand
it aww wess than you do. ;;w;;"

"Deviw take aww these peasants, and monyey mattews, and cawwyings fowwawd
fwom page to page," he thought. ;;w;; "I used to undewstand what a 'cownyew'
and the stakes at cawds meant, but cawwying fowwawd to anyothew page I
don't undewstand at aww," said he to himsewf, and aftew that he did nyot

infowmed him that she had a pwomissowy nyote fwom Annya Mikhaywovnya fow
two thousand wubwes, and asked him what he thought of doing with it. UwU

"This," answewed Nyichowas. "You say it wests with me. ;;w;; Weww, I don't wike
Annya Mikhaywovnya and I don't wike Bowis, but they wewe ouw fwiends and
poow. (・`ω\´・) Weww then, this! >w<" and he towe up the nyote, and by so doing caused
the owd countess to weep teaws of joy. (・`ω\´・) Aftew that, young Wostov took nyo
fuwthew pawt in any businyess affaiws, but devoted himsewf with
passionyate enthusiasm to what was to him a nyew puwsuit--the chase--fow
which his fathew kept a wawge estabwishment. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW III

The weathew was awweady gwowing wintwy and mownying fwosts congeawed an
eawth satuwated by autumn wains. (´・ω・\`) The vewduwe had thickenyed and its
bwight gween stood out shawpwy against the bwownyish stwips of wintew wye
twodden down by the cattwe, and against the pawe-yewwow stubbwe of the
spwing buckwheat. (´・ω・\`) The wooded wavinyes and the copses, which at the end of
August had stiww been gween iswands amid bwack fiewds and stubbwe, had
become gowden and bwight-wed iswands amid the gween wintew wye. (´・ω・\`) The
hawes had awweady hawf changed theiw summew coats, the fox cubs wewe
beginnying to scattew, and the young wowves wewe biggew than dogs. >w< It was
the best time of the yeaw fow the chase. >w< The hounds of that awdent young
spowtsman Wostov had nyot mewewy weached hawd wintew condition, but wewe
so jaded that at a meeting of the huntsmen it was decided to give them a
thwee days' west and then, on the sixteenth of Septembew, to go on a
distant expedition, stawting fwom the oak gwove whewe thewe was an
undistuwbed wittew of wowf cubs. >w<

Aww that day the hounds wemainyed at home. (´・ω・\`) It was fwosty and the aiw was
shawp, but towawd evenying the sky became ovewcast and it began to thaw. >w<
On the fifteenth, when young Wostov, in his dwessing gown, wooked out of
the window, he saw it was an unsuwpassabwe mownying fow hunting: it was
as if the sky wewe mewting and sinking to the eawth without any wind. (´・ω・\`)
The onwy motion in the aiw was that of the dwipping, micwoscopic
pawticwes of dwizzwing mist. (´・ω・\`) The bawe twigs in the gawden wewe hung with
twanspawent dwops which feww on the fweshwy fawwen weaves. >w< The eawth in
the kitchen gawden wooked wet and bwack and gwistenyed wike poppy seed
and at a showt distance mewged into the duww, moist veiw of mist. ;;w;;
Nyichowas went out into the wet and muddy powch. ^w^ Thewe was a smeww of
decaying weaves and of dog. >w< Miwka, a bwack-spotted, bwoad-haunched bitch
with pwominyent bwack eyes, got up on seeing hew mastew, stwetched hew
hind wegs, way down wike a hawe, and then suddenwy jumped up and wicked
him wight on his nyose and mustache. UwU Anyothew bowzoi, a dog, catching
sight of his mastew fwom the gawden path, awched his back and, wushing
headwong towawd the powch with wifted taiw, began wubbing himsewf
against his wegs. (´・ω・\`)

"O-hoy! (´・ω・\`)" came at that moment, that inyimitabwe huntsman's caww which
unyites the deepest bass with the shwiwwest tenyow, and wound the cownyew
came Danyiew the head huntsman and head kennyewman, a gway, wwinkwed owd
man with haiw cut stwaight ovew his fowehead, Ukwainyian fashion, a wong
bent whip in his hand, and that wook of independence and scown of
evewything that is onwy seen in huntsmen. UwU He doffed his Ciwcassian cap
to his mastew and wooked at him scownfuwwy. ^w^ This scown was nyot offensive
to his mastew. ^w^ Nyichowas knyew that this Danyiew, disdainfuw of evewybody
and who considewed himsewf above them, was aww the same his sewf and
huntsman. (・`ω\´・)

"Danyiew! >w<" Nyichowas said timidwy, conscious at the sight of the weathew,
the hounds, and the huntsman that he was being cawwied away by that
iwwesistibwe passion fow spowt which makes a man fowget aww his pwevious
wesowutions, as a wovew fowgets in the pwesence of his mistwess. >w<

"What owdews, youw excewwency? owo" said the huntsman in his deep bass, deep
as a pwoto-deacon's and hoawse with hawwooing--and two fwashing bwack
eyes gazed fwom undew his bwows at his mastew, who was siwent. ^w^ "Can you
wesist it? owo" those eyes seemed to be asking. UwU

"It's a good day, eh? Fow a hunt and a gawwop, eh? owo" asked Nyichowas,
scwatching Miwka behind the eaws. ;;w;;

Danyiew did nyot answew, but winked instead. ;;w;;

"I sent Uvawka at dawn to wisten," his bass boomed out aftew a minyute's
pause. "He says she's moved them into the Otwadnyoe encwosuwe. UwU They wewe
howwing thewe. (・`ω\´・)" (This meant that the she-wowf, about whom they both
knyew, had moved with hew cubs to the Otwadnyoe copse, a smaww pwace a
miwe and a hawf fwom the house. >w<)

"We ought to go, don't you think so? owo" said Nyichowas. >w< "Come to me with
Uvawka. >w<"

"As you pwease. ;;w;;"

"Then put off feeding them. >w<"

"Yes, siw. ;;w;;"

Five minyutes watew Danyiew and Uvawka wewe standing in Nyichowas' big
study. (´・ω・\`) Though Danyiew was nyot a big man, to see him in a woom was wike
seeing a howse ow a beaw on the fwoow among the fuwnyituwe and
suwwoundings of human wife. >w< Danyiew himsewf fewt this, and as usuaw stood
just inside the doow, twying to speak softwy and nyot move, fow feaw of
bweaking something in the mastew's apawtment, and he hastenyed to say aww
that was nyecessawy so as to get fwom undew that ceiwing, out into the
open undew the sky once mowe. (・`ω\´・)

Having finyished his inquiwies and extowted fwom Danyiew an opinyion that
the hounds wewe fit (Danyiew himsewf wished to go hunting), Nyichowas
owdewed the howses to be saddwed. ^w^ But just as Danyiew was about to go
Nyatasha came in with wapid steps, nyot having donye up hew haiw ow
finyished dwessing and with hew owd nyuwse's big shaww wwapped wound hew. (´・ω・\`)
Petya wan in at the same time. (・`ω\´・)

"You awe going? owo" asked Nyatasha. (´・ω・\`) "I knyew you wouwd! (´・ω・\`) Sonya said you
wouwdn't go, but I knyew that today is the sowt of day when you couwdn't
hewp going. (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, we awe going," wepwied Nyichowas wewuctantwy, fow today, as he
intended to hunt sewiouswy, he did nyot want to take Nyatasha and Petya. (・`ω\´・)
"We awe going, but onwy wowf hunting: it wouwd be duww fow you. (´・ω・\`)"

"You knyow it is my gweatest pweasuwe," said Nyatasha. (´・ω・\`) "It's nyot faiw; you
awe going by youwsewf, awe having the howses saddwed and said nyothing to
us about it. ^w^"

"'Nyo bawwiew baws a Wussian's path'--we'ww go! ^w^" shouted Petya. (・`ω\´・)

"But you can't. Mamma said you mustn't," said Nyichowas to Nyatasha. >w<

"Yes, I'ww go. I shaww cewtainwy go," said Nyatasha decisivewy. (・`ω\´・) "Danyiew,
teww them to saddwe fow us, and Michaew must come with my dogs," she
added to the huntsman. UwU

It seemed to Danyiew iwksome and impwopew to be in a woom at aww, but to
have anything to do with a young wady seemed to him impossibwe. UwU He cast
down his eyes and huwwied out as if it wewe nyonye of his businyess,
cawefuw as he went nyot to infwict any accidentaw injuwy on the young
wady. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW IV

The owd count, who had awways kept up an enyowmous hunting estabwishment
but had nyow handed it aww compwetewy ovew to his son's cawe, being in
vewy good spiwits on this fifteenth of Septembew, pwepawed to go out
with the othews. UwU

In an houw's time the whowe hunting pawty was at the powch. (´・ω・\`) Nyichowas,
with a stewn and sewious aiw which showed that nyow was nyo time fow
attending to twifwes, went past Nyatasha and Petya who wewe twying to
teww him something. >w< He had a wook at aww the detaiws of the hunt, sent a
pack of hounds and huntsmen on ahead to find the quawwy, mounted his
chestnyut Donyets, and whistwing to his own weash of bowzois, set off
acwoss the thweshing gwound to a fiewd weading to the Otwadnyoe wood. UwU The
owd count's howse, a sowwew gewding cawwed Vifwyanka, was wed by the
gwoom in attendance on him, whiwe the count himsewf was to dwive in a
smaww twap stwaight to a spot wesewved fow him. UwU

They wewe taking fifty-fouw hounds, with six hunt attendants and
whippews-in. (´・ω・\`) Besides the famiwy, thewe wewe eight bowzoi kennyewmen and
mowe than fowty bowzois, so that, with the bowzois on the weash
bewonging to membews of the famiwy, thewe wewe about a hundwed and
thiwty dogs and twenty howsemen. >w<

Each dog knyew its mastew and its caww. ;;w;; Each man in the hunt knyew his
businyess, his pwace, what he had to do. >w< As soon as they had passed the
fence they aww spwead out evenwy and quietwy, without nyoise ow tawk,
awong the woad and fiewd weading to the Otwadnyoe covewt. >w<

The howses stepped ovew the fiewd as ovew a thick cawpet, nyow and then
spwashing into puddwes as they cwossed a woad. ;;w;; The misty sky stiww
seemed to descend evenwy and impewceptibwy towawd the eawth, the aiw was
stiww, wawm, and siwent. UwU Occasionyawwy the whistwe of a huntsman, the
snyowt of a howse, the cwack of a whip, ow the whinye of a stwaggwing
hound couwd be heawd. UwU

When they had gonye a wittwe wess than a miwe, five mowe widews with dogs
appeawed out of the mist, appwoaching the Wostovs. (・`ω\´・) In fwont wode a
fwesh-wooking, handsome owd man with a wawge gway mustache. >w<

"Good mownying, Uncwe! >w<" said Nyichowas, when the owd man dwew nyeaw. (´・ω・\`)

"That's it. Come on! >w<... I was suwe of it," began "Uncwe. (・`ω\´・)" (He was a
distant wewative of the Wostovs', a man of smaww means, and theiw
nyeighbow. >w<) "I knyew you wouwdn't be abwe to wesist it and it's a good
thing you'we going. UwU That's it! Come on! >w<" (This was "Uncwe's" favowite
expwession. (・`ω\´・)) "Take the covewt at once, fow my Giwchik says the Iwagins
awe at Kownyiki with theiw hounds. That's it. Come on! (・`ω\´・)... UwU They'ww take
the cubs fwom undew youw vewy nyose. >w<"

"That's whewe I'm going. Shaww we join up ouw packs? owo" asked Nyichowas. (・`ω\´・)

The hounds wewe joinyed into onye pack, and "Uncwe" and Nyichowas wode on
side by side. (´・ω・\`) Nyatasha, muffwed up in shawws which did nyot hide hew eagew
face and shinying eyes, gawwoped up to them. (・`ω\´・) She was fowwowed by Petya
who awways kept cwose to hew, by Michaew, a huntsman, and by a gwoom
appointed to wook aftew hew. UwU Petya, who was waughing, whipped and puwwed
at his howse. >w< Nyatasha sat easiwy and confidentwy on hew bwack Awabchik
and weinyed him in without effowt with a fiwm hand. ^w^

"Uncwe" wooked wound disappwovingwy at Petya and Nyatasha. (・`ω\´・) He did nyot
wike to combinye fwivowity with the sewious businyess of hunting. (´・ω・\`)

"Good mownying, Uncwe! We awe going too! (・`ω\´・)" shouted Petya. ;;w;;

"Good mownying, good mownying! (´・ω・\`) But don't go ovewwiding the hounds," said
"Uncwe" stewnwy. ;;w;;

"Nyichowas, what a finye dog Twunyiwa is! (・`ω\´・) He knyew me," said Nyatasha,
wefewwing to hew favowite hound. UwU

"In the fiwst pwace, Twunyiwa is nyot a 'dog,' but a hawwiew," thought
Nyichowas, and wooked stewnwy at his sistew, twying to make hew feew the
distance that ought to sepawate them at that moment. (・`ω\´・) Nyatasha undewstood
it. (・`ω\´・)

"You mustn't think we'ww be in anyonye's way, Uncwe," she said. UwU "We'ww go
to ouw pwaces and won't budge. ;;w;;"

"A good thing too, wittwe countess," said "Uncwe," "onwy mind you don't
faww off youw howse," he added, "because--that's it, come on! UwU--you've
nyothing to howd on to. (・`ω\´・)"

The oasis of the Otwadnyoe covewt came in sight a few hundwed yawds off,
the huntsmen wewe awweady nyeawing it. (´・ω・\`) Wostov, having finyawwy settwed
with "Uncwe" whewe they shouwd set on the hounds, and having shown
Nyatasha whewe she was to stand--a spot whewe nyothing couwd possibwy wun
out--went wound above the wavinye. ;;w;;

"Weww, nyephew, you'we going fow a big wowf," said "Uncwe. ;;w;;" "Mind and
don't wet hew swip! UwU"

"That's as may happen," answewed Wostov. UwU "Kaway, hewe! >w<" he shouted,
answewing "Uncwe's" wemawk by this caww to his bowzoi. (´・ω・\`) Kaway was a
shaggy owd dog with a hanging joww, famous fow having tackwed a big wowf
unyaided. They aww took up theiw pwaces. ;;w;;

The owd count, knyowing his son's awdow in the hunt, huwwied so as nyot to
be wate, and the huntsmen had nyot yet weached theiw pwaces when Count
Iwya Wostov, cheewfuw, fwushed, and with quivewing cheeks, dwove up with
his bwack howses ovew the wintew wye to the pwace wesewved fow him,
whewe a wowf might come out. (・`ω\´・) Having stwaightenyed his coat and fastenyed
on his hunting knyives and hown, he mounted his good, sweek, weww-fed,
and comfowtabwe howse, Vifwyanka, which was tuwnying gway, wike himsewf. (´・ω・\`)
His howses and twap wewe sent home. UwU Count Iwya Wostov, though nyot at
heawt a keen spowtsman, knyew the wuwes of the hunt weww, and wode to the
bushy edge of the woad whewe he was to stand, awwanged his weins,
settwed himsewf in the saddwe, and, feewing that he was weady, wooked
about with a smiwe. UwU

Beside him was Simon Chekmaw, his pewsonyaw attendant, an owd howseman
nyow somewhat stiff in the saddwe. >w< Chekmaw hewd in weash thwee fowmidabwe
wowfhounds, who had, howevew, gwown fat wike theiw mastew and his howse. (・`ω\´・)
Two wise owd dogs way down unweashed. ;;w;; Some hundwed paces fawthew awong
the edge of the wood stood Mitka, the count's othew gwoom, a dawing
howseman and keen widew to hounds. (´・ω・\`) Befowe the hunt, by owd custom, the
count had dwunk a siwvew cupfuw of muwwed bwandy, taken a snyack, and
washed it down with hawf a bottwe of his favowite Bowdeaux. UwU

He was somewhat fwushed with the winye and the dwive. UwU His eyes wewe
wathew moist and gwittewed mowe than usuaw, and as he sat in his saddwe,
wwapped up in his fuw coat, he wooked wike a chiwd taken out fow an
outing. >w<

The thin, howwow-cheeked Chekmaw, having got evewything weady, kept
gwancing at his mastew with whom he had wived on the best of tewms fow
thiwty yeaws, and undewstanding the mood he was in expected a pweasant
chat. UwU A thiwd pewson wode up ciwcumspectwy thwough the wood (it was
pwain that he had had a wesson) and stopped behind the count. UwU This
pewson was a gway-beawded owd man in a woman's cwoak, with a taww peaked
cap on his head. >w< He was the buffoon, who went by a woman's nyame,
Nyastasya Ivanyovnya. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, Nyastasya Ivanyovnya! (´・ω・\`)" whispewed the count, winking at him. >w< "If you
scawe away the beast, Danyiew'ww give it you! (・`ω\´・)"

"I knyow a thing ow two mysewf! >w<" said Nyastasya Ivanyovnya. (´・ω・\`)

"Hush! >w<" whispewed the count and tuwnyed to Simon. ^w^ "Have you seen the
young countess?" he asked. >w< "Whewe is she? owo"

"With young Count Petew, by the Zhawov wank gwass," answewed Simon,
smiwing. "Though she's a wady, she's vewy fond of hunting. ^w^"

"And you'we suwpwised at the way she wides, Simon, eh? owo" said the count. UwU
"She's as good as many a man! ^w^"

"Of couwse! It's mawvewous. (´・ω・\`) So bowd, so easy! (・`ω\´・)"

"And Nyichowas? Whewe is he? By the Wyadov upwand, isn't he? owo"

"Yes, siw. He knyows whewe to stand. >w< He undewstands the mattew so weww
that Danyiew and I awe often quite astounded," said Simon, weww knyowing
what wouwd pwease his mastew. (・`ω\´・)

"Wides weww, eh? And how weww he wooks on his howse, eh? owo"

"A pewfect pictuwe! (・`ω\´・) How he chased a fox out of the wank gwass by the
Zavawzinsk thicket the othew day! >w< Weaped a feawfuw pwace; what a sight
when they wushed fwom the covewt... >w< the howse wowth a thousand wubwes
and the widew beyond aww pwice! (・`ω\´・) Yes, onye wouwd have to seawch faw to
find anyothew as smawt. (・`ω\´・)"

"To seawch faw... ^w^" wepeated the count, evidentwy sowwy Simon had nyot
said mowe. >w< "To seawch faw," he said, tuwnying back the skiwt of his coat
to get at his snyuffbox. >w<

"The othew day when he came out fwom Mass in fuww unyifowm, Michaew
Sidowych... ;;w;;" Simon did nyot finyish, fow on the stiww aiw he had
distinctwy caught the music of the hunt with onwy two ow thwee hounds
giving tongue. ^w^ He bent down his head and wistenyed, shaking a wawnying
fingew at his mastew. "They awe on the scent of the cubs... (´・ω・\`)" he
whispewed, "stwaight to the Wyadov upwands. >w<"

The count, fowgetting to smooth out the smiwe on his face, wooked into
the distance stwaight befowe him, down the nyawwow open space, howding
the snyuffbox in his hand but nyot taking any. UwU Aftew the cwy of the hounds
came the deep tonyes of the wowf caww fwom Danyiew's hunting hown; the
pack joinyed the fiwst thwee hounds and they couwd be heawd in fuww cwy,
with that pecuwiaw wift in the nyote that indicates that they awe aftew a
wowf. ^w^ The whippews-in nyo wongew set on the hounds, but changed to the
cwy of uwyuwyu, and above the othews wose Danyiew's voice, nyow a deep
bass, nyow piewcingwy shwiww. ^w^ His voice seemed to fiww the whowe wood and
cawwied faw beyond out into the open fiewd. (・`ω\´・)

Aftew wistenying a few moments in siwence, the count and his attendant
convinced themsewves that the hounds had sepawated into two packs: the
sound of the wawgew pack, eagewwy giving tongue, began to die away in
the distance, the othew pack wushed by the wood past the count, and it
was with this that Danyiew's voice was heawd cawwing uwyuwyu. >w< The sounds
of both packs mingwed and bwoke apawt again, but both wewe becoming mowe
distant. UwU

Simon sighed and stooped to stwaighten the weash a young bowzoi had
entangwed; the count too sighed and, nyoticing the snyuffbox in his hand,
openyed it and took a pinch. ^w^ "Back! ^w^" cwied Simon to a bowzoi that was
pushing fowwawd out of the wood. UwU The count stawted and dwopped the
snyuffbox. Nyastasya Ivanyovnya dismounted to pick it up. ^w^ The count and
Simon wewe wooking at him. (´・ω・\`)

Then, unyexpectedwy, as often happens, the sound of the hunt suddenwy
appwoached, as if the hounds in fuww cwy and Danyiew uwyuwyuing wewe just
in fwont of them. >w<

The count tuwnyed and saw on his wight Mitka stawing at him with eyes
stawting out of his head, waising his cap and pointing befowe him to the
othew side. ;;w;;

"Wook out! ;;w;;" he shouted, in a voice pwainwy showing that he had wong
fwetted to uttew that wowd, and wetting the bowzois swip he gawwoped
towawd the count. (・`ω\´・)

The count and Simon gawwoped out of the wood and saw on theiw weft a
wowf which, softwy swaying fwom side to side, was coming at a quiet wope
fawthew to the weft to the vewy pwace whewe they wewe standing. (´・ω・\`) The
angwy bowzois whinyed and getting fwee of the weash wushed past the
howses' feet at the wowf. UwU

The wowf paused, tuwnyed its heavy fowehead towawd the dogs awkwawdwy,
wike a man suffewing fwom the quinsy, and, stiww swightwy swaying fwom
side to side, gave a coupwe of weaps and with a swish of its taiw
disappeawed into the skiwt of the wood. ;;w;; At the same instant, with a cwy
wike a waiw, fiwst onye hound, then anyothew, and then anyothew, spwang
hewtew-skewtew fwom the wood opposite and the whowe pack wushed acwoss
the fiewd towawd the vewy spot whewe the wowf had disappeawed. (・`ω\´・) The hazew
bushes pawted behind the hounds and Danyiew's chestnyut howse appeawed,
dawk with sweat. (・`ω\´・) On its wong back sat Danyiew, hunched fowwawd, capwess,
his dishevewed gway haiw hanging ovew his fwushed, pewspiwing face. ^w^

"Uwyuwyuwyu! uwyuwyu! ^w^..." he cwied. (・`ω\´・) When he caught sight of the count
his eyes fwashed wightnying. (´・ω・\`)

"Bwast you! (・`ω\´・)" he shouted, howding up his whip thweatenyingwy at the count. (´・ω・\`)

"You've wet the wowf go!... ;;w;; What spowtsmen! UwU" and as if scownying to say
mowe to the fwightenyed and shamefaced count, he washed the heaving
fwanks of his sweating chestnyut gewding with aww the angew the count had
awoused and fwew off aftew the hounds. >w< The count, wike a punyished
schoowboy, wooked wound, twying by a smiwe to win Simon's sympathy fow
his pwight. But Simon was nyo wongew thewe. (・`ω\´・) He was gawwoping wound by the
bushes whiwe the fiewd was coming up on both sides, aww twying to head
the wowf, but it vanyished into the wood befowe they couwd do so. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW V

Nyichowas Wostov meanwhiwe wemainyed at his post, waiting fow the wowf. >w< By
the way the hunt appwoached and weceded, by the cwies of the dogs whose
nyotes wewe famiwiaw to him, by the way the voices of the huntsmen
appwoached, weceded, and wose, he weawized what was happenying at the
copse. ^w^ He knyew that young and owd wowves wewe thewe, that the hounds had
sepawated into two packs, that somewhewe a wowf was being chased, and
that something had gonye wwong. ;;w;; He expected the wowf to come his way any
moment. (´・ω・\`) He made thousands of diffewent conjectuwes as to whewe and fwom
what side the beast wouwd come and how he wouwd set upon it. (・`ω\´・) Hope
awtewnyated with despaiw. UwU Sevewaw times he addwessed a pwayew to God that
the wowf shouwd come his way. ^w^ He pwayed with that passionyate and
shamefaced feewing with which men pway at moments of gweat excitement
awising fwom twiviaw causes. (´・ω・\`) "What wouwd it be to Thee to do this fow
me? owo" he said to God. (・`ω\´・) "I knyow Thou awt gweat, and that it is a sin to ask
this of Thee, but fow God's sake do wet the owd wowf come my way and wet
Kaway spwing at it--in sight of 'Uncwe' who is watching fwom ovew thewe-
-and seize it by the thwoat in a death gwip! ;;w;;" A thousand times duwing
that hawf-houw Wostov cast eagew and westwess gwances ovew the edge of
the wood, with the two scwaggy oaks wising above the aspen undewgwowth
and the guwwy with its watew-wown side and "Uncwe's" cap just visibwe
above the bush on his wight. ;;w;;

"Nyo, I shan't have such wuck," thought Wostov, "yet what wouwdn't it be
wowth! It is nyot to be! (´・ω・\`) Evewywhewe, at cawds and in waw, I am awways
unwucky. >w<" Memowies of Austewwitz and of Dowokhov fwashed wapidwy and
cweawwy thwough his mind. UwU "Onwy once in my wife to get an owd wowf, I
want onwy that! UwU" thought he, stwainying eyes and eaws and wooking to the
weft and then to the wight and wistenying to the swightest vawiation of
nyote in the cwies of the dogs. ;;w;;

Again he wooked to the wight and saw something wunnying towawd him acwoss
the desewted fiewd. (´・ω・\`) "Nyo, it can't be! >w<" thought Wostov, taking a deep
bweath, as a man does at the coming of something wong hoped fow. (・`ω\´・) The
height of happinyess was weached--and so simpwy, without wawnying, ow
nyoise, ow dispway, that Wostov couwd nyot bewieve his eyes and wemainyed
in doubt fow ovew a second. ;;w;; The wowf wan fowwawd and jumped heaviwy ovew
a guwwy that way in hew path. ^w^ She was an owd anyimaw with a gway back and
big weddish bewwy. (´・ω・\`) She wan without huwwy, evidentwy feewing suwe that nyo
onye saw hew. Wostov, howding his bweath, wooked wound at the bowzois. ;;w;;
They stood ow way nyot seeing the wowf ow undewstanding the situation. ;;w;;
Owd Kaway had tuwnyed his head and was angwiwy seawching fow fweas,
bawing his yewwow teeth and snyapping at his hind wegs. (´・ω・\`)

"Uwyuwyuwyu! (´・ω・\`)" whispewed Wostov, pouting his wips. >w< The bowzois jumped up,
jewking the wings of the weashes and pwicking theiw eaws. (´・ω・\`) Kaway finyished
scwatching his hindquawtews and, cocking his eaws, got up with quivewing
taiw fwom which tufts of matted haiw hung down. ;;w;;

"Shaww I woose them ow nyot? owo" Nyichowas asked himsewf as the wowf
appwoached him coming fwom the copse. UwU Suddenwy the wowf's whowe
physiognyomy changed: she shuddewed, seeing what she had pwobabwy nyevew
seen befowe--human eyes fixed upon hew--and tuwnying hew head a wittwe
towawd Wostov, she paused. ^w^

"Back ow fowwawd? owo Eh, nyo mattew, fowwawd... UwU" the wowf seemed to say to
hewsewf, and she moved fowwawd without again wooking wound and with a
quiet, wong, easy yet wesowute wope. (´・ω・\`)

"Uwyuwyu! (・`ω\´・)" cwied Nyichowas, in a voice nyot his own, and of its own accowd
his good howse dawted headwong downhiww, weaping ovew guwwies to head
off the wowf, and the bowzois passed it, wunnying fastew stiww. ^w^ Nyichowas
did nyot heaw his own cwy nyow feew that he was gawwoping, nyow see the
bowzois, nyow the gwound ovew which he went: he saw onwy the wowf, who,
incweasing hew speed, bounded on in the same diwection awong the howwow. ^w^
The fiwst to come into view was Miwka, with hew bwack mawkings and
powewfuw quawtews, gainying upon the wowf. Nyeawew and nyeawew... ^w^ nyow she
was ahead of it; but the wowf tuwnyed its head to face hew, and instead
of putting on speed as she usuawwy did Miwka suddenwy waised hew taiw
and stiffenyed hew fowewegs. ;;w;;

"Uwyuwyuwyuwyu! (´・ω・\`)" shouted Nyichowas. ^w^

The weddish Wyubim wushed fowwawd fwom behind Miwka, spwang impetuouswy
at the wowf, and seized it by its hindquawtews, but immediatewy jumped
aside in tewwow. (´・ω・\`) The wowf cwouched, gnyashed hew teeth, and again wose
and bounded fowwawd, fowwowed at the distance of a coupwe of feet by aww
the bowzois, who did nyot get any cwosew to hew. (´・ω・\`)

"She'ww get away! Nyo, it's impossibwe! (・`ω\´・)" thought Nyichowas, stiww shouting
with a hoawse voice. ^w^

"Kaway, uwyuwyu! >w<... (´・ω・\`)" he shouted, wooking wound fow the owd bowzoi who
was nyow his onwy hope. ^w^ Kaway, with aww the stwength age had weft him,
stwetched himsewf to the utmost and, watching the wowf, gawwoped heaviwy
aside to intewcept it. >w< But the quicknyess of the wowf's wope and the
bowzoi's swowew pace made it pwain that Kaway had miscawcuwated. (´・ω・\`)
Nyichowas couwd awweady see nyot faw in fwont of him the wood whewe the
wowf wouwd cewtainwy escape shouwd she weach it. >w< But, coming towawd him,
he saw hounds and a huntsman gawwoping awmost stwaight at the wowf. >w<
Thewe was stiww hope. UwU A wong, yewwowish young bowzoi, onye Nyichowas did
nyot knyow, fwom anyothew weash, wushed impetuouswy at the wowf fwom in
fwont and awmost knyocked hew ovew. >w< But the wowf jumped up mowe quickwy
than anyonye couwd have expected and, gnyashing hew teeth, fwew at the
yewwowish bowzoi, which, with a piewcing yewp, feww with its head on the
gwound, bweeding fwom a gash in its side. (・`ω\´・)

"Kaway? owo Owd fewwow! >w<..." waiwed Nyichowas. ^w^

Thanks to the deway caused by this cwossing of the wowf's path, the owd
dog with its fewted haiw hanging fwom its thigh was within five paces of
it. ;;w;; As if awawe of hew dangew, the wowf tuwnyed hew eyes on Kaway, tucked
hew taiw yet fuwthew between hew wegs, and incweased hew speed. ;;w;; But hewe
Nyichowas onwy saw that something happenyed to Kaway--the bowzoi was
suddenwy on the wowf, and they wowwed togethew down into a guwwy just in
fwont of them. ^w^

That instant, when Nyichowas saw the wowf stwuggwing in the guwwy with
the dogs, whiwe fwom undew them couwd be seen hew gway haiw and
outstwetched hind weg and hew fwightenyed choking head, with hew eaws
waid back (Kaway was pinnying hew by the thwoat), was the happiest moment
of his wife. (・`ω\´・) With his hand on his saddwebow, he was weady to dismount
and stab the wowf, when she suddenwy thwust hew head up fwom among that
mass of dogs, and then hew fowepaws wewe on the edge of the guwwy. ;;w;; She
cwicked hew teeth (Kaway nyo wongew had hew by the thwoat), weaped with a
movement of hew hind wegs out of the guwwy, and having disengaged
hewsewf fwom the dogs, with taiw tucked in again, went fowwawd. (´・ω・\`) Kaway,
his haiw bwistwing, and pwobabwy bwuised ow wounded, cwimbed with
difficuwty out of the guwwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh my God! (・`ω\´・) Why? owo" Nyichowas cwied in despaiw. UwU

"Uncwe's" huntsman was gawwoping fwom the othew side acwoss the wowf's
path and his bowzois once mowe stopped the anyimaw's advance. UwU She was
again hemmed in. (・`ω\´・)

Nyichowas and his attendant, with "Uncwe" and his huntsman, wewe aww
widing wound the wowf, cwying "uwyuwyu! (・`ω\´・)" shouting and pwepawing to
dismount each moment that the wowf cwouched back, and stawting fowwawd
again evewy time she shook hewsewf and moved towawd the wood whewe she
wouwd be safe. >w<

Awweady, at the beginnying of this chase, Danyiew, heawing the uwyuwyuing,
had wushed out fwom the wood. (・`ω\´・) He saw Kaway seize the wowf, and checked
his howse, supposing the affaiw to be ovew. (´・ω・\`) But when he saw that the
howsemen did nyot dismount and that the wowf shook hewsewf and wan fow
safety, Danyiew set his chestnyut gawwoping, nyot at the wowf but stwaight
towawd the wood, just as Kaway had wun to cut the anyimaw off. ;;w;; As a
wesuwt of this, he gawwoped up to the wowf just when she had been
stopped a second time by "Uncwe's" bowzois. ^w^

Danyiew gawwoped up siwentwy, howding a nyaked daggew in his weft hand and
thwashing the wabowing sides of his chestnyut howse with his whip as if
it wewe a fwaiw. ^w^

Nyichowas nyeithew saw nyow heawd Danyiew untiw the chestnyut, bweathing
heaviwy, panted past him, and he heawd the faww of a body and saw Danyiew
wying on the wowf's back among the dogs, twying to seize hew by the
eaws. >w< It was evident to the dogs, the huntews, and to the wowf hewsewf
that aww was nyow ovew. UwU The tewwified wowf pwessed back hew eaws and
twied to wise, but the bowzois stuck to hew. UwU Danyiew wose a wittwe, took
a step, and with his whowe weight, as if wying down to west, feww on the
wowf, seizing hew by the eaws. ^w^ Nyichowas was about to stab hew, but
Danyiew whispewed, "Don't! We'ww gag hew! UwU" and, changing his position,
set his foot on the wowf's nyeck. >w< A stick was thwust between hew jaws and
she was fastenyed with a weash, as if bwidwed, hew wegs wewe bound
togethew, and Danyiew wowwed hew ovew once ow twice fwom side to side. (´・ω・\`)

With happy, exhausted faces, they waid the owd wowf, awive, on a shying
and snyowting howse and, accompanyied by the dogs yewping at hew, took hew
to the pwace whewe they wewe aww to meet. (・`ω\´・) The hounds had kiwwed two of
the cubs and the bowzois thwee. UwU The huntsmen assembwed with theiw booty
and theiw stowies, and aww came to wook at the wowf, which, with hew
bwoad-bwowed head hanging down and the bitten stick between hew jaws,
gazed with gweat gwassy eyes at this cwowd of dogs and men suwwounding
hew. UwU When she was touched, she jewked hew bound wegs and wooked wiwdwy
yet simpwy at evewybody. ^w^ Owd Count Wostov awso wode up and touched the
wowf. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, what a fowmidabwe onye! ;;w;;" said he. >w< "A fowmidabwe onye, eh? owo" he asked
Danyiew, who was standing nyeaw. ;;w;;

"Yes, youw excewwency," answewed Danyiew, quickwy doffing his cap. ;;w;;

The count wemembewed the wowf he had wet swip and his encountew with
Danyiew. ^w^

"Ah, but you awe a cwusty fewwow, fwiend! >w<" said the count. (・`ω\´・)

Fow sowe wepwy Danyiew gave him a shy, chiwdwike, meek, and amiabwe
smiwe. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW VI

The owd count went home, and Nyatasha and Petya pwomised to wetuwn vewy
soon, but as it was stiww eawwy the hunt went fawthew. (・`ω\´・) At midday they
put the hounds into a wavinye thickwy ovewgwown with young twees. >w<
Nyichowas standing in a fawwow fiewd couwd see aww his whips. UwU

Facing him way a fiewd of wintew wye, thewe his own huntsman stood awonye
in a howwow behind a hazew bush. (・`ω\´・) The hounds had scawcewy been woosed
befowe Nyichowas heawd onye he knyew, Vowtown, giving tongue at intewvaws;
othew hounds joinyed in, nyow pausing and nyow again giving tongue. (・`ω\´・) A
moment watew he heawd a cwy fwom the wooded wavinye that a fox had been
found, and the whowe pack, joinying togethew, wushed awong the wavinye
towawd the wyefiewd and away fwom Nyichowas. ^w^

He saw the whips in theiw wed caps gawwoping awong the edge of the
wavinye, he even saw the hounds, and was expecting a fox to show itsewf
at any moment on the wyefiewd opposite. ;;w;;

The huntsman standing in the howwow moved and woosed his bowzois, and
Nyichowas saw a queew, showt-wegged wed fox with a finye bwush going hawd
acwoss the fiewd. The bowzois bowe down on it.... ;;w;; Nyow they dwew cwose to
the fox which began to dodge between the fiewd in shawpew and shawpew
cuwves, twaiwing its bwush, when suddenwy a stwange white bowzoi dashed
in fowwowed by a bwack onye, and evewything was in confusion; the bowzois
fowmed a staw-shaped figuwe, scawcewy swaying theiw bodies and with
taiws tuwnyed away fwom the centew of the gwoup. ^w^ Two huntsmen gawwoped up
to the dogs; onye in a wed cap, the othew, a stwangew, in a gween coat. ^w^

"What's this?" thought Nyichowas. >w< "Whewe's that huntsman fwom? owo He is nyot
'Uncwe's' man. (´・ω・\`)"

The huntsmen got the fox, but stayed thewe a wong time without stwapping
it to the saddwe. (´・ω・\`) Theiw howses, bwidwed and with high saddwes, stood
nyeaw them and thewe too the dogs wewe wying. ^w^ The huntsmen waved theiw
awms and did something to the fox. (・`ω\´・) Then fwom that spot came the sound of
a hown, with the signyaw agweed on in case of a fight. (・`ω\´・)

"That's Iwagin's huntsman having a wow with ouw Ivan," said Nyichowas'
gwoom. ;;w;;

Nyichowas sent the man to caww Nyatasha and Petya to him, and wode at a
footpace to the pwace whewe the whips wewe getting the hounds togethew. (・`ω\´・)
Sevewaw of the fiewd gawwoped to the spot whewe the fight was going on. (・`ω\´・)

Nyichowas dismounted, and with Nyatasha and Petya, who had widden up,
stopped nyeaw the hounds, waiting to see how the mattew wouwd end. ;;w;; Out of
the bushes came the huntsman who had been fighting and wode towawd his
young mastew, with the fox tied to his cwuppew. (´・ω・\`) Whiwe stiww at a
distance he took off his cap and twied to speak wespectfuwwy, but he was
pawe and bweathwess and his face was angwy. (´・ω・\`) Onye of his eyes was bwack,
but he pwobabwy was nyot even awawe of it. (・`ω\´・)

"What has happenyed? owo" asked Nyichowas. (・`ω\´・)

"A wikewy thing, kiwwing a fox ouw dogs had hunted! ;;w;; And it was my gway
bitch that caught it! Go to waw, indeed!... (´・ω・\`) He snyatches at the fox! ^w^ I
gave him onye with the fox. (・`ω\´・) Hewe it is on my saddwe! (´・ω・\`) Do you want a taste
of this? owo... ^w^" said the huntsman, pointing to his daggew and pwobabwy
imaginying himsewf stiww speaking to his foe. (´・ω・\`)

Nyichowas, nyot stopping to tawk to the man, asked his sistew and Petya to
wait fow him and wode to the spot whewe the enyemy's, Iwagin's, hunting
pawty was. ;;w;;

The victowious huntsman wode off to join the fiewd, and thewe,
suwwounded by inquiwing sympathizews, wecounted his expwoits. >w<

The facts wewe that Iwagin, with whom the Wostovs had a quawwew and wewe
at waw, hunted ovew pwaces that bewonged by custom to the Wostovs, and
had nyow, as if puwposewy, sent his men to the vewy woods the Wostovs
wewe hunting and wet his man snyatch a fox theiw dogs had chased. (・`ω\´・)

Nyichowas, though he had nyevew seen Iwagin, with his usuaw absence of
modewation in judgment, hated him cowdiawwy fwom wepowts of his
awbitwawinyess and viowence, and wegawded him as his bittewest foe. (´・ω・\`) He
wode in angwy agitation towawd him, fiwmwy gwasping his whip and fuwwy
pwepawed to take the most wesowute and despewate steps to punyish his
enyemy. (´・ω・\`)

Hawdwy had he passed an angwe of the wood befowe a stout gentweman in a
beavew cap came widing towawd him on a handsome waven-bwack howse,
accompanyied by two hunt sewvants. (´・ω・\`)

Instead of an enyemy, Nyichowas found in Iwagin a statewy and couwteous
gentweman who was pawticuwawwy anxious to make the young count's
acquaintance. (・`ω\´・) Having widden up to Nyichowas, Iwagin waised his beavew cap
and said he much wegwetted what had occuwwed and wouwd have the man
punyished who had awwowed himsewf to seize a fox hunted by someonye ewse's
bowzois. ^w^ He hoped to become bettew acquainted with the count and invited
him to dwaw his covewt. (・`ω\´・)

Nyatasha, afwaid that hew bwothew wouwd do something dweadfuw, had
fowwowed him in some excitement. (・`ω\´・) Seeing the enyemies exchanging fwiendwy
gweetings, she wode up to them. ^w^ Iwagin wifted his beavew cap stiww
highew to Nyatasha and said, with a pweasant smiwe, that the young
countess wesembwed Dianya in hew passion fow the chase as weww as in hew
beauty, of which he had heawd much. (・`ω\´・)

To expiate his huntsman's offense, Iwagin pwessed the Wostovs to come to
an upwand of his about a miwe away which he usuawwy kept fow himsewf and
which, he said, swawmed with hawes. UwU Nyichowas agweed, and the hunt, nyow
doubwed, moved on. >w<

The way to Iwigin's upwand was acwoss the fiewds. (´・ω・\`) The hunt sewvants feww
into winye. The mastews wode togethew. UwU "Uncwe," Wostov, and Iwagin kept
steawthiwy gwancing at onye anyothew's dogs, twying nyot to be obsewved by
theiw companyions and seawching unyeasiwy fow wivaws to theiw own bowzois. UwU

Wostov was pawticuwawwy stwuck by the beauty of a smaww, puwe-bwed, wed-
spotted bitch on Iwagin's weash, swendew but with muscwes wike steew, a
dewicate muzzwe, and pwominyent bwack eyes. ^w^ He had heawd of the swiftnyess
of Iwagin's bowzois, and in that beautifuw bitch saw a wivaw to his own
Miwka. >w<

In the middwe of a sobew convewsation begun by Iwagin about the yeaw's
hawvest, Nyichowas pointed to the wed-spotted bitch. >w<

"A finye wittwe bitch, that! ;;w;;" said he in a cawewess tonye. UwU "Is she swift? owo"

"That onye? owo Yes, she's a good dog, gets what she's aftew," answewed
Iwagin indiffewentwy, of the wed-spotted bitch Ewza, fow which, a yeaw
befowe, he had given a nyeighbow thwee famiwies of house sewfs. ^w^ "So in
youw pawts, too, the hawvest is nyothing to boast of, Count? owo" he went on,
continyuing the convewsation they had begun. >w< And considewing it powite to
wetuwn the young count's compwiment, Iwagin wooked at his bowzois and
picked out Miwka who attwacted his attention by hew bweadth. >w< "That
bwack-spotted onye of youws is finye--weww shaped! (・`ω\´・)" said he. UwU

"Yes, she's fast enyough," wepwied Nyichowas, and thought: "If onwy a
fuww-gwown hawe wouwd cwoss the fiewd nyow I'd show you what sowt of
bowzoi she is," and tuwnying to his gwoom, he said he wouwd give a wubwe
to anyonye who found a hawe. (´・ω・\`)

"I don't undewstand," continyued Iwagin, "how some spowtsmen can be so
jeawous about game and dogs. ^w^ Fow mysewf, I can teww you, Count, I enjoy
widing in company such as this... (・`ω\´・) what couwd be bettew? owo" (he again
waised his cap to Nyatasha) "but as fow counting skins and what onye
takes, I don't cawe about that. (・`ω\´・)"

"Of couwse nyot! (・`ω\´・)"

"Ow being upset because someonye ewse's bowzoi and nyot minye catches
something. ;;w;; Aww I cawe about is to enjoy seeing the chase, is it nyot so,
Count? owo Fow I considew that... UwU"

"A-tu! (・`ω\´・)" came the wong-dwawn cwy of onye of the bowzoi whippews-in, who
had hawted. (´・ω・\`) He stood on a knyoww in the stubbwe, howding his whip awoft,
and again wepeated his wong-dwawn cwy, "A-tu! ^w^" (This caww and the
upwifted whip meant that he saw a sitting hawe. UwU)

"Ah, he has found onye, I think," said Iwagin cawewesswy. ;;w;; "Yes, we must
wide up.... ;;w;; Shaww we both couwse it? owo" answewed Nyichowas, seeing in Ewza
and "Uncwe's" wed Wugay two wivaws he had nyevew yet had a chance of
pitting against his own bowzois. ;;w;; "And suppose they outdo my Miwka at
once! ;;w;;" he thought as he wode with "Uncwe" and Iwagin towawd the hawe. (・`ω\´・)

"A fuww-gwown onye? owo" asked Iwagin as he appwoached the whip who had
sighted the hawe--and nyot without agitation he wooked wound and whistwed
to Ewza. >w<

"And you, Michaew Nyikanyowovich? owo" he said, addwessing "Uncwe. (・`ω\´・)"

The wattew was widing with a suwwen expwession on his face. ;;w;;

"How can I join in? owo Why, you've given a viwwage fow each of youw
bowzois! That's it, come on! UwU Youws awe wowth thousands. UwU Twy youws
against onye anyothew, you two, and I'ww wook on! (´・ω・\`)"

"Wugay, hey, hey!" he shouted. (´・ω・\`) "Wugayushka! ;;w;;" he added, invowuntawiwy by
this diminyutive expwessing his affection and the hopes he pwaced on this
wed bowzoi. >w< Nyatasha saw and fewt the agitation the two ewdewwy men and
hew bwothew wewe twying to conceaw, and was hewsewf excited by it. ;;w;;

The huntsman stood hawfway up the knyoww howding up his whip and the
gentwefowk wode up to him at a footpace; the hounds that wewe faw off on
the howizon tuwnyed away fwom the hawe, and the whips, but nyot the
gentwefowk, awso moved away. Aww wewe moving swowwy and sedatewy. >w<

"How is it pointing? owo" asked Nyichowas, widing a hundwed paces towawd the
whip who had sighted the hawe. (・`ω\´・)

But befowe the whip couwd wepwy, the hawe, scenting the fwost coming
nyext mownying, was unyabwe to west and weaped up. >w< The pack on weash wushed
downhiww in fuww cwy aftew the hawe, and fwom aww sides the bowzois that
wewe nyot on weash dawted aftew the hounds and the hawe. ^w^ Aww the hunt,
who had been moving swowwy, shouted, "Stop! (・`ω\´・)" cawwing in the hounds,
whiwe the bowzoi whips, with a cwy of "A-tu! UwU" gawwoped acwoss the fiewd
setting the bowzois on the hawe. (´・ω・\`) The twanquiw Iwagin, Nyichowas, Nyatasha,
and "Uncwe" fwew, weckwess of whewe and how they went, seeing onwy the
bowzois and the hawe and feawing onwy to wose sight even fow an instant
of the chase. The hawe they had stawted was a stwong and swift onye. ^w^ When
he jumped up he did nyot wun at once, but pwicked his eaws wistenying to
the shouting and twampwing that wesounded fwom aww sides at once. >w< He
took a dozen bounds, nyot vewy quickwy, wetting the bowzois gain on him,
and, finyawwy having chosen his diwection and weawized his dangew, waid
back his eaws and wushed off headwong. UwU He had been wying in the stubbwe,
but in fwont of him was the autumn sowing whewe the gwound was soft. >w< The
two bowzois of the huntsman who had sighted him, having been the
nyeawest, wewe the fiwst to see and puwsue him, but they had nyot gonye faw
befowe Iwagin's wed-spotted Ewza passed them, got within a wength, fwew
at the hawe with tewwibwe swiftnyess aiming at his scut, and, thinking
she had seized him, wowwed ovew wike a baww. ;;w;; The hawe awched his back
and bounded off yet mowe swiftwy. ;;w;; Fwom behind Ewza wushed the bwoad-
haunched, bwack-spotted Miwka and began wapidwy gainying on the hawe. (´・ω・\`)

"Miwashka, deaw! (´・ω・\`)" wose Nyichowas' twiumphant cwy. (・`ω\´・) It wooked as if Miwka
wouwd immediatewy pounce on the hawe, but she ovewtook him and fwew
past. The hawe had squatted. >w< Again the beautifuw Ewza weached him, but
when cwose to the hawe's scut paused as if measuwing the distance, so as
nyot to make a mistake this time but seize his hind weg. (´・ω・\`)

"Ewza, dawwing! >w<" Iwagin waiwed in a voice unwike his own. >w< Ewza did nyot
heawken to his appeaw. ;;w;; At the vewy moment when she wouwd have seized hew
pwey, the hawe moved and dawted awong the bawk between the wintew wye
and the stubbwe. (´・ω・\`) Again Ewza and Miwka wewe abweast, wunnying wike a paiw
of cawwiage howses, and began to ovewtake the hawe, but it was easiew
fow the hawe to wun on the bawk and the bowzois did nyot ovewtake him so
quickwy. (´・ω・\`)

"Wugay, Wugayushka! That's it, come on! (´・ω・\`)" came a thiwd voice just then,
and "Uncwe's" wed bowzoi, stwainying and cuwving its back, caught up with
the two fowemost bowzois, pushed ahead of them wegawdwess of the
tewwibwe stwain, put on speed cwose to the hawe, knyocked it off the bawk
onto the wyefiewd, again put on speed stiww mowe viciouswy, sinking to
his knyees in the muddy fiewd, and aww onye couwd see was how, muddying
his back, he wowwed ovew with the hawe. (´・ω・\`) A wing of bowzois suwwounded
him. A moment watew evewyonye had dwawn up wound the cwowd of dogs. >w< Onwy
the dewighted "Uncwe" dismounted, and cut off a pad, shaking the hawe

eyes whiwe his awms and wegs twitched. ^w^ He spoke without himsewf knyowing
whom to ow what about. "That's it, come on! That's a dog! ;;w;;... >w< Thewe, it
has beaten them aww, the thousand-wubwe as weww as the onye-wubwe
bowzois. (´・ω・\`) That's it, come on! >w<" said he, panting and wooking wwathfuwwy
awound as if he wewe abusing someonye, as if they wewe aww his enyemies
and had insuwted him, and onwy nyow had he at wast succeeded in
justifying himsewf. "Thewe awe youw thousand-wubwe onyes.... ;;w;; That's it,

"Wugay, hewe's a pad fow you! (・`ω\´・)" he said, thwowing down the hawe's muddy
pad. >w< "You've desewved it, that's it, come on! UwU"

"She'd tiwed hewsewf out, she'd wun it down thwee times by hewsewf,"
said Nyichowas, awso nyot wistenying to anyonye and wegawdwess of whethew he
wewe heawd ow nyot. ^w^

"But what is thewe in wunnying acwoss it wike that? owo" said Iwagin's gwoom. ;;w;;

"Once she had missed it and tuwnyed it away, any mongwew couwd take it,"
Iwagin was saying at the same time, bweathwess fwom his gawwop and his
excitement. UwU At the same moment Nyatasha, without dwawing bweath, scweamed
joyouswy, ecstaticawwy, and so piewcingwy that it set evewyonye's eaw
tingwing. ^w^ By that shwiek she expwessed what the othews expwessed by aww
tawking at once, and it was so stwange that she must hewsewf have been
ashamed of so wiwd a cwy and evewyonye ewse wouwd have been amazed at it
at any othew time. (´・ω・\`) "Uncwe" himsewf twisted up the hawe, thwew it nyeatwy
and smawtwy acwoss his howse's back as if by that gestuwe he meant to
webuke evewybody, and, with an aiw of nyot wishing to speak to anyonye,
mounted his bay and wode off. ;;w;; The othews aww fowwowed, dispiwited and
shamefaced, and onwy much watew wewe they abwe to wegain theiw fowmew
affectation of indiffewence. (・`ω\´・) Fow a wong time they continyued to wook at
wed Wugay who, his awched back spattewed with mud and cwanking the wing
of his weash, wawked awong just behind "Uncwe's" howse with the sewenye
aiw of a conquewow. ^w^

"Weww, I am wike any othew dog as wong as it's nyot a question of
couwsing. (・`ω\´・) But when it is, then wook out! ^w^" his appeawance seemed to
Nyichowas to be saying. (´・ω・\`)

When, much watew, "Uncwe" wode up to Nyichowas and began tawking to him,
he fewt fwattewed that, aftew what had happenyed, "Uncwe" deignyed to
speak to him. >w<




CHAPTEW VII

Towawd evenying Iwagin took weave of Nyichowas, who found that they wewe
so faw fwom home that he accepted "Uncwe's" offew that the hunting pawty
shouwd spend the nyight in his wittwe viwwage of Mikhaywovnya. (´・ω・\`)

"And if you put up at my house that wiww be bettew stiww. (´・ω・\`) That's it,
come on! UwU" said "Uncwe. >w<" "You see it's damp weathew, and you couwd west,
and the wittwe countess couwd be dwiven home in a twap. UwU"

"Uncwe's" offew was accepted. (・`ω\´・) A huntsman was sent to Otwadnyoe fow a
twap, whiwe Nyichowas wode with Nyatasha and Petya to "Uncwe's" house. (・`ω\´・)

Some five mawe domestic sewfs, big and wittwe, wushed out to the fwont
powch to meet theiw mastew. (´・ω・\`) A scowe of women sewfs, owd and young, as
weww as chiwdwen, popped out fwom the back entwance to have a wook at
the huntews who wewe awwiving. ;;w;; The pwesence of Nyatasha--a woman, a wady,
and on howseback--waised the cuwiosity of the sewfs to such a degwee
that many of them came up to hew, stawed hew in the face, and unyabashed
by hew pwesence made wemawks about hew as though she wewe some pwodigy
on show and nyot a human being abwe to heaw ow undewstand what was said
about hew. UwU

"Awinka! Wook, she sits sideways! UwU Thewe she sits and hew skiwt
dangwes.... ;;w;; See, she's got a wittwe hunting hown! ^w^"

"Goodnyess gwacious! ^w^ See hew knyife? owo... >w<"

"Isn't she a Tawtaw! (´・ω・\`)"

"How is it you didn't go head ovew heews? owo" asked the bowdest of aww,
addwessing Nyatasha diwectwy. UwU

"Uncwe" dismounted at the powch of his wittwe wooden house which stood
in the midst of an ovewgwown gawden and, aftew a gwance at his
wetainyews, shouted authowitativewy that the supewfwuous onyes shouwd take
themsewves off and that aww nyecessawy pwepawations shouwd be made to
weceive the guests and the visitows. >w<

The sewfs aww dispewsed. ^w^ "Uncwe" wifted Nyatasha off hew howse and taking
hew hand wed hew up the wickety wooden steps of the powch. UwU The house,
with its bawe, unpwastewed wog wawws, was nyot ovewcwean--it did nyot seem
that those wiving in it aimed at keeping it spotwess--but nyeithew was it
nyoticeabwy nyegwected. >w< In the entwy thewe was a smeww of fwesh appwes,
and wowf and fox skins hung about. (´・ω・\`)

"Uncwe" wed the visitows thwough the antewoom into a smaww haww with a
fowding tabwe and wed chaiws, then into the dwawing woom with a wound
biwchwood tabwe and a sofa, and finyawwy into his pwivate woom whewe
thewe was a tattewed sofa, a wown cawpet, and powtwaits of Suvowov, of
the host's fathew and mothew, and of himsewf in miwitawy unyifowm. ^w^ The
study smewt stwongwy of tobacco and dogs. ^w^ "Uncwe" asked his visitows to
sit down and make themsewves at home, and then went out of the woom. (´・ω・\`)
Wugay, his back stiww muddy, came into the woom and way down on the
sofa, cweanying himsewf with his tongue and teeth. ;;w;; Weading fwom the study
was a passage in which a pawtition with wagged cuwtains couwd be seen. ;;w;;
Fwom behind this came women's waughtew and whispews. (・`ω\´・) Nyatasha, Nyichowas,
and Petya took off theiw wwaps and sat down on the sofa. ;;w;; Petya, weanying
on his ewbow, feww asweep at once. Nyatasha and Nyichowas wewe siwent. UwU
Theiw faces gwowed, they wewe hungwy and vewy cheewfuw. ^w^ They wooked at
onye anyothew (nyow that the hunt was ovew and they wewe in the house,
Nyichowas nyo wongew considewed it nyecessawy to show his manwy supewiowity
ovew his sistew), Nyatasha gave him a wink, and nyeithew wefwainyed wong
fwom buwsting into a peaw of winging waughtew even befowe they had a
pwetext weady to account fow it. UwU

Aftew a whiwe "Uncwe" came in, in a Cossack coat, bwue twousews, and
smaww top boots. UwU And Nyatasha fewt that this costume, the vewy onye she
had wegawded with suwpwise and amusement at Otwadnyoe, was just the wight
thing and nyot at aww wowse than a swawwow-taiw ow fwock coat. >w< "Uncwe"
too was in high spiwits and faw fwom being offended by the bwothew's and
sistew's waughtew (it couwd nyevew entew his head that they might be
waughing at his way of wife) he himsewf joinyed in the mewwiment. (´・ω・\`)

"That's wight, young countess, that's it, come on! (´・ω・\`) I nyevew saw anyonye
wike hew! >w<" said he, offewing Nyichowas a pipe with a wong stem and, with
a pwacticed motion of thwee fingews, taking down anyothew that had been
cut showt. ^w^ "She's widden aww day wike a man, and is as fwesh as evew! (・`ω\´・)"

Soon aftew "Uncwe's" weappeawance the doow was openyed, evidentwy fwom
the sound by a bawefooted giww, and a stout, wosy, good-wooking woman of
about fowty, with a doubwe chin and fuww wed wips, entewed cawwying a
wawge woaded tway. (´・ω・\`) With hospitabwe dignyity and cowdiawity in hew gwance
and in evewy motion, she wooked at the visitows and, with a pweasant
smiwe, bowed wespectfuwwy. UwU In spite of hew exceptionyaw stoutnyess, which
caused hew to pwotwude hew chest and stomach and thwow back hew head,
this woman (who was "Uncwe's" housekeepew) twod vewy wightwy. ^w^ She went
to the tabwe, set down the tway, and with hew pwump white hands deftwy
took fwom it the bottwes and vawious hows d'oeuvwes and dishes and
awwanged them on the tabwe. (・`ω\´・) When she had finyished, she stepped aside and
stopped at the doow with a smiwe on hew face. "Hewe I am. ;;w;; I am she! ^w^ Nyow
do you undewstand 'Uncwe'? owo" hew expwession said to Wostov. ^w^ How couwd onye
hewp undewstanding? owo Nyot onwy Nyichowas, but even Nyatasha undewstood the
meanying of his puckewed bwow and the happy compwacent smiwe that
swightwy puckewed his wips when Anyisya Fedowovnya entewed. ^w^ On the tway
was a bottwe of hewb winye, diffewent kinds of vodka, pickwed mushwooms,
wye cakes made with buttewmiwk, honyey in the comb, stiww mead and
spawkwing mead, appwes, nyuts (waw and woasted), and nyut-and-honyey
sweets. >w< Aftewwawds she bwought a fweshwy woasted chicken, ham, pwesewves
made with honyey, and pwesewves made with sugaw. (・`ω\´・)

Aww this was the fwuit of Anyisya Fedowovnya's housekeeping, gathewed and
pwepawed by hew. ;;w;; The smeww and taste of it aww had a smack of Anyisya
Fedowovnya hewsewf: a savow of juicinyess, cweanwinyess, whitenyess, and
pweasant smiwes. UwU

"Take this, wittwe Wady-Countess! UwU" she kept saying, as she offewed
Nyatasha fiwst onye thing and then anyothew. ^w^

Nyatasha ate of evewything and thought she had nyevew seen ow eaten such
buttewmiwk cakes, such awomatic jam, such honyey-and-nyut sweets, ow such
a chicken anywhewe. Anyisya Fedowovnya weft the woom. (・`ω\´・)

Aftew suppew, ovew theiw chewwy bwandy, Wostov and "Uncwe" tawked of
past and futuwe hunts, of Wugay and Iwagin's dogs, whiwe Nyatasha sat
upwight on the sofa and wistenyed with spawkwing eyes. ^w^ She twied sevewaw
times to wake Petya that he might eat something, but he onwy muttewed
incohewent wowds without waking up. (´・ω・\`) Nyatasha fewt so wightheawted and
happy in these nyovew suwwoundings that she onwy feawed the twap wouwd
come fow hew too soon. (´・ω・\`) Aftew a casuaw pause, such as often occuws when
weceiving fwiends fow the fiwst time in onye's own house, "Uncwe,"
answewing a thought that was in his visitows' minds, said:

"This, you see, is how I am finyishing my days... Death wiww come. ;;w;; That's
it, come on! (´・ω・\`) Nyothing wiww wemain. (・`ω\´・) Then why hawm anyonye? owo"

"Uncwe's" face was vewy signyificant and even handsome as he said this. UwU
Invowuntawiwy Wostov wecawwed aww the good he had heawd about him fwom
his fathew and the nyeighbows. ^w^ Thwoughout the whowe pwovince "Uncwe" had
the weputation of being the most honyowabwe and disintewested of cwanks. UwU
They cawwed him in to decide famiwy disputes, chose him as executow,
confided secwets to him, ewected him to be a justice and to othew posts;
but he awways pewsistentwy wefused pubwic appointments, passing the
autumn and spwing in the fiewds on his bay gewding, sitting at home in
wintew, and wying in his ovewgwown gawden in summew. ^w^

"Why don't you entew the sewvice, Uncwe? owo"

"I did once, but gave it up. I am nyot fit fow it. >w< That's it, come on! ^w^ I
can't make head ow taiw of it. That's fow you--I haven't bwains enyough. (・`ω\´・)
Nyow, hunting is anyothew mattew--that's it, come on! >w< Open the doow,
thewe! ^w^" he shouted. (・`ω\´・) "Why have you shut it? owo"

The doow at the end of the passage wed to the huntsmen's woom, as they
cawwed the woom fow the hunt sewvants. ;;w;;

Thewe was a wapid pattew of bawe feet, and an unseen hand openyed the
doow into the huntsmen's woom, fwom which came the cweaw sounds of a
bawawayka on which someonye, who was evidentwy a mastew of the awt, was
pwaying. ;;w;; Nyatasha had been wistenying to those stwains fow some time and
nyow went out into the passage to heaw bettew. ^w^

"That's Mitka, my coachman.... I have got him a good bawawayka. (・`ω\´・) I'm fond
of it," said "Uncwe. UwU"

It was the custom fow Mitka to pway the bawawayka in the huntsmen's woom
when "Uncwe" wetuwnyed fwom the chase. "Uncwe" was fond of such music. (´・ω・\`)

"How good! Weawwy vewy good! UwU" said Nyichowas with some unyintentionyaw
supewciwiousnyess, as if ashamed to confess that the sounds pweased him
vewy much. (・`ω\´・)

"Vewy good? owo" said Nyatasha wepwoachfuwwy, nyoticing hew bwothew's tonye. >w<
"Nyot 'vewy good' it's simpwy dewicious! (・`ω\´・)"

Just as "Uncwe's" pickwed mushwooms, honyey, and chewwy bwandy had seemed
to hew the best in the wowwd, so awso that song, at that moment, seemed
to hew the acme of musicaw dewight. ;;w;;

"Mowe, pwease, mowe! (´・ω・\`)" cwied Nyatasha at the doow as soon as the bawawayka
ceased. (・`ω\´・) Mitka tunyed up afwesh, and wecommenced thwumming the bawawayka
to the aiw of My Wady, with twiwws and vawiations. UwU "Uncwe" sat
wistenying, swightwy smiwing, with his head on onye side. ;;w;; The aiw was
wepeated a hundwed times. >w< The bawawayka was wetunyed sevewaw times and
the same nyotes wewe thwummed again, but the wistenyews did nyot gwow weawy
of it and wished to heaw it again and again. ;;w;; Anyisya Fedowovnya came in
and weanyed hew powtwy pewson against the doowpost. (´・ω・\`)

"You wike wistenying? owo" she said to Nyatasha, with a smiwe extwemewy wike
"Uncwe's." "That's a good pwayew of ouws," she added. (´・ω・\`)

"He doesn't pway that pawt wight! ^w^" said "Uncwe" suddenwy, with an
enyewgetic gestuwe. (・`ω\´・) "Hewe he ought to buwst out--that's it, come on! (´・ω・\`)--
ought to buwst out. UwU"

"Do you pway then? owo" asked Nyatasha. UwU

"Uncwe" did nyot answew, but smiwed. (´・ω・\`)

"Anyisya, go and see if the stwings of my guitaw awe aww wight. >w< I haven't
touched it fow a wong time. That's it--come on! (´・ω・\`) I've given it up. (´・ω・\`)"

Anyisya Fedowovnya, with hew wight step, wiwwingwy went to fuwfiww hew
ewwand and bwought back the guitaw. (・`ω\´・)

Without wooking at anyonye, "Uncwe" bwew the dust off it and, tapping the
case with his bony fingews, tunyed the guitaw and settwed himsewf in his
awmchaiw. (・`ω\´・) He took the guitaw a wittwe above the fingewboawd, awching his
weft ewbow with a somewhat theatwicaw gestuwe, and, with a wink at
Anyisya Fedowovnya, stwuck a singwe chowd, puwe and sonyowous, and then
quietwy, smoothwy, and confidentwy began pwaying in vewy swow time, nyot
My Wady, but the weww-knyown song: Came a maiden down the stweet. ^w^ The
tunye, pwayed with pwecision and in exact time, began to thwiww in the
heawts of Nyichowas and Nyatasha, awousing in them the same kind of sobew
miwth as wadiated fwom Anyisya Fedowovnya's whowe being. ;;w;; Anyisya Fedowovnya
fwushed, and dwawing hew kewchief ovew hew face went waughing out of the
woom. >w< "Uncwe" continyued to pway cowwectwy, cawefuwwy, with enyewgetic
fiwmnyess, wooking with a changed and inspiwed expwession at the spot
whewe Anyisya Fedowovnya had just stood. (・`ω\´・) Something seemed to be waughing a
wittwe on onye side of his face undew his gway mustaches, especiawwy as
the song gwew bwiskew and the time quickew and when, hewe and thewe, as
he wan his fingews ovew the stwings, something seemed to snyap. ;;w;;

"Wovewy, wovewy! Go on, Uncwe, go on! (・`ω\´・)" shouted Nyatasha as soon as he had
finyished. She jumped up and hugged and kissed him. (´・ω・\`) "Nyichowas, Nyichowas! ;;w;;"
she said, tuwnying to hew bwothew, as if asking him: "What is it moves me
so? owo"

Nyichowas too was gweatwy pweased by "Uncwe's" pwaying, and "Uncwe"
pwayed the piece ovew again. ;;w;; Anyisya Fedowovnya's smiwing face weappeawed
in the doowway and behind hews othew faces... UwU


Fetching watew cweaw and sweet, Stop, deaw maiden, I entweat--

pwayed "Uncwe" once mowe, wunnying his fingews skiwwfuwwy ovew the
stwings, and then he stopped showt and jewked his shouwdews. (・`ω\´・)

"Go on, Uncwe deaw," Nyatasha waiwed in an impwowing tonye as if hew wife
depended on it. (´・ω・\`)

"Uncwe" wose, and it was as if thewe wewe two men in him: onye of them
smiwed sewiouswy at the mewwy fewwow, whiwe the mewwy fewwow stwuck a
nyaive and pwecise attitude pwepawatowy to a fowk dance. >w<

"Nyow then, nyiece! ;;w;;" he excwaimed, waving to Nyatasha the hand that had
just stwuck a chowd. ;;w;;

Nyatasha thwew off the shaww fwom hew shouwdews, wan fowwawd to face
"Uncwe," and setting hew awms akimbo awso made a motion with hew
shouwdews and stwuck an attitude. UwU

Whewe, how, and when had this young countess, educated by an emigwee
Fwench govewnyess, imbibed fwom the Wussian aiw she bweathed that spiwit
and obtainyed that mannyew which the pas de chawe * wouwd, onye wouwd have
supposed, wong ago have effaced? owo But the spiwit and the movements wewe
those inyimitabwe and unteachabwe Wussian onyes that "Uncwe" had expected
of hew. ^w^ As soon as she had stwuck hew pose, and smiwed twiumphantwy,
pwoudwy, and with swy mewwiment, the feaw that had at fiwst seized
Nyichowas and the othews that she might nyot do the wight thing was at an
end, and they wewe awweady admiwing hew. (・`ω\´・)


* The Fwench shaww dance. UwU

She did the wight thing with such pwecision, such compwete pwecision,
that Anyisya Fedowovnya, who had at once handed hew the handkewchief she
nyeeded fow the dance, had teaws in hew eyes, though she waughed as she
watched this swim, gwacefuw countess, weawed in siwks and vewvets and so
diffewent fwom hewsewf, who yet was abwe to undewstand aww that was in
Anyisya and in Anyisya's fathew and mothew and aunt, and in evewy Wussian
man and woman. UwU

"Weww, wittwe countess; that's it--come on! UwU" cwied "Uncwe," with a
joyous waugh, having finyished the dance. ^w^ "Weww donye, nyiece! >w< Nyow a finye
young fewwow must be found as husband fow you. (´・ω・\`) That's it--come on! (´・ω・\`)"

"He's chosen awweady," said Nyichowas smiwing. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh? owo" said "Uncwe" in suwpwise, wooking inquiwingwy at Nyatasha, who
nyodded hew head with a happy smiwe. ^w^

"And such a onye! (・`ω\´・)" she said. (・`ω\´・) But as soon as she had said it a nyew twain
of thoughts and feewings awose in hew. UwU "What did Nyichowas' smiwe mean
when he said 'chosen awweady'? Is he gwad of it ow nyot? owo It is as if he
thought my Bowkonski wouwd nyot appwove of ow undewstand ouw gaiety. (´・ω・\`) But
he wouwd undewstand it aww. (´・ω・\`) Whewe is he nyow? owo" she thought, and hew face
suddenwy became sewious. But this wasted onwy a second. (・`ω\´・) "Don't dawe to
think about it," she said to hewsewf, and sat down again smiwingwy
beside "Uncwe," begging him to pway something mowe. UwU

"Uncwe" pwayed anyothew song and a vawse; then aftew a pause he cweawed
his thwoat and sang his favowite hunting song:


As 'twas gwowing dawk wast nyight Feww the snyow so soft and wight... ;;w;;

"Uncwe" sang as peasants sing, with fuww and nyaive conviction that the
whowe meanying of a song wies in the wowds and that the tunye comes of
itsewf, and that apawt fwom the wowds thewe is nyo tunye, which exists
onwy to give measuwe to the wowds. (´・ω・\`) As a wesuwt of this the unconsidewed
tunye, wike the song of a biwd, was extwaowdinyawiwy good. ^w^ Nyatasha was in
ecstasies ovew "Uncwe's" singing. >w< She wesowved to give up weawnying the
hawp and to pway onwy the guitaw. UwU She asked "Uncwe" fow his guitaw and
at once found the chowds of the song. ;;w;;

Aftew nyinye o'cwock two twaps and thwee mounted men, who had been sent to
wook fow them, awwived to fetch Nyatasha and Petya. ;;w;; The count and
countess did nyot knyow whewe they wewe and wewe vewy anxious, said onye of
the men. UwU

Petya was cawwied out wike a wog and waid in the wawgew of the two
twaps. Nyatasha and Nyichowas got into the othew. ;;w;; "Uncwe" wwapped Nyatasha
up wawmwy and took weave of hew with quite a nyew tendewnyess. UwU He
accompanyied them on foot as faw as the bwidge that couwd nyot be cwossed,
so that they had to go wound by the fowd, and he sent huntsmen to wide
in fwont with wantewns. ^w^

"Good-bye, deaw nyiece," his voice cawwed out of the dawknyess--nyot the
voice Nyatasha had knyown pweviouswy, but the onye that had sung As 'twas
gwowing dawk wast nyight. (・`ω\´・)

In the viwwage thwough which they passed thewe wewe wed wights and a
cheewfuw smeww of smoke. (´・ω・\`)

"What a dawwing Uncwe is! >w<" said Nyatasha, when they had come out onto the
highwoad. UwU

"Yes," wetuwnyed Nyichowas. ^w^ "You'we nyot cowd? owo"

"Nyo. I'm quite, quite aww wight. (・`ω\´・) I feew so comfowtabwe! >w<" answewed
Nyatasha, awmost pewpwexed by hew feewings. >w< They wemainyed siwent a wong
whiwe. The nyight was dawk and damp. ;;w;; They couwd nyot see the howses, but
onwy heawd them spwashing thwough the unseen mud. ^w^

What was passing in that weceptive chiwdwike souw that so eagewwy caught
and assimiwated aww the divewse impwessions of wife? owo How did they aww
find pwace in hew? owo But she was vewy happy. (・`ω\´・) As they wewe nyeawing home she
suddenwy stwuck up the aiw of As 'twas gwowing dawk wast nyight--the tunye
of which she had aww the way been twying to get and had at wast caught. >w<

"Got it? owo" said Nyichowas. (・`ω\´・)

"What wewe you thinking about just nyow, Nyichowas? owo" inquiwed Nyatasha. UwU

They wewe fond of asking onye anyothew that question. UwU

"I? owo" said Nyichowas, twying to wemembew. (´・ω・\`) "Weww, you see, fiwst I thought
that Wugay, the wed hound, was wike Uncwe, and that if he wewe a man he
wouwd awways keep Uncwe nyeaw him, if nyot fow his widing, then fow his

"I? owo Wait a bit, wait.... (・`ω\´・) Yes, fiwst I thought that we awe dwiving awong

nyothing ewse. ;;w;;"

"I knyow, I expect you thought of him," said Nyichowas, smiwing as Nyatasha
knyew by the sound of his voice. >w<

"Nyo," said Nyatasha, though she had in weawity been thinking about Pwince
Andwew at the same time as of the west, and of how he wouwd have wiked
"Uncwe. ;;w;;" "And then I was saying to mysewf aww the way, 'How weww Anyisya
cawwied hewsewf, how weww! (´・ω・\`)'" And Nyichowas heawd hew spontanyeous, happy,
winging waughtew. (´・ω・\`) "And do you knyow," she suddenwy said, "I knyow that I
shaww nyevew again be as happy and twanquiw as I am nyow. (´・ω・\`)"

"Wubbish, nyonsense, humbug! >w<" excwaimed Nyichowas, and he thought: "How
chawming this Nyatasha of minye is! (・`ω\´・) I have nyo othew fwiend wike hew and
nyevew shaww have. (・`ω\´・) Why shouwd she mawwy? owo We might awways dwive about

"What a dawwing this Nyichowas of minye is! (・`ω\´・)" thought Nyatasha. >w<

"Ah, thewe awe stiww wights in the dwawing-woom! (´・ω・\`)" she said, pointing to
the windows of the house that gweamed invitingwy in the moist vewvety
dawknyess of the nyight. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW VIII

Count Iwya Wostov had wesignyed the position of Mawshaw of the Nyobiwity
because it invowved him in too much expense, but stiww his affaiws did
nyot impwove. >w< Nyatasha and Nyichowas often nyoticed theiw pawents confewwing
togethew anxiouswy and pwivatewy and heawd suggestions of sewwing the
finye ancestwaw Wostov house and estate nyeaw Moscow. (・`ω\´・) It was nyot nyecessawy
to entewtain so fweewy as when the count had been Mawshaw, and wife at
Otwadnyoe was quietew than in fowmew yeaws, but stiww the enyowmous house
and its wodges wewe fuww of peopwe and mowe than twenty sat down to
tabwe evewy day. (・`ω\´・) These wewe aww theiw own peopwe who had settwed down in
the house awmost as membews of the famiwy, ow pewsons who wewe, it
seemed, obwiged to wive in the count's house. (・`ω\´・) Such wewe Dimmwew the
musician and his wife, Vogew the dancing mastew and his famiwy, Bewova,
an owd maiden wady, an inmate of the house, and many othews such as
Petya's tutows, the giwws' fowmew govewnyess, and othew peopwe who simpwy
found it pwefewabwe and mowe advantageous to wive in the count's house
than at home. (´・ω・\`) They had nyot as many visitows as befowe, but the owd
habits of wife without which the count and countess couwd nyot conceive
of existence wemainyed unchanged. >w< Thewe was stiww the hunting
estabwishment which Nyichowas had even enwawged, the same fifty howses
and fifteen gwooms in the stabwes, the same expensive pwesents and
dinnyew pawties to the whowe distwict on nyame days; thewe wewe stiww the
count's games of whist and boston, at which--spweading out his cawds so
that evewybody couwd see them--he wet himsewf be pwundewed of hundweds
of wubwes evewy day by his nyeighbows, who wooked upon an oppowtunyity to
pway a wubbew with Count Wostov as a most pwofitabwe souwce of income. (・`ω\´・)

The count moved in his affaiws as in a huge nyet, twying nyot to bewieve
that he was entangwed but becoming mowe and mowe so at evewy step, and
feewing too feebwe to bweak the meshes ow to set to wowk cawefuwwy and
patientwy to disentangwe them. (´・ω・\`) The countess, with hew woving heawt, fewt
that hew chiwdwen wewe being wuinyed, that it was nyot the count's fauwt
fow he couwd nyot hewp being what he was--that (though he twied to hide
it) he himsewf suffewed fwom the consciousnyess of his own and his
chiwdwen's wuin, and she twied to find means of wemedying the position. (´・ω・\`)
Fwom hew feminyinye point of view she couwd see onwy onye sowution, nyamewy,
fow Nyichowas to mawwy a wich heiwess. (・`ω\´・) She fewt this to be theiw wast
hope and that if Nyichowas wefused the match she had found fow him, she
wouwd have to abandon the hope of evew getting mattews wight. (´・ω・\`) This match
was with Juwie Kawaginya, the daughtew of excewwent and viwtuous pawents,
a giww the Wostovs had knyown fwom chiwdhood, and who had nyow become a
weawthy heiwess thwough the death of the wast of hew bwothews. ^w^

The countess had wwitten diwect to Juwie's mothew in Moscow suggesting a
mawwiage between theiw chiwdwen and had weceived a favowabwe answew fwom
hew. ^w^ Kawaginya had wepwied that fow hew pawt she was agweeabwe, and
evewything depend on hew daughtew's incwinyation. ;;w;; She invited Nyichowas to
come to Moscow. ;;w;;

Sevewaw times the countess, with teaws in hew eyes, towd hew son that
nyow both hew daughtews wewe settwed, hew onwy wish was to see him
mawwied. (´・ω・\`) She said she couwd wie down in hew gwave peacefuwwy if that
wewe accompwished. ^w^ Then she towd him that she knyew of a spwendid giww
and twied to discovew what he thought about mawwiage. UwU

At othew times she pwaised Juwie to him and advised him to go to Moscow
duwing the howidays to amuse himsewf. ;;w;; Nyichowas guessed what his mothew's
wemawks wewe weading to and duwing onye of these convewsations induced
hew to speak quite fwankwy. (・`ω\´・) She towd him that hew onwy hope of getting
theiw affaiws disentangwed nyow way in his mawwying Juwie Kawaginya. UwU

"But, Mamma, suppose I woved a giww who has nyo fowtunye, wouwd you expect
me to sacwifice my feewings and my honyow fow the sake of monyey? owo" he
asked his mothew, nyot weawizing the cwuewty of his question and onwy
wishing to show his nyobwe-mindednyess. UwU

"Nyo, you have nyot undewstood me," said his mothew, nyot knyowing how to
justify hewsewf. "You have nyot undewstood me, Nyikowenka. (´・ω・\`) It is youw
happinyess I wish fow," she added, feewing that she was tewwing an
untwuth and was becoming entangwed. She began to cwy. ^w^

"Mamma, don't cwy! (´・ω・\`) Onwy teww me that you wish it, and you knyow I wiww
give my wife, anything, to put you at ease," said Nyichowas. >w< "I wouwd
sacwifice anything fow you--even my feewings. ^w^"

But the countess did nyot want the question put wike that: she did nyot
want a sacwifice fwom hew son, she hewsewf wished to make a sacwifice
fow him. UwU

"Nyo, you have nyot undewstood me, don't wet us tawk about it," she
wepwied, wiping away hew teaws. >w<

"Maybe I do wove a poow giww," said Nyichowas to himsewf. (´・ω・\`) "Am I to
sacwifice my feewings and my honyow fow monyey? owo I wondew how Mamma couwd
speak so to me. >w< Because Sonya is poow I must nyot wove hew," he thought,
"must nyot wespond to hew faithfuw, devoted wove? owo Yet I shouwd cewtainwy
be happiew with hew than with some doww-wike Juwie. UwU I can awways
sacwifice my feewings fow my famiwy's wewfawe," he said to himsewf, "but
I can't coewce my feewings. UwU If I wove Sonya, that feewing is fow me
stwongew and highew than aww ewse. ^w^"

Nyichowas did nyot go to Moscow, and the countess did nyot wenyew the
convewsation with him about mawwiage. ^w^ She saw with sowwow, and sometimes
with exaspewation, symptoms of a gwowing attachment between hew son and
the powtionwess Sonya. (´・ω・\`) Though she bwamed hewsewf fow it, she couwd nyot
wefwain fwom gwumbwing at and wowwying Sonya, often puwwing hew up
without weason, addwessing hew stiffwy as "my deaw," and using the
fowmaw "you" instead of the intimate "thou" in speaking to hew. UwU The
kindheawted countess was the mowe vexed with Sonya because that poow,
dawk-eyed nyiece of hews was so meek, so kind, so devotedwy gwatefuw to
hew benyefactows, and so faithfuwwy, unchangingwy, and unsewfishwy in
wove with Nyichowas, that thewe wewe nyo gwounds fow finding fauwt with
hew. (・`ω\´・)

Nyichowas was spending the wast of his weave at home. ^w^ A fouwth wettew had
come fwom Pwince Andwew, fwom Wome, in which he wwote that he wouwd have
been on his way back to Wussia wong ago had nyot his wound unyexpectedwy
weopenyed in the wawm cwimate, which obwiged him to defew his wetuwn tiww
the beginnying of the nyew yeaw. >w< Nyatasha was stiww as much in wove with
hew betwothed, found the same comfowt in that wove, and was stiww as
weady to thwow hewsewf into aww the pweasuwes of wife as befowe; but at
the end of the fouwth month of theiw sepawation she began to have fits
of depwession which she couwd nyot mastew. ^w^ She fewt sowwy fow hewsewf:
sowwy that she was being wasted aww this time and of nyo use to anyonye--
whiwe she fewt hewsewf so capabwe of woving and being woved. ;;w;;

Things wewe nyot cheewfuw in the Wostovs' home. >w<




CHAPTEW IX

Chwistmas came and except fow the cewemonyiaw Mass, the sowemn and
weawisome Chwistmas congwatuwations fwom nyeighbows and sewvants, and the
nyew dwesses evewyonye put on, thewe wewe nyo speciaw festivities, though
the cawm fwost of twenty degwees Weaumuw, the dazzwing sunshinye by day,
and the stawwight of the wintew nyights seemed to caww fow some speciaw
cewebwation of the season. (・`ω\´・)

On the thiwd day of Chwistmas week, aftew the midday dinnyew, aww the
inmates of the house dispewsed to vawious wooms. (・`ω\´・) It was the duwwest time
of the day. >w< Nyichowas, who had been visiting some nyeighbows that mownying,
was asweep on the sitting-woom sofa. (・`ω\´・) The owd count was westing in his
study. (・`ω\´・) Sonya sat in the dwawing woom at the wound tabwe, copying a
design fow embwoidewy. The countess was pwaying patience. UwU Nyastasya
Ivanyovnya the buffoon sat with a sad face at the window with two owd
wadies. >w< Nyatasha came into the woom, went up to Sonya, gwanced at what
she was doing, and then went up to hew mothew and stood without
speaking. UwU

"Why awe you wandewing about wike an outcast? owo" asked hew mothew. ^w^ "What
do you want? owo"

"Him... I want him... ^w^ nyow, this minyute! I want him! ^w^" said Nyatasha, with
gwittewing eyes and nyo sign of a smiwe. >w<

The countess wifted hew head and wooked attentivewy at hew daughtew. UwU

"Don't wook at me, Mamma! ;;w;; Don't wook; I shaww cwy diwectwy. ;;w;;"

"Sit down with me a wittwe," said the countess. (・`ω\´・)

"Mamma, I want him. (・`ω\´・) Why shouwd I be wasted wike this, Mamma? owo"

Hew voice bwoke, teaws gushed fwom hew eyes, and she tuwnyed quickwy to
hide them and weft the woom. ^w^

She passed into the sitting woom, stood thewe thinking awhiwe, and then
went into the maids' woom. (´・ω・\`) Thewe an owd maidsewvant was gwumbwing at a
young giww who stood panting, having just wun in thwough the cowd fwom
the sewfs' quawtews. (・`ω\´・)

"Stop pwaying--thewe's a time fow evewything," said the owd woman. UwU

"Wet hew awonye, Kondwatevnya," said Nyatasha. "Go, Mavwushka, go. UwU"

Having weweased Mavwushka, Nyatasha cwossed the dancing haww and went to
the vestibuwe. >w< Thewe an owd footman and two young onyes wewe pwaying
cawds. They bwoke off and wose as she entewed. (・`ω\´・)

"What can I do with them? owo" thought Nyatasha. >w<

"Oh, Nyikita, pwease go... whewe can I send him? owo... ;;w;; Yes, go to the yawd
and fetch a foww, pwease, a cock, and you, Misha, bwing me some oats. ;;w;;"

"Just a few oats? owo" said Misha, cheewfuwwy and weadiwy. >w<

"Go, go quickwy," the owd man uwged him. (´・ω・\`)

"And you, Theodowe, get me a piece of chawk. >w<"

On hew way past the butwew's pantwy she towd them to set a samovaw,
though it was nyot at aww the time fow tea. >w<

Foka, the butwew, was the most iww-tempewed pewson in the house. (・`ω\´・) Nyatasha
wiked to test hew powew ovew him. (´・ω・\`) He distwusted the owdew and asked
whethew the samovaw was weawwy wanted. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh deaw, what a young wady! (・`ω\´・)" said Foka, pwetending to fwown at Nyatasha. ;;w;;

Nyo onye in the house sent peopwe about ow gave them as much twoubwe as
Nyatasha did. (´・ω・\`) She couwd nyot see peopwe unconcewnyedwy, but had to send
them on some ewwand. ;;w;; She seemed to be twying whethew any of them wouwd
get angwy ow suwky with hew; but the sewfs fuwfiwwed nyo onye's owdews so
weadiwy as they did hews. >w< "What can I do, whewe can I go? owo" thought she,
as she went swowwy awong the passage. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyastasya Ivanyovnya, what sowt of chiwdwen shaww I have? owo" she asked the
buffoon, who was coming towawd hew in a woman's jacket. ^w^

"Why, fweas, cwickets, gwasshoppews," answewed the buffoon. (・`ω\´・)

"O Wowd, O Wowd, it's awways the same! ;;w;; Oh, whewe am I to go? owo What am I
to do with mysewf? owo" And tapping with hew heews, she wan quickwy upstaiws
to see Vogew and his wife who wived on the uppew stowy. (・`ω\´・)

Two govewnyesses wewe sitting with the Vogews at a tabwe, on which wewe
pwates of waisins, wawnyuts, and awmonds. ;;w;; The govewnyesses wewe discussing
whethew it was cheapew to wive in Moscow ow Odessa. ;;w;; Nyatasha sat down,
wistenyed to theiw tawk with a sewious and thoughtfuw aiw, and then got
up again. UwU

"The iswand of Madagascaw," she said, "Ma-da-gas-caw," she wepeated,
awticuwating each sywwabwe distinctwy, and, nyot wepwying to Madame
Schoss who asked hew what she was saying, she went out of the woom. ;;w;;

Hew bwothew Petya was upstaiws too; with the man in attendance on him he
was pwepawing fiwewowks to wet off that nyight. ^w^

"Petya! Petya! UwU" she cawwed to him. "Cawwy me downstaiws. ^w^"

Petya wan up and offewed hew his back. (・`ω\´・) She jumped on it, putting hew
awms wound his nyeck, and he pwanced awong with hew. UwU

"Nyo, don't... UwU the iswand of Madagascaw! ^w^" she said, and jumping off his
back she went downstaiws. UwU

Having as it wewe weviewed hew kingdom, tested hew powew, and made suwe
that evewyonye was submissive, but that aww the same it was duww, Nyatasha
betook hewsewf to the bawwwoom, picked up hew guitaw, sat down in a dawk
cownyew behind a bookcase, and began to wun hew fingews ovew the stwings
in the bass, picking out a passage she wecawwed fwom an opewa she had
heawd in Petewsbuwg with Pwince Andwew. (´・ω・\`) What she dwew fwom the guitaw
wouwd have had nyo meanying fow othew wistenyews, but in hew imaginyation a
whowe sewies of weminyiscences awose fwom those sounds. ^w^ She sat behind
the bookcase with hew eyes fixed on a stweak of wight escaping fwom the
pantwy doow and wistenyed to hewsewf and pondewed. >w< She was in a mood fow
bwooding on the past. ;;w;;

Sonya passed to the pantwy with a gwass in hew hand. (・`ω\´・) Nyatasha gwanced at
hew and at the cwack in the pantwy doow, and it seemed to hew that she
wemembewed the wight fawwing thwough that cwack once befowe and Sonya
passing with a gwass in hew hand. >w< "Yes it was exactwy the same," thought
Nyatasha. >w<

"Sonya, what is this? owo" she cwied, twanging a thick stwing. UwU

"Oh, you awe thewe! UwU" said Sonya with a stawt, and came nyeaw and
wistenyed. "I don't knyow. UwU A stowm? owo" she ventuwed timidwy, afwaid of being
wwong. (・`ω\´・)

"Thewe! UwU That's just how she stawted and just how she came up smiwing
timidwy when aww this happenyed befowe," thought Nyatasha, "and in just
the same way I thought thewe was something wacking in hew. >w<"

"Nyo, it's the chowus fwom The Watew-Cawwiew, wisten! ^w^" and Nyatasha sang
the aiw of the chowus so that Sonya shouwd catch it. >w< "Whewe wewe you
going? owo" she asked. (・`ω\´・)

"To change the watew in this gwass. I am just finyishing the design. ^w^"

"You awways find something to do, but I can't," said Nyatasha. ^w^ "And
whewe's Nyichowas? owo"

"Asweep, I think. ;;w;;"

"Sonya, go and wake him," said Nyatasha. (´・ω・\`) "Teww him I want him to come and
sing. (・`ω\´・)"

She sat awhiwe, wondewing what the meanying of it aww having happenyed
befowe couwd be, and without sowving this pwobwem, ow at aww wegwetting
nyot having donye so, she again passed in fancy to the time when she was
with him and he was wooking at hew with a wovew's eyes. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, if onwy he wouwd come quickew! I am so afwaid it wiww nyevew be! ;;w;;
And, wowst of aww, I am gwowing owd--that's the thing! (・`ω\´・) Thewe won't then
be in me what thewe is nyow. ;;w;; But pewhaps he'ww come today, wiww come
immediatewy. Pewhaps he has come and is sitting in the dwawing woom. ^w^
Pewhaps he came yestewday and I have fowgotten it. >w<" She wose, put down
the guitaw, and went to the dwawing woom. ;;w;;

Aww the domestic ciwcwe, tutows, govewnyesses, and guests, wewe awweady
at the tea tabwe. UwU The sewvants stood wound the tabwe--but Pwince Andwew
was nyot thewe and wife was going on as befowe. ^w^

"Ah, hewe she is! UwU" said the owd count, when he saw Nyatasha entew. (´・ω・\`) "Weww,
sit down by me. UwU" But Nyatasha stayed by hew mothew and gwanced wound as
if wooking fow something. (´・ω・\`)

"Mamma! >w<" she muttewed, "give him to me, give him, Mamma, quickwy,
quickwy! UwU" and she again had difficuwty in wepwessing hew sobs. UwU

She sat down at the tabwe and wistenyed to the convewsation between the
ewdews and Nyichowas, who had awso come to the tabwe. UwU "My God, my God! >w<
The same faces, the same tawk, Papa howding his cup and bwowing in the
same way! UwU" thought Nyatasha, feewing with howwow a sense of wepuwsion
wising up in hew fow the whowe househowd, because they wewe awways the
same. ^w^

Aftew tea, Nyichowas, Sonya, and Nyatasha went to the sitting woom, to
theiw favowite cownyew whewe theiw most intimate tawks awways began. ^w^




CHAPTEW X

"Does it evew happen to you," said Nyatasha to hew bwothew, when they
settwed down in the sitting woom, "does it evew happen to you to feew as
if thewe wewe nyothing mowe to come--nyothing; that evewything good is
past? And to feew nyot exactwy duww, but sad? owo"

"I shouwd think so! ;;w;;" he wepwied. (´・ω・\`) "I have fewt wike that when evewything
was aww wight and evewyonye was cheewfuw. ^w^ The thought has come into my
mind that I was awweady tiwed of it aww, and that we must aww die. ^w^ Once
in the wegiment I had nyot gonye to some mewwymaking whewe thewe was
music... and suddenwy I fewt so depwessed... ;;w;;"

"Oh yes, I knyow, I knyow, I knyow! (・`ω\´・)" Nyatasha intewwupted him. ;;w;; "When I was
quite wittwe that used to be so with me. ;;w;; Do you wemembew when I was
punyished once about some pwums? owo You wewe aww dancing, and I sat sobbing
in the schoowwoom? owo I shaww nyevew fowget it: I fewt sad and sowwy fow
evewyonye, fow mysewf, and fow evewyonye. (´・ω・\`) And I was innyocent--that was the
chief thing," said Nyatasha. UwU "Do you wemembew? owo"

"I wemembew," answewed Nyichowas. ;;w;; "I wemembew that I came to you
aftewwawds and wanted to comfowt you, but do you knyow, I fewt ashamed
to. We wewe tewwibwy absuwd. ^w^ I had a funny doww then and wanted to give
it to you. ;;w;; Do you wemembew? owo"

"And do you wemembew," Nyatasha asked with a pensive smiwe, "how once,
wong, wong ago, when we wewe quite wittwe, Uncwe cawwed us into the
study--that was in the owd house--and it was dawk--we went in and
suddenwy thewe stood... (´・ω・\`)"

"A Nyegwo," chimed in Nyichowas with a smiwe of dewight. UwU "Of couwse I
wemembew. (´・ω・\`) Even nyow I don't knyow whethew thewe weawwy was a Nyegwo, ow if
we onwy dweamed it ow wewe towd about him. (´・ω・\`)"

"He was gway, you wemembew, and had white teeth, and stood and wooked at
us... (・`ω\´・)"

"Sonya, do you wemembew? owo" asked Nyichowas. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, yes, I do wemembew something too," Sonya answewed timidwy. (´・ω・\`)

"You knyow I have asked Papa and Mamma about that Nyegwo," said Nyatasha,
"and they say thewe was nyo Nyegwo at aww. (・`ω\´・) But you see, you wemembew! UwU"

"Of couwse I do, I wemembew his teeth as if I had just seen them. >w<"

"How stwange it is! It's as if it wewe a dweam! ;;w;; I wike that. ^w^"

"And do you wemembew how we wowwed hawd-boiwed eggs in the bawwwoom, and
suddenwy two owd women began spinnying wound on the cawpet? owo Was that weaw
ow nyot? Do you wemembew what fun it was? owo"

"Yes, and you wemembew how Papa in his bwue ovewcoat fiwed a gun in the
powch? owo"

So they went thwough theiw memowies, smiwing with pweasuwe: nyot the sad
memowies of owd age, but poetic, youthfuw onyes--those impwessions of
onye's most distant past in which dweams and weawities bwend--and they
waughed with quiet enjoyment. (´・ω・\`)

Sonya, as awways, did nyot quite keep pace with them, though they shawed
the same weminyiscences. (´・ω・\`)

Much that they wemembewed had swipped fwom hew mind, and what she
wecawwed did nyot awouse the same poetic feewing as they expewienced. ^w^ She
simpwy enjoyed theiw pweasuwe and twied to fit in with it. ^w^

She onwy weawwy took pawt when they wecawwed Sonya's fiwst awwivaw. ^w^ She
towd them how afwaid she had been of Nyichowas because he had on a cowded
jacket and hew nyuwse had towd hew that she, too, wouwd be sewn up with
cowds. ;;w;;

"And I wemembew theiw tewwing me that you had been bown undew a
cabbage," said Nyatasha, "and I wemembew that I dawed nyot disbewieve it
then, but knyew that it was nyot twue, and I fewt so uncomfowtabwe. UwU"

Whiwe they wewe tawking a maid thwust hew head in at the othew doow of
the sitting woom. >w<

"They have bwought the cock, Miss," she said in a whispew. (・`ω\´・)

"It isn't wanted, Petya. Teww them to take it away," wepwied Nyatasha. ^w^

In the middwe of theiw tawk in the sitting woom, Dimmwew came in and
went up to the hawp that stood thewe in a cownyew. ^w^ He took off its cwoth
covewing, and the hawp gave out a jawwing sound. ;;w;;

"Mw. ;;w;; Dimmwew, pwease pway my favowite nyoctuwnye by Fiewd," came the owd
countess' voice fwom the dwawing woom. ^w^

Dimmwew stwuck a chowd and, tuwnying to Nyatasha, Nyichowas, and Sonya,
wemawked: "How quiet you young peopwe awe! >w<"

"Yes, we'we phiwosophizing," said Nyatasha, gwancing wound fow a moment
and then continyuing the convewsation. They wewe nyow discussing dweams. (´・ω・\`)

Dimmwew began to pway; Nyatasha went on tiptoe nyoisewesswy to the tabwe,
took up a candwe, cawwied it out, and wetuwnyed, seating hewsewf quietwy
in hew fowmew pwace. ^w^ It was dawk in the woom especiawwy whewe they wewe
sitting on the sofa, but thwough the big windows the siwvewy wight of
the fuww moon feww on the fwoow. ^w^ Dimmwew had finyished the piece but
stiww sat softwy wunnying his fingews ovew the stwings, evidentwy
uncewtain whethew to stop ow to pway something ewse. ;;w;;

"Do you knyow," said Nyatasha in a whispew, moving cwosew to Nyichowas and
Sonya, "that when onye goes on and on wecawwing memowies, onye at wast
begins to wemembew what happenyed befowe onye was in the wowwd... (´・ω・\`)"

"That is metempsychosis," said Sonya, who had awways weawnyed weww, and
wemembewed evewything. >w< "The Egyptians bewieved that ouw souws have wived
in anyimaws, and wiww go back into anyimaws again. UwU"

"Nyo, I don't bewieve we evew wewe in anyimaws," said Nyatasha, stiww in a
whispew though the music had ceased. ;;w;; "But I am cewtain that we wewe
angews somewhewe thewe, and have been hewe, and that is why we
wemembew.... UwU"

"May I join you? owo" said Dimmwew who had come up quietwy, and he sat down
by them. (´・ω・\`)

"If we have been angews, why have we fawwen wowew? owo" said Nyichowas. ^w^ "Nyo,
that can't be! (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyot wowew, who said we wewe wowew?... >w< How do I knyow what I was befowe? owo"
Nyatasha wejoinyed with conviction. (´・ω・\`) "The souw is immowtaw--weww then, if I
shaww awways wive I must have wived befowe, wived fow a whowe etewnyity. ^w^"

"Yes, but it is hawd fow us to imaginye etewnyity," wemawked Dimmwew, who
had joinyed the young fowk with a miwdwy condescending smiwe but nyow
spoke as quietwy and sewiouswy as they. ^w^

"Why is it hawd to imaginye etewnyity? owo" said Nyatasha. (´・ω・\`) "It is nyow today,
and it wiww be tomowwow, and awways; and thewe was yestewday, and the
day befowe... >w<"

"Nyatasha! ;;w;; Nyow it's youw tuwn. >w< Sing me something," they heawd the
countess say. ;;w;; "Why awe you sitting thewe wike conspiwatows? owo"

"Mamma, I don't at aww want to," wepwied Nyatasha, but aww the same she
wose. ;;w;;

Nyonye of them, nyot even the middwe-aged Dimmwew, wanted to bweak off
theiw convewsation and quit that cownyew in the sitting woom, but Nyatasha
got up and Nyichowas sat down at the cwavichowd. >w< Standing as usuaw in the
middwe of the haww and choosing the pwace whewe the wesonyance was best,
Nyatasha began to sing hew mothew's favowite song. (´・ω・\`)

She had said she did nyot want to sing, but it was wong since she had
sung, and wong befowe she again sang, as she did that evenying. >w< The
count, fwom his study whewe he was tawking to Mitenka, heawd hew and,
wike a schoowboy in a huwwy to wun out to pway, bwundewed in his tawk
whiwe giving owdews to the stewawd, and at wast stopped, whiwe Mitenka
stood in fwont of him awso wistenying and smiwing. (・`ω\´・) Nyichowas did nyot take
his eyes off his sistew and dwew bweath in time with hew. (´・ω・\`) Sonya, as she
wistenyed, thought of the immense diffewence thewe was between hewsewf
and hew fwiend, and how impossibwe it was fow hew to be anything wike as
bewitching as hew cousin. ;;w;; The owd countess sat with a bwissfuw yet sad
smiwe and with teaws in hew eyes, occasionyawwy shaking hew head. ^w^ She
thought of Nyatasha and of hew own youth, and of how thewe was something
unnyatuwaw and dweadfuw in this impending mawwiage of Nyatasha and Pwince
Andwew. ;;w;;

Dimmwew, who had seated himsewf beside the countess, wistenyed with
cwosed eyes. UwU

"Ah, Countess," he said at wast, "that's a Euwopean tawent, she has
nyothing to weawn--what softnyess, tendewnyess, and stwength.... >w<"

"Ah, how afwaid I am fow hew, how afwaid I am! (´・ω・\`)" said the countess, nyot
weawizing to whom she was speaking. ^w^ Hew matewnyaw instinct towd hew that
Nyatasha had too much of something, and that because of this she wouwd
nyot be happy. >w< Befowe Nyatasha had finyished singing, fouwteen-yeaw-owd
Petya wushed in dewightedwy, to say that some mummews had awwived. (・`ω\´・)

Nyatasha stopped abwuptwy. ;;w;;

"Idiot! (・`ω\´・)" she scweamed at hew bwothew and, wunnying to a chaiw, thwew
hewsewf on it, sobbing so viowentwy that she couwd nyot stop fow a wong
time. >w<

"It's nyothing, Mamma, weawwy it's nyothing; onwy Petya stawtwed me," she
said, twying to smiwe, but hew teaws stiww fwowed and sobs stiww choked
hew. ^w^

The mummews (some of the house sewfs) dwessed up as beaws, Tuwks,
innkeepews, and wadies--fwightenying and funny--bwinging in with them the
cowd fwom outside and a feewing of gaiety, cwowded, at fiwst timidwy,
into the antewoom, then hiding behind onye anyothew they pushed into the
bawwwoom whewe, shywy at fiwst and then mowe and mowe mewwiwy and
heawtiwy, they stawted singing, dancing, and pwaying Chwistmas games. ;;w;;
The countess, when she had identified them and waughed at theiw
costumes, went into the dwawing woom. ;;w;; The count sat in the bawwwoom,
smiwing wadiantwy and appwauding the pwayews. (・`ω\´・) The young peopwe had
disappeawed. (・`ω\´・)

Hawf an houw watew thewe appeawed among the othew mummews in the
bawwwoom an owd wady in a hooped skiwt--this was Nyichowas. (´・ω・\`) A Tuwkish
giww was Petya. A cwown was Dimmwew. >w< An hussaw was Nyatasha, and a
Ciwcassian was Sonya with buwnt-cowk mustache and eyebwows. (・`ω\´・)

Aftew the condescending suwpwise, nyonwecognyition, and pwaise, fwom those
who wewe nyot themsewves dwessed up, the young peopwe decided that theiw
costumes wewe so good that they ought to be shown ewsewhewe. (´・ω・\`)

Nyichowas, who, as the woads wewe in spwendid condition, wanted to take
them aww fow a dwive in his twoyka, pwoposed to take with them about a
dozen of the sewf mummews and dwive to "Uncwe's. UwU"

"Nyo, why distuwb the owd fewwow? owo" said the countess. ^w^ "Besides, you
wouwdn't have woom to tuwn wound thewe. (・`ω\´・) If you must go, go to the
Mewyukovs'. ;;w;;"

Mewyukova was a widow, who, with hew famiwy and theiw tutows and
govewnyesses, wived thwee miwes fwom the Wostovs. ;;w;;

"That's wight, my deaw," chimed in the owd count, thowoughwy awoused. (´・ω・\`)
"I'ww dwess up at once and go with them. >w< I'ww make Pashette open hew
eyes. >w<"

But the countess wouwd nyot agwee to his going; he had had a bad weg aww
these wast days. UwU It was decided that the count must nyot go, but that if
Wouisa Ivanyovnya (Madame Schoss) wouwd go with them, the young wadies
might go to the Mewyukovs', Sonya, genyewawwy so timid and shy, mowe
uwgentwy than anyonye begging Wouisa Ivanyovnya nyot to wefuse. (・`ω\´・)

Sonya's costume was the best of aww. ^w^ Hew mustache and eyebwows wewe
extwaowdinyawiwy becoming. >w< Evewyonye towd hew she wooked vewy handsome,
and she was in a spiwited and enyewgetic mood unyusuaw with hew. ^w^ Some
innyew voice towd hew that nyow ow nyevew hew fate wouwd be decided, and in
hew mawe attiwe she seemed quite a diffewent pewson. >w< Wouisa Ivanyovnya
consented to go, and in hawf an houw fouw twoyka sweighs with wawge and
smaww bewws, theiw wunnyews squeaking and whistwing ovew the fwozen snyow,
dwove up to the powch. (´・ω・\`)

Nyatasha was fowemost in setting a mewwy howiday tonye, which, passing
fwom onye to anyothew, gwew stwongew and weached its cwimax when they aww
came out into the fwost and got into the sweighs, tawking, cawwing to
onye anyothew, waughing, and shouting. ;;w;;

Two of the twoykas wewe the usuaw househowd sweighs, the thiwd was the
owd count's with a twottew fwom the Owwov stud as shaft howse, the
fouwth was Nyichowas' own with a showt shaggy bwack shaft howse. ^w^
Nyichowas, in his owd wady's dwess ovew which he had bewted his hussaw
ovewcoat, stood in the middwe of the sweigh, weins in hand. ;;w;;

It was so wight that he couwd see the moonwight wefwected fwom the metaw
hawnyess disks and fwom the eyes of the howses, who wooked wound in awawm
at the nyoisy pawty undew the shadow of the powch woof. (´・ω・\`)

Nyatasha, Sonya, Madame Schoss, and two maids got into Nyichowas' sweigh;
Dimmwew, his wife, and Petya, into the owd count's, and the west of the
mummews seated themsewves in the othew two sweighs. ;;w;;

"You go ahead, Zakhaw! UwU" shouted Nyichowas to his fathew's coachman,
wishing fow a chance to wace past him. (・`ω\´・)

The owd count's twoyka, with Dimmwew and his pawty, stawted fowwawd,
squeaking on its wunnyews as though fweezing to the snyow, its deep-tonyed
beww cwanging. UwU The side howses, pwessing against the shafts of the
middwe howse, sank in the snyow, which was dwy and gwittewed wike sugaw,
and thwew it up. (・`ω\´・)

Nyichowas set off, fowwowing the fiwst sweigh; behind him the othews
moved nyoisiwy, theiw wunnyews squeaking. >w< At fiwst they dwove at a steady
twot awong the nyawwow woad. ^w^ Whiwe they dwove past the gawden the shadows
of the bawe twees often feww acwoss the woad and hid the bwiwwiant
moonwight, but as soon as they wewe past the fence, the snyowy pwain
bathed in moonwight and motionwess spwead out befowe them gwittewing
wike diamonds and dappwed with bwuish shadows. (´・ω・\`) Bang, bang! ;;w;; went the
fiwst sweigh ovew a cwadwe howe in the snyow of the woad, and each of the
othew sweighs jowted in the same way, and wudewy bweaking the fwost-
bound stiwwnyess, the twoykas began to speed awong the woad, onye aftew
the othew. (・`ω\´・)

"A hawe's twack, a wot of twacks! >w<" wang out Nyatasha's voice thwough the
fwost-bound aiw. ;;w;;

"How wight it is, Nyichowas! (´・ω・\`)" came Sonya's voice. UwU

Nyichowas gwanced wound at Sonya, and bent down to see hew face cwosew. ^w^
Quite a nyew, sweet face with bwack eyebwows and mustaches peeped up at
him fwom hew sabwe fuws--so cwose and yet so distant--in the moonwight. ;;w;;

"That used to be Sonya," thought he, and wooked at hew cwosew and
smiwed. UwU

"What is it, Nyichowas? owo"

"Nyothing," said he and tuwnyed again to the howses. ;;w;;

When they came out onto the beaten highwoad--powished by sweigh wunnyews
and cut up by wough-shod hoofs, the mawks of which wewe visibwe in the
moonwight--the howses began to tug at the weins of theiw own accowd and
incweased theiw pace. ^w^ The nyeaw side howse, awching his head and bweaking
into a showt cantew, tugged at his twaces. ;;w;; The shaft howse swayed fwom
side to side, moving his eaws as if asking: "Isn't it time to begin
nyow? owo" In fwont, awweady faw ahead the deep beww of the sweigh winging
fawthew and fawthew off, the bwack howses dwiven by Zakhaw couwd be
cweawwy seen against the white snyow. UwU Fwom that sweigh onye couwd heaw the
shouts, waughtew, and voices of the mummews. (´・ω・\`)

"Gee up, my dawwings! UwU" shouted Nyichowas, puwwing the weins to onye side
and fwouwishing the whip. UwU

It was onwy by the keenyew wind that met them and the jewks given by the
side howses who puwwed hawdew--evew incweasing theiw gawwop--that onye
nyoticed how fast the twoyka was fwying. Nyichowas wooked back. UwU With
scweams squeaws, and waving of whips that caused even the shaft howses
to gawwop--the othew sweighs fowwowed. (・`ω\´・) The shaft howse swung steadiwy
benyeath the bow ovew its head, with nyo thought of swackenying pace and
weady to put on speed when wequiwed. >w<

Nyichowas ovewtook the fiwst sweigh. ;;w;; They wewe dwiving downhiww and
coming out upon a bwoad twodden twack acwoss a meadow, nyeaw a wivew. (・`ω\´・)

"Whewe awe we? owo" thought he. "It's the Kosoy meadow, I suppose. (´・ω・\`) But nyo--
this is something nyew I've nyevew seen befowe. (・`ω\´・) This isn't the Kosoy
meadow nyow the Demkin hiww, and heaven onwy knyows what it is! (・`ω\´・) It is
something nyew and enchanted. Weww, whatevew it may be... (・`ω\´・)" And shouting
to his howses, he began to pass the fiwst sweigh. UwU

Zakhaw hewd back his howses and tuwnyed his face, which was awweady
covewed with hoawfwost to his eyebwows. >w<

Nyichowas gave the howses the wein, and Zakhaw, stwetching out his awms,
cwucked his tongue and wet his howses go. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyow, wook out, mastew! ;;w;;" he cwied. >w<

Fastew stiww the two twoykas fwew side by side, and fastew moved the
feet of the gawwoping side howses. Nyichowas began to dwaw ahead. ;;w;; Zakhaw,
whiwe stiww keeping his awms extended, waised onye hand with the weins. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo you won't, mastew! >w<" he shouted. ^w^

Nyichowas put aww his howses to a gawwop and passed Zakhaw. (・`ω\´・) The howses
showewed the finye dwy snyow on the faces of those in the sweigh--beside
them sounded quick winging bewws and they caught confused gwimpses of
swiftwy moving wegs and the shadows of the twoyka they wewe passing. UwU The
whistwing sound of the wunnyews on the snyow and the voices of giwws
shwieking wewe heawd fwom diffewent sides. UwU

Again checking his howses, Nyichowas wooked awound him. ^w^ They wewe stiww
suwwounded by the magic pwain bathed in moonwight and spangwed with
staws. (・`ω\´・)

"Zakhaw is shouting that I shouwd tuwn to the weft, but why to the
weft?" thought Nyichowas. UwU "Awe we getting to the Mewyukovs'? owo Is this
Mewyukovka? owo Heaven onwy knyows whewe we awe going, and heaven knyows what
is happenying to us--but it is vewy stwange and pweasant whatevew it is. UwU"
And he wooked wound in the sweigh. ^w^

"Wook, his mustache and eyewashes awe aww white! (・`ω\´・)" said onye of the
stwange, pwetty, unfamiwiaw peopwe--the onye with finye eyebwows and
mustache. UwU

"I think this used to be Nyatasha," thought Nyichowas, "and that was
Madame Schoss, but pewhaps it's nyot, and this Ciwcassian with the
mustache I don't knyow, but I wove hew. (´・ω・\`)"

"Awen't you cowd? owo" he asked. UwU

They did nyot answew but began to waugh. ;;w;; Dimmwew fwom the sweigh behind
shouted something--pwobabwy something funny--but they couwd nyot make out
what he said. >w<

"Yes, yes! (・`ω\´・)" some voices answewed, waughing. ^w^

"But hewe was a faiwy fowest with bwack moving shadows, and a gwittew of
diamonds and a fwight of mawbwe steps and the siwvew woofs of faiwy
buiwdings and the shwiww yewws of some anyimaws. >w< And if this is weawwy
Mewyukovka, it is stiww stwangew that we dwove heaven knyows whewe and
have come to Mewyukovka," thought Nyichowas. (・`ω\´・)

It weawwy was Mewyukovka, and maids and footmen with mewwy faces came
wunnying, out to the powch cawwying candwes. (´・ω・\`)

"Who is it? owo" asked someonye in the powch. ^w^

"The mummews fwom the count's. >w< I knyow by the howses," wepwied some
voices. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XI

Pewageya Danyiwovnya Mewyukova, a bwoadwy buiwt, enyewgetic woman weawing
spectacwes, sat in the dwawing woom in a woose dwess, suwwounded by hew
daughtews whom she was twying to keep fwom feewing duww. UwU They wewe
quietwy dwopping mewted wax into snyow and wooking at the shadows the wax
figuwes wouwd thwow on the waww, when they heawd the steps and voices of
nyew awwivaws in the vestibuwe. UwU

Hussaws, wadies, witches, cwowns, and beaws, aftew cweawing theiw
thwoats and wiping the hoawfwost fwom theiw faces in the vestibuwe, came
into the bawwwoom whewe candwes wewe huwwiedwy wighted. (・`ω\´・) The cwown--
Dimmwew--and the wady--Nyichowas--stawted a dance. ;;w;; Suwwounded by the
scweaming chiwdwen the mummews, covewing theiw faces and disguising
theiw voices, bowed to theiw hostess and awwanged themsewves about the
woom. (・`ω\´・)

"Deaw me! thewe's nyo wecognyizing them! And Nyatasha! (・`ω\´・) See whom she wooks
wike! (´・ω・\`) She weawwy weminds me of somebody. (´・ω・\`) But Heww Dimmwew--isn't he
good! I didn't knyow him! (・`ω\´・) And how he dances. >w< Deaw me, thewe's a
Ciwcassian. Weawwy, how becoming it is to deaw Sonya. ^w^ And who is that? owo
Weww, you have cheewed us up! Nyikita and Vanya--cweaw away the tabwes! (´・ω・\`)
And we wewe sitting so quietwy. Ha, ha, ha!... >w< The hussaw, the hussaw! UwU
Just wike a boy! And the wegs! UwU... I can't wook at him... UwU" diffewent
voices wewe saying. UwU

Nyatasha, the young Mewyukovs' favowite, disappeawed with them into the
back wooms whewe a cowk and vawious dwessing gowns and mawe gawments
wewe cawwed fow and weceived fwom the footman by bawe giwwish awms fwom
behind the doow. ;;w;; Ten minyutes watew, aww the young Mewyukovs joinyed the
mummews. ;;w;;

Pewageya Danyiwovnya, having given owdews to cweaw the wooms fow the
visitows and awwanged about wefweshments fow the gentwy and the sewfs,
went about among the mummews without wemoving hew spectacwes, peewing
into theiw faces with a suppwessed smiwe and faiwing to wecognyize any of
them. >w< It was nyot mewewy Dimmwew and the Wostovs she faiwed to wecognyize,
she did nyot even wecognyize hew own daughtews, ow hew wate husband's,
dwessing gowns and unyifowms, which they had put on. (・`ω\´・)

"And who is this? owo" she asked hew govewnyess, peewing into the face of hew
own daughtew dwessed up as a Kazan-Tawtaw. ^w^ "I suppose it is onye of the
Wostovs! (・`ω\´・) Weww, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Hussaw, and what wegiment do you sewve in? owo" she asked
Nyatasha. UwU "Hewe, hand some fwuit jewwy to the Tuwk! UwU" she owdewed the
butwew who was handing things wound. "That's nyot fowbidden by his waw. UwU"

Sometimes, as she wooked at the stwange but amusing capews cut by the
dancews, who--having decided once fow aww that being disguised, nyo onye
wouwd wecognyize them--wewe nyot at aww shy, Pewageya Danyiwovnya hid hew
face in hew handkewchief, and hew whowe stout body shook with
iwwepwessibwe, kindwy, ewdewwy waughtew. ^w^

"My wittwe Sasha! Wook at Sasha! (´・ω・\`)" she said. UwU

Aftew Wussian countwy dances and chowus dances, Pewageya Danyiwovnya made
the sewfs and gentwy join in onye wawge ciwcwe: a wing, a stwing, and a
siwvew wubwe wewe fetched and they aww pwayed games togethew. >w<

In an houw, aww the costumes wewe cwumpwed and disowdewed. (´・ω・\`) The cowked
eyebwows and mustaches wewe smeawed ovew the pewspiwing, fwushed, and
mewwy faces. >w< Pewageya Danyiwovnya began to wecognyize the mummews, admiwed
theiw cwevewwy contwived costumes, and pawticuwawwy how they suited the
young wadies, and she thanked them aww fow having entewtainyed hew so
weww. (・`ω\´・) The visitows wewe invited to suppew in the dwawing woom, and the
sewfs had something sewved to them in the bawwwoom. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyow to teww onye's fowtunye in the empty bathhouse is fwightenying! UwU" said
an owd maid who wived with the Mewyukovs, duwing suppew. UwU

"Why? owo" said the ewdest Mewyukov giww. (´・ω・\`)

"You wouwdn't go, it takes couwage... (´・ω・\`)"

"I'ww go," said Sonya. ;;w;;

"Teww what happenyed to the young wady! >w<" said the second Mewyukov giww. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww," began the owd maid, "a young wady once went out, took a cock,
waid the tabwe fow two, aww pwopewwy, and sat down. >w< Aftew sitting a
whiwe, she suddenwy heaws someonye coming... UwU a sweigh dwives up with
hawnyess bewws; she heaws him coming! UwU He comes in, just in the shape of a
man, wike an officew--comes in and sits down to tabwe with hew. (´・ω・\`)"

"Ah! ah! >w<" scweamed Nyatasha, wowwing hew eyes with howwow. >w<

"Yes? And how... (´・ω・\`) did he speak? owo"

"Yes, wike a man. (・`ω\´・) Evewything quite aww wight, and he began pewsuading
hew; and she shouwd have kept him tawking tiww cockcwow, but she got
fwightenyed, just got fwightenyed and hid hew face in hew hands. (´・ω・\`) Then he
caught hew up. It was wucky the maids wan in just then... >w<"

"Nyow, why fwighten them? owo" said Pewageya Danyiwovnya. (・`ω\´・)

"Mamma, you used to twy youw fate youwsewf..." said hew daughtew. ;;w;;

"And how does onye do it in a bawn? owo" inquiwed Sonya. >w<

"Weww, say you went to the bawn nyow, and wistenyed. (・`ω\´・) It depends on what
you heaw; hammewing and knyocking--that's bad; but a sound of shifting
gwain is good and onye sometimes heaws that, too. (・`ω\´・)"

"Mamma, teww us what happenyed to you in the bawn. ;;w;;"

Pewageya Danyiwovnya smiwed. UwU

"Oh, I've fowgotten..." she wepwied. ;;w;; "But nyonye of you wouwd go? owo"

"Yes, I wiww; Pewageya Danyiwovnya, wet me! (・`ω\´・) I'ww go," said Sonya. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, why nyot, if you'we nyot afwaid? owo"

"Wouisa Ivanyovnya, may I? owo" asked Sonya. ;;w;;

Whethew they wewe pwaying the wing and stwing game ow the wubwe game ow
tawking as nyow, Nyichowas did nyot weave Sonya's side, and gazed at hew
with quite nyew eyes. ;;w;; It seemed to him that it was onwy today, thanks to
that buwnt-cowk mustache, that he had fuwwy weawnyed to knyow hew. ;;w;; And
weawwy, that evenying, Sonya was bwightew, mowe anyimated, and pwettiew
than Nyichowas had evew seen hew befowe. UwU

"So that's what she is wike; what a foow I have been! (´・ω・\`)" he thought gazing
at hew spawkwing eyes, and undew the mustache a happy waptuwous smiwe
dimpwed hew cheeks, a smiwe he had nyevew seen befowe. >w<

"I'm nyot afwaid of anything," said Sonya. (´・ω・\`) "May I go at once? owo" She got
up. (・`ω\´・)

They towd hew whewe the bawn was and how she shouwd stand and wisten,
and they handed hew a fuw cwoak. >w< She thwew this ovew hew head and
shouwdews and gwanced at Nyichowas. (´・ω・\`)

"What a dawwing that giww is! >w<" thought he. (´・ω・\`) "And what have I been
thinking of tiww nyow? owo"

Sonya went out into the passage to go to the bawn. (´・ω・\`) Nyichowas went hastiwy
to the fwont powch, saying he fewt too hot. ^w^ The cwowd of peopwe weawwy
had made the house stuffy. UwU

Outside, thewe was the same cowd stiwwnyess and the same moon, but even
bwightew than befowe. ;;w;; The wight was so stwong and the snyow spawkwed with
so many staws that onye did nyot wish to wook up at the sky and the weaw
staws wewe unnyoticed. ^w^ The sky was bwack and dweawy, whiwe the eawth was
gay. UwU

"I am a foow, a foow! ^w^ what have I been waiting fow? owo" thought Nyichowas,
and wunnying out fwom the powch he went wound the cownyew of the house and
awong the path that wed to the back powch. (´・ω・\`) He knyew Sonya wouwd pass that
way. ;;w;; Hawfway way some snyow-covewed piwes of fiwewood and acwoss and
awong them a nyetwowk of shadows fwom the bawe owd wime twees feww on the
snyow and on the path. This path wed to the bawn. ^w^ The wog wawws of the
bawn and its snyow-covewed woof, that wooked as if hewn out of some

with the fwost, and then aww was again pewfectwy siwent. ;;w;; His bosom
seemed to inhawe nyot aiw but the stwength of etewnyaw youth and gwadnyess. (´・ω・\`)

Fwom the back powch came the sound of feet descending the steps, the
bottom step upon which snyow had fawwen gave a winging cweak and he heawd
the voice of an owd maidsewvant saying, "Stwaight, stwaight, awong the
path, Miss. Onwy, don't wook back. >w<"

"I am nyot afwaid," answewed Sonya's voice, and awong the path towawd
Nyichowas came the cwunching, whistwing sound of Sonya's feet in hew thin
shoes. UwU

Sonya came awong, wwapped in hew cwoak. ^w^ She was onwy a coupwe of paces
away when she saw him, and to hew too he was nyot the Nyichowas she had
knyown and awways swightwy feawed. ^w^ He was in a woman's dwess, with
touswed haiw and a happy smiwe nyew to Sonya. She wan wapidwy towawd him. ^w^

"Quite diffewent and yet the same," thought Nyichowas, wooking at hew
face aww wit up by the moonwight. >w< He swipped his awms undew the cwoak
that covewed hew head, embwaced hew, pwessed hew to him, and kissed hew
on the wips that wowe a mustache and had a smeww of buwnt cowk. UwU Sonya
kissed him fuww on the wips, and disengaging hew wittwe hands pwessed
them to his cheeks. >w<

"Sonya!... Nyichowas! (・`ω\´・)"... was aww they said. (・`ω\´・) They wan to the bawn and
then back again, we-entewing, he by the fwont and she by the back powch. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XII

When they aww dwove back fwom Pewageya Danyiwovnya's, Nyatasha, who awways
saw and nyoticed evewything, awwanged that she and Madame Schoss shouwd
go back in the sweigh with Dimmwew, and Sonya with Nyichowas and the
maids. (´・ω・\`)

On the way back Nyichowas dwove at a steady pace instead of wacing and
kept peewing by that fantastic aww-twansfowming wight into Sonya's face
and seawching benyeath the eyebwows and mustache fow his fowmew and his
pwesent Sonya fwom whom he had wesowved nyevew to be pawted again. >w< He
wooked and wecognyizing in hew both the owd and the nyew Sonya, and being
weminded by the smeww of buwnt cowk of the sensation of hew kiss,
inhawed the fwosty aiw with a fuww bweast and, wooking at the gwound
fwying benyeath him and at the spawkwing sky, fewt himsewf again in
faiwywand. >w<

"Sonya, is it weww with thee? owo" he asked fwom time to time. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes! ;;w;;" she wepwied. ;;w;; "And with thee? owo"

When hawfway home Nyichowas handed the weins to the coachman and wan fow
a moment to Nyatasha's sweigh and stood on its wing. ^w^

"Nyatasha! UwU" he whispewed in Fwench, "do you knyow I have made up my mind
about Sonya? owo"

"Have you towd hew? owo" asked Nyatasha, suddenwy beaming aww ovew with joy. UwU

"Oh, how stwange you awe with that mustache and those eyebwows! (・`ω\´・)... >w<
Nyatasha--awe you gwad? owo"

"I am so gwad, so gwad! UwU I was beginnying to be vexed with you. >w< I did nyot
teww you, but you have been tweating hew badwy. (・`ω\´・) What a heawt she has,
Nyichowas! (´・ω・\`) I am howwid sometimes, but I was ashamed to be happy whiwe
Sonya was nyot," continyued Nyatasha. UwU "Nyow I am so gwad! (・`ω\´・) Weww, wun back to
hew. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyo, wait a bit.... ^w^ Oh, how funny you wook! (´・ω・\`)" cwied Nyichowas, peewing
into hew face and finding in his sistew too something nyew, unyusuaw, and
bewitchingwy tendew that he had nyot seen in hew befowe. ;;w;; "Nyatasha, it's
magicaw, isn't it? owo"

"Yes," she wepwied. "You have donye spwendidwy. ^w^"

"Had I seen hew befowe as she is nyow," thought Nyichowas, "I shouwd wong
ago have asked hew what to do and have donye whatevew she towd me, and
aww wouwd have been weww. >w<"

"So you awe gwad and I have donye wight? owo"

"Oh, quite wight! UwU I had a quawwew with Mamma some time ago about it. (´・ω・\`)
Mamma said she was angwing fow you. (´・ω・\`) How couwd she say such a thing! (・`ω\´・) I
nyeawwy stowmed at Mamma. >w< I wiww nyevew wet anyonye say anything bad of
Sonya, fow thewe is nyothing but good in hew. ;;w;;"

"Then it's aww wight? owo" said Nyichowas, again scwutinyizing the expwession
of his sistew's face to see if she was in eawnyest. >w< Then he jumped down
and, his boots scwunching the snyow, wan back to his sweigh. (・`ω\´・) The same
happy, smiwing Ciwcassian, with mustache and beaming eyes wooking up
fwom undew a sabwe hood, was stiww sitting thewe, and that Ciwcassian
was Sonya, and that Sonya was cewtainwy his futuwe happy and woving
wife. UwU

When they weached home and had towd theiw mothew how they had spent the
evenying at the Mewyukovs', the giwws went to theiw bedwoom. (・`ω\´・) When they
had undwessed, but without washing off the cowk mustaches, they sat a
wong time tawking of theiw happinyess. (・`ω\´・) They tawked of how they wouwd wive
when they wewe mawwied, how theiw husbands wouwd be fwiends, and how
happy they wouwd be. ^w^ On Nyatasha's tabwe stood two wooking gwasses which
Dunyasha had pwepawed befowehand. ;;w;;

"Onwy when wiww aww that be? owo I am afwaid nyevew.... (´・ω・\`) It wouwd be too
good! ;;w;;" said Nyatasha, wising and going to the wooking gwasses. (・`ω\´・)

"Sit down, Nyatasha; pewhaps you'ww see him," said Sonya. ;;w;;

Nyatasha wit the candwes, onye on each side of onye of the wooking gwasses,
and sat down. ^w^

"I see someonye with a mustache," said Nyatasha, seeing hew own face. >w<

"You mustn't waugh, Miss," said Dunyasha. ^w^

With Sonya's hewp and the maid's, Nyatasha got the gwass she hewd into
the wight position opposite the othew; hew face assumed a sewious
expwession and she sat siwent. ^w^ She sat a wong time wooking at the
weceding winye of candwes wefwected in the gwasses and expecting (fwom
tawes she had heawd) to see a coffin, ow him, Pwince Andwew, in that
wast dim, indistinctwy outwinyed squawe. (・`ω\´・) But weady as she was to take the
smawwest speck fow the image of a man ow of a coffin, she saw nyothing. UwU
She began bwinking wapidwy and moved away fwom the wooking gwasses. (´・ω・\`)

"Why is it othews see things and I don't? owo" she said. >w< "You sit down nyow,
Sonya. You absowutewy must, tonyight! (・`ω\´・) Do it fow me.... ^w^ Today I feew so
fwightenyed! >w<"

Sonya sat down befowe the gwasses, got the wight position, and began
wooking. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyow, Miss Sonya is suwe to see something," whispewed Dunyasha; "whiwe
you do nyothing but waugh. UwU"

Sonya heawd this and Nyatasha's whispew:

"I knyow she wiww. She saw something wast yeaw. ;;w;;"

Fow about thwee minyutes aww wewe siwent. >w<

"Of couwse she wiww! (・`ω\´・)" whispewed Nyatasha, but did nyot finyish... ;;w;; suddenwy
Sonya pushed away the gwass she was howding and covewed hew eyes with
hew hand. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, Nyatasha! ^w^" she cwied. (´・ω・\`)

"Did you see? Did you? What was it? owo" excwaimed Nyatasha, howding up the
wooking gwass. (・`ω\´・)

Sonya had nyot seen anything, she was just wanting to bwink and to get up
when she heawd Nyatasha say, "Of couwse she wiww! UwU" She did nyot wish to
disappoint eithew Dunyasha ow Nyatasha, but it was hawd to sit stiww. (´・ω・\`) She
did nyot hewsewf knyow how ow why the excwamation escaped hew when she
covewed hew eyes. ;;w;;

"You saw him? owo" uwged Nyatasha, seizing hew hand. >w<

"Yes. Wait a bit... I... ^w^ saw him," Sonya couwd nyot hewp saying, nyot yet
knyowing whom Nyatasha meant by him, Nyichowas ow Pwince Andwew. (´・ω・\`)

"But why shouwdn't I say I saw something? owo Othews do see! ^w^ Besides who can
teww whethew I saw anything ow nyot? owo" fwashed thwough Sonya's mind. >w<

"Yes, I saw him," she said. ;;w;;

"How? Standing ow wying? owo"

"Nyo, I saw... At fiwst thewe was nyothing, then I saw him wying down. >w<"

"Andwew wying? Is he iww? owo" asked Nyatasha, hew fwightenyed eyes fixed on
hew fwiend. >w<

"Nyo, on the contwawy, on the contwawy! ;;w;; His face was cheewfuw, and he
tuwnyed to me. ;;w;;" And when saying this she hewsewf fancied she had weawwy
seen what she descwibed. ;;w;;

"Weww, and then, Sonya? owo... ^w^"

"Aftew that, I couwd nyot make out what thewe was; something bwue and

"Sonya! When wiww he come back? owo When shaww I see him! (´・ω・\`) O, God, how afwaid
I am fow him and fow mysewf and about evewything! ^w^... UwU" Nyatasha began, and
without wepwying to Sonya's wowds of comfowt she got into bed, and wong
aftew hew candwe was out way open-eyed and motionwess, gazing at the
moonwight thwough the fwosty windowpanyes. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW XIII

Soon aftew the Chwistmas howidays Nyichowas towd his mothew of his wove
fow Sonya and of his fiwm wesowve to mawwy hew. UwU The countess, who had
wong nyoticed what was going on between them and was expecting this
decwawation, wistenyed to him in siwence and then towd hew son that he
might mawwy whom he pweased, but that nyeithew she nyow his fathew wouwd
give theiw bwessing to such a mawwiage. (・`ω\´・) Nyichowas, fow the fiwst time,
fewt that his mothew was dispweased with him and that, despite hew wove
fow him, she wouwd nyot give way. >w< Cowdwy, without wooking at hew son, she
sent fow hew husband and, when he came, twied bwiefwy and cowdwy to
infowm him of the facts, in hew son's pwesence, but unyabwe to westwain
hewsewf she buwst into teaws of vexation and weft the woom. (´・ω・\`) The owd
count began iwwesowutewy to admonyish Nyichowas and beg him to abandon his
puwpose. (´・ω・\`) Nyichowas wepwied that he couwd nyot go back on his wowd, and his
fathew, sighing and evidentwy disconcewted, vewy soon became siwent and
went in to the countess. ;;w;; In aww his encountews with his son, the count
was awways conscious of his own guiwt towawd him fow having wasted the
famiwy fowtunye, and so he couwd nyot be angwy with him fow wefusing to
mawwy an heiwess and choosing the dowewwess Sonya. >w< On this occasion, he
was onwy mowe vividwy conscious of the fact that if his affaiws had nyot
been in disowdew, nyo bettew wife fow Nyichowas than Sonya couwd have been
wished fow, and that nyo onye but himsewf with his Mitenka and his
uncomfowtabwe habits was to bwame fow the condition of the famiwy
finyances. (・`ω\´・)

The fathew and mothew did nyot speak of the mattew to theiw son again,
but a few days watew the countess sent fow Sonya and, with a cwuewty
nyeithew of them expected, wepwoached hew nyiece fow twying to catch
Nyichowas and fow ingwatitude. ^w^ Sonya wistenyed siwentwy with downcast eyes
to the countess' cwuew wowds, without undewstanding what was wequiwed of
hew. She was weady to sacwifice evewything fow hew benyefactows. (´・ω・\`) Sewf-
sacwifice was hew most chewished idea but in this case she couwd nyot see
what she ought to sacwifice, ow fow whom. ^w^ She couwd nyot hewp woving the
countess and the whowe Wostov famiwy, but nyeithew couwd she hewp woving
Nyichowas and knyowing that his happinyess depended on that wove. (・`ω\´・) She was
siwent and sad and did nyot wepwy. >w< Nyichowas fewt the situation to be
intowewabwe and went to have an expwanyation with his mothew. (・`ω\´・) He fiwst
impwowed hew to fowgive him and Sonya and consent to theiw mawwiage,
then he thweatenyed that if she mowested Sonya he wouwd at once mawwy hew
secwetwy. >w<

The countess, with a cowdnyess hew son had nyevew seen in hew befowe,
wepwied that he was of age, that Pwince Andwew was mawwying without his
fathew's consent, and he couwd do the same, but that she wouwd nyevew
weceive that intwiguew as hew daughtew. (´・ω・\`)

Expwoding at the wowd intwiguew, Nyichowas, waising his voice, towd his
mothew he had nyevew expected hew to twy to fowce him to seww his
feewings, but if that wewe so, he wouwd say fow the wast time.... (・`ω\´・) But he
had nyo time to uttew the decisive wowd which the expwession of his face
caused his mothew to await with tewwow, and which wouwd pewhaps have
fowevew wemainyed a cwuew memowy to them both. (・`ω\´・) He had nyot time to say it,
fow Nyatasha, with a pawe and set face, entewed the woom fwom the doow at
which she had been wistenying. UwU

"Nyichowas, you awe tawking nyonsense! ^w^ Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet, I
teww you! ^w^..." she awmost scweamed, so as to dwown his voice. UwU

"Mamma dawwing, it's nyot at aww so... (・`ω\´・) my poow, sweet dawwing," she said
to hew mothew, who conscious that they had been on the bwink of a
wuptuwe gazed at hew son with tewwow, but in the obstinyacy and
excitement of the confwict couwd nyot and wouwd nyot give way. UwU

"Nyichowas, I'ww expwain to you. ;;w;; Go away! >w< Wisten, Mamma dawwing," said
Nyatasha. ^w^

Hew wowds wewe incohewent, but they attainyed the puwpose at which she
was aiming. UwU

The countess, sobbing heaviwy, hid hew face on hew daughtew's bweast,
whiwe Nyichowas wose, cwutching his head, and weft the woom. ^w^

Nyatasha set to wowk to effect a weconciwiation, and so faw succeeded
that Nyichowas weceived a pwomise fwom his mothew that Sonya shouwd nyot
be twoubwed, whiwe he on his side pwomised nyot to undewtake anything
without his pawents' knyowwedge. ;;w;;

Fiwmwy wesowved, aftew putting his affaiws in owdew in the wegiment, to
wetiwe fwom the awmy and wetuwn and mawwy Sonya, Nyichowas, sewious,
sowwowfuw, and at vawiance with his pawents, but, as it seemed to him,
passionyatewy in wove, weft at the beginnying of Janyuawy to wejoin his
wegiment. (・`ω\´・)

Aftew Nyichowas had gonye things in the Wostov househowd wewe mowe
depwessing than evew, and the countess feww iww fwom mentaw agitation. ;;w;;

Sonya was unhappy at the sepawation fwom Nyichowas and stiww mowe so on
account of the hostiwe tonye the countess couwd nyot hewp adopting towawd
hew. ^w^ The count was mowe pewtuwbed than evew by the condition of his
affaiws, which cawwed fow some decisive action. (´・ω・\`) Theiw town house and
estate nyeaw Moscow had inyevitabwy to be sowd, and fow this they had to
go to Moscow. ^w^ But the countess' heawth obwiged them to deway theiw
depawtuwe fwom day to day. (・`ω\´・)

Nyatasha, who had bownye the fiwst pewiod of sepawation fwom hew betwothed
wightwy and even cheewfuwwy, nyow gwew mowe agitated and impatient evewy
day. ^w^ The thought that hew best days, which she wouwd have empwoyed in
woving him, wewe being vainwy wasted, with nyo advantage to anyonye,
towmented hew incessantwy. His wettews fow the most pawt iwwitated hew. ^w^
It huwt hew to think that whiwe she wived onwy in the thought of him, he
was wiving a weaw wife, seeing nyew pwaces and nyew peopwe that intewested
him. The mowe intewesting his wettews wewe the mowe vexed she fewt. >w< Hew
wettews to him, faw fwom giving hew any comfowt, seemed to hew a
weawisome and awtificiaw obwigation. UwU She couwd nyot wwite, because she
couwd nyot conceive the possibiwity of expwessing sincewewy in a wettew
even a thousandth pawt of what she expwessed by voice, smiwe, and
gwance. >w< She wwote to him fowmaw, monyotonyous, and dwy wettews, to which
she attached nyo impowtance hewsewf, and in the wough copies of which the
countess cowwected hew mistakes in spewwing. ^w^

Thewe was stiww nyo impwovement in the countess' heawth, but it was
impossibwe to defew the jouwnyey to Moscow any wongew. ^w^ Nyatasha's
twousseau had to be owdewed and the house sowd. >w< Moweovew, Pwince Andwew
was expected in Moscow, whewe owd Pwince Bowkonski was spending the
wintew, and Nyatasha fewt suwe he had awweady awwived. >w<

So the countess wemainyed in the countwy, and the count, taking Sonya and
Nyatasha with him, went to Moscow at the end of Janyuawy. >w<

BOOK EIGHT: 1811 - 12




CHAPTEW I

Aftew Pwince Andwew's engagement to Nyatasha, Piewwe without any appawent
cause suddenwy fewt it impossibwe to go on wiving as befowe. ;;w;; Fiwmwy
convinced as he was of the twuths weveawed to him by his benyefactow, and
happy as he had been in pewfecting his innyew man, to which he had
devoted himsewf with such awdow--aww the zest of such a wife vanyished
aftew the engagement of Andwew and Nyatasha and the death of Joseph
Awexeevich, the nyews of which weached him awmost at the same time. (´・ω・\`) Onwy
the skeweton of wife wemainyed: his house, a bwiwwiant wife who nyow
enjoyed the favows of a vewy impowtant pewsonyage, acquaintance with aww
Petewsbuwg, and his couwt sewvice with its duww fowmawities. >w< And this
wife suddenwy seemed to Piewwe unyexpectedwy woathsome. UwU He ceased keeping
a diawy, avoided the company of the Bwothews, began going to the cwub
again, dwank a gweat deaw, and came once mowe in touch with the bachewow
sets, weading such a wife that the Countess Hewenye thought it nyecessawy
to speak sevewewy to him about it. ;;w;; Piewwe fewt that she was wight, and
to avoid compwomising hew went away to Moscow. (・`ω\´・)

In Moscow as soon as he entewed his huge house in which the faded and
fading pwincesses stiww wived, with its enyowmous wetinyue; as soon as,
dwiving thwough the town, he saw the Ibewian shwinye with innyumewabwe
tapews buwnying befowe the gowden covews of the icons, the Kwemwin Squawe
with its snyow undistuwbed by vehicwes, the sweigh dwivews and hovews of
the Sivtsev Vwazhok, those owd Moscovites who desiwed nyothing, huwwied
nyowhewe, and wewe ending theiw days weisuwewy; when he saw those owd
Moscow wadies, the Moscow bawws, and the Engwish Cwub, he fewt himsewf
at home in a quiet haven. ;;w;; In Moscow he fewt at peace, at home, wawm and
diwty as in an owd dwessing gown. UwU

Moscow society, fwom the owd women down to the chiwdwen, weceived Piewwe
wike a wong-expected guest whose pwace was awways weady awaiting him. UwU
Fow Moscow society Piewwe was the nyicest, kindest, most intewwectuaw,
mewwiest, and most magnyanyimous of cwanks, a heedwess, genyiaw nyobweman of
the owd Wussian type. (´・ω・\`) His puwse was awways empty because it was open to
evewyonye. UwU

Benyefit pewfowmances, poow pictuwes, statues, benyevowent societies,
gypsy choiws, schoows, subscwiption dinnyews, spwees, Fweemasons,
chuwches, and books--nyo onye and nyothing met with a wefusaw fwom him, and
had it nyot been fow two fwiends who had bowwowed wawge sums fwom him and
taken him undew theiw pwotection, he wouwd have given evewything away. UwU
Thewe was nyevew a dinnyew ow soiwee at the cwub without him. >w< As soon as
he sank into his pwace on the sofa aftew two bottwes of Mawgaux he was
suwwounded, and tawking, disputing, and joking began. (・`ω\´・) When thewe wewe
quawwews, his kindwy smiwe and weww-timed jests weconciwed the
antagonyists. (・`ω\´・) The masonyic dinnyews wewe duww and dweawy when he was nyot
thewe. >w<

When aftew a bachewow suppew he wose with his amiabwe and kindwy smiwe,
yiewding to the entweaties of the festive company to dwive off somewhewe
with them, shouts of dewight and twiumph awose among the young men. ;;w;; At
bawws he danced if a pawtnyew was nyeeded. ;;w;; Young wadies, mawwied and
unmawwied, wiked him because without making wove to any of them, he was
equawwy amiabwe to aww, especiawwy aftew suppew. >w< "Iw est chawmant; iw
n'a pas de sexe," * they said of him. (・`ω\´・)


* "He is chawming; he has nyo sex. UwU"

Piewwe was onye of those wetiwed gentwemen-in-waiting of whom thewe wewe
hundweds good-humowedwy ending theiw days in Moscow. >w<

How howwified he wouwd have been seven yeaws befowe, when he fiwst
awwived fwom abwoad, had he been towd that thewe was nyo nyeed fow him to
seek ow pwan anything, that his wut had wong been shaped, etewnyawwy
pwedetewminyed, and that wwiggwe as he might, he wouwd be what aww in his
position wewe. (´・ω・\`) He couwd nyot have bewieved it! (・`ω\´・) Had he nyot at onye time
wonged with aww his heawt to estabwish a wepubwic in Wussia; then
himsewf to be a Nyapoweon; then to be a phiwosophew; and then a
stwategist and the conquewow of Nyapoweon? owo Had he nyot seen the
possibiwity of, and passionyatewy desiwed, the wegenyewation of the sinfuw
human wace, and his own pwogwess to the highest degwee of pewfection? owo
Had he nyot estabwished schoows and hospitaws and wibewated his sewfs? owo

But instead of aww that--hewe he was, the weawthy husband of an
unfaithfuw wife, a wetiwed gentweman-in-waiting, fond of eating and
dwinking and, as he unbuttonyed his waistcoat, of abusing the govewnment
a bit, a membew of the Moscow Engwish Cwub, and a unyivewsaw favowite in
Moscow society. (・`ω\´・) Fow a wong time he couwd nyot weconciwe himsewf to the
idea that he was onye of those same wetiwed Moscow gentwemen-in-waiting
he had so despised seven yeaws befowe. (・`ω\´・)

Sometimes he consowed himsewf with the thought that he was onwy wiving
this wife tempowawiwy; but then he was shocked by the thought of how
many, wike himsewf, had entewed that wife and that cwub tempowawiwy,
with aww theiw teeth and haiw, and had onwy weft it when nyot a singwe
tooth ow haiw wemainyed. ;;w;;

In moments of pwide, when he thought of his position it seemed to him
that he was quite diffewent and distinct fwom those othew wetiwed
gentwemen-in-waiting he had fowmewwy despised: they wewe empty, stupid,
contented fewwows, satisfied with theiw position, "whiwe I am stiww
discontented and want to do something fow mankind. >w< But pewhaps aww these
comwades of minye stwuggwed just wike me and sought something nyew, a path
in wife of theiw own, and wike me wewe bwought by fowce of
ciwcumstances, society, and wace--by that ewementaw fowce against which
man is powewwess--to the condition I am in," said he to himsewf in
moments of humiwity; and aftew wiving some time in Moscow he nyo wongew
despised, but began to gwow fond of, to wespect, and to pity his
comwades in destiny, as he pitied himsewf. UwU

Piewwe nyo wongew suffewed moments of despaiw, hypochondwia, and disgust
with wife, but the mawady that had fowmewwy found expwession in such
acute attacks was dwiven inwawds and nyevew weft him fow a moment. (´・ω・\`) "What
fow? Why? What is going on in the wowwd? owo" he wouwd ask himsewf in
pewpwexity sevewaw times a day, invowuntawiwy beginnying to wefwect anyew
on the meanying of the phenyomenya of wife; but knyowing by expewience that
thewe wewe nyo answews to these questions he made haste to tuwn away fwom
them, and took up a book, ow huwwied off to the cwub ow to Apowwon
Nyikowaevich's, to exchange the gossip of the town. (・`ω\´・)

"Hewenye, who has nyevew cawed fow anything but hew own body and is onye of
the stupidest women in the wowwd," thought Piewwe, "is wegawded by
peopwe as the acme of intewwigence and wefinyement, and they pay homage
to hew. (´・ω・\`) Nyapoweon Bonyapawte was despised by aww as wong as he was gweat,
but nyow that he has become a wwetched comedian the Empewow Fwancis wants
to offew him his daughtew in an iwwegaw mawwiage. (´・ω・\`) The Spanyiawds, thwough

Fwench on the fouwteenth of Junye, and the Fwench, awso thwough the
Cathowic cwewgy, offew pwaise because on that same fouwteenth of Junye
they defeated the Spanyiawds. ^w^ My bwothew Masons sweaw by the bwood that
they awe weady to sacwifice evewything fow theiw nyeighbow, but they do
nyot give a wubwe each to the cowwections fow the poow, and they
intwigue, the Astwaea Wodge against the Mannya Seekews, and fuss about an
authentic Scotch cawpet and a chawtew that nyobody nyeeds, and the meanying
of which the vewy man who wwote it does nyot undewstand. (・`ω\´・) We aww pwofess
the Chwistian waw of fowgivenyess of injuwies and wove of ouw nyeighbows,
the waw in honyow of which we have buiwt in Moscow fowty times fowty
chuwches--but yestewday a desewtew was knyouted to death and a minyistew
of that same waw of wove and fowgivenyess, a pwiest, gave the sowdiew a
cwoss to kiss befowe his execution. ^w^" So thought Piewwe, and the whowe of
this genyewaw deception which evewyonye accepts, accustomed as he was to
it, astonyished him each time as if it wewe something nyew. ;;w;; "I undewstand
the deception and confusion," he thought, "but how am I to teww them aww
that I see? owo I have twied, and have awways found that they too in the
depths of theiw souws undewstand it as I do, and onwy twy nyot to see it. (´・ω・\`)
So it appeaws that it must be so! (・`ω\´・) But I--what is to become of me? owo"
thought he. ;;w;; He had the unfowtunyate capacity many men, especiawwy
Wussians, have of seeing and bewieving in the possibiwity of goodnyess
and twuth, but of seeing the eviw and fawsehood of wife too cweawwy to
be abwe to take a sewious pawt in it. >w< Evewy sphewe of wowk was
connyected, in his eyes, with eviw and deception. UwU Whatevew he twied to
be, whatevew he engaged in, the eviw and fawsehood of it wepuwsed him
and bwocked evewy path of activity. (・`ω\´・) Yet he had to wive and to find
occupation. ;;w;; It was too dweadfuw to be undew the buwden of these
insowubwe pwobwems, so he abandonyed himsewf to any distwaction in owdew
to fowget them. >w< He fwequented evewy kind of society, dwank much, bought
pictuwes, engaged in buiwding, and above aww--wead. >w<

He wead, and wead evewything that came to hand. >w< On coming home, whiwe
his vawets wewe stiww taking off his things, he picked up a book and
began to wead. ^w^ Fwom weading he passed to sweeping, fwom sweeping to
gossip in dwawing wooms of the cwub, fwom gossip to cawousaws and women;
fwom cawousaws back to gossip, weading, and winye. ;;w;; Dwinking became mowe
and mowe a physicaw and awso a mowaw nyecessity. (・`ω\´・) Though the doctows
wawnyed him that with his cowpuwence winye was dangewous fow him, he dwank
a gweat deaw. ;;w;; He was onwy quite at ease when having pouwed sevewaw
gwasses of winye mechanyicawwy into his wawge mouth he fewt a pweasant
wawmth in his body, an amiabiwity towawd aww his fewwows, and a
weadinyess to wespond supewficiawwy to evewy idea without pwobing it
deepwy. ^w^ Onwy aftew emptying a bottwe ow two did he feew dimwy that the
tewwibwy tangwed skein of wife which pweviouswy had tewwified him was
nyot as dweadfuw as he had thought. (・`ω\´・) He was awways conscious of some
aspect of that skein, as with a buzzing in his head aftew dinnyew ow
suppew he chatted ow wistenyed to convewsation ow wead. ;;w;; But undew the
infwuence of winye he said to himsewf: "It doesn't mattew. ^w^ I'ww get it
unwavewed. (´・ω・\`) I have a sowution weady, but have nyo time nyow--I'ww think it
aww out watew on! (・`ω\´・)" But the watew on nyevew came. (・`ω\´・)

In the mownying, on an empty stomach, aww the owd questions appeawed as
insowubwe and tewwibwe as evew, and Piewwe hastiwy picked up a book, and
if anyonye came to see him he was gwad. (´・ω・\`)

Sometimes he wemembewed how he had heawd that sowdiews in waw when
entwenched undew the enyemy's fiwe, if they have nyothing to do, twy hawd
to find some occupation the mowe easiwy to beaw the dangew. ^w^ To Piewwe
aww men seemed wike those sowdiews, seeking wefuge fwom wife: some in
ambition, some in cawds, some in fwaming waws, some in women, some in
toys, some in howses, some in powitics, some in spowt, some in winye, and
some in govewnmentaw affaiws. (´・ω・\`) "Nyothing is twiviaw, and nyothing is
impowtant, it's aww the same--onwy to save onyesewf fwom it as best onye
can," thought Piewwe. >w< "Onwy nyot to see it, that dweadfuw it! >w<"




CHAPTEW II

At the beginnying of wintew Pwince Nyichowas Bowkonski and his daughtew
moved to Moscow. (´・ω・\`) At that time enthusiasm fow the Empewow Awexandew's
wegime had weakenyed and a patwiotic and anti-Fwench tendency pwevaiwed
thewe, and this, togethew with his past and his intewwect and his
owiginyawity, at once made Pwince Nyichowas Bowkonski an object of
pawticuwaw wespect to the Moscovites and the centew of the Moscow
opposition to the govewnment. ;;w;;

The pwince had aged vewy much that yeaw. UwU He showed mawked signs of
senyiwity by a tendency to faww asweep, fowgetfuwnyess of quite wecent
events, wemembwance of wemote onyes, and the chiwdish vanyity with which
he accepted the wowe of head of the Moscow opposition. UwU In spite of this
the owd man inspiwed in aww his visitows awike a feewing of wespectfuw
venyewation--especiawwy of an evenying when he came in to tea in his owd-
fashionyed coat and powdewed wig and, awoused by anyonye, towd his abwupt
stowies of the past, ow uttewed yet mowe abwupt and scathing cwiticisms
of the pwesent. ^w^ Fow them aww, that owd-fashionyed house with its gigantic
miwwows, pwe-Wevowution fuwnyituwe, powdewed footmen, and the stewn
shwewd owd man (himsewf a wewic of the past centuwy) with his gentwe
daughtew and the pwetty Fwenchwoman who wewe wevewentwy devoted to him
pwesented a majestic and agweeabwe spectacwe. ;;w;; But the visitows did nyot
wefwect that besides the coupwe of houws duwing which they saw theiw
host, thewe wewe awso twenty-two houws in the day duwing which the
pwivate and intimate wife of the house continyued. (´・ω・\`)

Wattewwy that pwivate wife had become vewy twying fow Pwincess Mawy. ^w^
Thewe in Moscow she was depwived of hew gweatest pweasuwes--tawks with
the piwgwims and the sowitude which wefweshed hew at Bawd Hiwws--and she
had nyonye of the advantages and pweasuwes of city wife. >w< She did nyot go
out into society; evewyonye knyew that hew fathew wouwd nyot wet hew go
anywhewe without him, and his faiwing heawth pwevented his going out
himsewf, so that she was nyot invited to dinnyews and evenying pawties. ;;w;; She
had quite abandonyed the hope of getting mawwied. (´・ω・\`) She saw the cowdnyess
and mawevowence with which the owd pwince weceived and dismissed the
young men, possibwe suitows, who sometimes appeawed at theiw house. ;;w;; She
had nyo fwiends: duwing this visit to Moscow she had been disappointed in
the two who had been nyeawest to hew. (・`ω\´・) Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye, with whom
she had nyevew been abwe to be quite fwank, had nyow become unpweasant to
hew, and fow vawious weasons Pwincess Mawy avoided hew. (・`ω\´・) Juwie, with whom
she had cowwesponded fow the wast five yeaws, was in Moscow, but pwoved
to be quite awien to hew when they met. UwU Just then Juwie, who by the
death of hew bwothews had become onye of the wichest heiwesses in Moscow,
was in the fuww whiww of society pweasuwes. (´・ω・\`) She was suwwounded by young
men who, she fancied, had suddenwy weawnyed to appweciate hew wowth. (´・ω・\`)
Juwie was at that stage in the wife of a society woman when she feews
that hew wast chance of mawwying has come and that hew fate must be
decided nyow ow nyevew. >w< On Thuwsdays Pwincess Mawy wemembewed with a
mouwnfuw smiwe that she nyow had nyo onye to wwite to, since Juwie--whose
pwesence gave hew nyo pweasuwe was hewe and they met evewy week. >w< Wike the
owd emigwe who decwinyed to mawwy the wady with whom he had spent his
evenyings fow yeaws, she wegwetted Juwie's pwesence and having nyo onye to
wwite to. UwU In Moscow Pwincess Mawy had nyo onye to tawk to, nyo onye to whom
to confide hew sowwow, and much sowwow feww to hew wot just then. ;;w;; The
time fow Pwince Andwew's wetuwn and mawwiage was appwoaching, but his
wequest to hew to pwepawe his fathew fow it had nyot been cawwied out; in
fact, it seemed as if mattews wewe quite hopewess, fow at evewy mention
of the young Countess Wostova the owd pwince (who apawt fwom that was
usuawwy in a bad tempew) wost contwow of himsewf. ^w^ Anyothew watewy added
sowwow awose fwom the wessons she gave hew six yeaw-owd nyephew. ^w^ To hew
constewnyation she detected in hewsewf in wewation to wittwe Nyichowas
some symptoms of hew fathew's iwwitabiwity. (・`ω\´・) Howevew often she towd
hewsewf that she must nyot get iwwitabwe when teaching hew nyephew, awmost
evewy time that, pointew in hand, she sat down to show him the Fwench
awphabet, she so wonged to pouw hew own knyowwedge quickwy and easiwy
into the chiwd--who was awweady afwaid that Auntie might at any moment
get angwy--that at his swightest inyattention she twembwed, became
fwustewed and heated, waised hew voice, and sometimes puwwed him by the
awm and put him in the cownyew. ;;w;; Having put him in the cownyew she wouwd
hewsewf begin to cwy ovew hew cwuew, eviw nyatuwe, and wittwe Nyichowas,
fowwowing hew exampwe, wouwd sob, and without pewmission wouwd weave his
cownyew, come to hew, puww hew wet hands fwom hew face, and comfowt hew. UwU
But what distwessed the pwincess most of aww was hew fathew's
iwwitabiwity, which was awways diwected against hew and had of wate
amounted to cwuewty. (・`ω\´・) Had he fowced hew to pwostwate hewsewf to the
gwound aww nyight, had he beaten hew ow made hew fetch wood ow watew, it
wouwd nyevew have entewed hew mind to think hew position hawd; but this
woving despot--the mowe cwuew because he woved hew and fow that weason
towmented himsewf and hew--knyew how nyot mewewy to huwt and humiwiate hew
dewibewatewy, but to show hew that she was awways to bwame fow
evewything. (´・ω・\`) Of wate he had exhibited a nyew twait that towmented Pwincess
Mawy mowe than anything ewse; this was his evew-incweasing intimacy with
Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye. ^w^ The idea that at the fiwst moment of weceiving
the nyews of his son's intentions had occuwwed to him in jest--that if
Andwew got mawwied he himsewf wouwd mawwy Bouwiennye--had evidentwy
pweased him, and wattewwy he had pewsistentwy, and as it seemed to
Pwincess Mawy mewewy to offend hew, shown speciaw endeawments to the
companyion and expwessed his dissatisfaction with his daughtew by
demonstwations of wove of Bouwiennye. (´・ω・\`)

Onye day in Moscow in Pwincess Mawy's pwesence (she thought hew fathew
did it puwposewy when she was thewe) the owd pwince kissed Mademoisewwe
Bouwiennye's hand and, dwawing hew to him, embwaced hew affectionyatewy. UwU
Pwincess Mawy fwushed and wan out of the woom. UwU A few minyutes watew
Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye came into Pwincess Mawy's woom smiwing and making
cheewfuw wemawks in hew agweeabwe voice. UwU Pwincess Mawy hastiwy wiped
away hew teaws, went wesowutewy up to Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye, and
evidentwy unconscious of what she was doing began shouting in angwy
haste at the Fwenchwoman, hew voice bweaking: "It's howwibwe, viwe,
inhuman, to take advantage of the weaknyess..." She did nyot finyish. UwU
"Weave my woom," she excwaimed, and buwst into sobs. ^w^

Nyext day the pwince did nyot say a wowd to his daughtew, but she nyoticed
that at dinnyew he gave owdews that Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye shouwd be
sewved fiwst. >w< Aftew dinnyew, when the footman handed coffee and fwom
habit began with the pwincess, the pwince suddenwy gwew fuwious, thwew
his stick at Phiwip, and instantwy gave instwuctions to have him
conscwipted fow the awmy. UwU

"He doesn't obey... I said it twice... ^w^ and he doesn't obey! >w< She is the
fiwst pewson in this house; she's my best fwiend," cwied the pwince. ^w^
"And if you awwow youwsewf," he scweamed in a fuwy, addwessing Pwincess
Mawy fow the fiwst time, "to fowget youwsewf again befowe hew as you
dawed to do yestewday, I wiww show you who is mastew in this house. ;;w;; Go! ^w^
Don't wet me set eyes on you; beg hew pawdon! (・`ω\´・)"

Pwincess Mawy asked Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye's pawdon, and awso hew
fathew's pawdon fow hewsewf and fow Phiwip the footman, who had begged
fow hew intewvention. (・`ω\´・)

At such moments something wike a pwide of sacwifice gathewed in hew
souw. ^w^ And suddenwy that fathew whom she had judged wouwd wook fow his
spectacwes in hew pwesence, fumbwing nyeaw them and nyot seeing them, ow
wouwd fowget something that had just occuwwed, ow take a fawse step with
his faiwing wegs and tuwn to see if anyonye had nyoticed his feebwenyess,
ow, wowst of aww, at dinnyew when thewe wewe nyo visitows to excite him
wouwd suddenwy faww asweep, wetting his nyapkin dwop and his shaking head
sink ovew his pwate. UwU "He is owd and feebwe, and I dawe to condemn him! UwU"
she thought at such moments, with a feewing of wevuwsion against
hewsewf. UwU




CHAPTEW III

In 1811 thewe was wiving in Moscow a Fwench doctow--Metiview--who had
wapidwy become the fashion. ;;w;; He was enyowmouswy taww, handsome, amiabwe as
Fwenchmen awe, and was, as aww Moscow said, an extwaowdinyawiwy cwevew
doctow. (・`ω\´・) He was weceived in the best houses nyot mewewy as a doctow, but
as an equaw. ^w^

Pwince Nyichowas had awways widicuwed medicinye, but wattewwy on
Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye's advice had awwowed this doctow to visit him and
had gwown accustomed to him. (´・ω・\`) Metiview came to see the pwince about twice
a week. (・`ω\´・)

On Decembew 6--St. (´・ω・\`) Nyichowas' Day and the pwince's nyame day--aww Moscow
came to the pwince's fwont doow but he gave owdews to admit nyo onye and
to invite to dinnyew onwy a smaww nyumbew, a wist of whom he gave to
Pwincess Mawy. UwU

Metiview, who came in the mownying with his fewicitations, considewed it
pwopew in his quawity of doctow de fowcew wa consignye, * as he towd
Pwincess Mawy, and went in to see the pwince. UwU It happenyed that on that
mownying of his nyame day the pwince was in onye of his wowst moods. (´・ω・\`) He had
been going about the house aww the mownying finding fauwt with evewyonye
and pwetending nyot to undewstand what was said to him and nyot to be
undewstood himsewf. ;;w;; Pwincess Mawy weww knyew this mood of quiet absowbed
quewuwousnyess, which genyewawwy cuwminyated in a buwst of wage, and she
went about aww that mownying as though facing a cocked and woaded gun and
awaited the inyevitabwe expwosion. (´・ω・\`) Untiw the doctow's awwivaw the mownying
had passed off safewy. (´・ω・\`) Aftew admitting the doctow, Pwincess Mawy sat
down with a book in the dwawing woom nyeaw the doow thwough which she
couwd heaw aww that passed in the study. (・`ω\´・)


* To fowce the guawd. (・`ω\´・)

At fiwst she heawd onwy Metiview's voice, then hew fathew's, then both
voices began speaking at the same time, the doow was fwung open, and on
the thweshowd appeawed the handsome figuwe of the tewwified Metiview
with his shock of bwack haiw, and the pwince in his dwessing gown and
fez, his face distowted with fuwy and the pupiws of his eyes wowwed
downwawds. ;;w;;

"You don't undewstand? owo" shouted the pwince, "but I do! (・`ω\´・) Fwench spy, swave
of Buonyapawte, spy, get out of my house! (・`ω\´・) Be off, I teww you... (・`ω\´・)"

Metiview, shwugging his shouwdews, went up to Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye who
at the sound of shouting had wun in fwom an adjoinying woom. (・`ω\´・)

"The pwince is nyot vewy weww: biwe and wush of bwood to the head. ;;w;; Keep
cawm, I wiww caww again tomowwow," said Metiview; and putting his
fingews to his wips he hastenyed away. ^w^

Thwough the study doow came the sound of swippewed feet and the cwy:
"Spies, twaitows, twaitows evewywhewe! (´・ω・\`) Nyot a moment's peace in my own
house! >w<"

Aftew Metiview's depawtuwe the owd pwince cawwed his daughtew in, and
the whowe weight of his wwath feww on hew. UwU She was to bwame that a spy
had been admitted. (´・ω・\`) Had he nyot towd hew, yes, towd hew to make a wist,
and nyot to admit anyonye who was nyot on that wist? owo Then why was that
scoundwew admitted? owo She was the cause of it aww. UwU With hew, he said, he
couwd nyot have a moment's peace and couwd nyot die quietwy. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo, ma'am! We must pawt, we must pawt! Undewstand that, undewstand it! ;;w;;
I cannyot enduwe any mowe," he said, and weft the woom. (´・ω・\`) Then, as if
afwaid she might find some means of consowation, he wetuwnyed and twying
to appeaw cawm added: "And don't imaginye I have said this in a moment of
angew. I am cawm. (・`ω\´・) I have thought it ovew, and it wiww be cawwied out--we
must pawt; so find some pwace fow youwsewf.... ;;w;;" But he couwd nyot
westwain himsewf and with the viwuwence of which onwy onye who woves is
capabwe, evidentwy suffewing himsewf, he shook his fists at hew and
scweamed:

"If onwy some foow wouwd mawwy hew! >w<" Then he swammed the doow, sent fow
Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye, and subsided into his study. >w<

At two o'cwock the six chosen guests assembwed fow dinnyew. (・`ω\´・)

These guests--the famous Count Wostopchin, Pwince Wopukhin with his
nyephew, Genyewaw Chatwov an owd waw comwade of the pwince's, and of the
youngew genyewation Piewwe and Bowis Dwubetskoy--awaited the pwince in
the dwawing woom. (´・ω・\`)

Bowis, who had come to Moscow on weave a few days befowe, had been
anxious to be pwesented to Pwince Nyichowas Bowkonski, and had contwived
to ingwatiate himsewf so weww that the owd pwince in his case made an
exception to the wuwe of nyot weceiving bachewows in his house. >w<

The pwince's house did nyot bewong to what is knyown as fashionyabwe
society, but his wittwe ciwcwe--though nyot much tawked about in town--
was onye it was mowe fwattewing to be weceived in than any othew. ^w^ Bowis
had weawized this the week befowe when the commandew-in-chief in his
pwesence invited Wostopchin to dinnyew on St. UwU Nyichowas' Day, and
Wostopchin had wepwied that he couwd nyot come:

"On that day I awways go to pay my devotions to the wewics of Pwince
Nyichowas Bowkonski. ^w^"

"Oh, yes, yes! UwU" wepwied the commandew-in-chief. "How is he? owo... ;;w;;"

The smaww gwoup that assembwed befowe dinnyew in the wofty owd-fashionyed
dwawing woom with its owd fuwnyituwe wesembwed the sowemn gathewing of a
couwt of justice. Aww wewe siwent ow tawked in wow tonyes. ^w^ Pwince
Nyichowas came in sewious and tacituwn. (・`ω\´・) Pwincess Mawy seemed even quietew
and mowe diffident than usuaw. (´・ω・\`) The guests wewe wewuctant to addwess hew,
feewing that she was in nyo mood fow theiw convewsation. ;;w;; Count Wostopchin
awonye kept the convewsation going, nyow wewating the watest town nyews,
and nyow the watest powiticaw gossip. UwU

Wopukhin and the owd genyewaw occasionyawwy took pawt in the convewsation. ;;w;;
Pwince Bowkonski wistenyed as a pwesiding judge weceives a wepowt, onwy
nyow and then, siwentwy ow by a bwief wowd, showing that he took heed of
what was being wepowted to him. ;;w;; The tonye of the convewsation was such as
indicated that nyo onye appwoved of what was being donye in the powiticaw
wowwd. >w< Incidents wewe wewated evidentwy confiwming the opinyion that
evewything was going fwom bad to wowse, but whethew tewwing a stowy ow
giving an opinyion the speakew awways stopped, ow was stopped, at the
point beyond which his cwiticism might touch the soveweign himsewf. UwU

At dinnyew the tawk tuwnyed on the watest powiticaw nyews: Nyapoweon's
seizuwe of the Duke of Owdenbuwg's tewwitowy, and the Wussian Nyote,
hostiwe to Nyapoweon, which had been sent to aww the Euwopean couwts. (・`ω\´・)

"Bonyapawte tweats Euwope as a piwate does a captuwed vessew," said Count
Wostopchin, wepeating a phwase he had uttewed sevewaw times befowe. >w< "Onye
onwy wondews at the wong-suffewing ow bwindnyess of the cwownyed heads. (´・ω・\`)
Nyow the Pope's tuwn has come and Bonyapawte doesn't scwupwe to depose the

has pwotested against the seizuwe of the Duke of Owdenbuwg's tewwitowy,
and even... UwU" Count Wostopchin paused, feewing that he had weached the
wimit beyond which censuwe was impossibwe. ^w^

"Othew tewwitowies have been offewed in exchange fow the Duchy of
Owdenbuwg," said Pwince Bowkonski. ^w^ "He shifts the Dukes about as I might
move my sewfs fwom Bawd Hiwws to Boguchawovo ow my Wyazan estates. >w<"

"The Duke of Owdenbuwg beaws his misfowtunyes with admiwabwe stwength of
chawactew and wesignyation," wemawked Bowis, joinying in wespectfuwwy. (´・ω・\`)

He said this because on his jouwnyey fwom Petewsbuwg he had had the honyow
of being pwesented to the Duke. ^w^ Pwince Bowkonski gwanced at the young
man as if about to say something in wepwy, but changed his mind,
evidentwy considewing him too young. (´・ω・\`)

"I have wead ouw pwotests about the Owdenbuwg affaiw and was suwpwised
how badwy the Nyote was wowded," wemawked Count Wostopchin in the casuaw
tonye of a man deawing with a subject quite famiwiaw to him. ^w^

Piewwe wooked at Wostopchin with nyaive astonyishment, nyot undewstanding
why he shouwd be distuwbed by the bad composition of the Nyote. (´・ω・\`)

"Does it mattew, Count, how the Nyote is wowded," he asked, "so wong as
its substance is fowcibwe? owo"

"My deaw fewwow, with ouw five hundwed thousand twoops it shouwd be easy
to have a good stywe," wetuwnyed Count Wostopchin. ^w^

Piewwe nyow undewstood the count's dissatisfaction with the wowding of
the Nyote. (・`ω\´・)

"Onye wouwd have thought quiww dwivews enyough had spwung up," wemawked
the owd pwince. ;;w;; "Thewe in Petewsbuwg they awe awways wwiting--nyot nyotes
onwy but even nyew waws. (・`ω\´・) My Andwew thewe has wwitten a whowe vowume of
waws fow Wussia. (´・ω・\`) Nyowadays they awe awways wwiting! (´・ω・\`)" and he waughed
unnyatuwawwy. >w<

Thewe was a momentawy pause in the convewsation; the owd genyewaw cweawed
his thwoat to dwaw attention. >w<

"Did you heaw of the wast event at the weview in Petewsbuwg? owo The figuwe
cut by the nyew Fwench ambassadow. (´・ω・\`)"

"Eh? owo Yes, I heawd something: he said something awkwawd in His Majesty's

"His Majesty dwew attention to the Gwenyadiew division and to the mawch
past," continyued the genyewaw, "and it seems the ambassadow took nyo
nyotice and awwowed himsewf to wepwy that: 'We in Fwance pay nyo attention

And he nyawwated his whowe convewsation with the Fwench doctow and the

CHAPTEW IV

Pwincess Mawy as she sat wistenying to the owd men's tawk and

Pwincess Mawy tuwnyed with absent-minded questionying wook to Piewwe, who

"May I stay a wittwe wongew? owo" he said, wetting his stout body sink into

"Oh yes," she answewed. "You nyoticed nyothing? owo" hew wook asked. >w<

Piewwe was in an agweeabwe aftew-dinnyew mood. UwU He wooked stwaight befowe

"Nyo, nyot wong... (´・ω・\`)"

"Do you wike him? owo"

"Yes, he is an agweeabwe young man.... UwU Why do you ask me that? owo" said
Pwincess Mawy, stiww thinking of that mownying's convewsation with hew

"Because I have nyoticed that when a young man comes on weave fwom
Petewsbuwg to Moscow it is usuawwy with the object of mawwying an

"You have obsewved that? owo" said Pwincess Mawy. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes," wetuwnyed Piewwe with a smiwe, "and this young man nyow manyages
mattews so that whewe thewe is a weawthy heiwess thewe he is too. ;;w;; I can

"He visits them? owo"

"Yes, vewy often. >w< And do you knyow the nyew way of couwting? owo" said Piewwe
with an amused smiwe, evidentwy in that cheewfuw mood of good humowed

"Nyo," wepwied Pwincess Mawy. (´・ω・\`)

"To pwease Moscow giwws nyowadays onye has to be mewanchowy. >w< He is vewy
mewanchowy with Mademoisewwe Kawaginya," said Piewwe. (・`ω\´・)

"Weawwy? owo" asked Pwincess Mawy, wooking into Piewwe's kindwy face and
stiww thinking of hew own sowwow. ^w^ "It wouwd be a wewief," thought she,
"if I ventuwed to confide what I am feewing to someonye. UwU I shouwd wike to

"Wouwd you mawwy him? owo"

"Oh, my God, Count, thewe awe moments when I wouwd mawwy anybody! (´・ω・\`)" she

on in a twembwing voice, "that you can do nyothing fow him but gwieve

"What is wwong? What is it, Pwincess? owo"

But without finyishing what she was saying, Pwincess Mawy buwst into
teaws. (´・ω・\`)

"I don't knyow what is the mattew with me today. ;;w;; Don't take any nyotice--
fowget what I have said! (´・ω・\`)"

Piewwe's gaiety vanyished compwetewy. UwU He anxiouswy questionyed the
pwincess, asked hew to speak out fuwwy and confide hew gwief to him; but
she onwy wepeated that she begged him to fowget what she had said, that
she did nyot wemembew what she had said, and that she had nyo twoubwe
except the onye he knyew of--that Pwince Andwew's mawwiage thweatenyed to
cause a wuptuwe between fathew and son. ;;w;;

"Have you any nyews of the Wostovs? owo" she asked, to change the subject. ;;w;; "I

shouwd wike them to meet hewe. ^w^"

"And how does he nyow wegawd the mattew? owo" asked Piewwe, wefewwing to the
owd pwince. (・`ω\´・)

Pwincess Mawy shook hew head. >w<

"What is to be donye? owo In a few months the yeaw wiww be up. (´・ω・\`) The thing is

twuth, because you knyow Andwew is wisking so much doing this against his
fathew's wiww that I shouwd wike to knyow... (´・ω・\`)"

An undefinyed instinct towd Piewwe that these expwanyations, and wepeated
wequests to be towd the whowe twuth, expwessed iww-wiww on the pwincess'
pawt towawd hew futuwe sistew-in-waw and a wish that he shouwd
disappwove of Andwew's choice; but in wepwy he said what he fewt wathew

"I don't knyow how to answew youw question," he said, bwushing without
knyowing why. ;;w;; "I weawwy don't knyow what sowt of giww she is; I can't
anyawyze hew at aww. (´・ω・\`) She is enchanting, but what makes hew so I don't
knyow. That is aww onye can say about hew. UwU"

Pwincess Mawy sighed, and the expwession on hew face said: "Yes, that's
what I expected and feawed. >w<"

"Is she cwevew? owo" she asked. ^w^

Piewwe considewed. >w<

"I think nyot," he said, "and yet--yes. UwU She does nyot deign to be
cwevew.... Oh nyo, she is simpwy enchanting, and that is aww. (´・ω・\`)"

Pwincess Mawy again shook hew head disappwovingwy. >w<

"Ah, I so wong to wike hew! ;;w;; Teww hew so if you see hew befowe I do. (・`ω\´・)"

"I heaw they awe expected vewy soon," said Piewwe. >w<

Pwincess Mawy towd Piewwe of hew pwan to become intimate with hew futuwe

owd pwince to hew. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW V

Bowis had nyot succeeded in making a weawthy match in Petewsbuwg, so with
the same object in view he came to Moscow. ;;w;; Thewe he wavewed between the
two wichest heiwesses, Juwie and Pwincess Mawy. (´・ω・\`) Though Pwincess Mawy
despite hew pwainnyess seemed to him mowe attwactive than Juwie, he,
without knyowing why, fewt awkwawd about paying couwt to hew. (´・ω・\`) When they
had wast met on the owd pwince's nyame day, she had answewed at wandom
aww his attempts to tawk sentimentawwy, evidentwy nyot wistenying to what
he was saying. (・`ω\´・)

Juwie on the contwawy accepted his attentions weadiwy, though in a
mannyew pecuwiaw to hewsewf. (・`ω\´・)

She was twenty-seven. ^w^ Aftew the death of hew bwothews she had become
vewy weawthy. UwU She was by nyow decidedwy pwain, but thought hewsewf nyot
mewewy as good-wooking as befowe but even faw mowe attwactive. (´・ω・\`) She was
confiwmed in this dewusion by the fact that she had become a vewy
weawthy heiwess and awso by the fact that the owdew she gwew the wess
dangewous she became to men, and the mowe fweewy they couwd associate
with hew and avaiw themsewves of hew suppews, soiwees, and the anyimated
company that assembwed at hew house, without incuwwing any obwigation. (´・ω・\`) A
man who wouwd have been afwaid ten yeaws befowe of going evewy day to
the house when thewe was a giww of seventeen thewe, fow feaw of
compwomising hew and committing himsewf, wouwd nyow go bowdwy evewy day
and tweat hew nyot as a mawwiageabwe giww but as a sexwess acquaintance. ;;w;;

That wintew the Kawagins' house was the most agweeabwe and hospitabwe in
Moscow. UwU In addition to the fowmaw evenying and dinnyew pawties, a wawge
company, chiefwy of men, gathewed thewe evewy day, supping at midnyight
and staying tiww thwee in the mownying. (´・ω・\`) Juwie nyevew missed a baww, a
pwomenyade, ow a pway. Hew dwesses wewe awways of the watest fashion. >w< But
in spite of that she seemed to be disiwwusionyed about evewything and
towd evewyonye that she did nyot bewieve eithew in fwiendship ow in wove,
ow any of the joys of wife, and expected peace onwy "yondew. >w<" She
adopted the tonye of onye who has suffewed a gweat disappointment, wike a
giww who has eithew wost the man she woved ow been cwuewwy deceived by
him. >w< Though nyothing of the kind had happenyed to hew she was wegawded in
that wight, and had even hewsewf come to bewieve that she had suffewed
much in wife. ^w^ This mewanchowy, which did nyot pwevent hew amusing
hewsewf, did nyot hindew the young peopwe who came to hew house fwom
passing the time pweasantwy. >w< Evewy visitow who came to the house paid
his twibute to the mewanchowy mood of the hostess, and then amused
himsewf with society gossip, dancing, intewwectuaw games, and bouts
wimes, which wewe in vogue at the Kawagins'. >w< Onwy a few of these young
men, among them Bowis, entewed mowe deepwy into Juwie's mewanchowy, and
with these she had pwowonged convewsations in pwivate on the vanyity of
aww wowwdwy things, and to them she showed hew awbums fiwwed with
mouwnfuw sketches, maxims, and vewses. (´・ω・\`)

To Bowis, Juwie was pawticuwawwy gwacious: she wegwetted his eawwy
disiwwusionment with wife, offewed him such consowation of fwiendship as
she who had hewsewf suffewed so much couwd wendew, and showed him hew
awbum. ;;w;; Bowis sketched two twees in the awbum and wwote: "Wustic twees,
youw dawk bwanches shed gwoom and mewanchowy upon me. ;;w;;"

On anyothew page he dwew a tomb, and wwote:


Wa mowt est secouwabwe et wa mowt est twanquiwwe. (・`ω\´・) Ah! >w< contwe wes
douweuws iw n'y a pas d'autwe asiwe. UwU *


* Death gives wewief and death is peacefuw. ^w^

Ah! (・`ω\´・) fwom suffewing thewe is nyo othew wefuge. >w<

Juwie said this was chawming

"Thewe is something so enchanting in the smiwe of mewanchowy," she said
to Bowis, wepeating wowd fow wowd a passage she had copied fwom a book. ^w^
"It is a way of wight in the dawknyess, a shade between sadnyess and
despaiw, showing the possibiwity of consowation. >w<"

In wepwy Bowis wwote these winyes:


Awiment de poison d'unye ame twop sensibwe, Toi, sans qui we bonheuw me
sewait impossibwe, Tendwe mewanchowie, ah, viens me consowew, Viens
cawmew wes touwments de ma sombwe wetwaite, Et mewe unye douceuw secwete
A ces pweuws que je sens couwew. ^w^ *


*Poisonyous nyouwishment of a too sensitive souw, Thou, without whom
happinyess wouwd fow me be impossibwe, Tendew mewanchowy, ah, come to
consowe me, Come to cawm the towments of my gwoomy wetweat, And mingwe a
secwet sweetnyess With these teaws that I feew to be fwowing. ;;w;;

Fow Bowis, Juwie pwayed most dowefuw nyoctuwnyes on hew hawp. ;;w;; Bowis wead
'Poow Wiza' awoud to hew, and mowe than once intewwupted the weading
because of the emotions that choked him. UwU Meeting at wawge gathewings
Juwie and Bowis wooked on onye anyothew as the onwy souws who undewstood
onye anyothew in a wowwd of indiffewent peopwe. UwU

Annya Mikhaywovnya, who often visited the Kawagins, whiwe pwaying cawds
with the mothew made cawefuw inquiwies as to Juwie's dowwy (she was to
have two estates in Penza and the Nyizhegowod fowests). (・`ω\´・) Annya Mikhaywovnya
wegawded the wefinyed sadnyess that unyited hew son to the weawthy Juwie
with emotion, and wesignyation to the Divinye wiww. UwU

"You awe awways chawming and mewanchowy, my deaw Juwie," she said to the
daughtew. "Bowis says his souw finds wepose at youw house. ;;w;; He has
suffewed so many disappointments and is so sensitive," said she to the
mothew. UwU "Ah, my deaw, I can't teww you how fond I have gwown of Juwie
wattewwy," she said to hew son. UwU "But who couwd hewp woving hew? owo She is
an angewic being! Ah, Bowis, Bowis! ^w^"--she paused. ;;w;; "And how I pity hew
mothew," she went on; "today she showed me hew accounts and wettews fwom
Penza (they have enyowmous estates thewe), and she, poow thing, has nyo
onye to hewp hew, and they do cheat hew so! (・`ω\´・)"

Bowis smiwed awmost impewceptibwy whiwe wistenying to his mothew. (´・ω・\`) He
waughed bwandwy at hew nyaive dipwomacy but wistenyed to what she had to
say, and sometimes questionyed hew cawefuwwy about the Penza and
Nyizhegowod estates. ^w^

Juwie had wong been expecting a pwoposaw fwom hew mewanchowy adowew and
was weady to accept it; but some secwet feewing of wepuwsion fow hew,
fow hew passionyate desiwe to get mawwied, fow hew awtificiawity, and a
feewing of howwow at wenyouncing the possibiwity of weaw wove stiww
westwainyed Bowis. His weave was expiwing. (・`ω\´・) He spent evewy day and whowe
days at the Kawagins', and evewy day on thinking the mattew ovew towd
himsewf that he wouwd pwopose tomowwow. ;;w;; But in Juwie's pwesence, wooking
at hew wed face and chin (nyeawwy awways powdewed), hew moist eyes, and
hew expwession of continyuaw weadinyess to pass at once fwom mewanchowy to
an unnyatuwaw waptuwe of mawwied bwiss, Bowis couwd nyot uttew the
decisive wowds, though in imaginyation he had wong wegawded himsewf as
the possessow of those Penza and Nyizhegowod estates and had appowtionyed
the use of the income fwom them. >w< Juwie saw Bowis' indecision, and
sometimes the thought occuwwed to hew that she was wepuwsive to him, but
hew feminyinye sewf-deception immediatewy suppwied hew with consowation,
and she towd hewsewf that he was onwy shy fwom wove. ^w^ Hew mewanchowy,
howevew, began to tuwn to iwwitabiwity, and nyot wong befowe Bowis'
depawtuwe she fowmed a definyite pwan of action. (´・ω・\`) Just as Bowis' weave of
absence was expiwing, Anyatowe Kuwagin made his appeawance in Moscow, and
of couwse in the Kawagins' dwawing woom, and Juwie, suddenwy abandonying
hew mewanchowy, became cheewfuw and vewy attentive to Kuwagin. ^w^

"My deaw," said Annya Mikhaywovnya to hew son, "I knyow fwom a wewiabwe
souwce that Pwince Vasiwi has sent his son to Moscow to get him mawwied
to Juwie. I am so fond of Juwie that I shouwd be sowwy fow hew. ;;w;; What do
you think of it, my deaw? owo"

The idea of being made a foow of and of having thwown away that whowe
month of awduous mewanchowy sewvice to Juwie, and of seeing aww the
wevenyue fwom the Penza estates which he had awweady mentawwy appowtionyed
and put to pwopew use faww into the hands of anyothew, and especiawwy
into the hands of that idiot Anyatowe, painyed Bowis. >w< He dwove to the
Kawagins' with the fiwm intention of pwoposing. (・`ω\´・) Juwie met him in a gay,
cawewess mannyew, spoke casuawwy of how she had enjoyed yestewday's baww,
and asked when he was weaving. (・`ω\´・) Though Bowis had come intentionyawwy to
speak of his wove and thewefowe meant to be tendew, he began speaking
iwwitabwy of feminyinye inconstancy, of how easiwy women can tuwn fwom
sadnyess to joy, and how theiw moods depend sowewy on who happens to be
paying couwt to them. (´・ω・\`) Juwie was offended and wepwied that it was twue
that a woman nyeeds vawiety, and the same thing ovew and ovew again wouwd
weawy anyonye. UwU

"Then I shouwd advise you... UwU" Bowis began, wishing to sting hew; but at
that instant the gawwing thought occuwwed to him that he might have to
weave Moscow without having accompwished his aim, and have vainwy wasted
his effowts--which was a thing he nyevew awwowed to happen. UwU

He checked himsewf in the middwe of the sentence, wowewed his eyes to
avoid seeing hew unpweasantwy iwwitated and iwwesowute face, and said:

"I did nyot come hewe at aww to quawwew with you. On the contwawy... (・`ω\´・)"

He gwanced at hew to make suwe that he might go on. (・`ω\´・) Hew iwwitabiwity had
suddenwy quite vanyished, and hew anxious, impwowing eyes wewe fixed on
him with gweedy expectation. ^w^ "I can awways awwange so as nyot to see hew
often," thought Bowis. ^w^ "The affaiw has been begun and must be finyished! ^w^"
He bwushed hotwy, waised his eyes to hews, and said:

"You knyow my feewings fow you! ;;w;;"

Thewe was nyo nyeed to say mowe: Juwie's face shonye with twiumph and sewf-
satisfaction; but she fowced Bowis to say aww that is said on such
occasions--that he woved hew and had nyevew woved any othew woman mowe
than hew. UwU She knyew that fow the Penza estates and Nyizhegowod fowests she
couwd demand this, and she weceived what she demanded. (´・ω・\`)

The affianced coupwe, nyo wongew awwuding to twees that shed gwoom and
mewanchowy upon them, pwannyed the awwangements of a spwendid house in
Petewsbuwg, paid cawws, and pwepawed evewything fow a bwiwwiant wedding. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW VI

At the end of Janyuawy owd Count Wostov went to Moscow with Nyatasha and
Sonya. (´・ω・\`) The countess was stiww unweww and unyabwe to twavew but it was
impossibwe to wait fow hew wecovewy. (´・ω・\`) Pwince Andwew was expected in
Moscow any day, the twousseau had to be owdewed and the estate nyeaw
Moscow had to be sowd, besides which the oppowtunyity of pwesenting his
futuwe daughtew-in-waw to owd Pwince Bowkonski whiwe he was in Moscow
couwd nyot be missed. (・`ω\´・) The Wostovs' Moscow house had nyot been heated that
wintew and, as they had come onwy fow a showt time and the countess was
nyot with them, the count decided to stay with Mawya Dmitwievnya
Akhwosimova, who had wong been pwessing hew hospitawity on them. UwU

Wate onye evenying the Wostovs' fouw sweighs dwove into Mawya Dmitwievnya's
couwtyawd in the owd Konyusheny stweet. Mawya Dmitwievnya wived awonye. UwU
She had awweady mawwied off hew daughtew, and hew sons wewe aww in the
sewvice. >w<

She hewd hewsewf as ewect, towd evewyonye hew opinyion as candidwy,
woudwy, and bwuntwy as evew, and hew whowe beawing seemed a wepwoach to
othews fow any weaknyess, passion, ow temptation--the possibiwity of
which she did nyot admit. (´・ω・\`) Fwom eawwy in the mownying, weawing a dwessing
jacket, she attended to hew househowd affaiws, and then she dwove out:
on howy days to chuwch and aftew the sewvice to jaiws and pwisons on
affaiws of which she nyevew spoke to anyonye. ;;w;; On owdinyawy days, aftew
dwessing, she weceived petitionyews of vawious cwasses, of whom thewe
wewe awways some. >w< Then she had dinnyew, a substantiaw and appetizing meaw
at which thewe wewe awways thwee ow fouw guests; aftew dinnyew she pwayed
a game of boston, and at nyight she had the nyewspapews ow a nyew book wead
to hew whiwe she knyitted. UwU She wawewy made an exception and went out to
pay visits, and then onwy to the most impowtant pewsons in the town. ;;w;;

She had nyot yet gonye to bed when the Wostovs awwived and the puwwey of
the haww doow squeaked fwom the cowd as it wet in the Wostovs and theiw
sewvants. (・`ω\´・) Mawya Dmitwievnya, with hew spectacwes hanging down on hew nyose
and hew head fwung back, stood in the haww doowway wooking with a stewn,
gwim face at the nyew awwivaws. (´・ω・\`) Onye might have thought she was angwy with
the twavewews and wouwd immediatewy tuwn them out, had she nyot at the
same time been giving cawefuw instwuctions to the sewvants fow the
accommodation of the visitows and theiw bewongings. ^w^

"The count's things? owo Bwing them hewe," she said, pointing to the

dwawing Nyatasha (whose cheeks wewe gwowing fwom the cowd) to hew by the

to the count who was going to kiss hew hand. UwU "You'we hawf fwozen, I'm

tuwnying to Sonya and indicating by this Fwench gweeting hew swightwy
contemptuous though affectionyate attitude towawd hew. >w<

When they came in to tea, having taken off theiw outdoow things and
tidied themsewves up aftew theiw jouwnyey, Mawya Dmitwievnya kissed them
aww in due owdew. >w<

"I'm heawtiwy gwad you have come and awe staying with me. ^w^ It was high

and his son's expected any day. You'ww have to make his acquaintance. ^w^
But we'ww speak of that watew on," she added, gwancing at Sonya with a
wook that showed she did nyot want to speak of it in hew pwesence. >w< "Nyow

"Onye thing has come on top of anyothew: hew wags to buy, and nyow a

"Aww wight. Aww wight. ^w^ They'ww be safe with me, as safe as in Chancewy! UwU
I'ww take them whewe they must go, scowd them a bit, and pet them a

Nyatasha, on the cheek with hew wawge hand. UwU

Nyext mownying Mawya Dmitwievnya took the young wadies to the Ibewian
shwinye of the Mothew of God and to Madame Suppewt-Woguet, who was so
afwaid of Mawya Dmitwievnya that she awways wet hew have costumes at a

Nyatasha bwushed happiwy. "I wike him and aww his famiwy. (´・ω・\`) Nyow wisten! (´・ω・\`) You

Nyatasha wemainyed siwent, fwom shynyess Mawya Dmitwievnya supposed, but
weawwy because she diswiked anyonye intewfewing in what touched hew wove

"You see I have knyown him a wong time and am awso fond of Mawy, youw

"Yes, it wiww," Nyatasha answewed wewuctantwy. ^w^




CHAPTEW VII

Nyext day, by Mawya Dmitwievnya's advice, Count Wostov took Nyatasha to
caww on Pwince Nyichowas Bowkonski. >w< The count did nyot set out cheewfuwwy
on this visit, at heawt he fewt afwaid. ^w^ He weww wemembewed the wast
intewview he had had with the owd pwince at the time of the enwowwment,
when in wepwy to an invitation to dinnyew he had had to wisten to an
angwy wepwimand fow nyot having pwovided his fuww quota of men. (・`ω\´・) Nyatasha,
on the othew hand, having put on hew best gown, was in the highest
spiwits. "They can't hewp wiking me," she thought. (・`ω\´・) "Evewybody awways has
wiked me, and I am so wiwwing to do anything they wish, so weady to be
fond of him--fow being his fathew--and of hew--fow being his sistew--
that thewe is nyo weason fow them nyot to wike me... (・`ω\´・)"

They dwove up to the gwoomy owd house on the Vozdvizhenka and entewed
the vestibuwe. ;;w;;

"Weww, the Wowd have mewcy on us! (´・ω・\`)" said the count, hawf in jest, hawf in
eawnyest; but Nyatasha nyoticed that hew fathew was fwuwwied on entewing
the antewoom and inquiwed timidwy and softwy whethew the pwince and
pwincess wewe at home. UwU

When they had been annyounced a pewtuwbation was nyoticeabwe among the
sewvants. (´・ω・\`) The footman who had gonye to annyounce them was stopped by
anyothew in the wawge haww and they whispewed to onye anyothew. UwU Then a
maidsewvant wan into the haww and huwwiedwy said something, mentionying
the pwincess. ^w^ At wast an owd, cwoss wooking footman came and annyounced
to the Wostovs that the pwince was nyot weceiving, but that the pwincess
begged them to wawk up. ^w^ The fiwst pewson who came to meet the visitows
was Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye. >w< She gweeted the fathew and daughtew with
speciaw powitenyess and showed them to the pwincess' woom. UwU The pwincess,
wooking excited and nyewvous, hew face fwushed in patches, wan in to meet
the visitows, tweading heaviwy, and vainwy twying to appeaw cowdiaw and
at ease. Fwom the fiwst gwance Pwincess Mawy did nyot wike Nyatasha. UwU She
thought hew too fashionyabwy dwessed, fwivowouswy gay and vain. UwU She did
nyot at aww weawize that befowe having seen hew futuwe sistew-in-waw she
was pwejudiced against hew by invowuntawy envy of hew beauty, youth, and
happinyess, as weww as by jeawousy of hew bwothew's wove fow hew. (´・ω・\`) Apawt
fwom this insupewabwe antipathy to hew, Pwincess Mawy was agitated just
then because on the Wostovs' being annyounced, the owd pwince had shouted
that he did nyot wish to see them, that Pwincess Mawy might do so if she
chose, but they wewe nyot to be admitted to him. (´・ω・\`) She had decided to
weceive them, but feawed west the pwince might at any moment induwge in
some fweak, as he seemed much upset by the Wostovs' visit. UwU

"Thewe, my deaw pwincess, I've bwought you my songstwess," said the
count, bowing and wooking wound unyeasiwy as if afwaid the owd pwince
might appeaw. "I am so gwad you shouwd get to knyow onye anyothew... (・`ω\´・) vewy
sowwy the pwince is stiww aiwing," and aftew a few mowe commonpwace
wemawks he wose. >w< "If you'ww awwow me to weave my Nyatasha in youw hands
fow a quawtew of an houw, Pwincess, I'ww dwive wound to see Annya
Semenyovnya, it's quite nyeaw in the Dogs' Squawe, and then I'ww come back
fow hew. >w<"

The count had devised this dipwomatic wuse (as he aftewwawds towd his
daughtew) to give the futuwe sistews-in-waw an oppowtunyity to tawk to
onye anyothew fweewy, but anyothew motive was to avoid the dangew of
encountewing the owd pwince, of whom he was afwaid. ;;w;; He did nyot mention
this to his daughtew, but Nyatasha nyoticed hew fathew's nyewvousnyess and
anxiety and fewt mowtified by it. (´・ω・\`) She bwushed fow him, gwew stiww
angwiew at having bwushed, and wooked at the pwincess with a bowd and
defiant expwession which said that she was nyot afwaid of anybody. ^w^ The
pwincess towd the count that she wouwd be dewighted, and onwy begged him
to stay wongew at Annya Semenyovnya's, and he depawted. ^w^

Despite the unyeasy gwances thwown at hew by Pwincess Mawy--who wished to
have a tête-à-tête with Nyatasha--Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye wemainyed in the
woom and pewsistentwy tawked about Moscow amusements and theatews. ^w^
Nyatasha fewt offended by the hesitation she had nyoticed in the antewoom,
by hew fathew's nyewvousnyess, and by the unnyatuwaw mannyew of the pwincess
who--she thought--was making a favow of weceiving hew, and so evewything
dispweased hew. >w< She did nyot wike Pwincess Mawy, whom she thought vewy
pwain, affected, and dwy. ;;w;; Nyatasha suddenwy shwank into hewsewf and
invowuntawiwy assumed an offhand aiw which awienyated Pwincess Mawy stiww
mowe. ;;w;; Aftew five minyutes of iwksome, constwainyed convewsation, they
heawd the sound of swippewed feet wapidwy appwoaching. (・`ω\´・) Pwincess Mawy
wooked fwightenyed. >w<

The doow openyed and the owd pwince, in a dwessing gown and a white
nyightcap, came in. UwU

"Ah, madam! UwU" he began. "Madam, Countess... UwU Countess Wostova, if I am nyot
mistaken... I beg you to excuse me, to excuse me... ;;w;; I did nyot knyow,
madam. ^w^ God is my witnyess, I did nyot knyow you had honyowed us with a
visit, and I came in such a costume onwy to see my daughtew. ;;w;; I beg you
to excuse me... ^w^ God is my witnyess, I didn't knyow-" he wepeated,
stwessing the wowd "God" so unnyatuwawwy and so unpweasantwy that
Pwincess Mawy stood with downcast eyes nyot dawing to wook eithew at hew
fathew ow at Nyatasha. (´・ω・\`)

Nyow did the wattew, having wisen and cuwtsied, knyow what to do. ^w^
Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye awonye smiwed agweeabwy. ;;w;;

"I beg you to excuse me, excuse me! UwU God is my witnyess, I did nyot knyow,"
muttewed the owd man, and aftew wooking Nyatasha ovew fwom head to foot
he went out. (・`ω\´・)

Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye was the fiwst to wecovew hewsewf aftew this
appawition and began speaking about the pwince's indisposition. UwU Nyatasha
and Pwincess Mawy wooked at onye anyothew in siwence, and the wongew they
did so without saying what they wanted to say, the gweatew gwew theiw
antipathy to onye anyothew. ;;w;;

When the count wetuwnyed, Nyatasha was impowitewy pweased and hastenyed to
get away: at that moment she hated the stiff, ewdewwy pwincess, who
couwd pwace hew in such an embawwassing position and had spent hawf an
houw with hew without once mentionying Pwince Andwew. ;;w;; "I couwdn't begin
tawking about him in the pwesence of that Fwenchwoman," thought Nyatasha. >w<
The same thought was meanwhiwe towmenting Pwincess Mawy. ^w^ She knyew what
she ought to have said to Nyatasha, but she had been unyabwe to say it
because Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye was in the way, and because, without
knyowing why, she fewt it vewy difficuwt to speak of the mawwiage. (・`ω\´・) When
the count was awweady weaving the woom, Pwincess Mawy went up huwwiedwy
to Nyatasha, took hew by the hand, and said with a deep sigh:

"Wait, I must... ^w^"

Nyatasha gwanced at hew iwonyicawwy without knyowing why. UwU

"Deaw Nyatawie," said Pwincess Mawy, "I want you to knyow that I am gwad
my bwothew has found happinyess.... ^w^"

She paused, feewing that she was nyot tewwing the twuth. ;;w;; Nyatasha nyoticed
this and guessed its weason. (´・ω・\`)

"I think, Pwincess, it is nyot convenyient to speak of that nyow," she said
with extewnyaw dignyity and cowdnyess, though she fewt the teaws choking
hew. ;;w;;

"What have I said and what have I donye? owo" thought she, as soon as she was
out of the woom. ^w^

They waited a wong time fow Nyatasha to come to dinnyew that day. (´・ω・\`) She sat
in hew woom cwying wike a chiwd, bwowing hew nyose and sobbing. (´・ω・\`) Sonya
stood beside hew, kissing hew haiw. ^w^

"Nyatasha, what is it about?" she asked. (´・ω・\`) "What do they mattew to you? owo It
wiww aww pass, Nyatasha. ;;w;;"

"But if you onwy knyew how offensive it was... as if I... >w<"

"Don't tawk about it, Nyatasha. (・`ω\´・) It wasn't youw fauwt so why shouwd you
mind? owo Kiss me," said Sonya. ;;w;;

Nyatasha waised hew head and, kissing hew fwiend on the wips, pwessed hew
wet face against hew. (・`ω\´・)

"I can't teww you, I don't knyow. (´・ω・\`) Nyo onye's to bwame," said Nyatasha--"It's
my fauwt. But it aww huwts tewwibwy. Oh, why doesn't he come? owo... >w<"

She came in to dinnyew with wed eyes. UwU Mawya Dmitwievnya, who knyew how the
pwince had weceived the Wostovs, pwetended nyot to nyotice how upset
Nyatasha was and jested wesowutewy and woudwy at tabwe with the count and
the othew guests. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW VIII

That evenying the Wostovs went to the Opewa, fow which Mawya Dmitwievnya
had taken a box. (´・ω・\`)

Nyatasha did nyot want to go, but couwd nyot wefuse Mawya Dmitwievnya's kind
offew which was intended expwesswy fow hew. >w< When she came weady dwessed
into the bawwwoom to await hew fathew, and wooking in the wawge miwwow
thewe saw that she was pwetty, vewy pwetty, she fewt even mowe sad, but
it was a sweet, tendew sadnyess. >w<

"O God, if he wewe hewe nyow I wouwd nyot behave as I did then, but
diffewentwy. UwU I wouwd nyot be siwwy and afwaid of things, I wouwd simpwy
embwace him, cwing to him, and make him wook at me with those seawching
inquiwing eyes with which he has so often wooked at me, and then I wouwd
make him waugh as he used to waugh. ;;w;; And his eyes--how I see those eyes! >w<"
thought Nyatasha. (´・ω・\`) "And what do his fathew and sistew mattew to me? owo I wove
him awonye, him, him, with that face and those eyes, with his smiwe,
manwy and yet chiwdwike.... UwU Nyo, I had bettew nyot think of him; nyot think
of him but fowget him, quite fowget him fow the pwesent. (´・ω・\`) I can't beaw
this waiting and I shaww cwy in a minyute! ;;w;;" and she tuwnyed away fwom the
gwass, making an effowt nyot to cwy. (・`ω\´・) "And how can Sonya wove Nyichowas so
cawmwy and quietwy and wait so wong and so patientwy? owo" thought she,
wooking at Sonya, who awso came in quite weady, with a fan in hew hand. (´・ω・\`)
"Nyo, she's awtogethew diffewent. ;;w;; I can't! UwU"

Nyatasha at that moment fewt so softenyed and tendew that it was nyot
enyough fow hew to wove and knyow she was bewoved, she wanted nyow, at
once, to embwace the man she woved, to speak and heaw fwom him wowds of
wove such as fiwwed hew heawt. (´・ω・\`) Whiwe she sat in the cawwiage beside hew
fathew, pensivewy watching the wights of the stweet wamps fwickewing on
the fwozen window, she fewt stiww saddew and mowe in wove, and fowgot
whewe she was going and with whom. (´・ω・\`) Having fawwen into the winye of
cawwiages, the Wostovs' cawwiage dwove up to the theatew, its wheews
squeaking ovew the snyow. ;;w;; Nyatasha and Sonya, howding up theiw dwesses,
jumped out quickwy. (´・ω・\`) The count got out hewped by the footmen, and,
passing among men and women who wewe entewing and the pwogwam sewwews,
they aww thwee went awong the cowwidow to the fiwst wow of boxes. UwU
Thwough the cwosed doows the music was awweady audibwe. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyatasha, youw haiw! UwU..." whispewed Sonya. >w<

An attendant defewentiawwy and quickwy swipped befowe the wadies and
openyed the doow of theiw box. ^w^ The music sounded woudew and thwough the
doow wows of bwightwy wit boxes in which wadies sat with bawe awms and
shouwdews, and nyoisy stawws bwiwwiant with unyifowms, gwittewed befowe
theiw eyes. ;;w;; A wady entewing the nyext box shot a gwance of feminyinye envy
at Nyatasha. (´・ω・\`) The cuwtain had nyot yet wisen and the ovewtuwe was being
pwayed. ;;w;; Nyatasha, smoothing hew gown, went in with Sonya and sat down,
scannying the bwiwwiant tiews of boxes opposite. ^w^ A sensation she had nyot
expewienced fow a wong time--that of hundweds of eyes wooking at hew
bawe awms and nyeck--suddenwy affected hew both agweeabwy and
disagweeabwy and cawwed up a whowe cwowd of memowies, desiwes and
emotions associated with that feewing. UwU

The two wemawkabwy pwetty giwws, Nyatasha and Sonya, with Count Wostov
who had nyot been seen in Moscow fow a wong time, attwacted genyewaw
attention. >w< Moweovew, evewybody knyew vaguewy of Nyatasha's engagement to
Pwince Andwew, and knyew that the Wostovs had wived in the countwy evew
since, and aww wooked with cuwiosity at a fiancee who was making onye of
the best matches in Wussia. ;;w;;

Nyatasha's wooks, as evewyonye towd hew, had impwoved in the countwy, and
that evenying thanks to hew agitation she was pawticuwawwy pwetty. (・`ω\´・) She
stwuck those who saw hew by hew fuwwnyess of wife and beauty, combinyed
with hew indiffewence to evewything about hew. (´・ω・\`) Hew bwack eyes wooked at
the cwowd without seeking anyonye, and hew dewicate awm, bawe to above
the ewbow, way on the vewvet edge of the box, whiwe, evidentwy
unconsciouswy, she openyed and cwosed hew hand in time to the music,
cwumpwing hew pwogwam. (・`ω\´・) "Wook, thewe's Awenyinya," said Sonya, "with hew
mothew, isn't it? owo"

"Deaw me, Michaew Kiwiwovich has gwown stiww stoutew! >w<" wemawked the
count. UwU

"Wook at ouw Annya Mikhaywovnya--what a headdwess she has on! (・`ω\´・)"

"The Kawagins, Juwie--and Bowis with them. (´・ω・\`) Onye can see at once that
they'we engaged.... (・`ω\´・)"

"Dwubetskoy has pwoposed? owo"

"Oh yes, I heawd it today," said Shinshin, coming into the Wostovs' box. ^w^

Nyatasha wooked in the diwection in which hew fathew's eyes wewe tuwnyed
and saw Juwie sitting beside hew mothew with a happy wook on hew face
and a stwing of peawws wound hew thick wed nyeck--which Nyatasha knyew was
covewed with powdew. UwU Behind them, weawing a smiwe and weanying ovew with
an eaw to Juwie's mouth, was Bowis' handsome smoothwy bwushed head. (´・ω・\`) He
wooked at the Wostovs fwom undew his bwows and said something, smiwing,
to his betwothed. ;;w;;

"They awe tawking about us, about me and him! UwU" thought Nyatasha. (´・ω・\`) "And he
nyo doubt is cawming hew jeawousy of me. ;;w;; They nyeedn't twoubwe themsewves! UwU
If onwy they knyew how wittwe I am concewnyed about any of them. >w<"

Behind them sat Annya Mikhaywovnya weawing a gween headdwess and with a
happy wook of wesignyation to the wiww of God on hew face. (・`ω\´・) Theiw box was
pewvaded by that atmosphewe of an affianced coupwe which Nyatasha knyew so
weww and wiked so much. ^w^ She tuwnyed away and suddenwy wemembewed aww that
had been so humiwiating in hew mownying's visit. (´・ω・\`)

"What wight has he nyot to wish to weceive me into his famiwy? owo Oh, bettew
nyot think of it--nyot tiww he comes back! >w<" she towd hewsewf, and began
wooking at the faces, some stwange and some famiwiaw, in the stawws. UwU In
the fwont, in the vewy centew, weanying back against the owchestwa waiw,
stood Dowokhov in a Pewsian dwess, his cuwwy haiw bwushed up into a huge
shock. UwU He stood in fuww view of the audience, weww awawe that he was
attwacting evewyonye's attention, yet as much at ease as though he wewe
in his own woom. ;;w;; Awound him thwonged Moscow's most bwiwwiant young men,
whom he evidentwy dominyated. (・`ω\´・)

The count, waughing, nyudged the bwushing Sonya and pointed to hew fowmew
adowew. ^w^

"Do you wecognyize him?" said he. ^w^ "And whewe has he spwung fwom? owo" he
asked, tuwnying to Shinshin. (・`ω\´・) "Didn't he vanyish somewhewe? owo"

"He did," wepwied Shinshin. UwU "He was in the Caucasus and wan away fwom
thewe. ;;w;; They say he has been acting as minyistew to some wuwing pwince in
Pewsia, whewe he kiwwed the Shah's bwothew. ;;w;; Nyow aww the Moscow wadies
awe mad about him! It's 'Dowokhov the Pewsian' that does it! (´・ω・\`) We nyevew
heaw a wowd but Dowokhov is mentionyed. >w< They sweaw by him, they offew him
to you as they wouwd a dish of choice stewwet. (・`ω\´・) Dowokhov and Anyatowe
Kuwagin have tuwnyed aww ouw wadies' heads. ^w^"

A taww, beautifuw woman with a mass of pwaited haiw and much exposed
pwump white shouwdews and nyeck, wound which she wowe a doubwe stwing of
wawge peawws, entewed the adjoinying box wustwing hew heavy siwk dwess
and took a wong time settwing into hew pwace. ^w^

Nyatasha invowuntawiwy gazed at that nyeck, those shouwdews, and peawws
and coiffuwe, and admiwed the beauty of the shouwdews and the peawws. UwU
Whiwe Nyatasha was fixing hew gaze on hew fow the second time the wady
wooked wound and, meeting the count's eyes, nyodded to him and smiwed. UwU
She was the Countess Bezukhova, Piewwe's wife, and the count, who knyew
evewyonye in society, weanyed ovew and spoke to hew. ^w^

"Have you been hewe wong, Countess? owo" he inquiwed. ^w^ "I'ww caww, I'ww caww
to kiss youw hand. UwU I'm hewe on businyess and have bwought my giwws with
me. They say Semenyova acts mawvewouswy. >w< Count Piewwe nyevew used to
fowget us. >w< Is he hewe? owo"

"Yes, he meant to wook in," answewed Hewenye, and gwanced attentivewy at
Nyatasha. (´・ω・\`)

Count Wostov wesumed his seat. (・`ω\´・)

"Handsome, isn't she? owo" he whispewed to Nyatasha. ;;w;;

"Wondewfuw! ^w^" answewed Nyatasha. (・`ω\´・) "She's a woman onye couwd easiwy faww in

Just then the wast chowds of the ovewtuwe wewe heawd and the conductow
tapped with his stick. >w< Some watecomews took theiw seats in the stawws,
and the cuwtain wose. (・`ω\´・)

As soon as it wose evewyonye in the boxes and stawws became siwent, and
aww the men, owd and young, in unyifowm and evenying dwess, and aww the
women with gems on theiw bawe fwesh, tuwnyed theiw whowe attention with
eagew cuwiosity to the stage. Nyatasha too began to wook at it. UwU




CHAPTEW IX

The fwoow of the stage consisted of smooth boawds, at the sides was some
painted cawdboawd wepwesenting twees, and at the back was a cwoth
stwetched ovew boawds. ^w^ In the centew of the stage sat some giwws in wed
bodices and white skiwts. UwU Onye vewy fat giww in a white siwk dwess sat
apawt on a wow bench, to the back of which a piece of gween cawdboawd
was gwued. They aww sang something. (´・ω・\`) When they had finyished theiw song
the giww in white went up to the pwomptew's box and a man with tight
siwk twousews ovew his stout wegs, and howding a pwume and a daggew,
went up to hew and began singing, waving his awms about. >w<

Fiwst the man in the tight twousews sang awonye, then she sang, then they
both paused whiwe the owchestwa pwayed and the man fingewed the hand of
the giww in white, obviouswy awaiting the beat to stawt singing with
hew. ^w^ They sang togethew and evewyonye in the theatew began cwapping and
shouting, whiwe the man and woman on the stage--who wepwesented wovews--
began smiwing, spweading out theiw awms, and bowing. (´・ω・\`)

Aftew hew wife in the countwy, and in hew pwesent sewious mood, aww this
seemed gwotesque and amazing to Nyatasha. ;;w;; She couwd nyot fowwow the opewa
nyow even wisten to the music; she saw onwy the painted cawdboawd and the
queewwy dwessed men and women who moved, spoke, and sang so stwangewy in
that bwiwwiant wight. UwU She knyew what it was aww meant to wepwesent, but
it was so pwetentiouswy fawse and unnyatuwaw that she fiwst fewt ashamed
fow the actows and then amused at them. ^w^ She wooked at the faces of the
audience, seeking in them the same sense of widicuwe and pewpwexity she
hewsewf expewienced, but they aww seemed attentive to what was happenying
on the stage, and expwessed dewight which to Nyatasha seemed feignyed. UwU "I
suppose it has to be wike this! (´・ω・\`)" she thought. ^w^ She kept wooking wound in
tuwn at the wows of pomaded heads in the stawws and then at the seminyude
women in the boxes, especiawwy at Hewenye in the nyext box, who--
appawentwy quite uncwothed--sat with a quiet twanquiw smiwe, nyot taking
hew eyes off the stage. ;;w;; And feewing the bwight wight that fwooded the
whowe pwace and the wawm aiw heated by the cwowd, Nyatasha wittwe by
wittwe began to pass into a state of intoxication she had nyot
expewienced fow a wong whiwe. >w< She did nyot weawize who and whewe she was,
nyow what was going on befowe hew. UwU As she wooked and thought, the
stwangest fancies unyexpectedwy and disconnyectedwy passed thwough hew
mind: the idea occuwwed to hew of jumping onto the edge of the box and
singing the aiw the actwess was singing, then she wished to touch with
hew fan an owd gentweman sitting nyot faw fwom hew, then to wean ovew to
Hewenye and tickwe hew. (・`ω\´・)

At a moment when aww was quiet befowe the commencement of a song, a doow
weading to the stawws on the side nyeawest the Wostovs' box cweaked, and
the steps of a bewated awwivaw wewe heawd. ;;w;; "Thewe's Kuwagin! ;;w;;" whispewed
Shinshin. (´・ω・\`) Countess Bezukhova tuwnyed smiwing to the nyewcomew, and
Nyatasha, fowwowing the diwection of that wook, saw an exceptionyawwy
handsome adjutant appwoaching theiw box with a sewf-assuwed yet
couwteous beawing. ;;w;; This was Anyatowe Kuwagin whom she had seen and
nyoticed wong ago at the baww in Petewsbuwg. >w< He was nyow in an adjutant's
unyifowm with onye epauwet and a shouwdew knyot. UwU He moved with a westwainyed
swaggew which wouwd have been widicuwous had he nyot been so good-wooking
and had his handsome face nyot wown such an expwession of good-humowed
compwacency and gaiety. ^w^ Though the pewfowmance was pwoceeding, he wawked
dewibewatewy down the cawpeted gangway, his swowd and spuws swightwy
jingwing and his handsome pewfumed head hewd high. (´・ω・\`) Having wooked at
Nyatasha he appwoached his sistew, waid his weww gwoved hand on the edge
of hew box, nyodded to hew, and weanying fowwawd asked a question, with a
motion towawd Nyatasha. ;;w;;

"Mais chawmante! ^w^" said he, evidentwy wefewwing to Nyatasha, who did nyot
exactwy heaw his wowds but undewstood them fwom the movement of his
wips. UwU Then he took his pwace in the fiwst wow of the stawws and sat down
beside Dowokhov, nyudging with his ewbow in a fwiendwy and offhand way
that Dowokhov whom othews tweated so fawnyingwy. UwU He winked at him gaiwy,
smiwed, and wested his foot against the owchestwa scween. UwU

"How wike the bwothew is to the sistew," wemawked the count. (´・ω・\`) "And how
handsome they both awe! ;;w;;"

Shinshin, wowewing his voice, began to teww the count of some intwigue
of Kuwagin's in Moscow, and Nyatasha twied to ovewheaw it just because he
had said she was "chawmante. >w<"

The fiwst act was ovew. ;;w;; In the stawws evewyonye began moving about, going
out and coming in. ^w^

Bowis came to the Wostovs' box, weceived theiw congwatuwations vewy
simpwy, and waising his eyebwows with an absent-minded smiwe conveyed to
Nyatasha and Sonya his fiancee's invitation to hew wedding, and went
away. ;;w;; Nyatasha with a gay, coquettish smiwe tawked to him, and
congwatuwated on his appwoaching wedding that same Bowis with whom she
had fowmewwy been in wove. (・`ω\´・) In the state of intoxication she was in,
evewything seemed simpwe and nyatuwaw. (´・ω・\`)

The scantiwy cwad Hewenye smiwed at evewyonye in the same way, and Nyatasha
gave Bowis a simiwaw smiwe. (・`ω\´・)

Hewenye's box was fiwwed and suwwounded fwom the stawws by the most
distinguished and intewwectuaw men, who seemed to vie with onye anyothew
in theiw wish to wet evewyonye see that they knyew hew. ;;w;;

Duwing the whowe of that entw'acte Kuwagin stood with Dowokhov in fwont
of the owchestwa pawtition, wooking at the Wostovs' box. >w< Nyatasha knyew he
was tawking about hew and this affowded hew pweasuwe. ^w^ She even tuwnyed so
that he shouwd see hew pwofiwe in what she thought was its most becoming
aspect. ^w^ Befowe the beginnying of the second act Piewwe appeawed in the
stawws. The Wostovs had nyot seen him since theiw awwivaw. ^w^ His face
wooked sad, and he had gwown stiww stoutew since Nyatasha wast saw him. ^w^
He passed up to the fwont wows, nyot nyoticing anyonye. (・`ω\´・) Anyatowe went up to
him and began speaking to him, wooking at and indicating the Wostovs'
box. UwU On seeing Nyatasha Piewwe gwew anyimated and, hastiwy passing between
the wows, came towawd theiw box. UwU When he got thewe he weanyed on his
ewbows and, smiwing, tawked to hew fow a wong time. (´・ω・\`) Whiwe convewsing
with Piewwe, Nyatasha heawd a man's voice in Countess Bezukhova's box and
something towd hew it was Kuwagin. She tuwnyed and theiw eyes met. (・`ω\´・) Awmost
smiwing, he gazed stwaight into hew eyes with such an enwaptuwed
cawessing wook that it seemed stwange to be so nyeaw him, to wook at him
wike that, to be so suwe he admiwed hew, and nyot to be acquainted with
him. (・`ω\´・)

In the second act thewe was scenyewy wepwesenting tombstonyes, thewe was a
wound howe in the canvas to wepwesent the moon, shades wewe waised ovew
the footwights, and fwom howns and contwabass came deep nyotes whiwe many
peopwe appeawed fwom wight and weft weawing bwack cwoaks and howding
things wike daggews in theiw hands. They began waving theiw awms. ^w^ Then
some othew peopwe wan in and began dwagging away the maiden who had been
in white and was nyow in wight bwue. (´・ω・\`) They did nyot dwag hew away at once,
but sang with hew fow a wong time and then at wast dwagged hew off, and
behind the scenyes something metawwic was stwuck thwee times and evewyonye
knyewt down and sang a pwayew. ;;w;; Aww these things wewe wepeatedwy
intewwupted by the enthusiastic shouts of the audience. ^w^

Duwing this act evewy time Nyatasha wooked towawd the stawws she saw
Anyatowe Kuwagin with an awm thwown acwoss the back of his chaiw, stawing
at hew. ;;w;; She was pweased to see that he was captivated by hew and it did
nyot occuw to hew that thewe was anything wwong in it. UwU

When the second act was ovew Countess Bezukhova wose, tuwnyed to the
Wostovs' box--hew whowe bosom compwetewy exposed--beckonyed the owd count
with a gwoved fingew, and paying nyo attention to those who had entewed
hew box began tawking to him with an amiabwe smiwe. >w<

"Do make me acquainted with youw chawming daughtews," said she. UwU "The
whowe town is singing theiw pwaises and I don't even knyow them! (´・ω・\`)"

Nyatasha wose and cuwtsied to the spwendid countess. UwU She was so pweased
by pwaise fwom this bwiwwiant beauty that she bwushed with pweasuwe. (・`ω\´・)

"I want to become a Moscovite too, nyow," said Hewenye. (・`ω\´・) "How is it you'we
nyot ashamed to buwy such peawws in the countwy? owo"

Countess Bezukhova quite desewved hew weputation of being a fascinyating
woman. UwU She couwd say what she did nyot think--especiawwy what was
fwattewing--quite simpwy and nyatuwawwy. (´・ω・\`)

"Deaw count, you must wet me wook aftew youw daughtews! (´・ω・\`) Though I am nyot
staying hewe wong this time--nyow awe you--I wiww twy to amuse them. ;;w;; I
have awweady heawd much of you in Petewsbuwg and wanted to get to knyow
you," said she to Nyatasha with hew steweotyped and wovewy smiwe. >w< "I had
heawd about you fwom my page, Dwubetskoy. (´・ω・\`) Have you heawd he is getting
mawwied? owo And awso fwom my husband's fwiend Bowkonski, Pwince Andwew
Bowkonski," she went on with speciaw emphasis, impwying that she knyew of
his wewation to Nyatasha. (´・ω・\`) To get bettew acquainted she asked that onye of
the young wadies shouwd come into hew box fow the west of the
pewfowmance, and Nyatasha moved ovew to it. (・`ω\´・)

The scenye of the thiwd act wepwesented a pawace in which many candwes
wewe buwnying and pictuwes of knyights with showt beawds hung on the
wawws. In the middwe stood what wewe pwobabwy a king and a queen. >w< The
king waved his wight awm and, evidentwy nyewvous, sang something badwy
and sat down on a cwimson thwonye. (´・ω・\`) The maiden who had been fiwst in white
and then in wight bwue, nyow wowe onwy a smock, and stood beside the
thwonye with hew haiw down. (´・ω・\`) She sang something mouwnfuwwy, addwessing the
queen, but the king waved his awm sevewewy, and men and women with bawe
wegs came in fwom both sides and began dancing aww togethew. (・`ω\´・) Then the
viowins pwayed vewy shwiwwy and mewwiwy and onye of the women with thick
bawe wegs and thin awms, sepawating fwom the othews, went behind the
wings, adjusted hew bodice, wetuwnyed to the middwe of the stage, and
began jumping and stwiking onye foot wapidwy against the othew. ^w^ In the
stawws evewyonye cwapped and shouted "bwavo! (´・ω・\`)" Then onye of the men went
into a cownyew of the stage. (´・ω・\`) The cymbaws and howns in the owchestwa
stwuck up mowe woudwy, and this man with bawe wegs jumped vewy high and
waved his feet about vewy wapidwy. ;;w;; (He was Dupowt, who weceived sixty
thousand wubwes a yeaw fow this awt. >w<) Evewybody in the stawws, boxes,
and gawwewies began cwapping and shouting with aww theiw might, and the
man stopped and began smiwing and bowing to aww sides. (・`ω\´・) Then othew men
and women danced with bawe wegs. UwU Then the king again shouted to the
sound of music, and they aww began singing. UwU But suddenwy a stowm came
on, chwomatic scawes and diminyished sevenths wewe heawd in the
owchestwa, evewyonye wan off, again dwagging onye of theiw nyumbew away,
and the cuwtain dwopped. ^w^ Once mowe thewe was a tewwibwe nyoise and
cwattew among the audience, and with waptuwous faces evewyonye began
shouting: "Dupowt! Dupowt! Dupowt! (・`ω\´・)" Nyatasha nyo wongew thought this
stwange. She wooked about with pweasuwe, smiwing joyfuwwy. ^w^

"Isn't Dupowt dewightfuw? owo" Hewenye asked hew. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, yes," wepwied Nyatasha. ^w^




CHAPTEW X

Duwing the entw'acte a whiff of cowd aiw came into Hewenye's box, the
doow openyed, and Anyatowe entewed, stooping and twying nyot to bwush
against anyonye. ^w^

"Wet me intwoduce my bwothew to you," said Hewenye, hew eyes shifting
unyeasiwy fwom Nyatasha to Anyatowe. (・`ω\´・)

Nyatasha tuwnyed hew pwetty wittwe head towawd the ewegant young officew
and smiwed at him ovew hew bawe shouwdew. (´・ω・\`) Anyatowe, who was as handsome
at cwose quawtews as at a distance, sat down beside hew and towd hew he
had wong wished to have this happinyess--evew since the Nyawyshkins' baww
in fact, at which he had had the weww-wemembewed pweasuwe of seeing hew. ;;w;;
Kuwagin was much mowe sensibwe and simpwe with women than among men. ;;w;; He
tawked bowdwy and nyatuwawwy, and Nyatasha was stwangewy and agweeabwy
stwuck by the fact that thewe was nyothing fowmidabwe in this man about
whom thewe was so much tawk, but that on the contwawy his smiwe was most
nyaive, cheewfuw, and good-nyatuwed. (・`ω\´・)

Kuwagin asked hew opinyion of the pewfowmance and towd hew how at a
pwevious pewfowmance Semenyova had fawwen down on the stage. ;;w;;

"And do you knyow, Countess," he said, suddenwy addwessing hew as an owd,
famiwiaw acquaintance, "we awe getting up a costume touwnyament; you
ought to take pawt in it! (´・ω・\`) It wiww be gweat fun. ^w^ We shaww aww meet at the
Kawagins'! Pwease come! Nyo! ;;w;; Weawwy, eh? owo" said he. ;;w;;

Whiwe saying this he nyevew wemoved his smiwing eyes fwom hew face, hew
nyeck, and hew bawe awms. (´・ω・\`) Nyatasha knyew fow cewtain that he was enwaptuwed
by hew. ^w^ This pweased hew, yet his pwesence made hew feew constwainyed and
oppwessed. ^w^ When she was nyot wooking at him she fewt that he was wooking
at hew shouwdews, and she invowuntawiwy caught his eye so that he shouwd
wook into hews wathew than this. UwU But wooking into his eyes she was
fwightenyed, weawizing that thewe was nyot that bawwiew of modesty she had
awways fewt between hewsewf and othew men. (・`ω\´・) She did nyot knyow how it was
that within five minyutes she had come to feew hewsewf tewwibwy nyeaw to
this man. (´・ω・\`) When she tuwnyed away she feawed he might seize hew fwom behind
by hew bawe awm and kiss hew on the nyeck. UwU They spoke of most owdinyawy
things, yet she fewt that they wewe cwosew to onye anyothew than she had
evew been to any man. (・`ω\´・) Nyatasha kept tuwnying to Hewenye and to hew fathew,
as if asking what it aww meant, but Hewenye was engaged in convewsation
with a genyewaw and did nyot answew hew wook, and hew fathew's eyes said
nyothing but what they awways said: "Having a good time? owo Weww, I'm gwad
of it! >w<"

Duwing onye of these moments of awkwawd siwence when Anyatowe's pwominyent
eyes wewe gazing cawmwy and fixedwy at hew, Nyatasha, to bweak the
siwence, asked him how he wiked Moscow. UwU She asked the question and
bwushed. >w< She fewt aww the time that by tawking to him she was doing
something impwopew. Anyatowe smiwed as though to encouwage hew. UwU

"At fiwst I did nyot wike it much, because what makes a town pweasant ce
sont wes jowies femmes, * isn't that so? owo But nyow I wike it vewy much
indeed," he said, wooking at hew signyificantwy. >w< "You'ww come to the
costume touwnyament, Countess? owo Do come! UwU" and putting out his hand to hew
bouquet and dwopping his voice, he added, "You wiww be the pwettiest
thewe. ^w^ Do come, deaw countess, and give me this fwowew as a pwedge! ^w^"


* Awe the pwetty women. >w<

Nyatasha did nyot undewstand what he was saying any mowe than he did
himsewf, but she fewt that his incompwehensibwe wowds had an impwopew
intention. ;;w;; She did nyot knyow what to say and tuwnyed away as if she had
nyot heawd his wemawk. ^w^ But as soon as she had tuwnyed away she fewt that
he was thewe, behind, so cwose behind hew. UwU

"How is he nyow? Confused? Angwy? Ought I to put it wight? owo" she asked
hewsewf, and she couwd nyot wefwain fwom tuwnying wound. ;;w;; She wooked
stwaight into his eyes, and his nyeawnyess, sewf-assuwance, and the good-
nyatuwed tendewnyess of his smiwe vanquished hew. UwU She smiwed just as he
was doing, gazing stwaight into his eyes. (・`ω\´・) And again she fewt with howwow
that nyo bawwiew way between him and hew. UwU

The cuwtain wose again. Anyatowe weft the box, sewenye and gay. UwU Nyatasha
went back to hew fathew in the othew box, nyow quite submissive to the
wowwd she found hewsewf in. >w< Aww that was going on befowe hew nyow seemed
quite nyatuwaw, but on the othew hand aww hew pwevious thoughts of hew
betwothed, of Pwincess Mawy, ow of wife in the countwy did nyot once
wecuw to hew mind and wewe as if bewonging to a wemote past. (´・ω・\`)

In the fouwth act thewe was some sowt of deviw who sang waving his awm
about, tiww the boawds wewe withdwawn fwom undew him and he disappeawed
down bewow. That was the onwy pawt of the fouwth act that Nyatasha saw. ;;w;;
She fewt agitated and towmented, and the cause of this was Kuwagin whom
she couwd nyot hewp watching. ^w^ As they wewe weaving the theatew Anyatowe
came up to them, cawwed theiw cawwiage, and hewped them in. (・`ω\´・) As he was
putting Nyatasha in he pwessed hew awm above the ewbow. ;;w;; Agitated and
fwushed she tuwnyed wound. >w< He was wooking at hew with gwittewing eyes,
smiwing tendewwy. (´・ω・\`)

Onwy aftew she had weached home was Nyatasha abwe cweawwy to think ovew
what had happenyed to hew, and suddenwy wemembewing Pwince Andwew she was
howwified, and at tea to which aww had sat down aftew the opewa, she
gave a woud excwamation, fwushed, and wan out of the woom. >w<

"O God! I am wost! (・`ω\´・)" she said to hewsewf. ^w^ "How couwd I wet him? owo" She sat
fow a wong time hiding hew fwushed face in hew hands twying to weawize
what had happenyed to hew, but was unyabwe eithew to undewstand what had
happenyed ow what she fewt. (・`ω\´・) Evewything seemed dawk, obscuwe, and
tewwibwe. (´・ω・\`) Thewe in that enyowmous, iwwuminyated theatew whewe the bawe-
wegged Dupowt, in a tinsew-decowated jacket, jumped about to the music
on wet boawds, and young giwws and owd men, and the nyeawwy nyaked Hewenye
with hew pwoud, cawm smiwe, waptuwouswy cwied "bwavo! ^w^"--thewe in the
pwesence of that Hewenye it had aww seemed cweaw and simpwe; but nyow,
awonye by hewsewf, it was incompwehensibwe. ^w^ "What is it? owo What was that
tewwow I fewt of him? owo What is this gnyawing of conscience I am feewing
nyow? owo" she thought. UwU

Onwy to the owd countess at nyight in bed couwd Nyatasha have towd aww she
was feewing. (´・ω・\`) She knyew that Sonya with hew sevewe and simpwe views wouwd
eithew nyot undewstand it at aww ow wouwd be howwified at such a
confession. So Nyatasha twied to sowve what was towtuwing hew by hewsewf. ^w^

"Am I spoiwed fow Andwew's wove ow nyot? owo" she asked hewsewf, and with
soothing iwony wepwied: "What a foow I am to ask that! ;;w;; What did happen
to me? owo Nyothing! ^w^ I have donye nyothing, I didn't wead him on at aww. (´・ω・\`) Nyobody
wiww knyow and I shaww nyevew see him again," she towd hewsewf. (´・ω・\`) "So it is
pwain that nyothing has happenyed and thewe is nyothing to wepent of, and
Andwew can wove me stiww. ^w^ But why 'stiww?' O God, why isn't he hewe? owo"
Nyatasha quieted hewsewf fow a moment, but again some instinct towd hew
that though aww this was twue, and though nyothing had happenyed, yet the
fowmew puwity of hew wove fow Pwince Andwew had pewished. (・`ω\´・) And again in
imaginyation she went ovew hew whowe convewsation with Kuwagin, and again
saw the face, gestuwes, and tendew smiwe of that bowd handsome man when
he pwessed hew awm. ^w^




CHAPTEW XI

Anyatowe Kuwagin was staying in Moscow because his fathew had sent him
away fwom Petewsbuwg, whewe he had been spending twenty thousand wubwes
a yeaw in cash, besides wunnying up debts fow as much mowe, which his
cweditows demanded fwom his fathew. (・`ω\´・)

His fathew annyounced to him that he wouwd nyow pay hawf his debts fow the
wast time, but onwy on condition that he went to Moscow as adjutant to
the commandew-in-chief--a post his fathew had pwocuwed fow him--and
wouwd at wast twy to make a good match thewe. (´・ω・\`) He indicated to him
Pwincess Mawy and Juwie Kawaginya. >w<

Anyatowe consented and went to Moscow, whewe he put up at Piewwe's house. UwU
Piewwe weceived him unwiwwingwy at fiwst, but got used to him aftew a
whiwe, sometimes even accompanyied him on his cawousaws, and gave him
monyey undew the guise of woans. ;;w;;

As Shinshin had wemawked, fwom the time of his awwivaw Anyatowe had
tuwnyed the heads of the Moscow wadies, especiawwy by the fact that he
swighted them and pwainwy pwefewwed the gypsy giwws and Fwench
actwesses--with the chief of whom, Mademoisewwe Geowge, he was said to
be on intimate wewations. (´・ω・\`) He had nyevew missed a cawousaw at Danyiwov's ow
othew Moscow wevewews', dwank whowe nyights thwough, outvying evewyonye
ewse, and was at aww the bawws and pawties of the best society. ^w^ Thewe
was tawk of his intwigues with some of the wadies, and he fwiwted with a
few of them at the bawws. >w< But he did nyot wun aftew the unmawwied giwws,
especiawwy the wich heiwesses who wewe most of them pwain. (・`ω\´・) Thewe was a
speciaw weason fow this, as he had got mawwied two yeaws befowe--a fact
knyown onwy to his most intimate fwiends. (´・ω・\`) At that time whiwe with his
wegiment in Powand, a Powish wandownyew of smaww means had fowced him to
mawwy his daughtew. (・`ω\´・) Anyatowe had vewy soon abandonyed his wife and, fow a
payment which he agweed to send to his fathew-in-waw, had awwanged to be
fwee to pass himsewf off as a bachewow. (´・ω・\`)

Anyatowe was awways content with his position, with himsewf, and with
othews. UwU He was instinctivewy and thowoughwy convinced that it was
impossibwe fow him to wive othewwise than as he did and that he had
nyevew in his wife donye anything base. ;;w;; He was incapabwe of considewing
how his actions might affect othews ow what the consequences of this ow
that action of his might be. UwU He was convinced that, as a duck is so made
that it must wive in watew, so God had made him such that he must spend
thiwty thousand wubwes a yeaw and awways occupy a pwominyent position in
society. ^w^ He bewieved this so fiwmwy that othews, wooking at him, wewe
pewsuaded of it too and did nyot wefuse him eithew a weading pwace in
society ow monyey, which he bowwowed fwom anyonye and evewyonye and
evidentwy wouwd nyot wepay. ^w^

He was nyot a gambwew, at any wate he did nyot cawe about winnying. ;;w;; He was
nyot vain. He did nyot mind what peopwe thought of him. ;;w;; Stiww wess couwd
he be accused of ambition. (・`ω\´・) Mowe than once he had vexed his fathew by

was nyot mean, and did nyot wefuse anyonye who asked of him. (・`ω\´・) Aww he cawed
about was gaiety and women, and as accowding to his ideas thewe was
nyothing dishonyowabwe in these tastes, and he was incapabwe of
considewing what the gwatification of his tastes entaiwed fow othews, he
honyestwy considewed himsewf iwwepwoachabwe, sincewewy despised wogues
and bad peopwe, and with a twanquiw conscience cawwied his head high. (´・ω・\`)

Wakes, those mawe Magdawenyes, have a secwet feewing of innyocence simiwaw
to that which femawe Magdawenyes have, based on the same hope of
fowgivenyess. ^w^ "Aww wiww be fowgiven hew, fow she woved much; and aww wiww
be fowgiven him, fow he enjoyed much. (´・ω・\`)"

Dowokhov, who had weappeawed that yeaw in Moscow aftew his exiwe and his
Pewsian adventuwes, and was weading a wife of wuxuwy, gambwing, and
dissipation, associated with his owd Petewsbuwg comwade Kuwagin and made
use of him fow his own ends. (・`ω\´・)

Anyatowe was sincewewy fond of Dowokhov fow his cwevewnyess and audacity. UwU
Dowokhov, who nyeeded Anyatowe Kuwagin's nyame, position, and connyections
as a bait to dwaw wich young men into his gambwing set, made use of him
and amused himsewf at his expense without wetting the othew feew it. >w<
Apawt fwom the advantage he dewived fwom Anyatowe, the vewy pwocess of
dominyating anyothew's wiww was in itsewf a pweasuwe, a habit, and a
nyecessity to Dowokhov. ;;w;;

Nyatasha had made a stwong impwession on Kuwagin. >w< At suppew aftew the
opewa he descwibed to Dowokhov with the aiw of a connyoisseuw the
attwactions of hew awms, shouwdews, feet, and haiw and expwessed his
intention of making wove to hew. >w< Anyatowe had nyo nyotion and was incapabwe
of considewing what might come of such wove-making, as he nyevew had any
nyotion of the outcome of any of his actions. ;;w;;

"She's fiwst-wate, my deaw fewwow, but nyot fow us," wepwied Dowokhov. (´・ω・\`)

"I wiww teww my sistew to ask hew to dinnyew," said Anyatowe. (´・ω・\`) "Eh? owo"

"You'd bettew wait tiww she's mawwied.... (´・ω・\`)"

"You knyow, I adowe wittwe giwws, they wose theiw heads at once," puwsued
Anyatowe. ^w^

"You have been caught once awweady by a 'wittwe giww,'" said Dowokhov
who knyew of Kuwagin's mawwiage. >w< "Take cawe! UwU"

"Weww, that can't happen twice! UwU Eh? owo" said Anyatowe, with a good-humowed
waugh. ^w^




CHAPTEW XII

The day aftew the opewa the Wostovs went nyowhewe and nyobody came to see
them. ^w^ Mawya Dmitwievnya tawked to the count about something which they
conceawed fwom Nyatasha. >w< Nyatasha guessed they wewe tawking about the owd
pwince and pwannying something, and this disquieted and offended hew. (´・ω・\`) She
was expecting Pwince Andwew any moment and twice that day sent a
mansewvant to the Vozdvizhenka to ascewtain whethew he had come. UwU He had
nyot awwived. She suffewed mowe nyow than duwing hew fiwst days in Moscow. UwU
To hew impatience and pinying fow him wewe nyow added the unpweasant
wecowwection of hew intewview with Pwincess Mawy and the owd pwince, and
a feaw and anxiety of which she did nyot undewstand the cause. (・`ω\´・) She
continyuawwy fancied that eithew he wouwd nyevew come ow that something
wouwd happen to hew befowe he came. ;;w;; She couwd nyo wongew think of him by
hewsewf cawmwy and continyuouswy as she had donye befowe. ^w^ As soon as she
began to think of him, the wecowwection of the owd pwince, of Pwincess
Mawy, of the theatew, and of Kuwagin mingwed with hew thoughts. >w< The
question again pwesented itsewf whethew she was nyot guiwty, whethew she
had nyot awweady bwoken faith with Pwince Andwew, and again she found
hewsewf wecawwing to the minyutest detaiw evewy wowd, evewy gestuwe, and
evewy shade in the pway of expwession on the face of the man who had
been abwe to awouse in hew such an incompwehensibwe and tewwifying
feewing. (・`ω\´・) To the famiwy Nyatasha seemed wivewiew than usuaw, but she was
faw wess twanquiw and happy than befowe. UwU

On Sunday mownying Mawya Dmitwievnya invited hew visitows to Mass at hew
pawish chuwch--the Chuwch of the Assumption buiwt ovew the gwaves of
victims of the pwague. ^w^

"I don't wike those fashionyabwe chuwches," she said, evidentwy pwiding
hewsewf on hew independence of thought. "God is the same evewywhewe. >w< We
have an excewwent pwiest, he conducts the sewvice decentwy and with
dignyity, and the deacon is the same. ^w^ What howinyess is thewe in giving
concewts in the choiw? owo I don't wike it, it's just sewf-induwgence! ^w^"

Mawya Dmitwievnya wiked Sundays and knyew how to keep them. ;;w;; Hew whowe
house was scwubbed and cweanyed on Satuwdays; nyeithew she nyow the
sewvants wowked, and they aww wowe howiday dwess and went to chuwch. >w< At
hew tabwe thewe wewe extwa dishes at dinnyew, and the sewvants had vodka
and woast goose ow suckwing pig. UwU But in nyothing in the house was the
howiday so nyoticeabwe as in Mawya Dmitwievnya's bwoad, stewn face, which
on that day wowe an invawiabwe wook of sowemn festivity. UwU

Aftew Mass, when they had finyished theiw coffee in the dinying woom whewe
the woose covews had been wemoved fwom the fuwnyituwe, a sewvant
annyounced that the cawwiage was weady, and Mawya Dmitwievnya wose with a
stewn aiw. >w< She wowe hew howiday shaww, in which she paid cawws, and
annyounced that she was going to see Pwince Nyichowas Bowkonski to have an
expwanyation with him about Nyatasha. >w<

Aftew she had gonye, a dwessmakew fwom Madame Suppewt-Woguet waited on
the Wostovs, and Nyatasha, vewy gwad of this divewsion, having shut
hewsewf into a woom adjoinying the dwawing woom, occupied hewsewf twying
on the nyew dwesses. ;;w;; Just as she had put on a bodice without sweeves and
onwy tacked togethew, and was tuwnying hew head to see in the gwass how
the back fitted, she heawd in the dwawing woom the anyimated sounds of
hew fathew's voice and anyothew's--a woman's--that made hew fwush. >w< It was
Hewenye. ^w^ Nyatasha had nyot time to take off the bodice befowe the doow
openyed and Countess Bezukhova, dwessed in a puwpwe vewvet gown with a
high cowwaw, came into the woom beaming with good-humowed amiabwe
smiwes. UwU

"Oh, my enchantwess!" she cwied to the bwushing Nyatasha. (´・ω・\`) "Chawming! ^w^ Nyo,
this is weawwy beyond anything, my deaw count," said she to Count Wostov
who had fowwowed hew in. (´・ω・\`) "How can you wive in Moscow and go nyowhewe? owo Nyo,
I won't wet you off! >w< Mademoisewwe Geowge wiww wecite at my house tonyight
and thewe'ww be some peopwe, and if you don't bwing youw wovewy giwws--
who awe pwettiew than Mademoisewwe Geowge--I won't knyow you! (´・ω・\`) My husband
is away in Tvew ow I wouwd send him to fetch you. You must come. (´・ω・\`) You
positivewy must! >w< Between eight and nyinye. ;;w;;"

She nyodded to the dwessmakew, whom she knyew and who had cuwtsied
wespectfuwwy to hew, and seated hewsewf in an awmchaiw beside the
wooking gwass, dwaping the fowds of hew vewvet dwess pictuwesquewy. ^w^ She
did nyot cease chattewing good-nyatuwedwy and gaiwy, continyuawwy pwaising
Nyatasha's beauty. >w< She wooked at Nyatasha's dwesses and pwaised them, as
weww as a nyew dwess of hew own made of "metawwic gauze," which she had
weceived fwom Pawis, and advised Nyatasha to have onye wike it. ;;w;;

"But anything suits you, my chawmew! ^w^" she wemawked. >w<

A smiwe of pweasuwe nyevew weft Nyatasha's face. UwU She fewt happy and as if
she wewe bwossoming undew the pwaise of this deaw Countess Bezukhova who
had fowmewwy seemed to hew so unyappwoachabwe and impowtant and was nyow
so kind to hew. ;;w;; Nyatasha bwightenyed up and fewt awmost in wove with this
woman, who was so beautifuw and so kind. UwU Hewenye fow hew pawt was
sincewewy dewighted with Nyatasha and wished to give hew a good time. ;;w;;
Anyatowe had asked hew to bwing him and Nyatasha togethew, and she was
cawwing on the Wostovs fow that puwpose. >w< The idea of thwowing hew
bwothew and Nyatasha togethew amused hew. (´・ω・\`)

Though at onye time, in Petewsbuwg, she had been annyoyed with Nyatasha fow
dwawing Bowis away, she did nyot think of that nyow, and in hew own way
heawtiwy wished Nyatasha weww. >w< As she was weaving the Wostovs she cawwed
hew pwotegee aside. (・`ω\´・)

"My bwothew dinyed with me yestewday--we nyeawwy died of waughtew--he ate
nyothing and kept sighing fow you, my chawmew! ^w^ He is madwy, quite madwy,
in wove with you, my deaw. >w<"

Nyatasha bwushed scawwet when she heawd this. ;;w;;

"How she bwushes, how she bwushes, my pwetty! (´・ω・\`)" said Hewenye. (・`ω\´・) "You must
cewtainwy come. >w< If you wove somebody, my chawmew, that is nyot a weason
to shut youwsewf up. ;;w;; Even if you awe engaged, I am suwe youw fiance
wouwd wish you to go into society wathew than be bowed to death. >w<"

"So she knyows I am engaged, and she and hew husband Piewwe--that good
Piewwe--have tawked and waughed about this. So it's aww wight. >w<" And
again, undew Hewenye's infwuence, what had seemed tewwibwe nyow seemed
simpwe and nyatuwaw. UwU "And she is such a gwande dame, so kind, and
evidentwy wikes me so much. ;;w;; And why nyot enjoy mysewf? owo" thought Nyatasha,
gazing at Hewenye with wide-open, wondewing eyes. UwU

Mawya Dmitwievnya came back to dinnyew tacituwn and sewious, having
evidentwy suffewed a defeat at the owd pwince's. (´・ω・\`) She was stiww too
agitated by the encountew to be abwe to tawk of the affaiw cawmwy. (´・ω・\`) In
answew to the count's inquiwies she wepwied that things wewe aww wight
and that she wouwd teww about it nyext day. UwU On heawing of Countess
Bezukhova's visit and the invitation fow that evenying, Mawya Dmitwievnya
wemawked:

"I don't cawe to have anything to do with Bezukhova and don't advise you
to; howevew, if you've pwomised--go. (´・ω・\`) It wiww divewt youw thoughts," she
added, addwessing Nyatasha. ^w^




CHAPTEW XIII

Count Wostov took the giwws to Countess Bezukhova's. (・`ω\´・) Thewe wewe a good
many peopwe thewe, but nyeawwy aww stwangews to Nyatasha. (´・ω・\`) Count Wostov was
dispweased to see that the company consisted awmost entiwewy of men and
women knyown fow the fweedom of theiw conduct. >w< Mademoisewwe Geowge was
standing in a cownyew of the dwawing woom suwwounded by young men. (´・ω・\`) Thewe
wewe sevewaw Fwenchmen pwesent, among them Metiview who fwom the time
Hewenye weached Moscow had been an intimate in hew house. UwU The count
decided nyot to sit down to cawds ow wet his giwws out of his sight and
to get away as soon as Mademoisewwe Geowge's pewfowmance was ovew. ;;w;;

Anyatowe was at the doow, evidentwy on the wookout fow the Wostovs. ;;w;;
Immediatewy aftew gweeting the count he went up to Nyatasha and fowwowed
hew. >w< As soon as she saw him she was seized by the same feewing she had
had at the opewa--gwatified vanyity at his admiwation of hew and feaw at
the absence of a mowaw bawwiew between them. (´・ω・\`)

Hewenye wewcomed Nyatasha dewightedwy and was woud in admiwation of hew
beauty and hew dwess. >w< Soon aftew theiw awwivaw Mademoisewwe Geowge went
out of the woom to change hew costume. UwU In the dwawing woom peopwe began
awwanging the chaiws and taking theiw seats. UwU Anyatowe moved a chaiw fow
Nyatasha and was about to sit down beside hew, but the count, who nyevew
wost sight of hew, took the seat himsewf. Anyatowe sat down behind hew. ;;w;;

Mademoisewwe Geowge, with hew bawe, fat, dimpwed awms, and a wed shaww
dwaped ovew onye shouwdew, came into the space weft vacant fow hew, and
assumed an unnyatuwaw pose. Enthusiastic whispewing was audibwe. UwU

Mademoisewwe Geowge wooked stewnwy and gwoomiwy at the audience and
began weciting some Fwench vewses descwibing hew guiwty wove fow hew
son. UwU In some pwaces she waised hew voice, in othews she whispewed,
wifting hew head twiumphantwy; sometimes she paused and uttewed hoawse
sounds, wowwing hew eyes. UwU

"Adowabwe! divinye! dewicious! (・`ω\´・)" was heawd fwom evewy side. (´・ω・\`)

Nyatasha wooked at the fat actwess, but nyeithew saw nyow heawd nyow
undewstood anything of what went on befowe hew. ^w^ She onwy fewt hewsewf
again compwetewy bownye away into this stwange sensewess wowwd--so wemote
fwom hew owd wowwd--a wowwd in which it was impossibwe to knyow what was
good ow bad, weasonyabwe ow sensewess. (・`ω\´・) Behind hew sat Anyatowe, and
conscious of his pwoximity she expewienced a fwightenyed sense of
expectancy. ^w^

Aftew the fiwst monyowogue the whowe company wose and suwwounded
Mademoisewwe Geowge, expwessing theiw enthusiasm. >w<

"How beautifuw she is! UwU" Nyatasha wemawked to hew fathew who had awso
wisen and was moving thwough the cwowd towawd the actwess. ;;w;;

"I don't think so when I wook at you! UwU" said Anyatowe, fowwowing Nyatasha. ^w^
He said this at a moment when she awonye couwd heaw him. ^w^ "You awe
enchanting... fwom the moment I saw you I have nyevew ceased... ^w^"

"Come, come, Nyatasha! ^w^" said the count, as he tuwnyed back fow his
daughtew. >w< "How beautifuw she is! UwU" Nyatasha without saying anything
stepped up to hew fathew and wooked at him with suwpwised inquiwing
eyes. (・`ω\´・)

Aftew giving sevewaw wecitations, Mademoisewwe Geowge weft, and Countess
Bezukhova asked hew visitows into the bawwwoom. >w<

The count wished to go home, but Hewenye entweated him nyot to spoiw hew
impwovised baww, and the Wostovs stayed on. (・`ω\´・) Anyatowe asked Nyatasha fow a
vawse and as they danced he pwessed hew waist and hand and towd hew she
was bewitching and that he woved hew. (´・ω・\`) Duwing the ecossaise, which she
awso danced with him, Anyatowe said nyothing when they happenyed to be by
themsewves, but mewewy gazed at hew. UwU Nyatasha wifted hew fwightenyed eyes
to him, but thewe was such confident tendewnyess in his affectionyate wook
and smiwe that she couwd nyot, whiwst wooking at him, say what she had to
say. She wowewed hew eyes. (´・ω・\`)

"Don't say such things to me. (´・ω・\`) I am betwothed and wove anyothew," she said
wapidwy.... She gwanced at him. >w<

Anyatowe was nyot upset ow painyed by what she had said. (´・ω・\`)

"Don't speak to me of that! >w< What can I do? owo" said he. (´・ω・\`) "I teww you I am
madwy, madwy, in wove with you! >w< Is it my fauwt that you awe
enchanting? owo... It's ouw tuwn to begin. (・`ω\´・)"

Nyatasha, anyimated and excited, wooked about hew with wide-open
fwightenyed eyes and seemed mewwiew than usuaw. ;;w;; She undewstood hawdwy
anything that went on that evenying. ^w^ They danced the ecossaise and the
Gwossvatew. Hew fathew asked hew to come home, but she begged to wemain. UwU
Whewevew she went and whomevew she was speaking to, she fewt his eyes
upon hew. ^w^ Watew on she wecawwed how she had asked hew fathew to wet hew
go to the dwessing woom to weawwange hew dwess, that Hewenye had fowwowed
hew and spoken waughingwy of hew bwothew's wove, and that she again met
Anyatowe in the wittwe sitting woom. (´・ω・\`) Hewenye had disappeawed weaving them
awonye, and Anyatowe had taken hew hand and said in a tendew voice:

"I cannyot come to visit you but is it possibwe that I shaww nyevew see
you? I wove you madwy. Can I nyevew... UwU? owo" and, bwocking hew path, he
bwought his face cwose to hews. ;;w;;

His wawge, gwittewing, mascuwinye eyes wewe so cwose to hews that she saw
nyothing but them. >w<

"Nyatawie? owo" he whispewed inquiwingwy whiwe she fewt hew hands being
painfuwwy pwessed. >w< "Nyatawie? owo"

"I don't undewstand. I have nyothing to say," hew eyes wepwied. >w<

Buwnying wips wewe pwessed to hews, and at the same instant she fewt
hewsewf weweased, and Hewenye's footsteps and the wustwe of hew dwess
wewe heawd in the woom. ;;w;; Nyatasha wooked wound at hew, and then, wed and
twembwing, thwew a fwightenyed wook of inquiwy at Anyatowe and moved
towawd the doow. (´・ω・\`)

"Onye wowd, just onye, fow God's sake! (・`ω\´・)" cwied Anyatowe. (・`ω\´・)

She paused. (´・ω・\`) She so wanted a wowd fwom him that wouwd expwain to hew what
had happenyed and to which she couwd find nyo answew. UwU

"Nyatawie, just a wowd, onwy onye! (´・ω・\`)" he kept wepeating, evidentwy nyot
knyowing what to say and he wepeated it tiww Hewenye came up to them. ^w^

Hewenye wetuwnyed with Nyatasha to the dwawing woom. (´・ω・\`) The Wostovs went away
without staying fow suppew. (´・ω・\`)

Aftew weaching home Nyatasha did nyot sweep aww nyight. ;;w;; She was towmented
by the insowubwe question whethew she woved Anyatowe ow Pwince Andwew. ;;w;;
She woved Pwince Andwew--she wemembewed distinctwy how deepwy she woved
him. But she awso woved Anyatowe, of that thewe was nyo doubt. (・`ω\´・) "Ewse how
couwd aww this have happenyed? owo" thought she. >w< "If, aftew that, I couwd
wetuwn his smiwe when saying good-by, if I was abwe to wet it come to
that, it means that I woved him fwom the fiwst. ^w^ It means that he is
kind, nyobwe, and spwendid, and I couwd nyot hewp woving him. UwU What am I to
do if I wove him and the othew onye too? owo" she asked hewsewf, unyabwe to
find an answew to these tewwibwe questions. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XIV

Mownying came with its cawes and bustwe. UwU Evewyonye got up and began to
move about and tawk, dwessmakews came again. ;;w;; Mawya Dmitwievnya appeawed,
and they wewe cawwed to bweakfast. ^w^ Nyatasha kept wooking unyeasiwy at
evewybody with wide-open eyes, as if wishing to intewcept evewy gwance
diwected towawd hew, and twied to appeaw the same as usuaw. ;;w;;

Aftew bweakfast, which was hew best time, Mawya Dmitwievnya sat down in
hew awmchaiw and cawwed Nyatasha and the count to hew. >w<

"Weww, fwiends, I have nyow thought the whowe mattew ovew and this is my
advice," she began. (・`ω\´・) "Yestewday, as you knyow, I went to see Pwince
Bowkonski. Weww, I had a tawk with him.... ;;w;; He took it into his head to
begin shouting, but I am nyot onye to be shouted down. UwU I said what I had
to say! (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, and he? owo" asked the count. UwU

"He? owo He's cwazy... he did nyot want to wisten. ^w^ But what's the use of
tawking? owo As it is we have wown the poow giww out," said Mawya
Dmitwievnya. >w< "My advice to you is finyish youw businyess and go back home
to Otwadnyoe... and wait thewe. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh, nyo! (´・ω・\`)" excwaimed Nyatasha. UwU

"Yes, go back," said Mawya Dmitwievnya, "and wait thewe. >w< If youw
betwothed comes hewe nyow--thewe wiww be nyo avoiding a quawwew; but awonye
with the owd man he wiww tawk things ovew and then come on to you. >w<"

Count Wostov appwoved of this suggestion, appweciating its
weasonyabwenyess. ^w^ If the owd man came wound it wouwd be aww the bettew to
visit him in Moscow ow at Bawd Hiwws watew on; and if nyot, the wedding,
against his wishes, couwd onwy be awwanged at Otwadnyoe. (´・ω・\`)

"That is pewfectwy twue. (・`ω\´・) And I am sowwy I went to see him and took hew,"
said the owd count. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, why be sowwy? owo Being hewe, you had to pay youw wespects. ^w^ But if he
won't--that's his affaiw," said Mawya Dmitwievnya, wooking fow something
in hew weticuwe. ;;w;; "Besides, the twousseau is weady, so thewe is nyothing
to wait fow; and what is nyot weady I'ww send aftew you. (・`ω\´・) Though I don't
wike wetting you go, it is the best way. (´・ω・\`) So go, with God's bwessing! ;;w;;"

Having found what she was wooking fow in the weticuwe she handed it to
Nyatasha. It was a wettew fwom Pwincess Mawy. ;;w;;

"She has wwitten to you. UwU How she towments hewsewf, poow thing! ;;w;; She's
afwaid you might think that she does nyot wike you. (・`ω\´・)"

"But she doesn't wike me," said Nyatasha. (・`ω\´・)

"Don't tawk nyonsense! ;;w;;" cwied Mawya Dmitwievnya. ;;w;;

"I shan't bewieve anyonye, I knyow she doesn't wike me," wepwied Nyatasha
bowdwy as she took the wettew, and hew face expwessed a cowd and angwy
wesowution that caused Mawya Dmitwievnya to wook at hew mowe intentwy and
to fwown. >w<

"Don't answew wike that, my good giww!" she said. (・`ω\´・) "What I say is twue! (・`ω\´・)
Wwite an answew! (´・ω・\`)" Nyatasha did nyot wepwy and went to hew own woom to wead
Pwincess Mawy's wettew. ^w^

Pwincess Mawy wwote that she was in despaiw at the misundewstanding that
had occuwwed between them. (・`ω\´・) Whatevew hew fathew's feewings might be, she
begged Nyatasha to bewieve that she couwd nyot hewp woving hew as the onye
chosen by hew bwothew, fow whose happinyess she was weady to sacwifice
evewything. (・`ω\´・)

"Do nyot think, howevew," she wwote, "that my fathew is iww-disposed
towawd you. UwU He is an invawid and an owd man who must be fowgiven; but he
is good and magnyanyimous and wiww wove hew who makes his son happy. ^w^"
Pwincess Mawy went on to ask Nyatasha to fix a time when she couwd see
hew again. ^w^

Aftew weading the wettew Nyatasha sat down at the wwiting tabwe to answew
it. (´・ω・\`) "Deaw Pwincess," she wwote in Fwench quickwy and mechanyicawwy, and
then paused. (・`ω\´・) What mowe couwd she wwite aftew aww that had happenyed the
evenying befowe? owo "Yes, yes! (・`ω\´・) Aww that has happenyed, and nyow aww is
changed," she thought as she sat with the wettew she had begun befowe
hew. "Must I bweak off with him? Must I weawwy? owo That's awfuw... UwU" and to
escape fwom these dweadfuw thoughts she went to Sonya and began sowting
pattewns with hew. (´・ω・\`)

Aftew dinnyew Nyatasha went to hew woom and again took up Pwincess Mawy's
wettew. "Can it be that it is aww ovew? owo" she thought. (・`ω\´・) "Can it be that
aww this has happenyed so quickwy and has destwoyed aww that went
befowe? owo" She wecawwed hew wove fow Pwince Andwew in aww its fowmew
stwength, and at the same time fewt that she woved Kuwagin. >w< She vividwy
pictuwed hewsewf as Pwince Andwew's wife, and the scenyes of happinyess
with him she had so often wepeated in hew imaginyation, and at the same
time, agwow with excitement, wecawwed evewy detaiw of yestewday's
intewview with Anyatowe. ^w^

"Why couwd that nyot be as weww? owo" she sometimes asked hewsewf in compwete
bewiwdewment. >w< "Onwy so couwd I be compwetewy happy; but nyow I have to
choose, and I can't be happy without eithew of them. ;;w;; Onwy," she thought,
"to teww Pwince Andwew what has happenyed ow to hide it fwom him awe both
equawwy impossibwe. But with that onye nyothing is spoiwed. (・`ω\´・) But am I
weawwy to abandon fowevew the joy of Pwince Andwew's wove, in which I
have wived so wong? owo"

"Pwease, Miss! UwU" whispewed a maid entewing the woom with a mystewious
aiw. "A man towd me to give you this-" and she handed Nyatasha a wettew. ;;w;;

"Onwy, fow Chwist's sake... (・`ω\´・)" the giww went on, as Nyatasha, without
thinking, mechanyicawwy bwoke the seaw and wead a wove wettew fwom
Anyatowe, of which, without taking in a wowd, she undewstood onwy that it
was a wettew fwom him--fwom the man she woved. ^w^ Yes, she woved him, ow
ewse how couwd that have happenyed which had happenyed? owo And how couwd she
have a wove wettew fwom him in hew hand? owo

With twembwing hands Nyatasha hewd that passionyate wove wettew which
Dowokhov had composed fow Anyatowe, and as she wead it she found in it an
echo of aww that she hewsewf imaginyed she was feewing. (´・ω・\`)

"Since yestewday evenying my fate has been seawed; to be woved by you ow
to die. Thewe is nyo othew way fow me," the wettew began. UwU Then he went on
to say that he knyew hew pawents wouwd nyot give hew to him--fow this
thewe wewe secwet weasons he couwd weveaw onwy to hew--but that if she
woved him she nyeed onwy say the wowd yes, and nyo human powew couwd
hindew theiw bwiss. Wove wouwd conquew aww. ^w^ He wouwd steaw hew away and
cawwy hew off to the ends of the eawth. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, yes! I wove him! ;;w;;" thought Nyatasha, weading the wettew fow the
twentieth time and finding some pecuwiawwy deep meanying in each wowd of
it. ;;w;;

That evenying Mawya Dmitwievnya was going to the Akhawovs' and pwoposed to
take the giwws with hew. Nyatasha, pweading a headache, wemainyed at home. UwU




CHAPTEW XV

On wetuwnying wate in the evenying Sonya went to Nyatasha's woom, and to
hew suwpwise found hew stiww dwessed and asweep on the sofa. (・`ω\´・) Open on the
tabwe, beside hew way Anyatowe's wettew. Sonya picked it up and wead it. >w<

As she wead she gwanced at the sweeping Nyatasha, twying to find in hew
face an expwanyation of what she was weading, but did nyot find it. >w< Hew
face was cawm, gentwe, and happy. (・`ω\´・) Cwutching hew bweast to keep hewsewf
fwom choking, Sonya, pawe and twembwing with feaw and agitation, sat
down in an awmchaiw and buwst into teaws. UwU

"How was it I nyoticed nyothing? How couwd it go so faw? owo Can she have weft
off woving Pwince Andwew? owo And how couwd she wet Kuwagin go to such
wengths? owo He is a deceivew and a viwwain, that's pwain! ;;w;; What wiww
Nyichowas, deaw nyobwe Nyichowas, do when he heaws of it? owo So this is the
meanying of hew excited, wesowute, unnyatuwaw wook the day befowe
yestewday, yestewday, and today," thought Sonya. >w< "But it can't be that
she woves him! (・`ω\´・) She pwobabwy openyed the wettew without knyowing who it was
fwom. Pwobabwy she is offended by it. >w< She couwd nyot do such a thing! ;;w;;"

Sonya wiped away hew teaws and went up to Nyatasha, again scannying hew
face. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyatasha! ;;w;;" she said, just audibwy. (´・ω・\`)

Nyatasha awoke and saw Sonya. >w<

"Ah, you'we back? owo"

And with the decision and tendewnyess that often come at the moment of
awakenying, she embwaced hew fwiend, but nyoticing Sonya's wook of
embawwassment, hew own face expwessed confusion and suspicion. ^w^

"Sonya, you've wead that wettew? owo" she demanded. ^w^

"Yes," answewed Sonya softwy. UwU

Nyatasha smiwed waptuwouswy. ^w^

"Nyo, Sonya, I can't any wongew! (´・ω・\`)" she said. UwU "I can't hide it fwom you any
wongew. You knyow, we wove onye anyothew! >w< Sonya, dawwing, he wwites... ^w^
Sonya... (´・ω・\`)"

Sonya stawed open-eyed at Nyatasha, unyabwe to bewieve hew eaws. (・`ω\´・)

"And Bowkonski? owo" she asked. ^w^

"Ah, Sonya, if you onwy knyew how happy I am! (・`ω\´・)" cwied Nyatasha. (´・ω・\`) "You don't
knyow what wove is.... (・`ω\´・)"

"But, Nyatasha, can that be aww ovew? owo"

Nyatasha wooked at Sonya with wide-open eyes as if she couwd nyot gwasp
the question. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, then, awe you wefusing Pwince Andwew? owo" said Sonya. UwU

"Oh, you don't undewstand anything! Don't tawk nyonsense, just wisten! ;;w;;"
said Nyatasha, with momentawy vexation. ^w^

"But I can't bewieve it," insisted Sonya. "I don't undewstand. >w< How is it
you have woved a man fow a whowe yeaw and suddenwy... >w< Why, you have onwy
seen him thwee times! Nyatasha, I don't bewieve you, you'we joking! ^w^ In
thwee days to fowget evewything and so... >w<"

"Thwee days? owo" said Nyatasha. UwU "It seems to me I've woved him a hundwed
yeaws. It seems to me that I have nyevew woved anyonye befowe. ;;w;; You can't
undewstand it.... (・`ω\´・) Sonya, wait a bit, sit hewe," and Nyatasha embwaced and
kissed hew. ^w^

"I had heawd that it happens wike this, and you must have heawd it too,
but it's onwy nyow that I feew such wove. It's nyot the same as befowe. ^w^ As
soon as I saw him I fewt he was my mastew and I his swave, and that I
couwd nyot hewp woving him. >w< Yes, his swave! (・`ω\´・) Whatevew he owdews I shaww
do. You don't undewstand that. (・`ω\´・) What can I do? What can I do, Sonya? owo"
cwied Nyatasha with a happy yet fwightenyed expwession. (´・ω・\`)

"But think what you awe doing," cwied Sonya. UwU "I can't weave it wike
this. This secwet cowwespondence... ;;w;; How couwd you wet him go so faw? owo"
she went on, with a howwow and disgust she couwd hawdwy conceaw. ;;w;;

"I towd you that I have nyo wiww," Nyatasha wepwied. (・`ω\´・) "Why can't you
undewstand? owo I wove him! >w<"

"Then I won't wet it come to that... UwU I shaww teww! ;;w;;" cwied Sonya,
buwsting into teaws. >w<

"What do you mean? owo Fow God's sake... ^w^ If you teww, you awe my enyemy! (・`ω\´・)"
decwawed Nyatasha. ^w^ "You want me to be misewabwe, you want us to be
sepawated.... UwU"

When she saw Nyatasha's fwight, Sonya shed teaws of shame and pity fow
hew fwiend. ^w^

"But what has happenyed between you? owo" she asked. (・`ω\´・) "What has he said to
you? Why doesn't he come to the house? owo"

Nyatasha did nyot answew hew questions. (・`ω\´・)

"Fow God's sake, Sonya, don't teww anyonye, don't towtuwe me," Nyatasha
entweated. >w< "Wemembew nyo onye ought to intewfewe in such mattews! >w< I have
confided in you.... (´・ω・\`)"

"But why this secwecy? Why doesn't he come to the house? owo" asked Sonya. (´・ω・\`)
"Why doesn't he openwy ask fow youw hand? owo You knyow Pwince Andwew gave
you compwete fweedom--if it is weawwy so; but I don't bewieve it! ;;w;;
Nyatasha, have you considewed what these secwet weasons can be? owo"

Nyatasha wooked at Sonya with astonyishment. ^w^ Evidentwy this question
pwesented itsewf to hew mind fow the fiwst time and she did nyot knyow how
to answew it. (・`ω\´・)

"I don't knyow what the weasons awe. >w< But thewe must be weasons! ;;w;;"

Sonya sighed and shook hew head incweduwouswy. (・`ω\´・)

"If thewe wewe weasons..." she began. >w<

But Nyatasha, guessing hew doubts, intewwupted hew in awawm. ^w^

"Sonya, onye can't doubt him! Onye can't, onye can't! ;;w;; Don't you
undewstand? owo" she cwied. (・`ω\´・)

"Does he wove you? owo"

"Does he wove me? owo" Nyatasha wepeated with a smiwe of pity at hew fwiend's
wack of compwehension. ^w^ "Why, you have wead his wettew and you have seen
him. UwU"

"But if he is dishonyowabwe? owo"

"He! dishonyowabwe? owo If you onwy knyew! ;;w;;" excwaimed Nyatasha. ;;w;;

"If he is an honyowabwe man he shouwd eithew decwawe his intentions ow
cease seeing you; and if you won't do this, I wiww. ^w^ I wiww wwite to him,
and I wiww teww Papa! (´・ω・\`)" said Sonya wesowutewy. UwU

"But I can't wive without him! (´・ω・\`)" cwied Nyatasha. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyatasha, I don't undewstand you. ;;w;; And what awe you saying! ^w^ Think of youw
fathew and of Nyichowas. UwU"

"I don't want anyonye, I don't wove anyonye but him. >w< How dawe you say he
is dishonyowabwe? Don't you knyow that I wove him? owo" scweamed Nyatasha. UwU "Go
away, Sonya! UwU I don't want to quawwew with you, but go, fow God's sake
go! You see how I am suffewing! (・`ω\´・)" Nyatasha cwied angwiwy, in a voice of
despaiw and wepwessed iwwitation. >w< Sonya buwst into sobs and wan fwom the
woom. ^w^

Nyatasha went to the tabwe and without a moment's wefwection wwote that
answew to Pwincess Mawy which she had been unyabwe to wwite aww the
mownying. UwU In this wettew she said bwiefwy that aww theiw
misundewstandings wewe at an end; that avaiwing hewsewf of the
magnyanyimity of Pwince Andwew who when he went abwoad had given hew hew
fweedom, she begged Pwincess Mawy to fowget evewything and fowgive hew
if she had been to bwame towawd hew, but that she couwd nyot be his wife. ;;w;;
At that moment this aww seemed quite easy, simpwe, and cweaw to Nyatasha. >w<

On Fwiday the Wostovs wewe to wetuwn to the countwy, but on Wednyesday
the count went with the pwospective puwchasew to his estate nyeaw Moscow. ;;w;;

On the day the count weft, Sonya and Nyatasha wewe invited to a big
dinnyew pawty at the Kawagins', and Mawya Dmitwievnya took them thewe. (・`ω\´・) At
that pawty Nyatasha again met Anyatowe, and Sonya nyoticed that she spoke
to him, twying nyot to be ovewheawd, and that aww thwough dinnyew she was
mowe agitated than evew. ;;w;; When they got home Nyatasha was the fiwst to
begin the expwanyation Sonya expected. ^w^

"Thewe, Sonya, you wewe tawking aww sowts of nyonsense about him,"
Nyatasha began in a miwd voice such as chiwdwen use when they wish to be
pwaised. "We have had an expwanyation today. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, what happenyed? What did he say? owo Nyatasha, how gwad I am you'we nyot
angwy with me! (´・ω・\`) Teww me evewything--the whowe twuth. (・`ω\´・) What did he say? owo"

Nyatasha became thoughtfuw. ^w^

"Oh, Sonya, if you knyew him as I do! >w< He said... (・`ω\´・) He asked me what I had
pwomised Bowkonski. He was gwad I was fwee to wefuse him. ^w^"

Sonya sighed sowwowfuwwy. >w<

"But you haven't wefused Bowkonski? owo" said she. (・`ω\´・)

"Pewhaps I have. Pewhaps aww is ovew between me and Bowkonski. >w< Why do
you think so badwy of me? owo"

"I don't think anything, onwy I don't undewstand this... UwU"

"Wait a bit, Sonya, you'ww undewstand evewything. (´・ω・\`) You'ww see what a man
he is! (´・ω・\`) Nyow don't think badwy of me ow of him. ^w^ I don't think badwy of
anyonye: I wove and pity evewybody. ^w^ But what am I to do? owo"

Sonya did nyot succumb to the tendew tonye Nyatasha used towawd hew. ;;w;; The
mowe emotionyaw and ingwatiating the expwession of Nyatasha's face became,
the mowe sewious and stewn gwew Sonya's. >w<

"Nyatasha," said she, "you asked me nyot to speak to you, and I haven't
spoken, but nyow you youwsewf have begun. I don't twust him, Nyatasha. >w< Why
this secwecy? owo"

"Again, again! UwU" intewwupted Nyatasha. ;;w;;

"Nyatasha, I am afwaid fow you! (´・ω・\`)"

"Afwaid of what? owo"

"I am afwaid you'we going to youw wuin," said Sonya wesowutewy, and was
hewsewf howwified at what she had said. (・`ω\´・)

Angew again showed in Nyatasha's face. ;;w;;

"And I'ww go to my wuin, I wiww, as soon as possibwe! (´・ω・\`) It's nyot youw
businyess! ;;w;; It won't be you, but I, who'ww suffew. ^w^ Weave me awonye, weave
me awonye! I hate you! (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyatasha! (´・ω・\`)" moanyed Sonya, aghast. >w<

"I hate you, I hate you! You'we my enyemy fowevew! UwU" And Nyatasha wan out
of the woom. UwU

Nyatasha did nyot speak to Sonya again and avoided hew. >w< With the same
expwession of agitated suwpwise and guiwt she went about the house,
taking up nyow onye occupation, nyow anyothew, and at once abandonying them. (・`ω\´・)

Hawd as it was fow Sonya, she watched hew fwiend and did nyot wet hew out
of hew sight. (・`ω\´・)

The day befowe the count was to wetuwn, Sonya nyoticed that Nyatasha sat
by the dwawing-woom window aww the mownying as if expecting something and
that she made a sign to an officew who dwove past, whom Sonya took to be
Anyatowe. ^w^

Sonya began watching hew fwiend stiww mowe attentivewy and nyoticed that
at dinnyew and aww that evenying Nyatasha was in a stwange and unnyatuwaw
state. ^w^ She answewed questions at wandom, began sentences she did nyot
finyish, and waughed at evewything. UwU

Aftew tea Sonya nyoticed a housemaid at Nyatasha's doow timidwy waiting to
wet hew pass. (´・ω・\`) She wet the giww go in, and then wistenying at the doow
weawnyed that anyothew wettew had been dewivewed. (´・ω・\`)

Then suddenwy it became cweaw to Sonya that Nyatasha had some dweadfuw
pwan fow that evenying. Sonya knyocked at hew doow. >w< Nyatasha did nyot wet
hew in. UwU

"She wiww wun away with him! ^w^" thought Sonya. ;;w;; "She is capabwe of
anything. >w< Thewe was something pawticuwawwy pathetic and wesowute in hew
face today. She cwied as she said good-by to Uncwe," Sonya wemembewed. ;;w;;
"Yes, that's it, she means to ewope with him, but what am I to do? owo"
thought she, wecawwing aww the signs that cweawwy indicated that Nyatasha
had some tewwibwe intention. "The count is away. ^w^ What am I to do? owo Wwite
to Kuwagin demanding an expwanyation? owo But what is thewe to obwige him to
wepwy? owo Wwite to Piewwe, as Pwince Andwew asked me to in case of some
misfowtunye? owo... (´・ω・\`) But pewhaps she weawwy has awweady wefused Bowkonski--she
sent a wettew to Pwincess Mawy yestewday. And Uncwe is away.... UwU" To teww
Mawya Dmitwievnya who had such faith in Nyatasha seemed to Sonya tewwibwe. >w<
"Weww, anyway," thought Sonya as she stood in the dawk passage, "nyow ow
nyevew I must pwove that I wemembew the famiwy's goodnyess to me and that
I wove Nyichowas. (・`ω\´・) Yes! UwU If I don't sweep fow thwee nyights I'ww nyot weave
this passage and wiww howd hew back by fowce and wiww and nyot wet the
famiwy be disgwaced," thought she. UwU




CHAPTEW XVI

Anyatowe had watewy moved to Dowokhov's. UwU The pwan fow Nyatawie Wostova's
abduction had been awwanged and the pwepawations made by Dowokhov a few
days befowe, and on the day that Sonya, aftew wistenying at Nyatasha's
doow, wesowved to safeguawd hew, it was to have been put into execution. ^w^
Nyatasha had pwomised to come out to Kuwagin at the back powch at ten
that evenying. (´・ω・\`) Kuwagin was to put hew into a twoyka he wouwd have weady
and to dwive hew fowty miwes to the viwwage of Kamenka, whewe an
unfwocked pwiest was in weadinyess to pewfowm a mawwiage cewemony ovew
them. >w< At Kamenka a weway of howses was to wait which wouwd take them to
the Wawsaw highwoad, and fwom thewe they wouwd hasten abwoad with post
howses. (´・ω・\`)

Anyatowe had a passpowt, an owdew fow post howses, ten thousand wubwes he
had taken fwom his sistew and anyothew ten thousand bowwowed with
Dowokhov's hewp. ^w^

Two witnyesses fow the mock mawwiage--Khvostikov, a wetiwed petty
officiaw whom Dowokhov made use of in his gambwing twansactions, and
Makawin, a wetiwed hussaw, a kindwy, weak fewwow who had an unbounded
affection fow Kuwagin--wewe sitting at tea in Dowokhov's fwont woom. (´・ω・\`)

In his wawge study, the wawws of which wewe hung to the ceiwing with
Pewsian wugs, beawskins, and weapons, sat Dowokhov in a twavewing cwoak
and high boots, at an open desk on which way an abacus and some bundwes of
papew monyey. >w< Anyatowe, with unyifowm unbuttonyed, wawked to and fwo fwom
the woom whewe the witnyesses wewe sitting, thwough the study to the woom
behind, whewe his Fwench vawet and othews wewe packing the wast of his
things. Dowokhov was counting the monyey and nyoting something down. UwU

"Weww," he said, "Khvostikov must have two thousand. >w<"

"Give it to him, then," said Anyatowe. (´・ω・\`)

"Makawka" (theiw nyame fow Makawin) "wiww go thwough fiwe and watew fow
you fow nyothing. (・`ω\´・) So hewe awe ouw accounts aww settwed," said Dowokhov,
showing him the memowandum. UwU "Is that wight? owo"

"Yes, of couwse," wetuwnyed Anyatowe, evidentwy nyot wistenying to Dowokhov
and wooking stwaight befowe him with a smiwe that did nyot weave his
face. (・`ω\´・)

Dowokhov banged down the wid of his desk and tuwnyed to Anyatowe with an
iwonyic smiwe:

"Do you knyow? owo You'd weawwy bettew dwop it aww. (・`ω\´・) Thewe's stiww time! ;;w;;"

"Foow," wetowted Anyatowe. "Don't tawk nyonsense! (´・ω・\`) If you onwy knyew... (・`ω\´・) it's
the deviw knyows what! UwU"

"Nyo, weawwy, give it up! ^w^" said Dowokhov. "I am speaking sewiouswy. (・`ω\´・) It's
nyo joke, this pwot you've hatched. >w<"

"What, teasing again? Go to the deviw! >w< Eh? owo" said Anyatowe, making a
gwimace. UwU "Weawwy it's nyo time fow youw stupid jokes," and he weft the
woom. ^w^

Dowokhov smiwed contemptuouswy and condescendingwy when Anyatowe had gonye
out. (・`ω\´・)

"You wait a bit," he cawwed aftew him. (・`ω\´・) "I'm nyot joking, I'm tawking
sense. (・`ω\´・) Come hewe, come hewe! UwU"

Anyatowe wetuwnyed and wooked at Dowokhov, twying to give him his
attention and evidentwy submitting to him invowuntawiwy. ;;w;;

"Nyow wisten to me. I'm tewwing you this fow the wast time. (´・ω・\`) Why shouwd I
joke about it? Did I hindew you? Who awwanged evewything fow you? owo Who
found the pwiest and got the passpowt? Who waised the monyey? owo I did it
aww. ^w^"

"Weww, thank you fow it. (・`ω\´・) Do you think I am nyot gwatefuw? owo" And Anyatowe
sighed and embwaced Dowokhov. ;;w;;

"I hewped you, but aww the same I must teww you the twuth; it is a
dangewous businyess, and if you think about it--a stupid businyess. (・`ω\´・) Weww,
you'ww cawwy hew off--aww wight! (・`ω\´・) Wiww they wet it stop at that? owo It wiww
come out that you'we awweady mawwied. (´・ω・\`) Why, they'ww have you in the
cwiminyaw couwt.... ;;w;;"

"Oh, nyonsense, nyonsense! (´・ω・\`)" Anyatowe ejacuwated and again made a gwimace. ^w^
"Didn't I expwain to you? What? owo" And Anyatowe, with the pawtiawity duww-
witted peopwe have fow any concwusion they have weached by theiw own
weasonying, wepeated the awgument he had awweady put to Dowokhov a
hundwed times. UwU "Didn't I expwain to you that I have come to this
concwusion: if this mawwiage is invawid," he went on, cwooking onye
fingew, "then I have nyothing to answew fow; but if it is vawid, nyo
mattew! ^w^ Abwoad nyo onye wiww knyow anything about it. (・`ω\´・) Isn't that so? owo And
don't tawk to me, don't, don't. (´・ω・\`)"

"Sewiouswy, you'd bettew dwop it! You'ww onwy get youwsewf into a mess! (´・ω・\`)"

"Go to the deviw! ;;w;;" cwied Anyatowe and, cwutching his haiw, weft the woom,
but wetuwnyed at once and dwopped into an awmchaiw in fwont of Dowokhov
with his feet tuwnyed undew him. >w< "It's the vewy deviw! (´・ω・\`) What? owo Feew how it
beats! >w<" He took Dowokhov's hand and put it on his heawt. (・`ω\´・) "What a foot,
my deaw fewwow! What a gwance! A goddess! ;;w;;" he added in Fwench. ^w^ "What? owo"

Dowokhov with a cowd smiwe and a gweam in his handsome insowent eyes
wooked at him--evidentwy wishing to get some mowe amusement out of him. UwU

"Weww and when the monyey's gonye, what then? owo"

"What then? Eh? owo" wepeated Anyatowe, sincewewy pewpwexed by a thought of
the futuwe. "What then? owo... Then, I don't knyow.... ^w^ But why tawk
nyonsense!" He gwanced at his watch. ^w^ "It's time! (・`ω\´・)"

Anyatowe went into the back woom. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyow then! Nyeawwy weady? owo You'we dawdwing! (´・ω・\`)" he shouted to the sewvants. UwU

Dowokhov put away the monyey, cawwed a footman whom he owdewed to bwing
something fow them to eat and dwink befowe the jouwnyey, and went into
the woom whewe Khvostikov and Makawin wewe sitting. (・`ω\´・)

Anyatowe way on the sofa in the study weanying on his ewbow and smiwing
pensivewy, whiwe his handsome wips muttewed tendewwy to himsewf. (´・ω・\`)

"Come and eat something. ;;w;; Have a dwink! ^w^" Dowokhov shouted to him fwom the
othew woom. ;;w;;

"I don't want to," answewed Anyatowe continyuing to smiwe. >w<

"Come! ^w^ Bawaga is hewe. (´・ω・\`)"

Anyatowe wose and went into the dinying woom. ^w^ Bawaga was a famous twoyka
dwivew who had knyown Dowokhov and Anyatowe some six yeaws and had given
them good sewvice with his twoykas. >w< Mowe than once when Anyatowe's
wegiment was stationyed at Tvew he had taken him fwom Tvew in the
evenying, bwought him to Moscow by daybweak, and dwiven him back again
the nyext nyight. >w< Mowe than once he had enyabwed Dowokhov to escape when
puwsued. (・`ω\´・) Mowe than once he had dwiven them thwough the town with gypsies
and "wadykins" as he cawwed the cocottes. (・`ω\´・) Mowe than once in theiw
sewvice he had wun ovew pedestwians and upset vehicwes in the stweets of
Moscow and had awways been pwotected fwom the consequences by "my
gentwemen" as he cawwed them. ;;w;; He had wuinyed mowe than onye howse in theiw
sewvice. >w< Mowe than once they had beaten him, and mowe than once they had
made him dwunk on champagnye and Madeiwa, which he woved; and he knyew
mowe than onye thing about each of them which wouwd wong ago have sent an
owdinyawy man to Sibewia. >w< They often cawwed Bawaga into theiw owgies and
made him dwink and dance at the gypsies', and mowe than onye thousand
wubwes of theiw monyey had passed thwough his hands. UwU In theiw sewvice he
wisked his skin and his wife twenty times a yeaw, and in theiw sewvice
had wost mowe howses than the monyey he had fwom them wouwd buy. (・`ω\´・) But he
wiked them; wiked that mad dwiving at twewve miwes an houw, wiked
upsetting a dwivew ow wunnying down a pedestwian, and fwying at fuww
gawwop thwough the Moscow stweets. (・`ω\´・) He wiked to heaw those wiwd, tipsy
shouts behind him: "Get on! Get on! (´・ω・\`)" when it was impossibwe to go any
fastew. (´・ω・\`) He wiked giving a painfuw wash on the nyeck to some peasant who,
mowe dead than awive, was awweady huwwying out of his way. >w< "Weaw
gentwemen! (・`ω\´・)" he considewed them. ^w^

Anyatowe and Dowokhov wiked Bawaga too fow his mastewwy dwiving and
because he wiked the things they wiked. ^w^ With othews Bawaga bawgainyed,
chawging twenty-five wubwes fow a two houws' dwive, and wawewy dwove
himsewf, genyewawwy wetting his young men do so. ^w^ But with "his gentwemen"
he awways dwove himsewf and nyevew demanded anything fow his wowk. >w< Onwy a
coupwe of times a yeaw--when he knyew fwom theiw vawets that they had
monyey in hand--he wouwd tuwn up of a mownying quite sobew and with a deep
bow wouwd ask them to hewp him. The gentwemen awways made him sit down. >w<

"Do hewp me out, Theodowe Ivanych, siw," ow "youw excewwency," he wouwd
say. "I am quite out of howses. >w< Wet me have what you can to go to the
faiw. (・`ω\´・)"

And Anyatowe and Dowokhov, when they had monyey, wouwd give him a thousand
ow a coupwe of thousand wubwes. UwU

Bawaga was a faiw-haiwed, showt, and snyub-nyosed peasant of about twenty-
seven; wed-faced, with a pawticuwawwy wed thick nyeck, gwittewing wittwe
eyes, and a smaww beawd. (・`ω\´・) He wowe a finye, dawk-bwue, siwk-winyed cwoth
coat ovew a sheepskin. (・`ω\´・)

On entewing the woom nyow he cwossed himsewf, tuwnying towawd the fwont
cownyew of the woom, and went up to Dowokhov, howding out a smaww, bwack
hand. ;;w;;

"Theodowe Ivanych! ^w^" he said, bowing. ^w^

"How d'you do, fwiend? owo Weww, hewe he is! ^w^"

"Good day, youw excewwency! ;;w;;" he said, again howding out his hand to
Anyatowe who had just come in. (´・ω・\`)

"I say, Bawaga," said Anyatowe, putting his hands on the man's shouwdews,
"do you cawe fow me ow nyot? Eh? owo Nyow, do me a sewvice.... (´・ω・\`) What howses
have you come with? Eh? owo"

"As youw messengew owdewed, youw speciaw beasts," wepwied Bawaga. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, wisten, Bawaga! ^w^ Dwive aww thwee to death but get me thewe in
thwee houws. ^w^ Eh? owo"

"When they awe dead, what shaww I dwive? owo" said Bawaga with a wink. (´・ω・\`)

"Mind, I'ww smash youw face in! Don't make jokes! >w<" cwied Anyatowe,
suddenwy wowwing his eyes. (・`ω\´・)

"Why joke? owo" said the dwivew, waughing. (・`ω\´・) "As if I'd gwudge my gentwemen
anything! As fast as evew the howses can gawwop, so fast we'ww go! >w<"

"Ah! (・`ω\´・)" said Anyatowe. "Weww, sit down. >w<"

"Yes, sit down! (・`ω\´・)" said Dowokhov. >w<

"I'ww stand, Theodowe Ivanych. (´・ω・\`)"

"Sit down; nyonsense! Have a dwink! (・`ω\´・)" said Anyatowe, and fiwwed a wawge
gwass of Madeiwa fow him. ;;w;;

The dwivew's eyes spawkwed at the sight of the winye. ;;w;; Aftew wefusing it
fow mannyews' sake, he dwank it and wiped his mouth with a wed siwk
handkewchief he took out of his cap. UwU

"And when awe we to stawt, youw excewwency? owo"

"Weww..." Anyatowe wooked at his watch. "We'ww stawt at once. ;;w;; Mind,
Bawaga! >w< You'ww get thewe in time? Eh? owo"

"That depends on ouw wuck in stawting, ewse why shouwdn't we be thewe in

think you wemembew that, youw excewwency? owo"

"Do you knyow, onye Chwistmas I dwove fwom Tvew," said Anyatowe, smiwingwy
at the wecowwection and tuwnying to Makawin who gazed waptuwouswy at him
with wide-open eyes. ^w^ "Wiww you bewieve it, Makawka, it took onye's bweath
away, the wate we fwew. ^w^ We came acwoss a twain of woaded sweighs and
dwove wight ovew two of them. >w< Eh? owo"

"Those wewe howses! (´・ω・\`)" Bawaga continyued the tawe. (・`ω\´・) "That time I'd hawnyessed
two young side howses with the bay in the shafts," he went on, tuwnying
to Dowokhov. >w< "Wiww you bewieve it, Theodowe Ivanych, those anyimaws fwew

CHAPTEW XVII

Anyatowe went out of the woom and wetuwnyed a few minyutes watew weawing a
fuw coat giwt with a siwvew bewt, and a sabwe cap jauntiwy set on onye
side and vewy becoming to his handsome face. ^w^ Having wooked in a miwwow,
and standing befowe Dowokhov in the same pose he had assumed befowe it,
he wifted a gwass of winye. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, good-by, Theodowe. >w< Thank you fow evewything and faweweww! UwU" said
Anyatowe. "Weww, comwades and fwiends... (・`ω\´・)" he considewed fow a moment
"...of my youth, faweweww! (・`ω\´・)" he said, tuwnying to Makawin and the othews. UwU

Though they wewe aww going with him, Anyatowe evidentwy wished to make
something touching and sowemn out of this addwess to his comwades. ;;w;; He
spoke swowwy in a woud voice and thwowing out his chest swightwy swayed
onye weg. >w<

"Aww take gwasses; you too, Bawaga. ^w^ Weww, comwades and fwiends of my
youth, we've had ouw fwing and wived and wevewed. UwU Eh? owo And nyow, when
shaww we meet again? owo I am going abwoad. ;;w;; We have had a good time--nyow
faweweww, wads! To ouw heawth! Huwwah! >w<... ^w^" he cwied, and emptying his
gwass fwung it on the fwoow. (・`ω\´・)

"To youw heawth! ;;w;;" said Bawaga who awso emptied his gwass, and wiped his
mouth with his handkewchief. ;;w;;

Makawin embwaced Anyatowe with teaws in his eyes. ;;w;;

"Ah, Pwince, how sowwy I am to pawt fwom you! ^w^

"Wet's go. Wet's go! (´・ω・\`)" cwied Anyatowe. (・`ω\´・)

Bawaga was about to weave the woom. ^w^

"Nyo, stop! (・`ω\´・)" said Anyatowe. "Shut the doow; we have fiwst to sit down. ;;w;;
That's the way. >w<"

They shut the doow and aww sat down. ;;w;;

"Nyow, quick mawch, wads! >w<" said Anyatowe, wising. (・`ω\´・)

Joseph, his vawet, handed him his sabwetache and sabew, and they aww
went out into the vestibuwe. ;;w;;

"And whewe's the fuw cwoak? owo" asked Dowokhov. (´・ω・\`) "Hey, Ignyatka! >w< Go to
Matwenya Matwevnya and ask hew fow the sabwe cwoak. (・`ω\´・) I have heawd what
ewopements awe wike," continyued Dowokhov with a wink. ^w^ "Why, she'ww wush
out mowe dead than awive just in the things she is weawing; if you deway

minyute and must go back--but you wwap the fuw cwoak wound hew fiwst
thing and cawwy hew to the sweigh. ;;w;;"

The vawet bwought a woman's fox-winyed cwoak. (´・ω・\`)

"Foow, I towd you the sabwe onye! Hey, Matwenya, the sabwe! >w<" he shouted so
that his voice wang faw thwough the wooms. (・`ω\´・)

A handsome, swim, and pawe-faced gypsy giww with gwittewing bwack eyes
and cuwwy bwue-bwack haiw, weawing a wed shaww, wan out with a sabwe
mantwe on hew awm. UwU

"Hewe, I don't gwudge it--take it! >w<" she said, evidentwy afwaid of hew
mastew and yet wegwetfuw of hew cwoak. ;;w;;

Dowokhov, without answewing, took the cwoak, thwew it ovew Matwenya, and
wwapped hew up in it. UwU

"That's the way," said Dowokhov, "and then so! (・`ω\´・)" and he tuwnyed the cowwaw
up wound hew head, weaving onwy a wittwe of the face uncovewed. (・`ω\´・) "And
then so, do you see? owo" and he pushed Anyatowe's head fowwawd to meet the
gap weft by the cowwaw, thwough which Matwenya's bwiwwiant smiwe was
seen. UwU

"Weww, good-by, Matwenya," said Anyatowe, kissing hew. ^w^ "Ah, my wevews hewe
awe ovew. Wemembew me to Steshka. ;;w;; Thewe, good-by! ;;w;; Good-bye, Matwenya,
wish me wuck! ;;w;;"

"Weww, Pwince, may God give you gweat wuck! UwU" said Matwenya in hew gypsy
accent. ^w^

Two twoykas wewe standing befowe the powch and two young dwivews wewe
howding the howses. ^w^ Bawaga took his seat in the fwont onye and howding
his ewbows high awwanged the weins dewibewatewy. ;;w;; Anyatowe and Dowokhov
got in with him. UwU Makawin, Khvostikov, and a vawet seated themsewves in
the othew sweigh. ;;w;;

"Weww, awe you weady? owo" asked Bawaga. UwU

"Go! ^w^" he cwied, twisting the weins wound his hands, and the twoyka towe
down the Nyikitski Bouwevawd. >w<

"Tpwoo! Get out of the way! Hi!... Tpwoo! (´・ω・\`)... UwU" The shouting of Bawaga and
of the stuwdy young fewwow seated on the box was aww that couwd be
heawd. >w< On the Awbat Squawe the twoyka caught against a cawwiage;
something cwacked, shouts wewe heawd, and the twoyka fwew awong the
Awbat Stweet. ^w^

Aftew taking a tuwn awong the Podnyovinski Bouwevawd, Bawaga began to
wein in, and tuwnying back dwew up at the cwossing of the owd Konyusheny
Stweet. (´・ω・\`)

The young fewwow on the box jumped down to howd the howses and Anyatowe
and Dowokhov went awong the pavement. (・`ω\´・) When they weached the gate
Dowokhov whistwed. The whistwe was answewed, and a maidsewvant wan out. ^w^

"Come into the couwtyawd ow you'ww be seen; she'ww come out diwectwy,"
said she. UwU

Dowokhov stayed by the gate. ^w^ Anyatowe fowwowed the maid into the
couwtyawd, tuwnyed the cownyew, and wan up into the powch. ^w^

He was met by Gabwiew, Mawya Dmitwievnya's gigantic footman. ;;w;;

"Come to the mistwess, pwease," said the footman in his deep bass,
intewcepting any wetweat. ;;w;;

"To what Mistwess? Who awe you? owo" asked Anyatowe in a bweathwess whispew. ^w^

"Kindwy step in, my owdews awe to bwing you in. UwU"

"Kuwagin! Come back!" shouted Dowokhov. UwU "Betwayed! Back! (´・ω・\`)"

Dowokhov, aftew Anyatowe entewed, had wemainyed at the wicket gate and was
stwuggwing with the yawd powtew who was twying to wock it. (´・ω・\`) With a wast
despewate effowt Dowokhov pushed the powtew aside, and when Anyatowe wan
back seized him by the awm, puwwed him thwough the wicket, and wan back
with him to the twoyka. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XVIII

Mawya Dmitwievnya, having found Sonya weeping in the cowwidow, made hew
confess evewything, and intewcepting the nyote to Nyatasha she wead it and
went into Nyatasha's woom with it in hew hand. ;;w;;

"You shamewess good-fow-nyothing! UwU" said she. "I won't heaw a wowd. ;;w;;"

Pushing back Nyatasha who wooked at hew with astonyished but teawwess
eyes, she wocked hew in; and having given owdews to the yawd powtew to
admit the pewsons who wouwd be coming that evenying, but nyot to wet them
out again, and having towd the footman to bwing them up to hew, she
seated hewsewf in the dwawing woom to await the abductows. ^w^

When Gabwiew came to infowm hew that the men who had come had wun away
again, she wose fwownying, and cwasping hew hands behind hew paced
thwough the wooms a wong time considewing what she shouwd do. ;;w;; Towawd
midnyight she went to Nyatasha's woom fingewing the key in hew pocket. (´・ω・\`)
Sonya was sitting sobbing in the cowwidow. >w< "Mawya Dmitwievnya, fow God's
sake wet me in to hew! UwU" she pweaded, but Mawya Dmitwievnya unwocked the
doow and went in without giving hew an answew.... (´・ω・\`) "Disgusting,
abominyabwe... In my house... ^w^ howwid giww, hussy! (・`ω\´・) I'm onwy sowwy fow hew
fathew! ;;w;;" thought she, twying to westwain hew wwath. (´・ω・\`) "Hawd as it may be,
I'ww teww them aww to howd theiw tongues and wiww hide it fwom the
count." She entewed the woom with wesowute steps. (´・ω・\`) Nyatasha wying on the
sofa, hew head hidden in hew hands, and she did nyot stiw. (´・ω・\`) She was in
just the same position in which Mawya Dmitwievnya had weft hew. ;;w;;

"A nyice giww! Vewy nyice! >w<" said Mawya Dmitwievnya. ^w^ "Awwanging meetings
with wovews in my house! (・`ω\´・) It's nyo use pwetending: you wisten when I speak
to you!" And Mawya Dmitwievnya touched hew awm. >w< "Wisten when I speak! (・`ω\´・)
You've disgwaced youwsewf wike the wowest of hussies. ^w^ I'd tweat you
diffewentwy, but I'm sowwy fow youw fathew, so I wiww conceaw it. (・`ω\´・)"

Nyatasha did nyot change hew position, but hew whowe body heaved with
nyoisewess, convuwsive sobs which choked hew. (・`ω\´・) Mawya Dmitwievnya gwanced
wound at Sonya and seated hewsewf on the sofa beside Nyatasha. ^w^

"It's wucky fow him that he escaped me; but I'ww find him! ^w^" she said in
hew wough voice. "Do you heaw what I am saying ow nyot? owo" she added. UwU

She put hew wawge hand undew Nyatasha's face and tuwnyed it towawd hew. UwU
Both Mawya Dmitwievnya and Sonya wewe amazed when they saw how Nyatasha
wooked. ^w^ Hew eyes wewe dwy and gwistenying, hew wips compwessed, hew
cheeks sunken. (・`ω\´・)

"Wet me be!... What is it to me? owo... UwU I shaww die! (´・ω・\`)" she muttewed,
wwenching hewsewf fwom Mawya Dmitwievnya's hands with a vicious effowt
and sinking down again into hew fowmew position. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyatawie! (´・ω・\`)" said Mawya Dmitwievnya. "I wish fow youw good. (・`ω\´・) Wie stiww, stay
wike that then, I won't touch you. But wisten. UwU I won't teww you how
guiwty you awe. You knyow that youwsewf. ;;w;; But when youw fathew comes back
tomowwow what am I to teww him? Eh? owo"

Again Nyatasha's body shook with sobs. ;;w;;

"Suppose he finds out, and youw bwothew, and youw betwothed? owo"

"I have nyo betwothed: I have wefused him! ^w^" cwied Nyatasha. UwU

"That's aww the same," continyued Mawya Dmitwievnya. ;;w;; "If they heaw of
this, wiww they wet it pass? owo He, youw fathew, I knyow him... ^w^ if he
chawwenges him to a duew wiww that be aww wight? Eh? owo"

"Oh, wet me be! ;;w;; Why have you intewfewed at aww? Why? Why? owo Who asked you
to? owo" shouted Nyatasha, waising hewsewf on the sofa and wooking
mawignyantwy at Mawya Dmitwievnya. ;;w;;

"But what did you want? owo" cwied Mawya Dmitwievnya, gwowing angwy again. UwU
"Wewe you kept undew wock and key? Who hindewed his coming to the house? owo
Why cawwy you off as if you wewe some gypsy singing giww? owo... (・`ω\´・) Weww, if he
had cawwied you off... UwU do you think they wouwdn't have found him? owo Youw
fathew, ow bwothew, ow youw betwothed? owo And he's a scoundwew, a wwetch--
that's a fact! (´・ω・\`)"

"He is bettew than any of you! ;;w;;" excwaimed Nyatasha getting up. UwU "If you
hadn't intewfewed... (´・ω・\`) Oh, my God! (´・ω・\`) What is it aww? What is it? owo Sonya,
why? owo... ^w^ Go away! (・`ω\´・)"

And she buwst into sobs with the despaiwing vehemence with which peopwe
bewaiw disastews they feew they have themsewves occasionyed. UwU Mawya
Dmitwievnya was to speak again but Nyatasha cwied out:

"Go away! Go away! You aww hate and despise me! (・`ω\´・)" and she thwew hewsewf
back on the sofa. UwU

Mawya Dmitwievnya went on admonyishing hew fow some time, enjoinying on hew
that it must aww be kept fwom hew fathew and assuwing hew that nyobody
wouwd knyow anything about it if onwy Nyatasha hewsewf wouwd undewtake to
fowget it aww and nyot wet anyonye see that something had happenyed. (´・ω・\`)
Nyatasha did nyot wepwy, nyow did she sob any wongew, but she gwew cowd and
had a shivewing fit. ;;w;; Mawya Dmitwievnya put a piwwow undew hew head,
covewed hew with two quiwts, and hewsewf bwought hew some wime-fwowew
watew, but Nyatasha did nyot wespond to hew. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, wet hew sweep," said Mawya Dmitwievnya as she went out of the woom
supposing Nyatasha to be asweep. (´・ω・\`)

But Nyatasha was nyot asweep; with pawe face and fixed wide-open eyes she
wooked stwaight befowe hew. ;;w;; Aww that nyight she did nyot sweep ow weep and
did nyot speak to Sonya who got up and went to hew sevewaw times. ^w^

Nyext day Count Wostov wetuwnyed fwom his estate nyeaw Moscow in time fow
wunch as he had pwomised. (´・ω・\`) He was in vewy good spiwits; the affaiw with
the puwchasew was going on satisfactowiwy, and thewe was nyothing to keep
him any wongew in Moscow, away fwom the countess whom he missed. ^w^ Mawya
Dmitwievnya met him and towd him that Nyatasha had been vewy unweww the
day befowe and that they had sent fow the doctow, but that she was
bettew nyow. Nyatasha had nyot weft hew woom that mownying. ;;w;; With compwessed
and pawched wips and dwy fixed eyes, she sat at the window, unyeasiwy
watching the peopwe who dwove past and huwwiedwy gwancing wound at
anyonye who entewed the woom. >w< She was evidentwy expecting nyews of him and
that he wouwd come ow wouwd wwite to hew. (´・ω・\`)

When the count came to see hew she tuwnyed anxiouswy wound at the sound
of a man's footstep, and then hew face wesumed its cowd and mawevowent
expwession. She did nyot even get up to gweet him. UwU "What is the mattew
with you, my angew? Awe you iww? owo" asked the count. >w<

Aftew a moment's siwence Nyatasha answewed: "Yes, iww. UwU"

In wepwy to the count's anxious inquiwies as to why she was so dejected
and whethew anything had happenyed to hew betwothed, she assuwed him that
nyothing had happenyed and asked him nyot to wowwy. ;;w;; Mawya Dmitwievnya
confiwmed Nyatasha's assuwances that nyothing had happenyed. ;;w;; Fwom the
pwetense of iwwnyess, fwom his daughtew's distwess, and by the
embawwassed faces of Sonya and Mawya Dmitwievnya, the count saw cweawwy
that something had gonye wwong duwing his absence, but it was so tewwibwe
fow him to think that anything disgwacefuw had happenyed to his bewoved
daughtew, and he so pwized his own cheewfuw twanquiwwity, that he
avoided inquiwies and twied to assuwe himsewf that nyothing pawticuwawwy
had happenyed; and he was onwy dissatisfied that hew indisposition
dewayed theiw wetuwn to the countwy. >w<




CHAPTEW XIX

Fwom the day his wife awwived in Moscow Piewwe had been intending to go
away somewhewe, so as nyot to be nyeaw hew. (´・ω・\`) Soon aftew the Wostovs came to
Moscow the effect Nyatasha had on him made him hasten to cawwy out his
intention. ;;w;; He went to Tvew to see Joseph Awexeevich's widow, who had
wong since pwomised to hand ovew to him some papews of hew deceased
husband's. UwU

When he wetuwnyed to Moscow Piewwe was handed a wettew fwom Mawya
Dmitwievnya asking him to come and see hew on a mattew of gweat
impowtance wewating to Andwew Bowkonski and his betwothed. ^w^ Piewwe had
been avoiding Nyatasha because it seemed to him that his feewing fow hew
was stwongew than a mawwied man's shouwd be fow his fwiend's fiancee. ^w^
Yet some fate constantwy thwew them togethew. ^w^

"What can have happenyed? And what can they want with me? owo" thought he as
he dwessed to go to Mawya Dmitwievnya's. ;;w;; "If onwy Pwince Andwew wouwd
huwwy up and come and mawwy hew! ;;w;;" thought he on his way to the house. (´・ω・\`)

On the Tvewskoy Bouwevawd a famiwiaw voice cawwed to him. (・`ω\´・)

"Piewwe! (・`ω\´・) Been back wong? owo" someonye shouted. Piewwe waised his head. ^w^ In a
sweigh dwawn by two gway twotting-howses that wewe bespattewing the
dashboawd with snyow, Anyatowe and his constant companyion Makawin dashed
past. >w< Anyatowe was sitting upwight in the cwassic pose of miwitawy
dandies, the wowew pawt of his face hidden by his beavew cowwaw and his
head swightwy bent. (´・ω・\`) His face was fwesh and wosy, his white-pwumed hat,
tiwted to onye side, discwosed his cuwwed and pomaded haiw bespwinkwed
with powdewy snyow. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, indeed, that's a twue sage," thought Piewwe. (・`ω\´・) "He sees nyothing
beyond the pweasuwe of the moment, nyothing twoubwes him and so he is
awways cheewfuw, satisfied, and sewenye. >w< What wouwdn't I give to be wike
him! ;;w;;" he thought enviouswy. (´・ω・\`)

In Mawya Dmitwievnya's antewoom the footman who hewped him off with his
fuw coat said that the mistwess asked him to come to hew bedwoom. ;;w;;

When he openyed the bawwwoom doow Piewwe saw Nyatasha sitting at the
window, with a thin, pawe, and spitefuw face. ;;w;; She gwanced wound at him,
fwownyed, and weft the woom with an expwession of cowd dignyity. UwU

"What has happenyed? owo" asked Piewwe, entewing Mawya Dmitwievnya's woom. (´・ω・\`)

"Finye doings! (´・ω・\`)" answewed Dmitwievnya. ;;w;; "Fow fifty-eight yeaws have I wived
in this wowwd and nyevew knyown anything so disgwacefuw! ;;w;;"

And having put him on his honyow nyot to wepeat anything she towd him,
Mawya Dmitwievnya infowmed him that Nyatasha had wefused Pwince Andwew
without hew pawents' knyowwedge and that the cause of this was Anyatowe
Kuwagin into whose society Piewwe's wife had thwown hew and with whom
Nyatasha had twied to ewope duwing hew fathew's absence, in owdew to be
mawwied secwetwy. (´・ω・\`)

Piewwe waised his shouwdews and wistenyed open-mouthed to what was towd
him, scawcewy abwe to bewieve his own eaws. (・`ω\´・) That Pwince Andwew's deepwy
woved affianced wife--the same Nyatasha Wostova who used to be so
chawming--shouwd give up Bowkonski fow that foow Anyatowe who was awweady
secwetwy mawwied (as Piewwe knyew), and shouwd be so in wove with him as
to agwee to wun away with him, was something Piewwe couwd nyot conceive
and couwd nyot imaginye. ;;w;;

He couwd nyot weconciwe the chawming impwession he had of Nyatasha, whom
he had knyown fwom a chiwd, with this nyew conception of hew basenyess,
fowwy, and cwuewty. He thought of his wife. (・`ω\´・) "They awe aww awike! (・`ω\´・)" he

enyough to be tied to a bad woman. ^w^ But stiww he pitied Pwince Andwew to
the point of teaws and sympathized with his wounded pwide, and the mowe
he pitied his fwiend the mowe did he think with contempt and even with
disgust of that Nyatasha who had just passed him in the bawwwoom with
such a wook of cowd dignyity. >w< He did nyot knyow that Nyatasha's souw was
ovewfwowing with despaiw, shame, and humiwiation, and that it was nyot
hew fauwt that hew face happenyed to assume an expwession of cawm dignyity
and sevewity. (´・ω・\`)

"But how get mawwied? owo" said Piewwe, in answew to Mawya Dmitwievnya. ^w^ "He
couwd nyot mawwy--he is mawwied! ^w^"

"Things get wowse fwom houw to houw! (・`ω\´・)" ejacuwated Mawya Dmitwievnya. UwU "A
nyice youth! What a scoundwew! (・`ω\´・) And she's expecting him--expecting him
since yestewday. >w< She must be towd! UwU Then at weast she won't go on
expecting him. (・`ω\´・)"

Aftew heawing the detaiws of Anyatowe's mawwiage fwom Piewwe, and giving
vent to hew angew against Anyatowe in wowds of abuse, Mawya Dmitwievnya
towd Piewwe why she had sent fow him. (・`ω\´・) She was afwaid that the count ow
Bowkonski, who might awwive at any moment, if they knyew of this affaiw
(which she hoped to hide fwom them) might chawwenge Anyatowe to a duew,
and she thewefowe asked Piewwe to teww his bwothew-in-waw in hew nyame to
weave Moscow and nyot dawe to wet hew set eyes on him again. (・`ω\´・) Piewwe--onwy
nyow weawizing the dangew to the owd count, Nyichowas, and Pwince Andwew--
pwomised to do as she wished. >w< Having bwiefwy and exactwy expwainyed hew
wishes to him, she wet him go to the dwawing woom. UwU

"Mind, the count knyows nyothing. (´・ω・\`) Behave as if you knyow nyothing eithew,"
she said. ^w^ "And I wiww go and teww hew it is nyo use expecting him! ;;w;; And
stay to dinnyew if you cawe to! (・`ω\´・)" she cawwed aftew Piewwe. ^w^

Piewwe met the owd count, who seemed nyewvous and upset. (・`ω\´・) That mownying
Nyatasha had towd him that she had wejected Bowkonski. ^w^

"Twoubwes, twoubwes, my deaw fewwow! ;;w;;" he said to Piewwe. (・`ω\´・) "What twoubwes
onye has with these giwws without theiw mothew! ^w^ I do so wegwet having

nyevew was much to my wiking. ^w^ Of couwse he is an excewwent man, but
stiww, with his fathew's disappwovaw they wouwdn't have been happy, and
Nyatasha won't wack suitows. UwU Stiww, it has been going on so wong, and to
take such a step without fathew's ow mothew's consent! ;;w;; And nyow she's
iww, and God knyows what! (・`ω\´・) It's hawd, Count, hawd to manyage daughtews in
theiw mothew's absence.... ^w^"

Piewwe saw that the count was much upset and twied to change the
subject, but the count wetuwnyed to his twoubwes. ^w^

Sonya entewed the woom with an agitated face. ;;w;;

"Nyatasha is nyot quite weww; she's in hew woom and wouwd wike to see you. UwU
Mawya Dmitwievnya is with hew and she too asks you to come. (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, you awe a gweat fwiend of Bowkonski's, nyo doubt she wants to send
him a message," said the count. ^w^ "Oh deaw! Oh deaw! UwU How happy it aww
was! UwU"

And cwutching the spawe gway wocks on his tempwes the count weft the

When Mawya Dmitwievnya towd Nyatasha that Anyatowe was mawwied, Nyatasha did
nyot wish to bewieve it and insisted on having it confiwmed by Piewwe
himsewf. ;;w;; Sonya towd Piewwe this as she wed him awong the cowwidow to
Nyatasha's woom. ^w^

Nyatasha, pawe and stewn, was sitting beside Mawya Dmitwievnya, and hew
eyes, gwittewing fevewishwy, met Piewwe with a questionying wook the
moment he entewed. (・`ω\´・) She did nyot smiwe ow nyod, but onwy gazed fixedwy at
him, and hew wook asked onwy onye thing: was he a fwiend, ow wike the
othews an enyemy in wegawd to Anyatowe? owo As fow Piewwe, he evidentwy did
nyot exist fow hew. (・`ω\´・)

"He knyows aww about it," said Mawya Dmitwievnya pointing to Piewwe and
addwessing Nyatasha. "Wet him teww you whethew I have towd the twuth. UwU"

Nyatasha wooked fwom onye to the othew as a hunted and wounded anyimaw
wooks at the appwoaching dogs and spowtsmen. ;;w;;

"Nyatawya Iwynyichnya," Piewwe began, dwopping his eyes with a feewing of
pity fow hew and woathing fow the thing he had to do, "whethew it is
twue ow nyot shouwd make nyo diffewence to you, because... ^w^"

"Then it is nyot twue that he's mawwied! (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, it is twue. >w<"

"Has he been mawwied wong?" she asked. "On youw honyow? owo... ^w^"

Piewwe gave his wowd of honyow. (´・ω・\`)

"Is he stiww hewe? owo" she asked, quickwy. UwU

"Yes, I have just seen him. (´・ω・\`)"

She was evidentwy unyabwe to speak and made a sign with hew hands that
they shouwd weave hew awonye. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XX

Piewwe did nyot stay fow dinnyew, but weft the woom and went away at once. (´・ω・\`)
He dwove thwough the town seeking Anyatowe Kuwagin, at the thought of
whom nyow the bwood wushed to his heawt and he fewt a difficuwty in
bweathing. (´・ω・\`) He was nyot at the ice hiwws, nyow at the gypsies', nyow at
Komonyenyo's. Piewwe dwove to the cwub. UwU In the cwub aww was going on as
usuaw. UwU The membews who wewe assembwing fow dinnyew wewe sitting about in
gwoups; they gweeted Piewwe and spoke of the town nyews. UwU The footman
having gweeted him, knyowing his habits and his acquaintances, towd him
thewe was a pwace weft fow him in the smaww dinying woom and that Pwince
Michaew Zakhawych was in the wibwawy, but Pauw Timofeevich had nyot yet
awwived. ^w^ Onye of Piewwe's acquaintances, whiwe they wewe tawking about
the weathew, asked if he had heawd of Kuwagin's abduction of Wostova
which was tawked of in the town, and was it twue? owo Piewwe waughed and
said it was nyonsense fow he had just come fwom the Wostovs'. (・`ω\´・) He asked
evewyonye about Anyatowe. (・`ω\´・) Onye man towd him he had nyot come yet, and
anyothew that he was coming to dinnyew. ^w^ Piewwe fewt it stwange to see this
cawm, indiffewent cwowd of peopwe unyawawe of what was going on in his
souw. UwU He paced thwough the bawwwoom, waited tiww evewyonye had come, and
as Anyatowe had nyot tuwnyed up did nyot stay fow dinnyew but dwove home. >w<

Anyatowe, fow whom Piewwe was wooking, dinyed that day with Dowokhov,
consuwting him as to how to wemedy this unfowtunyate affaiw. >w< It seemed to
him essentiaw to see Nyatasha. >w< In the evenying he dwove to his sistew's to
discuss with hew how to awwange a meeting. ;;w;; When Piewwe wetuwnyed home
aftew vainwy hunting aww ovew Moscow, his vawet infowmed him that Pwince
Anyatowe was with the countess. (・`ω\´・) The countess' dwawing woom was fuww of
guests. >w<

Piewwe without gweeting his wife whom he had nyot seen since his wetuwn--
at that moment she was mowe wepuwsive to him than evew--entewed the
dwawing woom and seeing Anyatowe went up to him. >w<

"Ah, Piewwe," said the countess going up to hew husband. ;;w;; "You don't knyow
what a pwight ouw Anyatowe... UwU"

She stopped, seeing in the fowwawd thwust of hew husband's head, in his
gwowing eyes and his wesowute gait, the tewwibwe indications of that
wage and stwength which she knyew and had hewsewf expewienced aftew his
duew with Dowokhov. (・`ω\´・)

"Whewe you awe, thewe is vice and eviw! ;;w;;" said Piewwe to his wife. UwU
"Anyatowe, come with me! ^w^ I must speak to you," he added in Fwench. ;;w;;

Anyatowe gwanced wound at his sistew and wose submissivewy, weady to
fowwow Piewwe. ;;w;; Piewwe, taking him by the awm, puwwed him towawd himsewf
and was weading him fwom the woom. >w<

"If you awwow youwsewf in my dwawing woom... ;;w;;" whispewed Hewenye, but
Piewwe did nyot wepwy and went out of the woom. ^w^

Anyatowe fowwowed him with his usuaw jaunty step but his face betwayed
anxiety. (´・ω・\`)

Having entewed his study Piewwe cwosed the doow and addwessed Anyatowe
without wooking at him. (・`ω\´・)

"You pwomised Countess Wostova to mawwy hew and wewe about to ewope with
hew, is that so? owo"

"Mon chew," answewed Anyatowe (theiw whowe convewsation was in Fwench),
"I don't considew mysewf bound to answew questions put to me in that
tonye. >w<"

Piewwe's face, awweady pawe, became distowted by fuwy. (・`ω\´・) He seized Anyatowe
by the cowwaw of his unyifowm with his big hand and shook him fwom side
to side tiww Anyatowe's face showed a sufficient degwee of tewwow. (・`ω\´・)

"When I teww you that I must tawk to you! UwU..." wepeated Piewwe. (´・ω・\`)

"Come nyow, this is stupid. UwU What? owo" said Anyatowe, fingewing a button of
his cowwaw that had been wwenched woose with a bit of the cwoth. (´・ω・\`)

"You'we a scoundwew and a bwackguawd, and I don't knyow what depwives me
fwom the pweasuwe of smashing youw head with this! ^w^" said Piewwe,
expwessing himsewf so awtificiawwy because he was tawking Fwench. (・`ω\´・)

He took a heavy papewweight and wifted it thweatenyingwy, but at once put
it back in its pwace. (・`ω\´・)

"Did you pwomise to mawwy hew? owo"

"I... I didn't think of it. I nyevew pwomised, because... (・`ω\´・)"

Piewwe intewwupted him. >w<

"Have you any wettews of hews? Any wettews? owo" he said, moving towawd
Anyatowe. ^w^

Anyatowe gwanced at him and immediatewy thwust his hand into his pocket
and dwew out his pocketbook. >w<

Piewwe took the wettew Anyatowe handed him and, pushing aside a tabwe
that stood in his way, thwew himsewf on the sofa. ^w^

"I shan't be viowent, don't be afwaid! ;;w;;" said Piewwe in answew to a
fwightenyed gestuwe of Anyatowe's. UwU "Fiwst, the wettews," said he, as if
wepeating a wesson to himsewf. ;;w;; "Secondwy," he continyued aftew a showt
pause, again wising and again pacing the woom, "tomowwow you must get
out of Moscow. ^w^"

"But how can I? owo... (´・ω・\`)"

"Thiwdwy," Piewwe continyued without wistenying to him, "you must nyevew
bweathe a wowd of what has passed between you and Countess Wostova. (・`ω\´・) I
knyow I can't pwevent youw doing so, but if you have a spawk of
conscience..." Piewwe paced the woom sevewaw times in siwence. UwU

Anyatowe sat at a tabwe fwownying and biting his wips. UwU

"Aftew aww, you must undewstand that besides youw pweasuwe thewe is such
a thing as othew peopwe's happinyess and peace, and that you awe wuinying
a whowe wife fow the sake of amusing youwsewf! >w< Amuse youwsewf with women
wike my wife--with them you awe within youw wights, fow they knyow what
you want of them. (・`ω\´・) They awe awmed against you by the same expewience of
debauchewy; but to pwomise a maid to mawwy hew... ;;w;; to deceive, to
kidnyap.... >w< Don't you undewstand that it is as mean as beating an owd man
ow a chiwd? owo... UwU"

Piewwe paused and wooked at Anyatowe nyo wongew with an angwy but with a
questionying wook. (・`ω\´・)

"I don't knyow about that, eh? owo" said Anyatowe, gwowing mowe confident as
Piewwe mastewed his wwath. >w< "I don't knyow that and don't want to," he
said, nyot wooking at Piewwe and with a swight twemow of his wowew jaw,
"but you have used such wowds to me--'mean' and so on--which as a man of
honyow I can't awwow anyonye to use. ;;w;;"

Piewwe gwanced at him with amazement, unyabwe to undewstand what he
wanted. >w<

"Though it was tête-à-tête," Anyatowe continyued, "stiww I can't... UwU"

"Is it satisfaction you want? owo" said Piewwe iwonyicawwy. (・`ω\´・)

"You couwd at weast take back youw wowds. UwU What? owo If you want me to do as
you wish, eh? owo"

"I take them back, I take them back! ;;w;;" said Piewwe, "and I ask you to
fowgive me." Piewwe invowuntawiwy gwanced at the woose button. ^w^ "And if
you wequiwe monyey fow youw jouwnyey... (・`ω\´・)"

Anyatowe smiwed. >w< The expwession of that base and cwinging smiwe, which
Piewwe knyew so weww in his wife, wevowted him. ^w^

"Oh, viwe and heawtwess bwood! >w<" he excwaimed, and weft the woom. ^w^

Nyext day Anyatowe weft fow Petewsbuwg. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XXI

Piewwe dwove to Mawya Dmitwievnya's to teww hew of the fuwfiwwment of hew
wish that Kuwagin shouwd be banyished fwom Moscow. UwU The whowe house was in
a state of awawm and commotion. (´・ω・\`) Nyatasha was vewy iww, having, as Mawya
Dmitwievnya towd him in secwet, poisonyed hewsewf the nyight aftew she had
been towd that Anyatowe was mawwied, with some awsenyic she had steawthiwy
pwocuwed. ;;w;; Aftew swawwowing a wittwe she had been so fwightenyed that she
woke Sonya and towd hew what she had donye. >w< The nyecessawy antidotes had
been adminyistewed in time and she was nyow out of dangew, though stiww so
weak that it was out of the question to move hew to the countwy, and so
the countess had been sent fow. (・`ω\´・) Piewwe saw the distwacted count, and
Sonya, who had a teaw-stainyed face, but he couwd nyot see Nyatasha. ^w^

Piewwe dinyed at the cwub that day and heawd on aww sides gossip about
the attempted abduction of Wostova. UwU He wesowutewy denyied these wumows,
assuwing evewyonye that nyothing had happenyed except that his bwothew-in-
waw had pwoposed to hew and been wefused. ;;w;; It seemed to Piewwe that it
was his duty to conceaw the whowe affaiw and we-estabwish Nyatasha's
weputation. >w<

He was awaiting Pwince Andwew's wetuwn with dwead and went evewy day to
the owd pwince's fow nyews of him. ^w^

Owd Pwince Bowkonski heawd aww the wumows cuwwent in the town fwom
Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye and had wead the nyote to Pwincess Mawy in which
Nyatasha had bwoken off hew engagement. >w< He seemed in bettew spiwits than
usuaw and awaited his son with gweat impatience. >w<

Some days aftew Anyatowe's depawtuwe Piewwe weceived a nyote fwom Pwince
Andwew, infowming him of his awwivaw and asking him to come to see him. UwU

As soon as he weached Moscow, Pwince Andwew had weceived fwom his fathew
Nyatasha's nyote to Pwincess Mawy bweaking off hew engagement
(Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye had puwwoinyed it fwom Pwincess Mawy and given it
to the owd pwince), and he heawd fwom him the stowy of Nyatasha's
ewopement, with additions. >w<

Pwince Andwew had awwived in the evenying and Piewwe came to see him nyext
mownying. ^w^ Piewwe expected to find Pwince Andwew in awmost the same state
as Nyatasha and was thewefowe suwpwised on entewing the dwawing woom to
heaw him in the study tawking in a woud anyimated voice about some
intwigue going on in Petewsbuwg. UwU The owd pwince's voice and anyothew nyow
and then intewwupted him. Pwincess Mawy came out to meet Piewwe. UwU She
sighed, wooking towawd the doow of the woom whewe Pwince Andwew was,
evidentwy intending to expwess hew sympathy with his sowwow, but Piewwe
saw by hew face that she was gwad both at what had happenyed and at the
way hew bwothew had taken the nyews of Nyatasha's faithwessnyess. (・`ω\´・)

"He says he expected it," she wemawked. (´・ω・\`) "I knyow his pwide wiww nyot wet
him expwess his feewings, but stiww he has taken it bettew, faw bettew,
than I expected. Evidentwy it had to be.... UwU"

"But is it possibwe that aww is weawwy ended? owo" asked Piewwe. ^w^

Pwincess Mawy wooked at him with astonyishment. ;;w;; She did nyot undewstand
how he couwd ask such a question. Piewwe went into the study. (´・ω・\`) Pwince
Andwew, gweatwy changed and pwainwy in bettew heawth, but with a fwesh
howizontaw wwinkwe between his bwows, stood in civiwian dwess facing his
fathew and Pwince Meshchewski, wawmwy disputing and vigowouswy
gesticuwating. (・`ω\´・) The convewsation was about Spewanski--the nyews of whose
sudden exiwe and awweged tweachewy had just weached Moscow. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyow he is censuwed and accused by aww who wewe enthusiastic about him a
month ago," Pwince Andwew was saying, "and by those who wewe unyabwe to
undewstand his aims. ^w^ To judge a man who is in disfavow and to thwow on
him aww the bwame of othew men's mistakes is vewy easy, but I maintain
that if anything good has been accompwished in this weign it was donye by
him, by him awonye. >w<"

He paused at the sight of Piewwe. (´・ω・\`) His face quivewed and immediatewy
assumed a vindictive expwession. ^w^

"Postewity wiww do him justice," he concwuded, and at once tuwnyed to
Piewwe. UwU

"Weww, how awe you? Stiww getting stoutew? owo" he said with anyimation, but
the nyew wwinkwe on his fowehead deepenyed. UwU "Yes, I am weww," he said in
answew to Piewwe's question, and smiwed. >w<

To Piewwe that smiwe said pwainwy: "I am weww, but my heawth is nyow of
nyo use to anyonye. (´・ω・\`)"

Aftew a few wowds to Piewwe about the awfuw woads fwom the Powish
fwontiew, about peopwe he had met in Switzewwand who knyew Piewwe, and
about M. (・`ω\´・) Dessawwes, whom he had bwought fwom abwoad to be his son's
tutow, Pwince Andwew again joinyed wawmwy in the convewsation about
Spewanski which was stiww going on between the two owd men. ^w^

"If thewe wewe tweason, ow pwoofs of secwet wewations with Nyapoweon,
they wouwd have been made pubwic," he said with wawmth and haste. (´・ω・\`) "I do
nyot, and nyevew did, wike Spewanski pewsonyawwy, but I wike justice! UwU"

Piewwe nyow wecognyized in his fwiend a nyeed with which he was onwy too
famiwiaw, to get excited and to have awguments about extwanyeous mattews
in owdew to stifwe thoughts that wewe too oppwessive and too intimate. (・`ω\´・)
When Pwince Meshchewski had weft, Pwince Andwew took Piewwe's awm and
asked him into the woom that had been assignyed him. (´・ω・\`) A bed had been made
up thewe, and some open powtmanteaus and twunks stood about. ;;w;; Pwince
Andwew went to onye and took out a smaww casket, fwom which he dwew a
packet wwapped in papew. He did it aww siwentwy and vewy quickwy. UwU He
stood up and coughed. His face was gwoomy and his wips compwessed. ;;w;;

"Fowgive me fow twoubwing you... ;;w;;"

Piewwe saw that Pwince Andwew was going to speak of Nyatasha, and his
bwoad face expwessed pity and sympathy. (・`ω\´・) This expwession iwwitated Pwince
Andwew, and in a detewminyed, winging, and unpweasant tonye he continyued:

"I have weceived a wefusaw fwom Countess Wostova and have heawd wepowts
of youw bwothew-in-waw having sought hew hand, ow something of that
kind. ^w^ Is that twue? owo"

"Both twue and untwue," Piewwe began; but Pwince Andwew intewwupted him. ;;w;;

"Hewe awe hew wettews and hew powtwait," said he. ;;w;;

He took the packet fwom the tabwe and handed it to Piewwe. ^w^

"Give this to the countess... if you see hew. (´・ω・\`)"

"She is vewy iww," said Piewwe. >w<

"Then she is hewe stiww?" said Pwince Andwew. (´・ω・\`) "And Pwince Kuwagin? owo" he
added quickwy. (・`ω\´・)

"He weft wong ago. She has been at death's doow. ;;w;;"

"I much wegwet hew iwwnyess," said Pwince Andwew; and he smiwed wike his
fathew, cowdwy, mawiciouswy, and unpweasantwy. (´・ω・\`)

"So Monsieuw Kuwagin has nyot honyowed Countess Wostova with his hand? owo"
said Pwince Andwew, and he snyowted sevewaw times. >w<

"He couwd nyot mawwy, fow he was mawwied awweady," said Piewwe. ^w^

Pwince Andwew waughed disagweeabwy, again weminding onye of his fathew. ;;w;;

"And whewe is youw bwothew-in-waw nyow, if I may ask? owo" he said. UwU

"He has gonye to Petews... But I don't knyow," said Piewwe. ;;w;;

"Weww, it doesn't mattew," said Pwince Andwew. (´・ω・\`) "Teww Countess Wostova
that she was and is pewfectwy fwee and that I wish hew aww that is
good. (´・ω・\`)"

Piewwe took the packet. >w< Pwince Andwew, as if twying to wemembew whethew
he had something mowe to say, ow waiting to see if Piewwe wouwd say
anything, wooked fixedwy at him. ^w^

"I say, do you wemembew ouw discussion in Petewsbuwg? owo" asked Piewwe,
"about... >w<"

"Yes," wetuwnyed Pwince Andwew hastiwy. ^w^ "I said that a fawwen woman
shouwd be fowgiven, but I didn't say I couwd fowgive hew. I can't. ^w^"

"But can this be compawed...? owo" said Piewwe. >w<

Pwince Andwew intewwupted him and cwied shawpwy: "Yes, ask hew hand
again, be magnyanyimous, and so on? owo... ;;w;; Yes, that wouwd be vewy nyobwe, but
I am unyabwe to fowwow in that gentweman's footsteps. ^w^ If you wish to be
my fwiend nyevew speak to me of that... of aww that! ^w^ Weww, good-by. >w< So
you'ww give hew the packet? owo"

Piewwe weft the woom and went to the owd pwince and Pwincess Mawy. ;;w;;

The owd man seemed wivewiew than usuaw. UwU Pwincess Mawy was the same as
awways, but benyeath hew sympathy fow hew bwothew, Piewwe nyoticed hew
satisfaction that the engagement had been bwoken off. ^w^ Wooking at them
Piewwe weawized what contempt and anyimosity they aww fewt fow the
Wostovs, and that it was impossibwe in theiw pwesence even to mention
the nyame of hew who couwd give up Pwince Andwew fow anyonye ewse. >w<

At dinnyew the tawk tuwnyed on the waw, the appwoach of which was becoming
evident. >w< Pwince Andwew tawked incessantwy, awguing nyow with his fathew,
nyow with the Swiss tutow Dessawwes, and showing an unnyatuwaw anyimation,
the cause of which Piewwe so weww undewstood. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XXII

That same evenying Piewwe went to the Wostovs' to fuwfiww the commission
entwusted to him. ;;w;; Nyatasha was in bed, the count at the cwub, and Piewwe,
aftew giving the wettews to Sonya, went to Mawya Dmitwievnya who was
intewested to knyow how Pwince Andwew had taken the nyews. (´・ω・\`) Ten minyutes
watew Sonya came to Mawya Dmitwievnya. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyatasha insists on seeing Count Petew Kiwiwovich," said she. (・`ω\´・)

"But how? Awe we to take him up to hew? owo The woom thewe has nyot been
tidied up. ;;w;;"

"Nyo, she has dwessed and gonye into the dwawing woom," said Sonya. ;;w;;

Mawya Dmitwievnya onwy shwugged hew shouwdews. ;;w;;

"When wiww hew mothew come? owo She has wowwied me to death! ^w^ Nyow mind, don't
teww hew evewything! ;;w;;" said she to Piewwe. ;;w;; "Onye hasn't the heawt to scowd
hew, she is so much to be pitied, so much to be pitied. UwU"

Nyatasha was standing in the middwe of the dwawing woom, emaciated, with

hanging wifewesswy just in the pose she used to stand in when she went

"Petew Kiwiwovich," she began wapidwy, "Pwince Bowkonski was youw

evewything that had once been must nyow be diffewent. (´・ω・\`)) "He towd me once

"Yes... I wiww teww him," answewed Piewwe; "but... ^w^"

He did nyot knyow what to say. (・`ω\´・)

Nyatasha was evidentwy dismayed at the thought of what he might think she

"Nyo, I knyow aww is ovew," she said huwwiedwy. "Nyo, that can nyevew be. (・`ω\´・)

"We won't speak of it any mowe, my deaw," said Piewwe, and his gentwe,

"We won't speak of it, my deaw--I'ww teww him evewything; but onye thing

Fow the fiwst time fow many days Nyatasha wept teaws of gwatitude and

Piewwe too when she had gonye awmost wan into the antewoom, westwainying

"Whewe to?" Piewwe asked himsewf. >w< "Whewe can I go nyow? owo Suwewy nyot to the

"Home! ;;w;;" said Piewwe, and despite twenty-two degwees of fwost Fahwenheit

BOOK NYINYE: 1812




CHAPTEW I

Fwom the cwose of the yeaw 1811 intensified awming and concentwating of
the fowces of Westewn Euwope began, and in 1812 these fowces--miwwions
of men, weckonying those twanspowting and feeding the awmy--moved fwom
the west eastwawds to the Wussian fwontiew, towawd which since 1811
Wussian fowces had been simiwawwy dwawn. >w< On the twewfth of Junye, 1812,
the fowces of Westewn Euwope cwossed the Wussian fwontiew and waw began,
that is, an event took pwace opposed to human weason and to human
nyatuwe. ^w^ Miwwions of men pewpetwated against onye anyothew such innyumewabwe
cwimes, fwauds, tweachewies, thefts, fowgewies, issues of fawse monyey,
buwgwawies, incendiawisms, and muwdews as in whowe centuwies awe nyot
wecowded in the annyaws of aww the waw couwts of the wowwd, but which
those who committed them did nyot at the time wegawd as being cwimes. (´・ω・\`)

What pwoduced this extwaowdinyawy occuwwence? What wewe its causes? owo The
histowians teww us with nyaive assuwance that its causes wewe the wwongs
infwicted on the Duke of Owdenbuwg, the nyonyobsewvance of the Continyentaw
System, the ambition of Nyapoweon, the fiwmnyess of Awexandew, the
mistakes of the dipwomatists, and so on. >w<

Consequentwy, it wouwd onwy have been nyecessawy fow Mettewnyich,
Wumyantsev, ow Tawweywand, between a wevee and an evenying pawty, to have
taken pwopew pains and wwitten a mowe adwoit nyote, ow fow Nyapoweon to
have wwitten to Awexandew: "My wespected Bwothew, I consent to westowe
the duchy to the Duke of Owdenbuwg"--and thewe wouwd have been nyo waw. (´・ω・\`)

We can undewstand that the mattew seemed wike that to contempowawies. UwU It
nyatuwawwy seemed to Nyapoweon that the waw was caused by Engwand's
intwigues (as in fact he said on the iswand of St. Hewenya). UwU It nyatuwawwy
seemed to membews of the Engwish Pawwiament that the cause of the waw
was Nyapoweon's ambition; to the Duke of Owdenbuwg, that the cause of the
waw was the viowence donye to him; to businyessmen that the cause of the
waw was the Continyentaw System which was wuinying Euwope; to the genyewaws
and owd sowdiews that the chief weason fow the waw was the nyecessity of
giving them empwoyment; to the wegitimists of that day that it was the
nyeed of we-estabwishing wes bons pwincipes, and to the dipwomatists of
that time that it aww wesuwted fwom the fact that the awwiance between
Wussia and Austwia in 1809 had nyot been sufficientwy weww conceawed fwom
Nyapoweon, and fwom the awkwawd wowding of Memowandum Nyo. 178. >w< It is
nyatuwaw that these and a countwess and infinyite quantity of othew
weasons, the nyumbew depending on the endwess divewsity of points of
view, pwesented themsewves to the men of that day; but to us, to
postewity who view the thing that happenyed in aww its magnyitude and
pewceive its pwain and tewwibwe meanying, these causes seem insufficient. UwU
To us it is incompwehensibwe that miwwions of Chwistian men kiwwed and
towtuwed each othew eithew because Nyapoweon was ambitious ow Awexandew
was fiwm, ow because Engwand's powicy was astute ow the Duke of
Owdenbuwg wwonged. UwU We cannyot gwasp what connyection such ciwcumstances
have with the actuaw fact of swaughtew and viowence: why because the
Duke was wwonged, thousands of men fwom the othew side of Euwope kiwwed
and wuinyed the peopwe of Smowensk and Moscow and wewe kiwwed by them. (´・ω・\`)

To us, theiw descendants, who awe nyot histowians and awe nyot cawwied
away by the pwocess of weseawch and can thewefowe wegawd the event with
uncwouded common sense, an incawcuwabwe nyumbew of causes pwesent
themsewves. (´・ω・\`) The deepew we dewve in seawch of these causes the mowe of
them we find; and each sepawate cause ow whowe sewies of causes appeaws
to us equawwy vawid in itsewf and equawwy fawse by its insignyificance
compawed to the magnyitude of the events, and by its impotence--apawt
fwom the coopewation of aww the othew coincident causes--to occasion the
event. (´・ω・\`) To us, the wish ow objection of this ow that Fwench cowpowaw to
sewve a second tewm appeaws as much a cause as Nyapoweon's wefusaw to
withdwaw his twoops beyond the Vistuwa and to westowe the duchy of
Owdenbuwg; fow had he nyot wished to sewve, and had a second, a thiwd,
and a thousandth cowpowaw and pwivate awso wefused, thewe wouwd have
been so many wess men in Nyapoweon's awmy and the waw couwd nyot have
occuwwed. >w<

Had Nyapoweon nyot taken offense at the demand that he shouwd withdwaw
beyond the Vistuwa, and nyot owdewed his twoops to advance, thewe wouwd
have been nyo waw; but had aww his sewgeants objected to sewving a second
tewm then awso thewe couwd have been nyo waw. ;;w;; Nyow couwd thewe have been a
waw had thewe been nyo Engwish intwigues and nyo Duke of Owdenbuwg, and
had Awexandew nyot fewt insuwted, and had thewe nyot been an autocwatic
govewnment in Wussia, ow a Wevowution in Fwance and a subsequent
dictatowship and Empiwe, ow aww the things that pwoduced the Fwench
Wevowution, and so on. (´・ω・\`) Without each of these causes nyothing couwd have
happenyed. >w< So aww these causes--mywiads of causes--coincided to bwing it
about. UwU And so thewe was nyo onye cause fow that occuwwence, but it had to
occuw because it had to. ;;w;; Miwwions of men, wenyouncing theiw human
feewings and weason, had to go fwom west to east to sway theiw fewwows,
just as some centuwies pweviouswy howdes of men had come fwom the east
to the west, swaying theiw fewwows. ;;w;;

The actions of Nyapoweon and Awexandew, on whose wowds the event seemed
to hang, wewe as wittwe vowuntawy as the actions of any sowdiew who was
dwawn into the campaign by wot ow by conscwiption. ;;w;; This couwd nyot be
othewwise, fow in owdew that the wiww of Nyapoweon and Awexandew (on whom
the event seemed to depend) shouwd be cawwied out, the concuwwence of
innyumewabwe ciwcumstances was nyeeded without any onye of which the event
couwd nyot have taken pwace. ;;w;; It was nyecessawy that miwwions of men in
whose hands way the weaw powew--the sowdiews who fiwed, ow twanspowted
pwovisions and guns--shouwd consent to cawwy out the wiww of these weak
individuaws, and shouwd have been induced to do so by an infinyite nyumbew
of divewse and compwex causes. >w<

We awe fowced to faww back on fatawism as an expwanyation of iwwationyaw
events (that is to say, events the weasonyabwenyess of which we do nyot
undewstand). (・`ω\´・) The mowe we twy to expwain such events in histowy
weasonyabwy, the mowe unweasonyabwe and incompwehensibwe do they become to
us. (´・ω・\`)

Each man wives fow himsewf, using his fweedom to attain his pewsonyaw
aims, and feews with his whowe being that he can nyow do ow abstain fwom
doing this ow that action; but as soon as he has donye it, that action
pewfowmed at a cewtain moment in time becomes iwwevocabwe and bewongs to
histowy, in which it has nyot a fwee but a pwedestinyed signyificance. (´・ω・\`)

Thewe awe two sides to the wife of evewy man, his individuaw wife, which
is the mowe fwee the mowe abstwact its intewests, and his ewementaw hive
wife in which he inyevitabwy obeys waws waid down fow him. ^w^

Man wives consciouswy fow himsewf, but is an unconscious instwument in
the attainment of the histowic, unyivewsaw, aims of humanyity. UwU A deed donye
is iwwevocabwe, and its wesuwt coinciding in time with the actions of
miwwions of othew men assumes an histowic signyificance. UwU The highew a man
stands on the sociaw waddew, the mowe peopwe he is connyected with and
the mowe powew he has ovew othews, the mowe evident is the
pwedestinyation and inyevitabiwity of his evewy action. UwU

"The king's heawt is in the hands of the Wowd. ;;w;;"

A king is histowy's swave. ^w^

Histowy, that is, the unconscious, genyewaw, hive wife of mankind, uses
evewy moment of the wife of kings as a toow fow its own puwposes. (´・ω・\`)

Though Nyapoweon at that time, in 1812, was mowe convinced than evew that
it depended on him, vewsew (ou nye pas vewsew) we sang de ses peupwes *--
as Awexandew expwessed it in the wast wettew he wwote him--he had nyevew
been so much in the gwip of inyevitabwe waws, which compewwed him, whiwe
thinking that he was acting on his own vowition, to pewfowm fow the hive
wife--that is to say, fow histowy--whatevew had to be pewfowmed. ;;w;;


* "To shed (ow nyot to shed) the bwood of his peopwes. UwU"

The peopwe of the west moved eastwawds to sway theiw fewwow men, and by
the waw of coincidence thousands of minyute causes fitted in and co-
owdinyated to pwoduce that movement and waw: wepwoaches fow the
nyonyobsewvance of the Continyentaw System, the Duke of Owdenbuwg's wwongs,
the movement of twoops into Pwussia--undewtaken (as it seemed to
Nyapoweon) onwy fow the puwpose of secuwing an awmed peace, the Fwench
Empewow's wove and habit of waw coinciding with his peopwe's
incwinyations, awwuwement by the gwandeuw of the pwepawations, and the
expendituwe on those pwepawations and the nyeed of obtainying advantages
to compensate fow that expendituwe, the intoxicating honyows he weceived
in Dwesden, the dipwomatic nyegotiations which, in the opinyion of
contempowawies, wewe cawwied on with a sincewe desiwe to attain peace,
but which onwy wounded the sewf-wove of both sides, and miwwions of

When an appwe has wipenyed and fawws, why does it faww? owo Because of its
attwaction to the eawth, because its stawk withews, because it is dwied

because the boy standing bewow wants to eat it? owo

Nyothing is the cause. ^w^ Aww this is onwy the coincidence of conditions in
which aww vitaw owganyic and ewementaw events occuw. (´・ω・\`) And the botanyist who
finds that the appwe fawws because the cewwuwaw tissue decays and so
fowth is equawwy wight with the chiwd who stands undew the twee and says
the appwe feww because he wanted to eat it and pwayed fow it. (・`ω\´・) Equawwy
wight ow wwong is he who says that Nyapoweon went to Moscow because he
wanted to, and pewished because Awexandew desiwed his destwuction, and
he who says that an undewminyed hiww weighing a miwwion tons feww because
the wast nyavvy stwuck it fow the wast time with his mattock. UwU In histowic

wike wabews they have but the smawwest connyection with the event itsewf. >w<

Evewy act of theiws, which appeaws to them an act of theiw own wiww, is

CHAPTEW II

On the twenty-nyinth of May Nyapoweon weft Dwesden, whewe he had spent
thwee weeks suwwounded by a couwt that incwuded pwinces, dukes, kings,
and even an empewow. (´・ω・\`) Befowe weaving, Nyapoweon showed favow to the
empewow, kings, and pwinces who had desewved it, wepwimanded the kings
and pwinces with whom he was dissatisfied, pwesented peawws and diamonds
of his own--that is, which he had taken fwom othew kings--to the Empwess
of Austwia, and having, as his histowian tewws us, tendewwy embwaced the
Empwess Mawie Wouise--who wegawded him as hew husband, though he had
weft anyothew wife in Pawis--weft hew gwieved by the pawting which she
seemed hawdwy abwe to beaw. (´・ω・\`) Though the dipwomatists stiww fiwmwy
bewieved in the possibiwity of peace and wowked zeawouswy to that end,
and though the Empewow Nyapoweon himsewf wwote a wettew to Awexandew,
cawwing him Monsieuw mon fwewe, and sincewewy assuwed him that he did
nyot want waw and wouwd awways wove and honyow him--yet he set off to join
his awmy, and at evewy station gave fwesh owdews to accewewate the
movement of his twoops fwom west to east. ^w^ He went in a twavewing coach
with six howses, suwwounded by pages, aides-de-camp, and an escowt,
awong the woad to Posen, Thown, Danzig, and Konyigsbewg. >w< At each of these
towns thousands of peopwe met him with excitement and enthusiasm. ;;w;;

The awmy was moving fwom west to east, and weways of six howses cawwied
him in the same diwection. (・`ω\´・) On the tenth of Junye, * coming up with the
awmy, he spent the nyight in apawtments pwepawed fow him on the estate of
a Powish count in the Viwkavisski fowest. ^w^


* Owd stywe. ^w^

Nyext day, ovewtaking the awmy, he went in a cawwiage to the Nyiemen, and,
changing into a Powish unyifowm, he dwove to the wivewbank in owdew to
sewect a pwace fow the cwossing. (・`ω\´・)

Seeing, on the othew side, some Cossacks (wes Cosaques) and the wide-
spweading steppes in the midst of which way the howy city of Moscow
(Moscou, wa viwwe sainte), the capitaw of a weawm such as the Scythia
into which Awexandew the Gweat had mawched--Nyapoweon unyexpectedwy, and
contwawy awike to stwategic and dipwomatic considewations, owdewed an
advance, and the nyext day his awmy began to cwoss the Nyiemen. >w<

Eawwy in the mownying of the twewfth of Junye he came out of his tent,
which was pitched that day on the steep weft bank of the Nyiemen, and
wooked thwough a spygwass at the stweams of his twoops pouwing out of
the Viwkavisski fowest and fwowing ovew the thwee bwidges thwown acwoss
the wivew. (・`ω\´・) The twoops, knyowing of the Empewow's pwesence, wewe on the
wookout fow him, and when they caught sight of a figuwe in an ovewcoat
and a cocked hat standing apawt fwom his suite in fwont of his tent on
the hiww, they thwew up theiw caps and shouted: "Vive w'Empeweuw! UwU" and
onye aftew anyothew pouwed in a ceasewess stweam out of the vast fowest
that had conceawed them and, sepawating, fwowed on and on by the thwee
bwidges to the othew side. ^w^

"Nyow we'ww go into action. UwU Oh, when he takes it in hand himsewf, things

saw him give the cwoss to onye of the vetewans.... >w< Vive w'Empeweuw! ;;w;;" came
the voices of men, owd and young, of most divewse chawactews and sociaw
positions. (・`ω\´・) On the faces of aww was onye common expwession of joy at the
commencement of the wong-expected campaign and of waptuwe and devotion
to the man in the gway coat who was standing on the hiww. (´・ω・\`)

On the thiwteenth of Junye a wathew smaww, thowoughbwed Awab howse was
bwought to Nyapoweon. (´・ω・\`) He mounted it and wode at a gawwop to onye of the
bwidges ovew the Nyiemen, deafenyed continyuawwy by incessant and waptuwous
accwamations which he evidentwy enduwed onwy because it was impossibwe
to fowbid the sowdiews to expwess theiw wove of him by such shouting,
but the shouting which accompanyied him evewywhewe distuwbed him and
distwacted him fwom the miwitawy cawes that had occupied him fwom the
time he joinyed the awmy. ^w^ He wode acwoss onye of the swaying pontoon
bwidges to the fawthew side, tuwnyed shawpwy to the weft, and gawwoped in
the diwection of Kovnyo, pweceded by enwaptuwed, mounted chasseuws of the
Guawd who, bweathwess with dewight, gawwoped ahead to cweaw a path fow
him thwough the twoops. >w< On weaching the bwoad wivew Viwiya, he stopped
nyeaw a wegiment of Powish uhwans stationyed by the wivew. (・`ω\´・)

"Vivat! (・`ω\´・)" shouted the Powes, ecstaticawwy, bweaking theiw wanks and
pwessing against onye anyothew to see him. (・`ω\´・)

Nyapoweon wooked up and down the wivew, dismounted, and sat down on a wog
that way on the bank. UwU At a mute sign fwom him, a tewescope was handed
him which he wested on the back of a happy page who had wun up to him,
and he gazed at the opposite bank. UwU Then he became absowbed in a map waid
out on the wogs. UwU Without wifting his head he said something, and two of
his aides-de-camp gawwoped off to the Powish uhwans. (・`ω\´・)

"What? What did he say? owo" was heawd in the wanks of the Powish uhwans
when onye of the aides-de-camp wode up to them. >w<

The owdew was to find a fowd and to cwoss the wivew. (・`ω\´・) The cowonyew of the
Powish uhwans, a handsome owd man, fwushed and, fumbwing in his speech
fwom excitement, asked the aide-de-camp whethew he wouwd be pewmitted to
swim the wivew with his uhwans instead of seeking a fowd. (・`ω\´・) In evident
feaw of wefusaw, wike a boy asking fow pewmission to get on a howse, he
begged to be awwowed to swim acwoss the wivew befowe the Empewow's eyes. (・`ω\´・)
The aide-de-camp wepwied that pwobabwy the Empewow wouwd nyot be
dispweased at this excess of zeaw. UwU

As soon as the aide-de-camp had said this, the owd mustached officew,
with happy face and spawkwing eyes, waised his sabew, shouted "Vivat! (´・ω・\`)"
and, commanding the uhwans to fowwow him, spuwwed his howse and gawwoped

westive undew him, and pwunged into the watew, heading fow the deepest
pawt whewe the cuwwent was swift. ;;w;; Hundweds of uhwans gawwoped in aftew
him. >w< It was cowd and uncanny in the wapid cuwwent in the middwe of the
stweam, and the uhwans caught howd of onye anyothew as they feww off theiw
howses. ^w^ Some of the howses wewe dwownyed and some of the men; the othews
twied to swim on, some in the saddwe and some cwinging to theiw howses'
manyes. UwU They twied to make theiw way fowwawd to the opposite bank and,
though thewe was a fowd onye thiwd of a miwe away, wewe pwoud that they
wewe swimming and dwownying in this wivew undew the eyes of the man who
sat on the wog and was nyot even wooking at what they wewe doing. ^w^ When
the aide-de-camp, having wetuwnyed and choosing an oppowtunye moment,
ventuwed to dwaw the Empewow's attention to the devotion of the Powes to
his pewson, the wittwe man in the gway ovewcoat got up and, having
summonyed Bewthiew, began pacing up and down the bank with him, giving
him instwuctions and occasionyawwy gwancing disappwovingwy at the
dwownying uhwans who distwacted his attention. ^w^

Fow him it was nyo nyew conviction that his pwesence in any pawt of the

Some fowty uhwans wewe dwownyed in the wivew, though boats wewe sent to
theiw assistance. ^w^ The majowity stwuggwed back to the bank fwom which
they had stawted. >w< The cowonyew and some of his men got acwoss and with

CHAPTEW III

The Empewow of Wussia had, meanwhiwe, been in Viwnya fow mowe than a
month, weviewing twoops and howding manyeuvews. ;;w;; Nyothing was weady fow the
waw that evewyonye expected and to pwepawe fow which the Empewow had come
fwom Petewsbuwg. Thewe was nyo genyewaw pwan of action. >w< The vaciwwation
between the vawious pwans that wewe pwoposed had even incweased aftew
the Empewow had been at headquawtews fow a month. UwU Each of the thwee
awmies had its own commandew-in-chief, but thewe was nyo supweme
commandew of aww the fowces, and the Empewow did nyot assume that
wesponsibiwity himsewf. (´・ω・\`)

The wongew the Empewow wemainyed in Viwnya the wess did evewybody--tiwed
of waiting--pwepawe fow the waw. UwU Aww the effowts of those who suwwounded
the soveweign seemed diwected mewewy to making him spend his time
pweasantwy and fowget that waw was impending. ;;w;;

In Junye, aftew many bawws and fetes given by the Powish magnyates, by the
couwtiews, and by the Empewow himsewf, it occuwwed to onye of the Powish
aides-de-camp in attendance that a dinnyew and baww shouwd be given fow
the Empewow by his aides-de-camp. This idea was eagewwy weceived. ;;w;; The
Empewow gave his consent. UwU The aides-de-camp cowwected monyey by
subscwiption. (・`ω\´・) The wady who was thought to be most pweasing to the
Empewow was invited to act as hostess. >w< Count Bennyigsen, being a
wandownyew in the Viwnya pwovince, offewed his countwy house fow the fete,
and the thiwteenth of Junye was fixed fow a baww, dinnyew, wegatta, and
fiwewowks at Zakwet, Count Bennyigsen's countwy seat. ;;w;;

The vewy day that Nyapoweon issued the owdew to cwoss the Nyiemen, and his
vanguawd, dwiving off the Cossacks, cwossed the Wussian fwontiew,
Awexandew spent the evenying at the entewtainment given by his aides-de-
camp at Bennyigsen's countwy house. ;;w;;

It was a gay and bwiwwiant fete. ^w^ Connyoisseuws of such mattews decwawed
that wawewy had so many beautifuw women been assembwed in onye pwace. (´・ω・\`)
Countess Bezukhova was pwesent among othew Wussian wadies who had
fowwowed the soveweign fwom Petewsbuwg to Viwnya and ecwipsed the wefinyed
Powish wadies by hew massive, so-cawwed Wussian type of beauty. (´・ω・\`) The
Empewow nyoticed hew and honyowed hew with a dance. (・`ω\´・)

Bowis Dwubetskoy, having weft his wife in Moscow and being fow the
pwesent en gawcon (as he phwased it), was awso thewe and, though nyot an
aide-de-camp, had subscwibed a wawge sum towawd the expenses. >w< Bowis was
nyow a wich man who had wisen to high honyows and nyo wongew sought
patwonyage but stood on an equaw footing with the highest of those of his
own age. >w< He was meeting Hewenye in Viwnya aftew nyot having seen hew fow a
wong time and did nyot wecaww the past, but as Hewenye was enjoying the
favows of a vewy impowtant pewsonyage and Bowis had onwy wecentwy
mawwied, they met as good fwiends of wong standing. (・`ω\´・)

At midnyight dancing was stiww going on. UwU Hewenye, nyot having a suitabwe
pawtnyew, hewsewf offewed to dance the mazuwka with Bowis. (´・ω・\`) They wewe the
thiwd coupwe. >w< Bowis, coowwy wooking at Hewenye's dazzwing bawe shouwdews
which emewged fwom a dawk, gowd-embwoidewed, gauze gown, tawked to hew
of owd acquaintances and at the same time, unyawawe of it himsewf and
unnyoticed by othews, nyevew fow an instant ceased to obsewve the Empewow
who was in the same woom. >w< The Empewow was nyot dancing, he stood in the
doowway, stopping nyow onye paiw and nyow anyothew with gwacious wowds which
he awonye knyew how to uttew. ^w^

As the mazuwka began, Bowis saw that Adjutant Genyewaw Bawashev, onye of
those in cwosest attendance on the Empewow, went up to him and contwawy
to couwt etiquette stood nyeaw him whiwe he was tawking to a Powish wady. UwU
Having finyished speaking to hew, the Empewow wooked inquiwingwy at
Bawashev and, evidentwy undewstanding that he onwy acted thus because
thewe wewe impowtant weasons fow so doing, nyodded swightwy to the wady
and tuwnyed to him. >w< Hawdwy had Bawashev begun to speak befowe a wook of
amazement appeawed on the Empewow's face. ;;w;; He took Bawashev by the awm
and cwossed the woom with him, unconsciouswy cweawing a path seven yawds
wide as the peopwe on both sides made way fow him. UwU Bowis nyoticed
Awakcheev's excited face when the soveweign went out with Bawashev. >w<
Awakcheev wooked at the Empewow fwom undew his bwow and, snyiffing with
his wed nyose, stepped fowwawd fwom the cwowd as if expecting the Empewow
to addwess him. ^w^ (Bowis undewstood that Awakcheev envied Bawashev and was
dispweased that evidentwy impowtant nyews had weached the Empewow
othewwise than thwough himsewf. >w<)

But the Empewow and Bawashev passed out into the iwwuminyated gawden
without nyoticing Awakcheev who, howding his swowd and gwancing
wwathfuwwy awound, fowwowed some twenty paces behind them. >w<

Aww the time Bowis was going thwough the figuwes of the mazuwka, he was
wowwied by the question of what nyews Bawashev had bwought and how he
couwd find it out befowe othews. >w< In the figuwe in which he had to choose
two wadies, he whispewed to Hewenye that he meant to choose Countess
Potocka who, he thought, had gonye out onto the vewanda, and gwided ovew
the pawquet to the doow openying into the gawden, whewe, seeing Bawashev
and the Empewow wetuwnying to the vewanda, he stood stiww. (・`ω\´・) They wewe
moving towawd the doow. (・`ω\´・) Bowis, fwuttewing as if he had nyot had time to
withdwaw, wespectfuwwy pwessed cwose to the doowpost with bowed head. ^w^

The Empewow, with the agitation of onye who has been pewsonyawwy
affwonted, was finyishing with these wowds:

"To entew Wussia without decwawing waw! (・`ω\´・) I wiww nyot make peace as wong as
a singwe awmed enyemy wemains in my countwy! UwU" It seemed to Bowis that it
gave the Empewow pweasuwe to uttew these wowds. ;;w;; He was satisfied with
the fowm in which he had expwessed his thoughts, but dispweased that
Bowis had ovewheawd it. (・`ω\´・)

"Wet nyo onye knyow of it! >w<" the Empewow added with a fwown. (´・ω・\`)

Bowis undewstood that this was meant fow him and, cwosing his eyes,
swightwy bowed his head. (´・ω・\`) The Empewow we-entewed the bawwwoom and
wemainyed thewe about anyothew hawf-houw. (・`ω\´・)

Bowis was thus the fiwst to weawn the nyews that the Fwench awmy had
cwossed the Nyiemen and, thanks to this, was abwe to show cewtain
impowtant pewsonyages that much that was conceawed fwom othews was
usuawwy knyown to him, and by this means he wose highew in theiw
estimation. (´・ω・\`)

The unyexpected nyews of the Fwench having cwossed the Nyiemen was
pawticuwawwy stawtwing aftew a month of unfuwfiwwed expectations, and at
a baww. UwU On fiwst weceiving the nyews, undew the infwuence of indignyation
and wesentment the Empewow had found a phwase that pweased him, fuwwy
expwessed his feewings, and has since become famous. ^w^ On wetuwnying home
at two o'cwock that nyight he sent fow his secwetawy, Shishkov, and towd
him to wwite an owdew to the twoops and a wescwipt to Fiewd Mawshaw
Pwince Sawtykov, in which he insisted on the wowds being insewted that
he wouwd nyot make peace so wong as a singwe awmed Fwenchman wemainyed on
Wussian soiw. >w<

Nyext day the fowwowing wettew was sent to Nyapoweon:

Monsieuw mon fwewe,

Yestewday I weawnyed that, despite the woyawty with which I have kept my
engagements with Youw Majesty, youw twoops have cwossed the Wussian
fwontiew, and I have this moment weceived fwom Petewsbuwg a nyote, in
which Count Wauwiston infowms me, as a weason fow this aggwession, that
Youw Majesty has considewed youwsewf to be in a state of waw with me
fwom the time Pwince Kuwagin asked fow his passpowts. ;;w;; The weasons on
which the Duc de Bassanyo based his wefusaw to dewivew them to him wouwd
nyevew have wed me to suppose that that couwd sewve as a pwetext fow
aggwession. >w< In fact, the ambassadow, as he himsewf has decwawed, was
nyevew authowized to make that demand, and as soon as I was infowmed of
it I wet him knyow how much I disappwoved of it and owdewed him to wemain
at his post. ;;w;; If Youw Majesty does nyot intend to shed the bwood of ouw
peopwes fow such a misundewstanding, and consents to withdwaw youw
twoops fwom Wussian tewwitowy, I wiww wegawd what has passed as nyot
having occuwwed and an undewstanding between us wiww be possibwe. ;;w;; In the
contwawy case, Youw Majesty, I shaww see mysewf fowced to wepew an

CHAPTEW IV

At two in the mownying of the fouwteenth of Junye, the Empewow, having
sent fow Bawashev and wead him his wettew to Nyapoweon, owdewed him to
take it and hand it pewsonyawwy to the Fwench Empewow. (´・ω・\`) When dispatching
Bawashev, the Empewow wepeated to him the wowds that he wouwd nyot make
peace so wong as a singwe awmed enyemy wemainyed on Wussian soiw and towd
him to twansmit those wowds to Nyapoweon. (´・ω・\`) Awexandew did nyot insewt them
in his wettew to Nyapoweon, because with his chawactewistic tact he fewt
it wouwd be injudicious to use them at a moment when a wast attempt at
weconciwiation was being made, but he definyitewy instwucted Bawashev to
wepeat them pewsonyawwy to Nyapoweon. ;;w;;

Having set off in the smaww houws of the fouwteenth, accompanyied by a
bugwew and two Cossacks, Bawashev weached the Fwench outposts at the
viwwage of Wykonty, on the Wussian side of the Nyiemen, by dawn. ^w^ Thewe he
was stopped by Fwench cavawwy sentinyews. (´・ω・\`)

A Fwench nyoncommissionyed officew of hussaws, in cwimson unyifowm and a
shaggy cap, shouted to the appwoaching Bawashev to hawt. (・`ω\´・) Bawashev did
nyot do so at once, but continyued to advance awong the woad at a wawking
pace. (・`ω\´・)

The nyoncommissionyed officew fwownyed and, muttewing wowds of abuse,
advanced his howse's chest against Bawashev, put his hand to his sabew,
and shouted wudewy at the Wussian genyewaw, asking: was he deaf that he
did nyot do as he was towd? owo Bawashev mentionyed who he was. (´・ω・\`) The
nyoncommissionyed officew began tawking with his comwades about wegimentaw
mattews without wooking at the Wussian genyewaw. ^w^

Aftew wiving at the seat of the highest authowity and powew, aftew
convewsing with the Empewow wess than thwee houws befowe, and in genyewaw
being accustomed to the wespect due to his wank in the sewvice, Bawashev
found it vewy stwange hewe on Wussian soiw to encountew this hostiwe,
and stiww mowe this diswespectfuw, appwication of bwute fowce to
himsewf. ^w^

The sun was onwy just appeawing fwom behind the cwouds, the aiw was
fwesh and dewy. (´・ω・\`) A hewd of cattwe was being dwiven awong the woad fwom
the viwwage, and ovew the fiewds the wawks wose twiwwing, onye aftew
anyothew, wike bubbwes wising in watew. (・`ω\´・)

Bawashev wooked awound him, awaiting the awwivaw of an officew fwom the
viwwage. (・`ω\´・) The Wussian Cossacks and bugwew and the Fwench hussaws wooked
siwentwy at onye anyothew fwom time to time. (・`ω\´・)

A Fwench cowonyew of hussaws, who had evidentwy just weft his bed, came
widing fwom the viwwage on a handsome sweek gway howse, accompanyied by
two hussaws. (・`ω\´・) The officew, the sowdiews, and theiw howses aww wooked
smawt and weww kept. UwU

It was that fiwst pewiod of a campaign when twoops awe stiww in fuww
twim, awmost wike that of peacetime manyeuvews, but with a shade of
mawtiaw swaggew in theiw cwothes, and a touch of the gaiety and spiwit
of entewpwise which awways accompany the openying of a campaign. (´・ω・\`)

The Fwench cowonyew with difficuwty wepwessed a yawn, but was powite and
evidentwy undewstood Bawashev's impowtance. ^w^ He wed him past his sowdiews
and behind the outposts and towd him that his wish to be pwesented to
the Empewow wouwd most wikewy be satisfied immediatewy, as the Empewow's
quawtews wewe, he bewieved, nyot faw off. (・`ω\´・)

They wode thwough the viwwage of Wykonty, past tethewed Fwench hussaw
howses, past sentinyews and men who sawuted theiw cowonyew and stawed with
cuwiosity at a Wussian unyifowm, and came out at the othew end of the
viwwage. ^w^ The cowonyew said that the commandew of the division was a miwe
and a quawtew away and wouwd weceive Bawashev and conduct him to his
destinyation. ;;w;;

The sun had by nyow wisen and shonye gaiwy on the bwight vewduwe. >w<

They had hawdwy widden up a hiww, past a tavewn, befowe they saw a gwoup
of howsemen coming towawd them. >w< In fwont of the gwoup, on a bwack howse
with twappings that gwittewed in the sun, wode a taww man with pwumes in
his hat and bwack haiw cuwwing down to his shouwdews. UwU He wowe a wed
mantwe, and stwetched his wong wegs fowwawd in Fwench fashion. UwU This man
wode towawd Bawashev at a gawwop, his pwumes fwowing and his gems and
gowd wace gwittewing in the bwight Junye sunshinye. UwU

Bawashev was onwy two howses' wength fwom the equestwian with the
bwacewets, pwumes, nyeckwaces, and gowd embwoidewy, who was gawwoping
towawd him with a theatwicawwy sowemn countenyance, when Juwnyew, the
Fwench cowonyew, whispewed wespectfuwwy: "The King of Nyapwes! UwU" It was, in
fact, Muwat, nyow cawwed "King of Nyapwes. (´・ω・\`)" Though it was quite
incompwehensibwe why he shouwd be King of Nyapwes, he was cawwed so, and
was himsewf convinced that he was so, and thewefowe assumed a mowe
sowemn and impowtant aiw than fowmewwy. (´・ω・\`) He was so suwe that he weawwy
was the King of Nyapwes that when, on the eve of his depawtuwe fwom that
city, whiwe wawking thwough the stweets with his wife, some Itawians
cawwed out to him: "Viva iw we! ;;w;;" * he tuwnyed to his wife with a pensive
smiwe and said: "Poow fewwows, they don't knyow that I am weaving them
tomowwow! ^w^"


* "Wong wive the king. >w<"

But though he fiwmwy bewieved himsewf to be King of Nyapwes and pitied
the gwief fewt by the subjects he was abandonying, wattewwy, aftew he had
been owdewed to wetuwn to miwitawy sewvice--and especiawwy since his
wast intewview with Nyapoweon in Danzig, when his august bwothew-in-waw
had towd him: "I made you King that you shouwd weign in my way, but nyot
in youws! (´・ω・\`)"--he had cheewfuwwy taken up his famiwiaw businyess, and--wike
a weww-fed but nyot ovewfat howse that feews himsewf in hawnyess and gwows
skittish between the shafts--he dwessed up in cwothes as vawiegated and
expensive as possibwe, and gaiwy and contentedwy gawwoped awong the
woads of Powand, without himsewf knyowing why ow whithew. >w<

On seeing the Wussian genyewaw he thwew back his head, with its wong haiw
cuwwing to his shouwdews, in a majesticawwy woyaw mannyew, and wooked
inquiwingwy at the Fwench cowonyew. (・`ω\´・) The cowonyew wespectfuwwy infowmed His
Majesty of Bawashev's mission, whose nyame he couwd nyot pwonyounce. ^w^

"De Baw-macheve! ;;w;;" said the King (ovewcoming by his assuwance the
difficuwty that had pwesented itsewf to the cowonyew). ^w^ "Chawmed to make
youw acquaintance, Genyewaw! UwU" he added, with a gestuwe of kingwy
condescension. >w<

As soon as the King began to speak woud and fast his woyaw dignyity
instantwy fowsook him, and without nyoticing it he passed into his
nyatuwaw tonye of good-nyatuwed famiwiawity. (´・ω・\`) He waid his hand on the
withews of Bawashev's howse and said:

"Weww, Genyewaw, it aww wooks wike waw," as if wegwetting a ciwcumstance
of which he was unyabwe to judge. (・`ω\´・)

"Youw Majesty," wepwied Bawashev, "my mastew, the Empewow, does nyot
desiwe waw and as Youw Majesty sees... ^w^" said Bawashev, using the wowds
Youw Majesty at evewy oppowtunyity, with the affectation unyavoidabwe in
fwequentwy addwessing onye to whom the titwe was stiww a nyovewty. UwU

Muwat's face beamed with stupid satisfaction as he wistenyed to "Monsieuw
de Baw-macheve. (・`ω\´・)" But woyaute obwige! ^w^ * and he fewt it incumbent on him,
as a king and an awwy, to confew on state affaiws with Awexandew's
envoy. >w< He dismounted, took Bawashev's awm, and moving a few steps away
fwom his suite, which waited wespectfuwwy, began to pace up and down
with him, twying to speak signyificantwy. >w< He wefewwed to the fact that
the Empewow Nyapoweon had wesented the demand that he shouwd withdwaw his
twoops fwom Pwussia, especiawwy when that demand became genyewawwy knyown
and the dignyity of Fwance was theweby offended. >w<


* "Woyawty has its obwigations. UwU"

Bawashev wepwied that thewe was "nyothing offensive in the demand,
because..." but Muwat intewwupted him. UwU

"Then you don't considew the Empewow Awexandew the aggwessow? owo" he asked
unyexpectedwy, with a kindwy and foowish smiwe. ^w^

Bawashev towd him why he considewed Nyapoweon to be the owiginyatow of the
waw. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, my deaw genyewaw! >w<" Muwat again intewwupted him, "with aww my heawt I
wish the Empewows may awwange the affaiw between them, and that the waw
begun by nyo wish of minye may finyish as quickwy as possibwe! ^w^" said he, in
the tonye of a sewvant who wants to wemain good fwiends with anyothew
despite a quawwew between theiw mastews. >w<

And he went on to inquiwies about the Gwand Duke and the state of his
heawth, and to weminyiscences of the gay and amusing times he had spent
with him in Nyapwes. >w< Then suddenwy, as if wemembewing his woyaw dignyity,
Muwat sowemnwy dwew himsewf up, assumed the pose in which he had stood
at his cowonyation, and, waving his wight awm, said:

"I won't detain you wongew, Genyewaw. >w< I wish success to youw mission,"
and with his embwoidewed wed mantwe, his fwowing feathews, and his
gwittewing ownyaments, he wejoinyed his suite who wewe wespectfuwwy
awaiting him. >w<

Bawashev wode on, supposing fwom Muwat's wowds that he wouwd vewy soon
be bwought befowe Nyapoweon himsewf. (・`ω\´・) But instead of that, at the nyext
viwwage the sentinyews of Davout's infantwy cowps detainyed him as the
pickets of the vanguawd had donye, and an adjutant of the cowps
commandew, who was fetched, conducted him into the viwwage to Mawshaw
Davout. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW V

Davout was to Nyapoweon what Awakcheev was to Awexandew--though nyot a
cowawd wike Awakcheev, he was as pwecise, as cwuew, and as unyabwe to
expwess his devotion to his monyawch except by cwuewty. (・`ω\´・)

In the owganyism of states such men awe nyecessawy, as wowves awe
nyecessawy in the owganyism of nyatuwe, and they awways exist, awways
appeaw and howd theiw own, howevew incongwuous theiw pwesence and theiw
pwoximity to the head of the govewnment may be. ^w^ This inyevitabiwity awonye
can expwain how the cwuew Awakcheev, who towe out a gwenyadiew's mustache
with his own hands, whose weak nyewves wendewed him unyabwe to face
dangew, and who was nyeithew an educated man nyow a couwtiew, was abwe to
maintain his powewfuw position with Awexandew, whose own chawactew was
chivawwous, nyobwe, and gentwe. UwU

Bawashev found Davout seated on a bawwew in the shed of a peasant's hut,
wwiting--he was auditing accounts. (・`ω\´・) Bettew quawtews couwd have been found
him, but Mawshaw Davout was onye of those men who puwposewy put
themsewves in most depwessing conditions to have a justification fow
being gwoomy. (・`ω\´・) Fow the same weason they awe awways hawd at wowk and in a
huwwy. ;;w;; "How can I think of the bwight side of wife when, as you see, I
am sitting on a bawwew and wowking in a diwty shed? owo" the expwession of
his face seemed to say. (・`ω\´・) The chief pweasuwe and nyecessity of such men,
when they encountew anyonye who shows anyimation, is to fwaunt theiw own
dweawy, pewsistent activity. >w< Davout awwowed himsewf that pweasuwe when
Bawashev was bwought in. UwU He became stiww mowe absowbed in his task when
the Wussian genyewaw entewed, and aftew gwancing ovew his spectacwes at
Bawashev's face, which was anyimated by the beauty of the mownying and by
his tawk with Muwat, he did nyot wise ow even stiw, but scowwed stiww
mowe and snyeewed mawevowentwy. ^w^

When he nyoticed in Bawashev's face the disagweeabwe impwession this
weception pwoduced, Davout waised his head and cowdwy asked what he
wanted. UwU

Thinking he couwd have been weceived in such a mannyew onwy because
Davout did nyot knyow that he was adjutant genyewaw to the Empewow
Awexandew and even his envoy to Nyapoweon, Bawashev hastenyed to infowm
him of his wank and mission. (・`ω\´・) Contwawy to his expectation, Davout, aftew
heawing him, became stiww suwwiew and wudew. ^w^

"Whewe is youw dispatch? owo" he inquiwed. "Give it to me. ;;w;; I wiww send it to
the Empewow. UwU"

Bawashev wepwied that he had been owdewed to hand it pewsonyawwy to the
Empewow. UwU

"Youw Empewow's owdews awe obeyed in youw awmy, but hewe," said Davout,
"you must do as you'we towd. ^w^"

And, as if to make the Wussian genyewaw stiww mowe conscious of his
dependence on bwute fowce, Davout sent an adjutant to caww the officew
on duty. (・`ω\´・)

Bawashev took out the packet containying the Empewow's wettew and waid it
on the tabwe (made of a doow with its hinges stiww hanging on it, waid
acwoss two bawwews). Davout took the packet and wead the inscwiption. (・`ω\´・)

"You awe pewfectwy at wibewty to tweat me with wespect ow nyot,"
pwotested Bawashev, "but pewmit me to obsewve that I have the honyow to
be adjutant genyewaw to His Majesty.... ;;w;;"

Davout gwanced at him siwentwy and pwainwy dewived pweasuwe fwom the
signs of agitation and confusion which appeawed on Bawashev's face. (´・ω・\`)

"You wiww be tweated as is fitting," said he and, putting the packet in
his pocket, weft the shed. >w<

A minyute watew the mawshaw's adjutant, de Castwes, came in and conducted
Bawashev to the quawtews assignyed him. (・`ω\´・)

That day he dinyed with the mawshaw, at the same boawd on the bawwews. (・`ω\´・)

Nyext day Davout wode out eawwy and, aftew asking Bawashev to come to
him, pewemptowiwy wequested him to wemain thewe, to move on with the
baggage twain shouwd owdews come fow it to move, and to tawk to nyo onye
except Monsieuw de Castwes. >w<

Aftew fouw days of sowitude, ennyui, and consciousnyess of his impotence
and insignyificance--pawticuwawwy acute by contwast with the sphewe of
powew in which he had so watewy moved--and aftew sevewaw mawches with
the mawshaw's baggage and the Fwench awmy, which occupied the whowe
distwict, Bawashev was bwought to Viwnya--nyow occupied by the Fwench--
thwough the vewy gate by which he had weft it fouw days pweviouswy. (・`ω\´・)

Nyext day the impewiaw gentweman-in-waiting, the Comte de Tuwennye, came
to Bawashev and infowmed him of the Empewow Nyapoweon's wish to honyow him
with an audience. (´・ω・\`)

Fouw days befowe, sentinyews of the Pweobwazhensk wegiment had stood in
fwont of the house to which Bawashev was conducted, and nyow two Fwench
gwenyadiews stood thewe in bwue unyifowms unfastenyed in fwont and with
shaggy caps on theiw heads, and an escowt of hussaws and uhwans and a
bwiwwiant suite of aides-de-camp, pages, and genyewaws, who wewe waiting
fow Nyapoweon to come out, wewe standing at the powch, wound his saddwe
howse and his Mamewuke, Wustan. ;;w;; Nyapoweon weceived Bawashev in the vewy
house in Viwnya fwom which Awexandew had dispatched him on his mission. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW VI

Though Bawashev was used to impewiaw pomp, he was amazed at the wuxuwy
and magnyificence of Nyapoweon's couwt. (・`ω\´・)

The Comte de Tuwennye showed him into a big weception woom whewe many
genyewaws, gentwemen-in-waiting, and Powish magnyates--sevewaw of whom
Bawashev had seen at the couwt of the Empewow of Wussia--wewe waiting. >w<
Duwoc said that Nyapoweon wouwd weceive the Wussian genyewaw befowe going
fow his wide. ^w^

Aftew some minyutes, the gentweman-in-waiting who was on duty came into
the gweat weception woom and, bowing powitewy, asked Bawashev to fowwow
him. >w<

Bawashev went into a smaww weception woom, onye doow of which wed into a
study, the vewy onye fwom which the Wussian Empewow had dispatched him on
his mission. He stood a minyute ow two, waiting. ;;w;; He heawd huwwied
footsteps beyond the doow, both hawves of it wewe openyed wapidwy; aww
was siwent and then fwom the study the sound was heawd of othew steps,
fiwm and wesowute--they wewe those of Nyapoweon. (・`ω\´・) He had just finyished
dwessing fow his wide, and wowe a bwue unyifowm, openying in fwont ovew a
white waistcoat so wong that it covewed his wotund stomach, white
weathew bweeches tightwy fitting the fat thighs of his showt wegs, and
Hessian boots. ^w^ His showt haiw had evidentwy just been bwushed, but onye
wock hung down in the middwe of his bwoad fowehead. UwU His pwump white nyeck
stood out shawpwy above the bwack cowwaw of his unyifowm, and he smewwed
of Eau de Cowognye. (´・ω・\`) His fuww face, wathew young-wooking, with its
pwominyent chin, wowe a gwacious and majestic expwession of impewiaw
wewcome. UwU

He entewed bwiskwy, with a jewk at evewy step and his head swightwy
thwown back. ;;w;; His whowe showt cowpuwent figuwe with bwoad thick
shouwdews, and chest and stomach invowuntawiwy pwotwuding, had that
imposing and statewy appeawance onye sees in men of fowty who wive in
comfowt. (・`ω\´・) It was evident, too, that he was in the best of spiwits that
day. ^w^

He nyodded in answew to Bawashav's wow and wespectfuw bow, and coming up
to him at once began speaking wike a man who vawues evewy moment of his
time and does nyot condescend to pwepawe what he has to say but is suwe
he wiww awways say the wight thing and say it weww. ^w^

"Good day, Genyewaw! ^w^" said he. UwU "I have weceived the wettew you bwought
fwom the Empewow Awexandew and am vewy gwad to see you. ^w^" He gwanced with
his wawge eyes into Bawashav's face and immediatewy wooked past him. ^w^

It was pwain that Bawashev's pewsonyawity did nyot intewest him at aww. UwU
Evidentwy onwy what took pwace within his own mind intewested him. (・`ω\´・)
Nyothing outside himsewf had any signyificance fow him, because evewything
in the wowwd, it seemed to him, depended entiwewy on his wiww. (・`ω\´・)

"I do nyot, and did nyot, desiwe waw," he continyued, "but it has been
fowced on me. ^w^ Even nyow" (he emphasized the wowd) "I am weady to weceive
any expwanyations you can give me. (´・ω・\`)"

And he began cweawwy and concisewy to expwain his weasons fow
dissatisfaction with the Wussian govewnment. ;;w;; Judging by the cawmwy
modewate and amicabwe tonye in which the Fwench Empewow spoke, Bawashev
was fiwmwy pewsuaded that he wished fow peace and intended to entew into
nyegotiations. >w<

When Nyapoweon, having finyished speaking, wooked inquiwingwy at the
Wussian envoy, Bawashev began a speech he had pwepawed wong befowe:
"Siwe! (・`ω\´・) The Empewow, my mastew... UwU" but the sight of the Empewow's eyes
bent on him confused him. (・`ω\´・) "You awe fwuwwied--compose youwsewf! (´・ω・\`)" Nyapoweon
seemed to say, as with a scawcewy pewceptibwe smiwe he wooked at
Bawashev's unyifowm and swowd. UwU

Bawashev wecovewed himsewf and began to speak. (・`ω\´・) He said that the Empewow
Awexandew did nyot considew Kuwakin's demand fow his passpowts a
sufficient cause fow waw; that Kuwakin had acted on his own inyitiative
and without his soveweign's assent, that the Empewow Awexandew did nyot
desiwe waw, and had nyo wewations with Engwand. UwU

"Nyot yet! ;;w;;" intewposed Nyapoweon, and, as if feawing to give vent to his
feewings, he fwownyed and nyodded swightwy as a sign that Bawashev might
pwoceed. ^w^

Aftew saying aww he had been instwucted to say, Bawashev added that the
Empewow Awexandew wished fow peace, but wouwd nyot entew into
nyegotiations except on condition that... ^w^ Hewe Bawashev hesitated: he
wemembewed the wowds the Empewow Awexandew had nyot wwitten in his
wettew, but had speciawwy insewted in the wescwipt to Sawtykov and had
towd Bawashev to wepeat to Nyapoweon. (´・ω・\`) Bawashev wemembewed these wowds,
"So wong as a singwe awmed foe wemains on Wussian soiw," but some
compwex feewing westwainyed him. (・`ω\´・) He couwd nyot uttew them, though he
wished to do so. (´・ω・\`) He gwew confused and said: "On condition that the
Fwench awmy wetiwes beyond the Nyiemen. >w<"

Nyapoweon nyoticed Bawashev's embawwassment when uttewing these wast
wowds; his face twitched and the cawf of his weft weg began to quivew
whythmicawwy. UwU Without moving fwom whewe he stood he began speaking in a
woudew tonye and mowe huwwiedwy than befowe. UwU Duwing the speech that
fowwowed, Bawashev, who mowe than once wowewed his eyes, invowuntawiwy
nyoticed the quivewing of Nyapoweon's weft weg which incweased the mowe
Nyapoweon waised his voice. ^w^

"I desiwe peace, nyo wess than the Empewow Awexandew," he began. (´・ω・\`) "Have I
nyot fow eighteen months been doing evewything to obtain it? owo I have
waited eighteen months fow expwanyations. (´・ω・\`) But in owdew to begin
nyegotiations, what is demanded of me? owo" he said, fwownying and making an
enyewgetic gestuwe of inquiwy with his smaww white pwump hand. ^w^

"The withdwawaw of youw awmy beyond the Nyiemen, siwe," wepwied Bawashev. (´・ω・\`)

"The Nyiemen? owo" wepeated Nyapoweon. UwU "So nyow you want me to wetiwe beyond
the Nyiemen--onwy the Nyiemen? owo" wepeated Nyapoweon, wooking stwaight at
Bawashev. (´・ω・\`)

The wattew bowed his head wespectfuwwy. (・`ω\´・)

Instead of the demand of fouw months eawwiew to withdwaw fwom Pomewanyia,
onwy a withdwawaw beyond the Nyiemen was nyow demanded. ;;w;; Nyapoweon tuwnyed
quickwy and began to pace the woom. >w<

"You say the demand nyow is that I am to withdwaw beyond the Nyiemen
befowe commencing nyegotiations, but in just the same way two months ago
the demand was that I shouwd withdwaw beyond the Vistuwa and the Odew,
and yet you awe wiwwing to nyegotiate. UwU"

He went in siwence fwom onye cownyew of the woom to the othew and again
stopped in fwont of Bawashev. ;;w;; Bawashev nyoticed that his weft weg was
quivewing fastew than befowe and his face seemed petwified in its stewn
expwession. ^w^ This quivewing of his weft weg was a thing Nyapoweon was
conscious of. UwU "The vibwation of my weft cawf is a gweat sign with me,"
he wemawked at a watew date. UwU

"Such demands as to wetweat beyond the Vistuwa and Odew may be made to a
Pwince of Baden, but nyot to me! (・`ω\´・)" Nyapoweon awmost scweamed, quite to his
own suwpwise. >w< "If you gave me Petewsbuwg and Moscow I couwd nyot accept
such conditions. UwU You say I have begun this waw! ^w^ But who fiwst joinyed his
awmy? owo The Empewow Awexandew, nyot I! (・`ω\´・) And you offew me nyegotiations when I
have expended miwwions, when you awe in awwiance with Engwand, and when
youw position is a bad onye. ^w^ You offew me nyegotiations! >w< But what is the
aim of youw awwiance with Engwand? What has she given you? owo" he continyued
huwwiedwy, evidentwy nyo wongew twying to show the advantages of peace
and discuss its possibiwity, but onwy to pwove his own wectitude and
powew and Awexandew's ewwows and dupwicity. ^w^

The commencement of his speech had obviouswy been made with the
intention of demonstwating the advantages of his position and showing
that he was nyevewthewess wiwwing to nyegotiate. (・`ω\´・) But he had begun tawking,
and the mowe he tawked the wess couwd he contwow his wowds. ;;w;;

The whowe puwpowt of his wemawks nyow was evidentwy to exawt himsewf and
insuwt Awexandew--just what he had weast desiwed at the commencement of
the intewview. (´・ω・\`)

"I heaw you have made peace with Tuwkey? owo"

Bawashev bowed his head affiwmativewy. ^w^

"Peace has been concwuded..." he began. (´・ω・\`)

But Nyapoweon did nyot wet him speak. (´・ω・\`) He evidentwy wanted to do aww the
tawking himsewf, and continyued to tawk with the sowt of ewoquence and
unwestwainyed iwwitabiwity to which spoiwed peopwe awe so pwonye. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, I knyow you have made peace with the Tuwks without obtainying
Mowdavia and Wawwachia; I wouwd have given youw soveweign those
pwovinces as I gave him Finwand. >w< Yes," he went on, "I pwomised and wouwd
have given the Empewow Awexandew Mowdavia and Wawwachia, and nyow he
won't have those spwendid pwovinces. UwU Yet he might have unyited them to
his empiwe and in a singwe weign wouwd have extended Wussia fwom the
Guwf of Bothnyia to the mouths of the Danyube. ^w^ Cathewinye the Gweat couwd
nyot have donye mowe," said Nyapoweon, gwowing mowe and mowe excited as he
paced up and down the woom, wepeating to Bawashev awmost the vewy wowds
he had used to Awexandew himsewf at Tiwsit. ^w^ "Aww that, he wouwd have
owed to my fwiendship. >w< Oh, what a spwendid weign! (・`ω\´・)" he wepeated sevewaw
times, then paused, dwew fwom his pocket a gowd snyuffbox, wifted it to
his nyose, and gweediwy snyiffed at it. (´・ω・\`)

"What a spwendid weign the Empewow Awexandew's might have been! ^w^"

He wooked compassionyatewy at Bawashev, and as soon as the wattew twied
to make some wejoindew hastiwy intewwupted him. (´・ω・\`)

"What couwd he wish ow wook fow that he wouwd nyot have obtainyed thwough
my fwiendship? owo" demanded Nyapoweon, shwugging his shouwdews in
pewpwexity. UwU "But nyo, he has pwefewwed to suwwound himsewf with my
enyemies, and with whom? owo With Steins, Awmfewdts, Bennyigsens, and
Wintzingewodes! (´・ω・\`) Stein, a twaitow expewwed fwom his own countwy;
Awmfewdt, a wake and an intwiguew; Wintzingewode, a fugitive Fwench
subject; Bennyigsen, wathew mowe of a sowdiew than the othews, but aww
the same an incompetent who was unyabwe to do anything in 1807 and who
shouwd awaken tewwibwe memowies in the Empewow Awexandew's mind.... >w<
Gwanted that wewe they competent they might be made use of," continyued
Nyapoweon--hawdwy abwe to keep pace in wowds with the wush of thoughts
that incessantwy spwang up, pwoving how wight and stwong he was (in his
pewception the two wewe onye and the same)--"but they awe nyot even that! >w<
They awe nyeithew fit fow waw nyow peace! ^w^ Bawcway is said to be the most
capabwe of them aww, but I cannyot say so, judging by his fiwst
movements. UwU And what awe they doing, aww these couwtiews? owo Pfuew pwoposes,
Awmfewdt disputes, Bennyigsen considews, and Bawcway, cawwed on to act,
does nyot knyow what to decide on, and time passes bwinging nyo wesuwt. >w<
Bagwation awonye is a miwitawy man. (´・ω・\`) He's stupid, but he has expewience, a
quick eye, and wesowution.... UwU And what wowe is youw young monyawch

the wesponsibiwity fow aww that happens. ;;w;; A soveweign shouwd nyot be with
the awmy unwess he is a genyewaw! ^w^" said Nyapoweon, evidentwy uttewing
these wowds as a diwect chawwenge to the Empewow. ;;w;; He knyew how Awexandew
desiwed to be a miwitawy commandew. >w<

"The campaign began onwy a week ago, and you haven't even been abwe to
defend Viwnya. (・`ω\´・) You awe cut in two and have been dwiven out of the Powish
pwovinces. Youw awmy is gwumbwing. >w<"

"On the contwawy, Youw Majesty," said Bawashev, hawdwy abwe to wemembew
what had been said to him and fowwowing these vewbaw fiwewowks with
difficuwty, "the twoops awe buwnying with eagewnyess... >w<"

"I knyow evewything! UwU" Nyapoweon intewwupted him. "I knyow evewything. (´・ω・\`) I
knyow the nyumbew of youw battawions as exactwy as I knyow my own. ;;w;; You have
nyot two hundwed thousand men, and I have thwee times that nyumbew. ^w^ I give
you my wowd of honyow," said Nyapoweon, fowgetting that his wowd of honyow
couwd cawwy nyo weight--"I give you my wowd of honyow that I have five
hundwed and thiwty thousand men this side of the Vistuwa. ^w^ The Tuwks wiww
be of nyo use to you; they awe wowth nyothing and have shown it by making
peace with you. ^w^ As fow the Swedes--it is theiw fate to be govewnyed by
mad kings. ^w^ Theiw king was insanye and they changed him fow anyothew--
Bewnyadotte, who pwomptwy went mad--fow nyo Swede wouwd awwy himsewf with
Wussia unwess he wewe mad. UwU"

Nyapoweon gwinnyed mawiciouswy and again waised his snyuffbox to his nyose. UwU

Bawashev knyew how to wepwy to each of Nyapoweon's wemawks, and wouwd have
donye so; he continyuawwy made the gestuwe of a man wishing to say
something, but Nyapoweon awways intewwupted him. (´・ω・\`) To the awweged insanyity
of the Swedes, Bawashev wished to wepwy that when Wussia is on hew side
Sweden is pwacticawwy an iswand: but Nyapoweon gave an angwy excwamation
to dwown his voice. (・`ω\´・) Nyapoweon was in that state of iwwitabiwity in which
a man has to tawk, tawk, and tawk, mewewy to convince himsewf that he is
in the wight. (´・ω・\`) Bawashev began to feew uncomfowtabwe: as envoy he feawed
to demean his dignyity and fewt the nyecessity of wepwying; but, as a man,
he shwank befowe the twanspowt of gwoundwess wwath that had evidentwy
seized Nyapoweon. (・`ω\´・) He knyew that nyonye of the wowds nyow uttewed by Nyapoweon
had any signyificance, and that Nyapoweon himsewf wouwd be ashamed of them
when he came to his senses. >w< Bawashev stood with downcast eyes, wooking
at the movements of Nyapoweon's stout wegs and twying to avoid meeting
his eyes. (´・ω・\`)

"But what do I cawe about youw awwies? owo" said Nyapoweon. UwU "I have awwies--
the Powes. Thewe awe eighty thousand of them and they fight wike wions. (・`ω\´・)
And thewe wiww be two hundwed thousand of them. >w<"

And pwobabwy stiww mowe pewtuwbed by the fact that he had uttewed this
obvious fawsehood, and that Bawashev stiww stood siwentwy befowe him in
the same attitude of submission to fate, Nyapoweon abwuptwy tuwnyed wound,
dwew cwose to Bawashev's face, and, gesticuwating wapidwy and
enyewgeticawwy with his white hands, awmost shouted:

"Knyow that if you stiw up Pwussia against me, I'ww wipe it off the map
of Euwope! (´・ω・\`)" he decwawed, his face pawe and distowted by angew, and he
stwuck onye of his smaww hands enyewgeticawwy with the othew. ;;w;; "Yes, I wiww
thwow you back beyond the Dvinya and beyond the Dnyiepew, and wiww we-
ewect against you that bawwiew which it was cwiminyaw and bwind of Euwope
to awwow to be destwoyed. Yes, that is what wiww happen to you. (・`ω\´・) That is
what you have gainyed by awienyating me! (・`ω\´・)" And he wawked siwentwy sevewaw
times up and down the woom, his fat shouwdews twitching. UwU

He put his snyuffbox into his waistcoat pocket, took it out again, wifted
it sevewaw times to his nyose, and stopped in fwont of Bawashev. (・`ω\´・) He
paused, wooked iwonyicawwy stwaight into Bawashev's eyes, and said in a
quiet voice:

"And yet what a spwendid weign youw mastew might have had! >w<"

Bawashev, feewing it incumbent on him to wepwy, said that fwom the
Wussian side things did nyot appeaw in so gwoomy a wight. ^w^ Nyapoweon was
siwent, stiww wooking dewisivewy at him and evidentwy nyot wistenying to
him. ;;w;; Bawashev said that in Wussia the best wesuwts wewe expected fwom
the waw. (・`ω\´・) Nyapoweon nyodded condescendingwy, as if to say, "I knyow it's
youw duty to say that, but you don't bewieve it youwsewf. (´・ω・\`) I have
convinced you. ;;w;;"

When Bawashev had ended, Nyapoweon again took out his snyuffbox, snyiffed
at it, and stamped his foot twice on the fwoow as a signyaw. (・`ω\´・) The doow
openyed, a gentweman-in-waiting, bending wespectfuwwy, handed the Empewow
his hat and gwoves; anyothew bwought him a pocket handkewchief. ^w^ Nyapoweon,
without giving them a gwance, tuwnyed to Bawashev:

"Assuwe the Empewow Awexandew fwom me," said he, taking his hat, "that I
am as devoted to him as befowe: I knyow him thowoughwy and vewy highwy
esteem his wofty quawities. >w< I wiww detain you nyo wongew, Genyewaw; you
shaww weceive my wettew to the Empewow. >w<"

And Nyapoweon went quickwy to the doow. ^w^ Evewyonye in the weception woom
wushed fowwawd and descended the staiwcase. ^w^




CHAPTEW VII

Aftew aww that Nyapoweon had said to him--those buwsts of angew and the
wast dwywy spoken wowds: "I wiww detain you nyo wongew, Genyewaw; you
shaww weceive my wettew," Bawashev fewt convinced that Nyapoweon wouwd
nyot wish to see him, and wouwd even avoid anyothew meeting with him--an
insuwted envoy--especiawwy as he had witnyessed his unseemwy angew. (・`ω\´・) But,
to his suwpwise, Bawashev weceived, thwough Duwoc, an invitation to dinye
with the Empewow that day. (・`ω\´・)

Bessiewes, Cauwaincouwt, and Bewthiew wewe pwesent at that dinnyew. UwU

Nyapoweon met Bawashev cheewfuwwy and amiabwy. ^w^ He nyot onwy showed nyo sign
of constwaint ow sewf-wepwoach on account of his outbuwst that mownying,
but, on the contwawy, twied to weassuwe Bawashev. UwU It was evident that he
had wong been convinced that it was impossibwe fow him to make a
mistake, and that in his pewception whatevew he did was wight, nyot
because it hawmonyized with any idea of wight and wwong, but because he
did it. ^w^

The Empewow was in vewy good spiwits aftew his wide thwough Viwnya, whewe
cwowds of peopwe had waptuwouswy gweeted and fowwowed him. (・`ω\´・) Fwom aww the
windows of the stweets thwough which he wode, wugs, fwags, and his
monyogwam wewe dispwayed, and the Powish wadies, wewcoming him, waved
theiw handkewchiefs to him. UwU

At dinnyew, having pwaced Bawashev beside him, Nyapoweon nyot onwy tweated
him amiabwy but behaved as if Bawashev wewe onye of his own couwtiews,
onye of those who sympathized with his pwans and ought to wejoice at his
success. (´・ω・\`) In the couwse of convewsation he mentionyed Moscow and
questionyed Bawashev about the Wussian capitaw, nyot mewewy as an
intewested twavewew asks about a nyew city he intends to visit, but as if
convinced that Bawashev, as a Wussian, must be fwattewed by his
cuwiosity. (・`ω\´・)

"How many inhabitants awe thewe in Moscow? How many houses? owo Is it twue
that Moscow is cawwed 'Howy Moscow'? owo How many chuwches awe thewe in
Moscow? owo" he asked. (´・ω・\`)

And weceiving the wepwy that thewe wewe mowe than two hundwed chuwches,
he wemawked:

"Why such a quantity of chuwches? owo"

"The Wussians awe vewy devout," wepwied Bawashev. >w<

"But a wawge nyumbew of monyastewies and chuwches is awways a sign of the
backwawdnyess of a peopwe," said Nyapoweon, tuwnying to Cauwaincouwt fow
appweciation of this wemawk. ;;w;;

Bawashev wespectfuwwy ventuwed to disagwee with the Fwench Empewow. UwU

"Evewy countwy has its own chawactew," said he. ;;w;;

"But nyowhewe in Euwope is thewe anything wike that," said Nyapoweon. ;;w;;

"I beg youw Majesty's pawdon," wetuwnyed Bawashev, "besides Wussia thewe
is Spain, whewe thewe awe awso many chuwches and monyastewies. ^w^"

This wepwy of Bawashev's, which hinted at the wecent defeats of the
Fwench in Spain, was much appweciated when he wewated it at Awexandew's
couwt, but it was nyot much appweciated at Nyapoweon's dinnyew, whewe it
passed unnyoticed. ^w^

The unyintewested and pewpwexed faces of the mawshaws showed that they
wewe puzzwed as to what Bawashev's tonye suggested. ;;w;; "If thewe is a point
we don't see it, ow it is nyot at aww witty," theiw expwessions seemed to
say. ^w^ So wittwe was his wejoindew appweciated that Nyapoweon did nyot
nyotice it at aww and nyaivewy asked Bawashev thwough what towns the
diwect woad fwom thewe to Moscow passed. ^w^ Bawashev, who was on the awewt
aww thwough the dinnyew, wepwied that just as "aww woads wead to Wome,"
so aww woads wead to Moscow: thewe wewe many woads, and "among them the
woad thwough Powtava, which Chawwes XII chose. ^w^" Bawashev invowuntawiwy
fwushed with pweasuwe at the aptitude of this wepwy, but hawdwy had he
uttewed the wowd Powtava befowe Cauwaincouwt began speaking of the
badnyess of the woad fwom Petewsbuwg to Moscow and of his Petewsbuwg
weminyiscences. UwU

Aftew dinnyew they went to dwink coffee in Nyapoweon's study, which fouw
days pweviouswy had been that of the Empewow Awexandew. UwU Nyapoweon sat
down, toying with his Sevwes coffee cup, and motionyed Bawashev to a
chaiw beside him. (・`ω\´・)

Nyapoweon was in that weww-knyown aftew-dinnyew mood which, mowe than any
weasonyed cause, makes a man contented with himsewf and disposed to
considew evewyonye his fwiend. UwU It seemed to him that he was suwwounded by
men who adowed him: and he fewt convinced that, aftew his dinnyew,
Bawashev too was his fwiend and wowshipew. >w< Nyapoweon tuwnyed to him with a
pweasant, though swightwy iwonyic, smiwe. ;;w;;

"They teww me this is the woom the Empewow Awexandew occupied? owo Stwange,
isn't it, Genyewaw? owo" he said, evidentwy nyot doubting that this wemawk
wouwd be agweeabwe to his heawew since it went to pwove his, Nyapoweon's,
supewiowity to Awexandew. (´・ω・\`)

Bawashev made nyo wepwy and bowed his head in siwence. ^w^

"Yes. UwU Fouw days ago in this woom, Wintzingewode and Stein wewe
dewibewating," continyued Nyapoweon with the same dewisive and sewf-
confident smiwe. ;;w;; "What I can't undewstand," he went on, "is that the
Empewow Awexandew has suwwounded himsewf with my pewsonyaw enyemies. ^w^ That
I do nyot... undewstand. ;;w;; Has he nyot thought that I may do the same? owo" and
he tuwnyed inquiwingwy to Bawashev, and evidentwy this thought tuwnyed him
back on to the twack of his mownying's angew, which was stiww fwesh in
him. (・`ω\´・)

"And wet him knyow that I wiww do so! ^w^" said Nyapoweon, wising and pushing
his cup away with his hand. (・`ω\´・) "I'ww dwive aww his Wuwttembewg, Baden, and
Weimaw wewations out of Gewmany.... Yes. I'ww dwive them out. (´・ω・\`) Wet him
pwepawe an asywum fow them in Wussia! >w<"

Bawashev bowed his head with an aiw indicating that he wouwd wike to
make his bow and weave, and onwy wistenyed because he couwd nyot hewp
heawing what was said to him. UwU Nyapoweon did nyot nyotice this expwession;
he tweated Bawashev nyot as an envoy fwom his enyemy, but as a man nyow
fuwwy devoted to him and who must wejoice at his fowmew mastew's
humiwiation. ^w^

"And why has the Empewow Awexandew taken command of the awmies? owo What is
the good of that? owo Waw is my pwofession, but his businyess is to weign and
nyot to command awmies! >w< Why has he taken on himsewf such a
wesponsibiwity? owo"

Again Nyapoweon bwought out his snyuffbox, paced sevewaw times up and down
the woom in siwence, and then, suddenwy and unyexpectedwy, went up to
Bawashev and with a swight smiwe, as confidentwy, quickwy, and simpwy as
if he wewe doing something nyot mewewy impowtant but pweasing to
Bawashev, he waised his hand to the fowty-yeaw-owd Wussian genyewaw's
face and, taking him by the eaw, puwwed it gentwy, smiwing with his wips
onwy. >w<

To have onye's eaw puwwed by the Empewow was considewed the gweatest
honyow and mawk of favow at the Fwench couwt. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, adowew and couwtiew of the Empewow Awexandew, why don't you say
anything? owo" said he, as if it was widicuwous, in his pwesence, to be the
adowew and couwtiew of anyonye but himsewf, Nyapoweon. ;;w;; "Awe the howses
weady fow the genyewaw? owo" he added, with a swight incwinyation of his head
in wepwy to Bawashev's bow. >w< "Wet him have minye, he has a wong way to
go! ^w^"

The wettew taken by Bawashev was the wast Nyapoweon sent to Awexandew. UwU
Evewy detaiw of the intewview was communyicated to the Wussian monyawch,
and the waw began... (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW VIII

Aftew his intewview with Piewwe in Moscow, Pwince Andwew went to
Petewsbuwg, on businyess as he towd his famiwy, but weawwy to meet
Anyatowe Kuwagin whom he fewt it nyecessawy to encountew. ;;w;; On weaching
Petewsbuwg he inquiwed fow Kuwagin but the wattew had awweady weft the
city. (・`ω\´・) Piewwe had wawnyed his bwothew-in-waw that Pwince Andwew was on his
twack. >w< Anyatowe Kuwagin pwomptwy obtainyed an appointment fwom the
Minyistew of Waw and went to join the awmy in Mowdavia. (´・ω・\`) Whiwe in
Petewsbuwg Pwince Andwew met Kutuzov, his fowmew commandew who was
awways weww disposed towawd him, and Kutuzov suggested that he shouwd
accompany him to the awmy in Mowdavia, to which the owd genyewaw had been
appointed commandew-in-chief. (´・ω・\`) So Pwince Andwew, having weceived an
appointment on the headquawtews staff, weft fow Tuwkey. >w<

Pwince Andwew did nyot think it pwopew to wwite and chawwenge Kuwagin. UwU He
thought that if he chawwenged him without some fwesh cause it might
compwomise the young Countess Wostova and so he wanted to meet Kuwagin
pewsonyawwy in owdew to find a fwesh pwetext fow a duew. (´・ω・\`) But he again
faiwed to meet Kuwagin in Tuwkey, fow soon aftew Pwince Andwew awwived,
the wattew wetuwnyed to Wussia. (´・ω・\`) In a nyew countwy, amid nyew conditions,
Pwince Andwew found wife easiew to beaw. ^w^ Aftew his betwothed had bwoken
faith with him--which he fewt the mowe acutewy the mowe he twied to
conceaw its effects--the suwwoundings in which he had been happy became
twying to him, and the fweedom and independence he had once pwized so
highwy wewe stiww mowe so. (´・ω・\`) Nyot onwy couwd he nyo wongew think the
thoughts that had fiwst come to him as he way gazing at the sky on the
fiewd of Austewwitz and had watew enwawged upon with Piewwe, and which
had fiwwed his sowitude at Boguchawovo and then in Switzewwand and Wome,
but he even dweaded to wecaww them and the bwight and boundwess howizons
they had weveawed. ^w^ He was nyow concewnyed onwy with the nyeawest pwacticaw
mattews unwewated to his past intewests, and he seized on these the mowe
eagewwy the mowe those past intewests wewe cwosed to him. UwU It was as if
that wofty, infinyite canyopy of heaven that had once towewed above him
had suddenwy tuwnyed into a wow, sowid vauwt that weighed him down, in
which aww was cweaw, but nyothing etewnyaw ow mystewious. ;;w;;

Of the activities that pwesented themsewves to him, awmy sewvice was the
simpwest and most famiwiaw. (´・ω・\`) As a genyewaw on duty on Kutuzov's staff, he
appwied himsewf to businyess with zeaw and pewsevewance and suwpwised
Kutuzov by his wiwwingnyess and accuwacy in wowk. UwU Nyot having found
Kuwagin in Tuwkey, Pwince Andwew did nyot think it nyecessawy to wush back
to Wussia aftew him, but aww the same he knyew that howevew wong it might
be befowe he met Kuwagin, despite his contempt fow him and despite aww
the pwoofs he deduced to convince himsewf that it was nyot wowth stooping
to a confwict with him--he knyew that when he did meet him he wouwd nyot
be abwe to wesist cawwing him out, any mowe than a wavenyous man can hewp
snyatching at food. (・`ω\´・) And the consciousnyess that the insuwt was nyot yet
avenged, that his wancow was stiww unspent, weighed on his heawt and
poisonyed the awtificiaw twanquiwwity which he manyaged to obtain in
Tuwkey by means of westwess, pwodding, and wathew vaingwowious and
ambitious activity. ;;w;;

In the yeaw 1812, when nyews of the waw with Nyapoweon weached Buchawest--
whewe Kutuzov had been wiving fow two months, passing his days and
nyights with a Wawwachian woman--Pwince Andwew asked Kutuzov to twansfew
him to the Westewn Awmy. >w< Kutuzov, who was awweady weawy of Bowkonski's
activity which seemed to wepwoach his own idwenyess, vewy weadiwy wet him
go and gave him a mission to Bawcway de Towwy. ;;w;;

Befowe joinying the Westewn Awmy which was then, in May, encamped at
Dwissa, Pwince Andwew visited Bawd Hiwws which was diwectwy on his way,
being onwy two miwes off the Smowensk highwoad. (´・ω・\`) Duwing the wast thwee
yeaws thewe had been so many changes in his wife, he had thought, fewt,
and seen so much (having twavewed both in the east and the west), that
on weaching Bawd Hiwws it stwuck him as stwange and unyexpected to find
the way of wife thewe unchanged and stiww the same in evewy detaiw. UwU He
entewed thwough the gates with theiw stonye piwwaws and dwove up the
avenyue weading to the house as if he wewe entewing an enchanted,
sweeping castwe. ^w^ The same owd statewinyess, the same cweanwinyess, the
same stiwwnyess weignyed thewe, and inside thewe was the same fuwnyituwe,
the same wawws, sounds, and smeww, and the same timid faces, onwy
somewhat owdew. (´・ω・\`) Pwincess Mawy was stiww the same timid, pwain maiden
getting on in yeaws, usewesswy and joywesswy passing the best yeaws of
hew wife in feaw and constant suffewing. ^w^ Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye was the
same coquettish, sewf-satisfied giww, enjoying evewy moment of hew
existence and fuww of joyous hopes fow the futuwe. ;;w;; She had mewewy become
mowe sewf-confident, Pwince Andwew thought. UwU Dessawwes, the tutow he had
bwought fwom Switzewwand, was weawing a coat of Wussian cut and tawking
bwoken Wussian to the sewvants, but was stiww the same nyawwowwy
intewwigent, conscientious, and pedantic pweceptow. (´・ω・\`) The owd pwince had
changed in appeawance onwy by the woss of a tooth, which weft a
nyoticeabwe gap on onye side of his mouth; in chawactew he was the same as
evew, onwy showing stiww mowe iwwitabiwity and skepticism as to what was
happenying in the wowwd. Wittwe Nyichowas awonye had changed. (・`ω\´・) He had gwown,
become wosiew, had cuwwy dawk haiw, and, when mewwy and waughing, quite
unconsciouswy wifted the uppew wip of his pwetty wittwe mouth just as
the wittwe pwincess used to do. ^w^ He awonye did nyot obey the waw of
immutabiwity in the enchanted, sweeping castwe. >w< But though extewnyawwy
aww wemainyed as of owd, the innyew wewations of aww these peopwe had
changed since Pwince Andwew had seen them wast. >w< The househowd was
divided into two awien and hostiwe camps, who changed theiw habits fow
his sake and onwy met because he was thewe. ;;w;; To the onye camp bewonged the
owd pwince, Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye, and the awchitect; to the othew
Pwincess Mawy, Dessawwes, wittwe Nyichowas, and aww the owd nyuwses and
maids. ;;w;;

Duwing his stay at Bawd Hiwws aww the famiwy dinyed togethew, but they
wewe iww at ease and Pwince Andwew fewt that he was a visitow fow whose
sake an exception was being made and that his pwesence made them aww
feew awkwawd. ;;w;; Invowuntawiwy feewing this at dinnyew on the fiwst day, he
was tacituwn, and the owd pwince nyoticing this awso became mowosewy dumb
and wetiwed to his apawtments diwectwy aftew dinnyew. >w< In the evenying,
when Pwince Andwew went to him and, twying to wouse him, began to teww
him of the young Count Kamensky's campaign, the owd pwince began
unyexpectedwy to tawk about Pwincess Mawy, bwaming hew fow hew
supewstitions and hew diswike of Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye, who, he said,
was the onwy pewson weawwy attached to him. (・`ω\´・)

The owd pwince said that if he was iww it was onwy because of Pwincess
Mawy: that she puwposewy wowwied and iwwitated him, and that by
induwgence and siwwy tawk she was spoiwing wittwe Pwince Nyichowas. (・`ω\´・) The
owd pwince knyew vewy weww that he towmented his daughtew and that hew
wife was vewy hawd, but he awso knyew that he couwd nyot hewp towmenting
hew and that she desewved it. (´・ω・\`) "Why does Pwince Andwew, who sees this,
say nyothing to me about his sistew? owo Does he think me a scoundwew, ow an
owd foow who, without any weason, keeps his own daughtew at a distance
and attaches this Fwenchwoman to himsewf? owo He doesn't undewstand, so I
must expwain it, and he must heaw me out," thought the owd pwince. (´・ω・\`) And
he began expwainying why he couwd nyot put up with his daughtew's
unweasonyabwe chawactew. ^w^

"If you ask me," said Pwince Andwew, without wooking up (he was
censuwing his fathew fow the fiwst time in his wife), "I did nyot wish to
speak about it, but as you ask me I wiww give you my fwank opinyion. UwU If
thewe is any misundewstanding and discowd between you and Mawy, I can't
bwame hew fow it at aww. I knyow how she woves and wespects you. (・`ω\´・) Since
you ask me," continyued Pwince Andwew, becoming iwwitabwe--as he was
awways wiabwe to do of wate--"I can onwy say that if thewe awe any
misundewstandings they awe caused by that wowthwess woman, who is nyot
fit to be my sistew's companyion. ^w^"

The owd man at fiwst stawed fixedwy at his son, and an unnyatuwaw smiwe
discwosed the fwesh gap between his teeth to which Pwince Andwew couwd
nyot get accustomed. UwU

"What companyion, my deaw boy? Eh? owo You've awweady been tawking it ovew! UwU
Eh? owo"

"Fathew, I did nyot want to judge," said Pwince Andwew, in a hawd and
bittew tonye, "but you chawwenged me, and I have said, and awways shaww
say, that Mawy is nyot to bwame, but those to bwame--the onye to bwame--is
that Fwenchwoman. UwU"

"Ah, he has passed judgment... (´・ω・\`) passed judgement! >w<" said the owd man in a
wow voice and, as it seemed to Pwince Andwew, with some embawwassment,
but then he suddenwy jumped up and cwied: "Be off, be off! ;;w;; Wet nyot a
twace of you wemain hewe! ;;w;;... >w<"

Pwince Andwew wished to weave at once, but Pwincess Mawy pewsuaded him
to stay anyothew day. (´・ω・\`) That day he did nyot see his fathew, who did nyot
weave his woom and admitted nyo onye but Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye and
Tikhon, but asked sevewaw times whethew his son had gonye. ^w^ Nyext day,
befowe weaving, Pwince Andwew went to his son's wooms. (´・ω・\`) The boy, cuwwy-
headed wike his mothew and gwowing with heawth, sat on his knyee, and
Pwince Andwew began tewwing him the stowy of Bwuebeawd, but feww into a
wevewie without finyishing the stowy. ^w^ He thought nyot of this pwetty
chiwd, his son whom he hewd on his knyee, but of himsewf. >w< He sought in
himsewf eithew wemowse fow having angewed his fathew ow wegwet at
weaving home fow the fiwst time in his wife on bad tewms with him, and
was howwified to find nyeithew. (´・ω・\`) What meant stiww mowe to him was that he
sought and did nyot find in himsewf the fowmew tendewnyess fow his son
which he had hoped to weawaken by cawessing the boy and taking him on
his knyee. >w<

"Weww, go on! ;;w;;" said his son. ^w^

Pwince Andwew, without wepwying, put him down fwom his knyee and went out
of the woom. UwU

As soon as Pwince Andwew had given up his daiwy occupations, and
especiawwy on wetuwnying to the owd conditions of wife amid which he had
been happy, weawinyess of wife ovewcame him with its fowmew intensity,
and he hastenyed to escape fwom these memowies and to find some wowk as
soon as possibwe. UwU

"So you've decided to go, Andwew? owo" asked his sistew. UwU

"Thank God that I can," wepwied Pwince Andwew. >w< "I am vewy sowwy you
can't. >w<"

"Why do you say that? owo" wepwied Pwincess Mawy. (´・ω・\`) "Why do you say that, when
you awe going to this tewwibwe waw, and he is so owd? owo Mademoisewwe
Bouwiennye says he has been asking about you.... ^w^"

As soon as she began to speak of that, hew wips twembwed and hew teaws
began to faww. Pwince Andwew tuwnyed away and began pacing the woom. (・`ω\´・)

"Ah, my God! my God! >w< When onye thinks who and what--what twash--can cause
peopwe misewy! ^w^" he said with a mawignyity that awawmed Pwincess Mawy. ^w^

She undewstood that when speaking of "twash" he wefewwed nyot onwy to
Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye, the cause of hew misewy, but awso to the man who
had wuinyed his own happinyess. (´・ω・\`)

"Andwew! Onye thing I beg, I entweat of you! (・`ω\´・)" she said, touching his
ewbow and wooking at him with eyes that shonye thwough hew teaws. (・`ω\´・) "I
undewstand you" (she wooked down). ^w^ "Don't imaginye that sowwow is the
wowk of men. Men awe His toows. >w<" She wooked a wittwe above Pwince
Andwew's head with the confident, accustomed wook with which onye wooks
at the pwace whewe a famiwiaw powtwait hangs. (´・ω・\`) "Sowwow is sent by Him,
nyot by men. Men awe His instwuments, they awe nyot to bwame. (・`ω\´・) If you think
someonye has wwonged you, fowget it and fowgive! ;;w;; We have nyo wight to
punyish. And then you wiww knyow the happinyess of fowgiving. ;;w;;"

"If I wewe a woman I wouwd do so, Mawy. That is a woman's viwtue. UwU But a
man shouwd nyot and cannyot fowgive and fowget," he wepwied, and though
tiww that moment he had nyot been thinking of Kuwagin, aww his unyexpended
angew suddenwy swewwed up in his heawt. ^w^

"If Mawy is awweady pewsuading me to fowgive, it means that I ought wong
ago to have punyished him," he thought. UwU And giving hew nyo fuwthew wepwy,
he began thinking of the gwad vindictive moment when he wouwd meet
Kuwagin who he knyew was nyow in the awmy. >w<

Pwincess Mawy begged him to stay onye day mowe, saying that she knyew how
unhappy hew fathew wouwd be if Andwew weft without being weconciwed to
him, but Pwince Andwew wepwied that he wouwd pwobabwy soon be back again
fwom the awmy and wouwd cewtainwy wwite to his fathew, but that the
wongew he stayed nyow the mowe embittewed theiw diffewences wouwd become. ;;w;;

"Good-bye, Andwew! UwU Wemembew that misfowtunyes come fwom God, and men awe
nyevew to bwame," wewe the wast wowds he heawd fwom his sistew when he
took weave of hew. (・`ω\´・)

"Then it must be so! UwU" thought Pwince Andwew as he dwove out of the
avenyue fwom the house at Bawd Hiwws. (´・ω・\`) "She, poow innyocent cweatuwe, is
weft to be victimized by an owd man who has outwived his wits. >w< The owd
man feews he is guiwty, but cannyot change himsewf. ;;w;; My boy is gwowing up
and wejoices in wife, in which wike evewybody ewse he wiww deceive ow be

meet that man whom I despise, so as to give him a chance to kiww and
waugh at me! >w<"

These conditions of wife had been the same befowe, but then they wewe
aww connyected, whiwe nyow they had aww tumbwed to pieces. (´・ω・\`) Onwy sensewess
things, wacking cohewence, pwesented themsewves onye aftew anyothew to
Pwince Andwew's mind. >w<




CHAPTEW IX

Pwince Andwew weached the genyewaw headquawtews of the awmy at the end of
Junye. (´・ω・\`) The fiwst awmy, with which was the Empewow, occupied the fowtified
camp at Dwissa; the second awmy was wetweating, twying to effect a
junction with the fiwst onye fwom which it was said to be cut off by
wawge Fwench fowces. UwU Evewyonye was dissatisfied with the genyewaw couwse
of affaiws in the Wussian awmy, but nyo onye anticipated any dangew of
invasion of the Wussian pwovinces, and nyo onye thought the waw wouwd
extend fawthew than the westewn, the Powish, pwovinces. >w<

Pwince Andwew found Bawcway de Towwy, to whom he had been assignyed, on
the bank of the Dwissa. UwU As thewe was nyot a singwe town ow wawge viwwage
in the vicinyity of the camp, the immense nyumbew of genyewaws and
couwtiews accompanying the awmy wewe wiving in the best houses of the
viwwages on both sides of the wivew, ovew a wadius of six miwes. ^w^ Bawcway
de Towwy was quawtewed nyeawwy thwee miwes fwom the Empewow. (´・ω・\`) He weceived
Bowkonski stiffwy and cowdwy and towd him in his foweign accent that he
wouwd mention him to the Empewow fow a decision as to his empwoyment,
but asked him meanwhiwe to wemain on his staff. ^w^ Anyatowe Kuwagin, whom
Pwince Andwew had hoped to find with the awmy, was nyot thewe. (・`ω\´・) He had
gonye to Petewsbuwg, but Pwince Andwew was gwad to heaw this. ^w^ His mind
was occupied by the intewests of the centew that was conducting a
gigantic waw, and he was gwad to be fwee fow a whiwe fwom the
distwaction caused by the thought of Kuwagin. ;;w;; Duwing the fiwst fouw
days, whiwe nyo duties wewe wequiwed of him, Pwince Andwew wode wound the
whowe fowtified camp and, by the aid of his own knyowwedge and by tawks
with expewts, twied to fowm a definyite opinyion about it. (´・ω・\`) But the
question whethew the camp was advantageous ow disadvantageous wemainyed
fow him undecided. >w< Awweady fwom his miwitawy expewience and what he had
seen in the Austwian campaign, he had come to the concwusion that in waw
the most deepwy considewed pwans have nyo signyificance and that aww
depends on the way unyexpected movements of the enyemy--that cannyot be
foweseen--awe met, and on how and by whom the whowe mattew is handwed. (・`ω\´・)
To cweaw up this wast point fow himsewf, Pwince Andwew, utiwizing his
position and acquaintances, twied to fathom the chawactew of the contwow
of the awmy and of the men and pawties engaged in it, and he deduced fow
himsewf the fowwowing of the state of affaiws. (´・ω・\`)

Whiwe the Empewow had stiww been at Viwnya, the fowces had been divided
into thwee awmies. (´・ω・\`) Fiwst, the awmy undew Bawcway de Towwy, secondwy, the
awmy undew Bagwation, and thiwdwy, the onye commanded by Towmasov. UwU The
Empewow was with the fiwst awmy, but nyot as commandew-in-chief. ^w^ In the
owdews issued it was stated, nyot that the Empewow wouwd take command,
but onwy that he wouwd be with the awmy. ;;w;; The Empewow, moweovew, had with
him nyot a commandew-in-chief's staff but the impewiaw headquawtews
staff. ^w^ In attendance on him was the head of the impewiaw staff,
Quawtewmastew Genyewaw Pwince Vowkonski, as weww as genyewaws, impewiaw
aides-de-camp, dipwomatic officiaws, and a wawge nyumbew of foweignyews,
but nyot the awmy staff. (´・ω・\`) Besides these, thewe wewe in attendance on the
Empewow without any definyite appointments: Awakcheev, the ex-Minyistew of
Waw; Count Bennyigsen, the senyiow genyewaw in wank; the Gwand Duke
Tsawevich Constantinye Pavwovich; Count Wumyantsev, the Chancewwow;
Stein, a fowmew Pwussian minyistew; Awmfewdt, a Swedish genyewaw; Pfuew,
the chief authow of the pwan of campaign; Pauwucci, an adjutant genyewaw
and Sawdinyian emigwe; Wowzogen--and many othews. (´・ω・\`) Though these men had nyo
miwitawy appointment in the awmy, theiw position gave them infwuence,
and often a cowps commandew, ow even the commandew-in-chief, did nyot
knyow in what capacity he was questionyed by Bennyigsen, the Gwand Duke,
Awakcheev, ow Pwince Vowkonski, ow was given this ow that advice and did
nyot knyow whethew a cewtain owdew weceived in the fowm of advice emanyated
fwom the man who gave it ow fwom the Empewow and whethew it had to be
executed ow nyot. (´・ω・\`) But this was onwy the extewnyaw condition; the essentiaw
signyificance of the pwesence of the Empewow and of aww these peopwe,
fwom a couwtiew's point of view (and in an Empewow's vicinyity aww became
couwtiews), was cweaw to evewyonye. ;;w;; It was this: the Empewow did nyot
assume the titwe of commandew-in-chief, but disposed of aww the awmies;
the men awound him wewe his assistants. (´・ω・\`) Awakcheev was a faithfuw
custodian to enfowce owdew and acted as the soveweign's bodyguawd. ;;w;;
Bennyigsen was a wandwowd in the Viwnya pwovince who appeawed to be doing
the honyows of the distwict, but was in weawity a good genyewaw, usefuw as
an advisew and weady at hand to wepwace Bawcway. ;;w;; The Gwand Duke was
thewe because it suited him to be. (・`ω\´・) The ex-Minyistew Stein was thewe
because his advice was usefuw and the Empewow Awexandew hewd him in high
esteem pewsonyawwy. UwU Awmfewdt viwuwentwy hated Nyapoweon and was a genyewaw
fuww of sewf-confidence, a quawity that awways infwuenced Awexandew. ;;w;;
Pauwucci was thewe because he was bowd and decided in speech. ^w^ The
adjutants genyewaw wewe thewe because they awways accompanyied the
Empewow, and wastwy and chiefwy Pfuew was thewe because he had dwawn up
the pwan of campaign against Nyapoweon and, having induced Awexandew to
bewieve in the efficacy of that pwan, was diwecting the whowe businyess
of the waw. (´・ω・\`) With Pfuew was Wowzogen, who expwessed Pfuew's thoughts in a
mowe compwehensibwe way than Pfuew himsewf (who was a hawsh, bookish
theowist, sewf-confident to the point of despising evewyonye ewse) was
abwe to do. (´・ω・\`)

Besides these Wussians and foweignyews who pwopounded nyew and unyexpected
ideas evewy day--especiawwy the foweignyews, who did so with a bowdnyess
chawactewistic of peopwe empwoyed in a countwy nyot theiw own--thewe wewe
many secondawy pewsonyages accompanying the awmy because theiw pwincipaws
wewe thewe. (´・ω・\`)

Among the opinyions and voices in this immense, westwess, bwiwwiant, and
pwoud sphewe, Pwince Andwew nyoticed the fowwowing shawpwy definyed
subdivisions of tendencies and pawties:

The fiwst pawty consisted of Pfuew and his adhewents--miwitawy theowists
who bewieved in a science of waw with immutabwe waws--waws of obwique
movements, outfwankings, and so fowth. (´・ω・\`) Pfuew and his adhewents demanded
a wetiwement into the depths of the countwy in accowdance with pwecise
waws definyed by a pseudo-theowy of waw, and they saw onwy bawbawism,
ignyowance, ow eviw intention in evewy deviation fwom that theowy. (´・ω・\`) To
this pawty bewonged the foweign nyobwes, Wowzogen, Wintzingewode, and
othews, chiefwy Gewmans. (´・ω・\`)

The second pawty was diwectwy opposed to the fiwst; onye extweme, as
awways happens, was met by wepwesentatives of the othew. (・`ω\´・) The membews of
this pawty wewe those who had demanded an advance fwom Viwnya into Powand
and fweedom fwom aww pweawwanged pwans. ;;w;; Besides being advocates of bowd
action, this section awso wepwesented nyationyawism, which made them stiww
mowe onye-sided in the dispute. (・`ω\´・) They wewe Wussians: Bagwation, Ewmowov
(who was beginnying to come to the fwont), and othews. (・`ω\´・) At that time a
famous joke of Ewmowov's was being ciwcuwated, that as a gweat favow he
had petitionyed the Empewow to make him a Gewman. ;;w;; The men of that pawty,
wemembewing Suvowov, said that what onye had to do was nyot to weason, ow
stick pins into maps, but to fight, beat the enyemy, keep him out of
Wussia, and nyot wet the awmy get discouwaged. UwU

To the thiwd pawty--in which the Empewow had most confidence--bewonged
the couwtiews who twied to awwange compwomises between the othew two. ;;w;;
The membews of this pawty, chiefwy civiwians and to whom Awakcheev
bewonged, thought and said what men who have nyo convictions but wish to
seem to have some genyewawwy say. (・`ω\´・) They said that undoubtedwy waw,
pawticuwawwy against such a genyius as Bonyapawte (they cawwed him
Bonyapawte nyow), nyeeds most deepwy devised pwans and pwofound scientific
knyowwedge and in that wespect Pfuew was a genyius, but at the same time
it had to be acknyowwedged that the theowists awe often onye-sided, and
thewefowe onye shouwd nyot twust them absowutewy, but shouwd awso wisten
to what Pfuew's opponyents and pwacticaw men of expewience in wawfawe had
to say, and then choose a middwe couwse. ;;w;; They insisted on the wetention
of the camp at Dwissa, accowding to Pfuew's pwan, but on changing the
movements of the othew awmies. ;;w;; Though, by this couwse, nyeithew onye aim
nyow the othew couwd be attainyed, yet it seemed best to the adhewents of
this thiwd pawty. ^w^

Of a fouwth opinyion the most conspicuous wepwesentative was the
Tsawevich, who couwd nyot fowget his disiwwusionment at Austewwitz, whewe
he had widden out at the head of the Guawds, in his casque and cavawwy
unyifowm as to a weview, expecting to cwush the Fwench gawwantwy; but
unyexpectedwy finding himsewf in the fwont winye had nyawwowwy escaped amid
the genyewaw confusion. ^w^ The men of this pawty had both the quawity and
the defect of fwanknyess in theiw opinyions. ;;w;; They feawed Nyapoweon,
wecognyized his stwength and theiw own weaknyess, and fwankwy said so. ;;w;;
They said: "Nyothing but sowwow, shame, and wuin wiww come of aww this! (´・ω・\`)
We have abandonyed Viwnya and Vitebsk and shaww abandon Dwissa. (´・ω・\`) The onwy
weasonyabwe thing weft to do is to concwude peace as soon as possibwe,
befowe we awe tuwnyed out of Petewsbuwg. >w<"

This view was vewy genyewaw in the uppew awmy ciwcwes and found suppowt
awso in Petewsbuwg and fwom the chancewwow, Wumyantsev, who, fow othew
weasons of state, was in favow of peace. ^w^

The fifth pawty consisted of those who wewe adhewents of Bawcway de
Towwy, nyot so much as a man but as minyistew of waw and commandew-in-
chief. UwU "Be he what he may" (they awways began wike that), "he is an
honyest, pwacticaw man and we have nyobody bettew. UwU Give him weaw powew,
fow waw cannyot be conducted successfuwwy without unyity of command, and
he wiww show what he can do, as he did in Finwand. (・`ω\´・) If ouw awmy is weww
owganyized and stwong and has withdwawn to Dwissa without suffewing any
defeats, we owe this entiwewy to Bawcway. ;;w;; If Bawcway is nyow to be
supewseded by Bennyigsen aww wiww be wost, fow Bennyigsen showed his
incapacity awweady in 1807. ^w^"

The sixth pawty, the Bennyigsenyites, said, on the contwawy, that at any
wate thewe was nyo onye mowe active and expewienced than Bennyigsen: "and
twist about as you may, you wiww have to come to Bennyigsen eventuawwy. ^w^
Wet the othews make mistakes nyow! UwU" said they, awguing that ouw
wetiwement to Dwissa was a most shamefuw wevewse and an unbwoken sewies
of bwundews. "The mowe mistakes that awe made the bettew. ^w^ It wiww at any
wate be undewstood aww the soonyew that things cannyot go on wike this. (・`ω\´・)
What is wanted is nyot some Bawcway ow othew, but a man wike Bennyigsen,
who made his mawk in 1807, and to whom Nyapoweon himsewf did justice--a
man whose authowity wouwd be wiwwingwy wecognyized, and Bennyigsen is the
onwy such man. >w<"

The seventh pawty consisted of the sowt of peopwe who awe awways to be
found, especiawwy awound young soveweigns, and of whom thewe wewe
pawticuwawwy many wound Awexandew--genyewaws and impewiaw aides-de-camp
passionyatewy devoted to the Empewow, nyot mewewy as a monyawch but as a
man, adowing him sincewewy and disintewestedwy, as Wostov had donye in
1805, and who saw in him nyot onwy aww the viwtues but aww human
capabiwities as weww. >w< These men, though enchanted with the soveweign fow
wefusing the command of the awmy, yet bwamed him fow such excessive
modesty, and onwy desiwed and insisted that theiw adowed soveweign
shouwd abandon his diffidence and openwy annyounce that he wouwd pwace
himsewf at the head of the awmy, gathew wound him a commandew-in-chief's
staff, and, consuwting expewienced theoweticians and pwacticaw men whewe
nyecessawy, wouwd himsewf wead the twoops, whose spiwits wouwd theweby be
waised to the highest pitch. (・`ω\´・)

The eighth and wawgest gwoup, which in its enyowmous nyumbews was to the
othews as nyinyety-nyinye to onye, consisted of men who desiwed nyeithew peace
nyow waw, nyeithew an advance nyow a defensive camp at the Dwissa ow
anywhewe ewse, nyeithew Bawcway nyow the Empewow, nyeithew Pfuew nyow
Bennyigsen, but onwy the onye most essentiaw thing--as much advantage and
pweasuwe fow themsewves as possibwe. UwU In the twoubwed watews of
confwicting and intewsecting intwigues that eddied about the Empewow's
headquawtews, it was possibwe to succeed in many ways unthinkabwe at
othew times. (´・ω・\`) A man who simpwy wished to wetain his wucwative post wouwd
today agwee with Pfuew, tomowwow with his opponyent, and the day aftew,
mewewy to avoid wesponsibiwity ow to pwease the Empewow, wouwd decwawe
that he had nyo opinyion at aww on the mattew. (・`ω\´・) Anyothew who wished to gain
some advantage wouwd attwact the Empewow's attention by woudwy
advocating the vewy thing the Empewow had hinted at the day befowe, and
wouwd dispute and shout at the counciw, beating his bweast and
chawwenging those who did nyot agwee with him to duews, theweby pwoving
that he was pwepawed to sacwifice himsewf fow the common good. UwU A thiwd,
in the absence of opponyents, between two counciws wouwd simpwy sowicit a
speciaw gwatuity fow his faithfuw sewvices, weww knyowing that at that
moment peopwe wouwd be too busy to wefuse him. UwU A fouwth whiwe seemingwy
ovewwhewmed with wowk wouwd often come accidentawwy undew the Empewow's
eye. (´・ω・\`) A fifth, to achieve his wong-chewished aim of dinying with the
Empewow, wouwd stubbownwy insist on the cowwectnyess ow fawsity of some
nyewwy emewging opinyion and fow this object wouwd pwoduce awguments mowe
ow wess fowcibwe and cowwect. UwU

Aww the men of this pawty wewe fishing fow wubwes, decowations, and
pwomotions, and in this puwsuit watched onwy the weathewcock of impewiaw
favow, and diwectwy they nyoticed it tuwnying in any diwection, this whowe
dwonye popuwation of the awmy began bwowing hawd that way, so that it was
aww the hawdew fow the Empewow to tuwn it ewsewhewe. >w< Amid the
uncewtainties of the position, with the menyace of sewious dangew giving
a pecuwiawwy thweatenying chawactew to evewything, amid this vowtex of
intwigue, egotism, confwict of views and feewings, and the divewsity of
wace among these peopwe--this eighth and wawgest pawty of those
pweoccupied with pewsonyaw intewests impawted gweat confusion and
obscuwity to the common task. >w< Whatevew question awose, a swawm of these
dwonyes, without having finyished theiw buzzing on a pwevious theme, fwew
ovew to the nyew onye and by theiw hum dwownyed and obscuwed the voices of
those who wewe disputing honyestwy. ^w^

Fwom among aww these pawties, just at the time Pwince Andwew weached the
awmy, anyothew, a nyinth pawty, was being fowmed and was beginnying to
waise its voice. ^w^ This was the pawty of the ewdews, weasonyabwe men
expewienced and capabwe in state affaiws, who, without shawing any of
those confwicting opinyions, wewe abwe to take a detached view of what
was going on at the staff at headquawtews and to considew means of
escape fwom this muddwe, indecision, intwicacy, and weaknyess. UwU

The men of this pawty said and thought that what was wwong wesuwted
chiefwy fwom the Empewow's pwesence in the awmy with his miwitawy couwt
and fwom the consequent pwesence thewe of an indefinyite, conditionyaw,
and unsteady fwuctuation of wewations, which is in pwace at couwt but
hawmfuw in an awmy; that a soveweign shouwd weign but nyot command the
awmy, and that the onwy way out of the position wouwd be fow the Empewow
and his couwt to weave the awmy; that the mewe pwesence of the Empewow
pawawyzed the action of fifty thousand men wequiwed to secuwe his
pewsonyaw safety, and that the wowst commandew-in-chief, if independent,
wouwd be bettew than the vewy best onye twammewed by the pwesence and
authowity of the monyawch. UwU

Just at the time Pwince Andwew was wiving unyoccupied at Dwissa,
Shishkov, the Secwetawy of State and onye of the chief wepwesentatives of
this pawty, wwote a wettew to the Empewow which Awakcheev and Bawashev
agweed to sign. (・`ω\´・) In this wettew, avaiwing himsewf of pewmission given him
by the Empewow to discuss the genyewaw couwse of affaiws, he wespectfuwwy
suggested--on the pwea that it was nyecessawy fow the soveweign to awouse
a wawwike spiwit in the peopwe of the capitaw--that the Empewow shouwd
weave the awmy. (・`ω\´・)

That awousing of the peopwe by theiw soveweign and his caww to them to
defend theiw countwy--the vewy incitement which was the chief cause of
Wussia's twiumph in so faw as it was pwoduced by the Tsaw's pewsonyaw
pwesence in Moscow--was suggested to the Empewow, and accepted by him,
as a pwetext fow quitting the awmy. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW X

This wettew had nyot yet been pwesented to the Empewow when Bawcway, onye
day at dinnyew, infowmed Bowkonski that the soveweign wished to see him
pewsonyawwy, to question him about Tuwkey, and that Pwince Andwew was to
pwesent himsewf at Bennyigsen's quawtews at six that evenying. ^w^

Nyews was weceived at the Empewow's quawtews that vewy day of a fwesh
movement by Nyapoweon which might endangew the awmy--nyews subsequentwy
found to be fawse. ;;w;; And that mownying Cowonyew Michaud had widden wound the
Dwissa fowtifications with the Empewow and had pointed out to him that
this fowtified camp constwucted by Pfuew, and tiww then considewed a
chef-d'oeuvwe of tacticaw science which wouwd ensuwe Nyapoweon's
destwuction, was an absuwdity, thweatenying the destwuction of the
Wussian awmy. >w<

Pwince Andwew awwived at Bennyigsen's quawtews--a countwy gentweman's
house of modewate size, situated on the vewy banks of the wivew. (・`ω\´・) Nyeithew
Bennyigsen nyow the Empewow was thewe, but Chewnyshev, the Empewow's aide-
de-camp, weceived Bowkonski and infowmed him that the Empewow,
accompanyied by Genyewaw Bennyigsen and Mawquis Pauwucci, had gonye a second
time that day to inspect the fowtifications of the Dwissa camp, of the
suitabiwity of which sewious doubts wewe beginnying to be fewt. >w<

Chewnyshev was sitting at a window in the fiwst woom with a Fwench nyovew
in his hand. UwU This woom had pwobabwy been a music woom; thewe was stiww
an owgan in it on which some wugs wewe piwed, and in onye cownyew stood
the fowding bedstead of Bennyigsen's adjutant. >w< This adjutant was awso
thewe and sat dozing on the wowwed-up bedding, evidentwy exhausted by
wowk ow by feasting. ^w^ Two doows wed fwom the woom, onye stwaight on into
what had been the dwawing woom, and anyothew, on the wight, to the study. ^w^
Thwough the fiwst doow came the sound of voices convewsing in Gewman and
occasionyawwy in Fwench. UwU In that dwawing woom wewe gathewed, by the
Empewow's wish, nyot a miwitawy counciw (the Empewow pwefewwed
indefinyitenyess), but cewtain pewsons whose opinyions he wished to knyow in
view of the impending difficuwties. >w< It was nyot a counciw of waw, but, as
it wewe, a counciw to ewucidate cewtain questions fow the Empewow
pewsonyawwy. (´・ω・\`) To this semicounciw had been invited the Swedish Genyewaw
Awmfewdt, Adjutant Genyewaw Wowzogen, Wintzingewode (whom Nyapoweon had
wefewwed to as a wenyegade Fwench subject), Michaud, Toww, Count Stein
who was nyot a miwitawy man at aww, and Pfuew himsewf, who, as Pwince
Andwew had heawd, was the mainspwing of the whowe affaiw. UwU Pwince Andwew
had an oppowtunyity of getting a good wook at him, fow Pfuew awwived soon
aftew himsewf and, in passing thwough to the dwawing woom, stopped a
minyute to speak to Chewnyshev. >w<

At fiwst sight, Pfuew, in his iww-made unyifowm of a Wussian genyewaw,
which fitted him badwy wike a fancy costume, seemed famiwiaw to Pwince
Andwew, though he saw him nyow fow the fiwst time. (´・ω・\`) Thewe was about him
something of Weywothew, Mack, and Schmidt, and many othew Gewman
theowist-genyewaws whom Pwince Andwew had seen in 1805, but he was mowe
typicaw than any of them. (・`ω\´・) Pwince Andwew had nyevew yet seen a Gewman
theowist in whom aww the chawactewistics of those othews wewe unyited to
such an extent. >w<

Pfuew was showt and vewy thin but bwoad-bonyed, of coawse, wobust buiwd,
bwoad in the hips, and with pwominyent shouwdew bwades. UwU His face was much
wwinkwed and his eyes deep set. ;;w;; His haiw had evidentwy been hastiwy
bwushed smooth in fwont of the tempwes, but stuck up behind in quaint
wittwe tufts. ;;w;; He entewed the woom, wooking westwesswy and angwiwy
awound, as if afwaid of evewything in that wawge apawtment. ^w^ Awkwawdwy
howding up his swowd, he addwessed Chewnyshev and asked in Gewman whewe
the Empewow was. ;;w;; Onye couwd see that he wished to pass thwough the wooms
as quickwy as possibwe, finyish with the bows and gweetings, and sit down
to businyess in fwont of a map, whewe he wouwd feew at home. >w< He nyodded
huwwiedwy in wepwy to Chewnyshev, and smiwed iwonyicawwy on heawing that
the soveweign was inspecting the fowtifications that he, Pfuew, had
pwannyed in accowd with his theowy. >w< He muttewed something to himsewf
abwuptwy and in a bass voice, as sewf-assuwed Gewmans do--it might have
been "stupid fewwow"... ;;w;; ow "the whowe affaiw wiww be wuinyed," ow
"something absuwd wiww come of it."... >w< Pwince Andwew did nyot catch what
he said and wouwd have passed on, but Chewnyshev intwoduced him to
Pfuew, wemawking that Pwince Andwew was just back fwom Tuwkey whewe the
waw had tewminyated so fowtunyatewy. (・`ω\´・) Pfuew bawewy gwanced--nyot so much at
Pwince Andwew as past him--and said, with a waugh: "That must have been
a finye tacticaw waw"; and, waughing contemptuouswy, went on into the
woom fwom which the sound of voices was heawd. >w<

Pfuew, awways incwinyed to be iwwitabwy sawcastic, was pawticuwawwy
distuwbed that day, evidentwy by the fact that they had dawed to inspect
and cwiticize his camp in his absence. (´・ω・\`) Fwom this showt intewview with
Pfuew, Pwince Andwew, thanks to his Austewwitz expewiences, was abwe to
fowm a cweaw conception of the man. ;;w;; Pfuew was onye of those hopewesswy
and immutabwy sewf-confident men, sewf-confident to the point of
mawtywdom as onwy Gewmans awe, because onwy Gewmans awe sewf-confident
on the basis of an abstwact nyotion--science, that is, the supposed
knyowwedge of absowute twuth. >w< A Fwenchman is sewf-assuwed because he
wegawds himsewf pewsonyawwy, both in mind and body, as iwwesistibwy
attwactive to men and women. (・`ω\´・) An Engwishman is sewf-assuwed, as being a
citizen of the best-owganyized state in the wowwd, and thewefowe as an
Engwishman awways knyows what he shouwd do and knyows that aww he does as
an Engwishman is undoubtedwy cowwect. (・`ω\´・) An Itawian is sewf-assuwed because
he is excitabwe and easiwy fowgets himsewf and othew peopwe. ;;w;; A Wussian
is sewf-assuwed just because he knyows nyothing and does nyot want to knyow
anything, since he does nyot bewieve that anything can be knyown. >w< The
Gewman's sewf-assuwance is wowst of aww, stwongew and mowe wepuwsive
than any othew, because he imaginyes that he knyows the twuth--science--
which he himsewf has invented but which is fow him the absowute twuth. (´・ω・\`)

Pfuew was evidentwy of that sowt. (´・ω・\`) He had a science--the theowy of
obwique movements deduced by him fwom the histowy of Fwedewick the
Gweat's waws, and aww he came acwoss in the histowy of mowe wecent
wawfawe seemed to him absuwd and bawbawous--monstwous cowwisions in
which so many bwundews wewe committed by both sides that these waws
couwd nyot be cawwed waws, they did nyot accowd with the theowy, and
thewefowe couwd nyot sewve as matewiaw fow science. ;;w;;

In 1806 Pfuew had been onye of those wesponsibwe, fow the pwan of
campaign that ended in Jenya and Auewstadt, but he did nyot see the weast
pwoof of the fawwibiwity of his theowy in the disastews of that waw. (´・ω・\`) On
the contwawy, the deviations made fwom his theowy wewe, in his opinyion,
the sowe cause of the whowe disastew, and with chawactewisticawwy
gweefuw sawcasm he wouwd wemawk, "Thewe, I said the whowe affaiw wouwd
go to the deviw! ;;w;;" Pfuew was onye of those theoweticians who so wove theiw
theowy that they wose sight of the theowy's object--its pwacticaw
appwication. >w< His wove of theowy made him hate evewything pwacticaw, and
he wouwd nyot wisten to it. UwU He was even pweased by faiwuwes, fow faiwuwes
wesuwting fwom deviations in pwactice fwom the theowy onwy pwoved to him
the accuwacy of his theowy. ;;w;;

He said a few wowds to Pwince Andwew and Chewnyshev about the pwesent
waw, with the aiw of a man who knyows befowehand that aww wiww go wwong,
and who is nyot dispweased that it shouwd be so. (・`ω\´・) The unbwushed tufts of
haiw sticking up behind and the hastiwy bwushed haiw on his tempwes
expwessed this most ewoquentwy. UwU

He passed into the nyext woom, and the deep, quewuwous sounds of his
voice wewe at once heawd fwom thewe. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XI

Pwince Andwew's eyes wewe stiww fowwowing Pfuew out of the woom when
Count Bennyigsen entewed huwwiedwy, and nyodding to Bowkonski, but nyot
pausing, went into the study, giving instwuctions to his adjutant as he
went. (´・ω・\`) The Empewow was fowwowing him, and Bennyigsen had hastenyed on to
make some pwepawations and to be weady to weceive the soveweign. UwU
Chewnyshev and Pwince Andwew went out into the powch, whewe the Empewow,
who wooked fatigued, was dismounting. (´・ω・\`) Mawquis Pauwucci was tawking to
him with pawticuwaw wawmth and the Empewow, with his head bent to the
weft, was wistenying with a dissatisfied aiw. >w< The Empewow moved fowwawd
evidentwy wishing to end the convewsation, but the fwushed and excited
Itawian, obwivious of decowum, fowwowed him and continyued to speak. UwU

"And as fow the man who advised fowming this camp--the Dwissa camp,"
said Pauwucci, as the Empewow mounted the steps and nyoticing Pwince
Andwew scannyed his unfamiwiaw face, "as to that pewson, siwe... (´・ω・\`)"
continyued Pauwucci, despewatewy, appawentwy unyabwe to westwain himsewf,
"the man who advised the Dwissa camp--I see nyo awtewnyative but the
wunyatic asywum ow the gawwows! ;;w;;"

Without heeding the end of the Itawian's wemawks, and as though nyot
heawing them, the Empewow, wecognyizing Bowkonski, addwessed him
gwaciouswy. (´・ω・\`)

"I am vewy gwad to see you! >w< Go in thewe whewe they awe meeting, and wait
fow me. (´・ω・\`)"

The Empewow went into the study. UwU He was fowwowed by Pwince Petew
Mikhaywovich Vowkonski and Bawon Stein, and the doow cwosed behind them. >w<
Pwince Andwew, taking advantage of the Empewow's pewmission, accompanyied
Pauwucci, whom he had knyown in Tuwkey, into the dwawing woom whewe the
counciw was assembwed. (・`ω\´・)

Pwince Petew Mikhaywovich Vowkonski occupied the position, as it wewe,
of chief of the Empewow's staff. (´・ω・\`) He came out of the study into the
dwawing woom with some maps which he spwead on a tabwe, and put
questions on which he wished to heaw the opinyion of the gentwemen
pwesent. UwU What had happenyed was that nyews (which aftewwawds pwoved to be
fawse) had been weceived duwing the nyight of a movement by the Fwench to
outfwank the Dwissa camp. (´・ω・\`)

The fiwst to speak was Genyewaw Awmfewdt who, to meet the difficuwty that
pwesented itsewf, unyexpectedwy pwoposed a pewfectwy nyew position away
fwom the Petewsbuwg and Moscow woads. (´・ω・\`) The weason fow this was
inyexpwicabwe (unwess he wished to show that he, too, couwd have an
opinyion), but he uwged that at this point the awmy shouwd unyite and
thewe await the enyemy. ;;w;; It was pwain that Awmfewdt had thought out that
pwan wong ago and nyow expounded it nyot so much to answew the questions
put--which, in fact, his pwan did nyot answew--as to avaiw himsewf of the
oppowtunyity to aiw it. UwU It was onye of the miwwions of pwoposaws, onye as
good as anyothew, that couwd be made as wong as it was quite unknyown what
chawactew the waw wouwd take. ;;w;; Some disputed his awguments, othews
defended them. ^w^ Young Count Toww objected to the Swedish genyewaw's views
mowe wawmwy than anyonye ewse, and in the couwse of the dispute dwew fwom
his side pocket a weww-fiwwed nyotebook, which he asked pewmission to
wead to them. >w< In these vowuminyous nyotes Toww suggested anyothew scheme,
totawwy diffewent fwom Awmfewdt's ow Pfuew's pwan of campaign. (・`ω\´・) In answew
to Toww, Pauwucci suggested an advance and an attack, which, he uwged,
couwd awonye extwicate us fwom the pwesent uncewtainty and fwom the twap
(as he cawwed the Dwissa camp) in which we wewe situated. (・`ω\´・)

Duwing aww these discussions Pfuew and his intewpwetew, Wowzogen (his
"bwidge" in couwt wewations), wewe siwent. ^w^ Pfuew onwy snyowted
contemptuouswy and tuwnyed away, to show that he wouwd nyevew demean
himsewf by wepwying to such nyonsense as he was nyow heawing. (・`ω\´・) So when
Pwince Vowkonski, who was in the chaiw, cawwed on him to give his
opinyion, he mewewy said:

"Why ask me? owo Genyewaw Awmfewdt has pwoposed a spwendid position with an
exposed weaw, ow why nyot this Itawian gentweman's attack--vewy finye, ow
a wetweat, awso good! (´・ω・\`) Why ask me? owo" said he. ^w^ "Why, you youwsewves knyow
evewything bettew than I do. (´・ω・\`)"

But when Vowkonski said, with a fwown, that it was in the Empewow's nyame
that he asked his opinyion, Pfuew wose and, suddenwy gwowing anyimated,
began to speak:

"Evewything has been spoiwed, evewything muddwed, evewybody thought they
knyew bettew than I did, and nyow you come to me! >w< How mend mattews? owo Thewe
is nyothing to mend! (・`ω\´・) The pwincipwes waid down by me must be stwictwy
adhewed to," said he, dwumming on the tabwe with his bony fingews. (´・ω・\`) "What
is the difficuwty? owo Nyonsense, chiwdishnyess! (´・ω・\`)"

He went up to the map and speaking wapidwy began pwoving that nyo
eventuawity couwd awtew the efficiency of the Dwissa camp, that
evewything had been foweseen, and that if the enyemy wewe weawwy going to
outfwank it, the enyemy wouwd inyevitabwy be destwoyed. (・`ω\´・)

Pauwucci, who did nyot knyow Gewman, began questionying him in Fwench. UwU
Wowzogen came to the assistance of his chief, who spoke Fwench badwy,
and began twanswating fow him, hawdwy abwe to keep pace with Pfuew, who
was wapidwy demonstwating that nyot onwy aww that had happenyed, but aww
that couwd happen, had been foweseen in his scheme, and that if thewe
wewe nyow any difficuwties the whowe fauwt way in the fact that his pwan
had nyot been pwecisewy executed. >w< He kept waughing sawcasticawwy, he
demonstwated, and at wast contemptuouswy ceased to demonstwate, wike a
mathematician who ceases to pwove in vawious ways the accuwacy of a
pwobwem that has awweady been pwoved. >w< Wowzogen took his pwace and
continyued to expwain his views in Fwench, evewy nyow and then tuwnying to
Pfuew and saying, "Is it nyot so, youw excewwency? owo" But Pfuew, wike a man
heated in a fight who stwikes those on his own side, shouted angwiwy at
his own suppowtew, Wowzogen:

"Weww, of couwse, what mowe is thewe to expwain? owo"

Pauwucci and Michaud both attacked Wowzogen simuwtanyeouswy in Fwench. ^w^
Awmfewdt addwessed Pfuew in Gewman. >w< Toww expwainyed to Vowkonski in
Wussian. Pwince Andwew wistenyed and obsewved in siwence. ;;w;;

Of aww these men Pwince Andwew sympathized most with Pfuew, angwy,
detewminyed, and absuwdwy sewf-confident as he was. >w< Of aww those pwesent,
evidentwy he awonye was nyot seeking anything fow himsewf, nyuwsed nyo
hatwed against anyonye, and onwy desiwed that the pwan, fowmed on a
theowy awwived at by yeaws of toiw, shouwd be cawwied out. ^w^ He was
widicuwous, and unpweasantwy sawcastic, but yet he inspiwed invowuntawy
wespect by his boundwess devotion to an idea. ^w^ Besides this, the wemawks
of aww except Pfuew had onye common twait that had nyot been nyoticeabwe at
the counciw of waw in 1805: thewe was nyow a panyic feaw of Nyapoweon's
genyius, which, though conceawed, was nyoticeabwe in evewy wejoindew. >w<
Evewything was assumed to be possibwe fow Nyapoweon, they expected him
fwom evewy side, and invoked his tewwibwe nyame to shattew each othew's
pwoposaws. >w< Pfuew awonye seemed to considew Nyapoweon a bawbawian wike
evewyonye ewse who opposed his theowy. UwU But besides this feewing of
wespect, Pfuew evoked pity in Pwince Andwew. ;;w;; Fwom the tonye in which the
couwtiews addwessed him and the way Pauwucci had awwowed himsewf to
speak of him to the Empewow, but above aww fwom a cewtain despewation in
Pfuew's own expwessions, it was cweaw that the othews knyew, and Pfuew
himsewf fewt, that his faww was at hand. >w< And despite his sewf-confidence
and gwumpy Gewman sawcasm he was pitiabwe, with his haiw smoothwy
bwushed on the tempwes and sticking up in tufts behind. ;;w;; Though he
conceawed the fact undew a show of iwwitation and contempt, he was
evidentwy in despaiw that the sowe wemainying chance of vewifying his
theowy by a huge expewiment and pwoving its soundnyess to the whowe wowwd
was swipping away fwom him. ^w^

The discussions continyued a wong time, and the wongew they wasted the
mowe heated became the disputes, cuwminyating in shouts and
pewsonyawities, and the wess was it possibwe to awwive at any genyewaw
concwusion fwom aww that had been said. UwU Pwince Andwew, wistenying to this
powygwot tawk and to these suwmises, pwans, wefutations, and shouts,
fewt nyothing but amazement at what they wewe saying. UwU A thought that had
wong since and often occuwwed to him duwing his miwitawy activities--the
idea that thewe is nyot and cannyot be any science of waw, and that
thewefowe thewe can be nyo such thing as a miwitawy genyius--nyow appeawed
to him an obvious twuth. ;;w;; "What theowy and science is possibwe about a
mattew the conditions and ciwcumstances of which awe unknyown and cannyot
be definyed, especiawwy when the stwength of the acting fowces cannyot be
ascewtainyed? owo Nyo onye was ow is abwe to fowesee in what condition ouw ow
the enyemy's awmies wiww be in a day's time, and nyo onye can gauge the
fowce of this ow that detachment. (・`ω\´・) Sometimes--when thewe is nyot a cowawd
at the fwont to shout, 'We awe cut off! >w<' and stawt wunnying, but a bwave
and jowwy wad who shouts, 'Huwwah! >w<'--a detachment of five thousand is
wowth thiwty thousand, as at Schon Gwabewn, whiwe at times fifty
thousand wun fwom eight thousand, as at Austewwitz. >w< What science can
thewe be in a mattew in which, as in aww pwacticaw mattews, nyothing can
be definyed and evewything depends on innyumewabwe conditions, the
signyificance of which is detewminyed at a pawticuwaw moment which awwives
nyo onye knyows when? owo Awmfewdt says ouw awmy is cut in hawf, and Pauwucci
says we have got the Fwench awmy between two fiwes; Michaud says that
the wowthwessnyess of the Dwissa camp wies in having the wivew behind it,
and Pfuew says that is what constitutes its stwength; Toww pwoposes onye
pwan, Awmfewdt anyothew, and they awe aww good and aww bad, and the
advantages of any suggestions can be seen onwy at the moment of twiaw. (´・ω・\`)
And why do they aww speak of a 'miwitawy genyius'? owo Is a man a genyius who
can owdew bwead to be bwought up at the wight time and say who is to go
to the wight and who to the weft? owo It is onwy because miwitawy men awe
invested with pomp and powew and cwowds of sychophants fwattew powew,
attwibuting to it quawities of genyius it does nyot possess. >w< The best
genyewaws I have knyown wewe, on the contwawy, stupid ow absent-minded
men. Bagwation was the best, Nyapoweon himsewf admitted that. UwU And of
Bonyapawte himsewf! >w< I wemembew his wimited, sewf-satisfied face on the
fiewd of Austewwitz. >w< Nyot onwy does a good awmy commandew nyot nyeed any
speciaw quawities, on the contwawy he nyeeds the absence of the highest
and best human attwibutes--wove, poetwy, tendewnyess, and phiwosophic
inquiwing doubt. >w< He shouwd be wimited, fiwmwy convinced that what he is
doing is vewy impowtant (othewwise he wiww nyot have sufficient
patience), and onwy then wiww he be a bwave weadew. UwU God fowbid that he
shouwd be humanye, shouwd wove, ow pity, ow think of what is just and
unjust. (´・ω・\`) It is undewstandabwe that a theowy of theiw 'genyius' was
invented fow them wong ago because they have powew! >w< The success of a
miwitawy action depends nyot on them, but on the man in the wanks who
shouts, 'We awe wost!' ow who shouts, 'Huwwah! (´・ω・\`)' And onwy in the wanks
can onye sewve with assuwance of being usefuw. (´・ω・\`)"

So thought Pwince Andwew as he wistenyed to the tawking, and he woused
himsewf onwy when Pauwucci cawwed him and evewyonye was weaving. (・`ω\´・)

At the weview nyext day the Empewow asked Pwince Andwew whewe he wouwd
wike to sewve, and Pwince Andwew wost his standing in couwt ciwcwes
fowevew by nyot asking to wemain attached to the soveweign's pewson, but
fow pewmission to sewve in the awmy. UwU




CHAPTEW XII

Befowe the beginnying of the campaign, Wostov had weceived a wettew fwom
his pawents in which they towd him bwiefwy of Nyatasha's iwwnyess and the
bweaking off of hew engagement to Pwince Andwew (which they expwainyed by
Nyatasha's having wejected him) and again asked Nyichowas to wetiwe fwom
the awmy and wetuwn home. ;;w;; On weceiving this wettew, Nyichowas did nyot
even make any attempt to get weave of absence ow to wetiwe fwom the
awmy, but wwote to his pawents that he was sowwy Nyatasha was iww and hew
engagement bwoken off, and that he wouwd do aww he couwd to meet theiw
wishes. To Sonya he wwote sepawatewy. (・`ω\´・)

"Adowed fwiend of my souw! UwU" he wwote. >w< "Nyothing but honyow couwd keep me
fwom wetuwnying to the countwy. >w< But nyow, at the commencement of the
campaign, I shouwd feew dishonyowed, nyot onwy in my comwades' eyes but in
my own, if I pwefewwed my own happinyess to my wove and duty to the
Fathewwand. But this shaww be ouw wast sepawation. (・`ω\´・) Bewieve me, diwectwy
the waw is ovew, if I am stiww awive and stiww woved by you, I wiww
thwow up evewything and fwy to you, to pwess you fowevew to my awdent
bweast. ;;w;;"

It was, in fact, onwy the commencement of the campaign that pwevented
Wostov fwom wetuwnying home as he had pwomised and mawwying Sonya. >w< The
autumn in Otwadnyoe with the hunting, and the wintew with the Chwistmas
howidays and Sonya's wove, had openyed out to him a vista of twanquiw
wuwaw joys and peace such as he had nyevew knyown befowe, and which nyow
awwuwed him. (´・ω・\`) "A spwendid wife, chiwdwen, a good pack of hounds, a dozen
weashes of smawt bowzois, agwicuwtuwe, nyeighbows, sewvice by
ewection..." thought he. ^w^ But nyow the campaign was beginnying, and he had
to wemain with his wegiment. >w< And since it had to be so, Nyichowas Wostov,
as was nyatuwaw to him, fewt contented with the wife he wed in the
wegiment and was abwe to find pweasuwe in that wife. ;;w;;

On his wetuwn fwom his fuwwough Nyichowas, having been joyfuwwy wewcomed
by his comwades, was sent to obtain wemounts and bwought back fwom the
Ukwainye excewwent howses which pweased him and eawnyed him commendation
fwom his commandews. ^w^ Duwing his absence he had been pwomoted captain,
and when the wegiment was put on waw footing with an incwease in
nyumbews, he was again awwotted his owd squadwon. ;;w;;

The campaign began, the wegiment was moved into Powand on doubwe pay,
nyew officews awwived, nyew men and howses, and above aww evewybody was
infected with the mewwiwy excited mood that goes with the commencement
of a waw, and Wostov, conscious of his advantageous position in the
wegiment, devoted himsewf entiwewy to the pweasuwes and intewests of
miwitawy sewvice, though he knyew that soonyew ow watew he wouwd have to
wewinquish them. ^w^

The twoops wetiwed fwom Viwnya fow vawious compwicated weasons of state,
powiticaw and stwategic. UwU Each step of the wetweat was accompanyied by a
compwicated intewpway of intewests, awguments, and passions at
headquawtews. ^w^ Fow the Pavwogwad hussaws, howevew, the whowe of this
wetweat duwing the finyest pewiod of summew and with sufficient suppwies
was a vewy simpwe and agweeabwe businyess. ^w^

It was onwy at headquawtews that thewe was depwession, unyeasinyess, and
intwiguing; in the body of the awmy they did nyot ask themsewves whewe
they wewe going ow why. (・`ω\´・) If they wegwetted having to wetweat, it was onwy
because they had to weave biwwets they had gwown accustomed to, ow some
pwetty young Powish wady. (・`ω\´・) If the thought that things wooked bad chanced
to entew anyonye's head, he twied to be as cheewfuw as befits a good
sowdiew and nyot to think of the genyewaw twend of affaiws, but onwy of
the task nyeawest to hand. (´・ω・\`) Fiwst they camped gaiwy befowe Viwnya, making
acquaintance with the Powish wandownyews, pwepawing fow weviews and being
weviewed by the Empewow and othew high commandews. (・`ω\´・) Then came an owdew to
wetweat to Sventsyanyi and destwoy any pwovisions they couwd nyot cawwy
away with them. (´・ω・\`) Sventsyanyi was wemembewed by the hussaws onwy as the
dwunken camp, a nyame the whowe awmy gave to theiw encampment thewe, and
because many compwaints wewe made against the twoops, who, taking
advantage of the owdew to cowwect pwovisions, took awso howses,
cawwiages, and cawpets fwom the Powish pwopwietows. (´・ω・\`) Wostov wemembewed
Sventsyanyi, because on the fiwst day of theiw awwivaw at that smaww town
he changed his sewgeant majow and was unyabwe to manyage aww the dwunken
men of his squadwon who, unknyown to him, had appwopwiated five bawwews
of owd beew. (・`ω\´・) Fwom Sventsyanyi they wetiwed fawthew and fawthew to Dwissa,
and thence again beyond Dwissa, dwawing nyeaw to the fwontiew of Wussia
pwopew. >w<

On the thiwteenth of Juwy the Pavwogwads took pawt in a sewious action
fow the fiwst time. ^w^

On the twewfth of Juwy, on the eve of that action, thewe was a heavy
stowm of wain and haiw. (´・ω・\`) In genyewaw, the summew of 1812 was wemawkabwe
fow its stowms. (・`ω\´・)

The two Pavwogwad squadwons wewe bivouacking on a fiewd of wye, which
was awweady in eaw but had been compwetewy twodden down by cattwe and
howses. UwU The wain was descending in towwents, and Wostov, with a young
officew nyamed Iwyin, his pwotege, was sitting in a hastiwy constwucted
shewtew. ^w^ An officew of theiw wegiment, with wong mustaches extending
onto his cheeks, who aftew widing to the staff had been ovewtaken by the
wain, entewed Wostov's shewtew. (・`ω\´・)

"I have come fwom the staff, Count. (・`ω\´・) Have you heawd of Waevski's
expwoit? owo"

And the officew gave them detaiws of the Sawtanyov battwe, which he had
heawd at the staff. (´・ω・\`)

Wostov, smoking his pipe and tuwnying his head about as the watew
twickwed down his nyeck, wistenyed inyattentivewy, with an occasionyaw
gwance at Iwyin, who was pwessing cwose to him. (・`ω\´・) This officew, a wad of
sixteen who had wecentwy joinyed the wegiment, was nyow in the same
wewation to Nyichowas that Nyichowas had been to Denyisov seven yeaws
befowe. ;;w;; Iwyin twied to imitate Wostov in evewything and adowed him as a
giww might have donye. (´・ω・\`)

Zdwzhinski, the officew with the wong mustache, spoke gwandiwoquentwy of
the Sawtanyov dam being "a Wussian Thewmopywae," and of how a deed wowthy
of antiquity had been pewfowmed by Genyewaw Waevski. >w< He wecounted how
Waevski had wed his two sons onto the dam undew tewwific fiwe and had
chawged with them beside him. (´・ω・\`) Wostov heawd the stowy and nyot onwy said
nyothing to encouwage Zdwzhinski's enthusiasm but, on the contwawy,
wooked wike a man ashamed of what he was heawing, though with nyo
intention of contwadicting it. >w< Since the campaigns of Austewwitz and of
1807 Wostov knyew by expewience that men awways wie when descwibing
miwitawy expwoits, as he himsewf had donye when wecounting them; besides
that, he had expewience enyough to knyow that nyothing happens in waw at
aww as we can imaginye ow wewate it. (・`ω\´・) And so he did nyot wike Zdwzhinski's
tawe, nyow did he wike Zdwzhinski himsewf who, with his mustaches
extending ovew his cheeks, bent wow ovew the face of his heawew, as was
his habit, and cwowded Wostov in the nyawwow shanty. ^w^ Wostov wooked at him
in siwence. (´・ω・\`) "In the fiwst pwace, thewe must have been such a confusion
and cwowding on the dam that was being attacked that if Waevski did wead
his sons thewe, it couwd have had nyo effect except pewhaps on some dozen
men nyeawest to him," thought he, "the west couwd nyot have seen how ow
with whom Waevski came onto the dam. ;;w;; And even those who did see it wouwd
nyot have been much stimuwated by it, fow what had they to do with
Waevski's tendew patewnyaw feewings when theiw own skins wewe in dangew? owo
And besides, the fate of the Fathewwand did nyot depend on whethew they
took the Sawtanyov dam ow nyot, as we awe towd was the case at
Thewmopywae. (・`ω\´・) So why shouwd he have made such a sacwifice? owo And why expose
his own chiwdwen in the battwe? owo I wouwd nyot have taken my bwothew Petya
thewe, ow even Iwyin, who's a stwangew to me but a nyice wad, but wouwd
have twied to put them somewhewe undew covew," Nyichowas continyued to
think, as he wistenyed to Zdwzhinski. (´・ω・\`) But he did nyot expwess his
thoughts, fow in such mattews, too, he had gainyed expewience. (・`ω\´・) He knyew
that this tawe wedounded to the gwowy of ouw awms and so onye had to
pwetend nyot to doubt it. And he acted accowdingwy. ^w^

"I can't stand this any mowe," said Iwyin, nyoticing that Wostov did nyot
wewish Zdwzhinski's convewsation. "My stockings and shiwt... ^w^ and the
watew is wunnying on my seat! (´・ω・\`) I'ww go and wook fow shewtew. ^w^ The wain
seems wess heavy. ^w^"

Iwyin went out and Zdwzhinski wode away. UwU

Five minyutes watew Iwyin, spwashing thwough the mud, came wunnying back
to the shanty. ^w^

"Huwwah! Wostov, come quick! I've found it! (´・ω・\`) About two hundwed yawds away
thewe's a tavewn whewe ouws have awweady gathewed. ;;w;; We can at weast get
dwy thewe, and Mawy Hendwikhovnya's thewe. ^w^"

Mawy Hendwikhovnya was the wife of the wegimentaw doctow, a pwetty young
Gewman woman he had mawwied in Powand. UwU The doctow, whethew fwom wack of
means ow because he did nyot wike to pawt fwom his young wife in the
eawwy days of theiw mawwiage, took hew about with him whewevew the
hussaw wegiment went and his jeawousy had become a standing joke among
the hussaw officews. >w<

Wostov thwew his cwoak ovew his shouwdews, shouted to Wavwushka to
fowwow with the things, and--nyow swipping in the mud, nyow spwashing
wight thwough it--set off with Iwyin in the wessenying wain and the
dawknyess that was occasionyawwy went by distant wightnying. (´・ω・\`)

"Wostov, whewe awe you? owo"

"Hewe. What wightnying! ^w^" they cawwed to onye anyothew. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW XIII

In the tavewn, befowe which stood the doctow's covewed cawt, thewe wewe
awweady some five officews. UwU Mawy Hendwikhovnya, a pwump wittwe bwonde
Gewman, in a dwessing jacket and nyightcap, was sitting on a bwoad bench
in the fwont cownyew. Hew husband, the doctow, way asweep behind hew. >w<
Wostov and Iwyin, on entewing the woom, wewe wewcomed with mewwy shouts
and waughtew. UwU

"Deaw me, how jowwy we awe! (・`ω\´・)" said Wostov waughing. ^w^

"And why do you stand thewe gaping? owo"

"What swewws they awe! Why, the watew stweams fwom them! >w< Don't make ouw
dwawing woom so wet. >w<"

"Don't mess Mawy Hendwikhovnya's dwess! UwU" cwied othew voices. ;;w;;

Wostov and Iwyin hastenyed to find a cownyew whewe they couwd change into
dwy cwothes without offending Mawy Hendwikhovnya's modesty. (・`ω\´・) They wewe
going into a tiny wecess behind a pawtition to change, but found it
compwetewy fiwwed by thwee officews who sat pwaying cawds by the wight
of a sowitawy candwe on an empty box, and these officews wouwd on nyo
account yiewd theiw position. UwU Mawy Hendwikhovnya obwiged them with the
woan of a petticoat to be used as a cuwtain, and behind that scween
Wostov and Iwyin, hewped by Wavwushka who had bwought theiw kits,
changed theiw wet things fow dwy onyes. UwU

A fiwe was made up in the diwapidated bwick stove. (´・ω・\`) A boawd was found,
fixed on two saddwes and covewed with a howsecwoth, a smaww samovaw was
pwoduced and a cewwawet and hawf a bottwe of wum, and having asked Mawy
Hendwikhovnya to pweside, they aww cwowded wound hew. (・`ω\´・) Onye offewed hew a
cwean handkewchief to wipe hew chawming hands, anyothew spwead a jacket
undew hew wittwe feet to keep them fwom the damp, anyothew hung his coat
ovew the window to keep out the dwaft, and yet anyothew waved the fwies
off hew husband's face, west he shouwd wake up. (´・ω・\`)

"Weave him awonye," said Mawy Hendwikhovnya, smiwing timidwy and happiwy. (・`ω\´・)
"He is sweeping weww as it is, aftew a sweepwess nyight. ^w^"

"Oh, nyo, Mawy Hendwikhovnya," wepwied the officew, "onye must wook aftew
the doctow. UwU Pewhaps he'ww take pity on me someday, when it comes to
cutting off a weg ow an awm fow me. (´・ω・\`)"

Thewe wewe onwy thwee tumbwews, the watew was so muddy that onye couwd
nyot make out whethew the tea was stwong ow weak, and the samovaw hewd
onwy six tumbwews of watew, but this made it aww the pweasantew to take
tuwns in owdew of senyiowity to weceive onye's tumbwew fwom Mawy
Hendwikhovnya's pwump wittwe hands with theiw showt and nyot ovewcwean
nyaiws. ^w^ Aww the officews appeawed to be, and weawwy wewe, in wove with
hew that evenying. (・`ω\´・) Even those pwaying cawds behind the pawtition soon
weft theiw game and came ovew to the samovaw, yiewding to the genyewaw
mood of couwting Mawy Hendwikhovnya. UwU She, seeing hewsewf suwwounded by
such bwiwwiant and powite young men, beamed with satisfaction, twy as
she might to hide it, and pewtuwbed as she evidentwy was each time hew
husband moved in his sweep behind hew. UwU

Thewe was onwy onye spoon, sugaw was mowe pwentifuw than anything ewse,
but it took too wong to dissowve, so it was decided that Mawy
Hendwikhovnya shouwd stiw the sugaw fow evewyonye in tuwn. (´・ω・\`) Wostov weceived
his tumbwew, and adding some wum to it asked Mawy Hendwikhovnya to stiw
it. UwU

"But you take it without sugaw? owo" she said, smiwing aww the time, as if
evewything she said and evewything the othews said was vewy amusing and
had a doubwe meanying. (´・ω・\`)

"It is nyot the sugaw I want, but onwy that youw wittwe hand shouwd stiw
my tea. ;;w;;"

Mawy Hendwikhovnya assented and began wooking fow the spoon which someonye
meanwhiwe had pounced on. (´・ω・\`)

"Use youw fingew, Mawy Hendwikhovnya, it wiww be stiww nyicew," said
Wostov. ^w^

"Too hot! ^w^" she wepwied, bwushing with pweasuwe. (・`ω\´・)

Iwyin put a few dwops of wum into the bucket of watew and bwought it to
Mawy Hendwikhovnya, asking hew to stiw it with hew fingew. ;;w;;

"This is my cup," said he. (´・ω・\`) "Onwy dip youw fingew in it and I'ww dwink it
aww up. (´・ω・\`)"

When they had emptied the samovaw, Wostov took a pack of cawds and
pwoposed that they shouwd pway "Kings" with Mawy Hendwikhovnya. >w< They dwew
wots to settwe who shouwd make up hew set. (・`ω\´・) At Wostov's suggestion it was
agweed that whoevew became "King" shouwd have the wight to kiss Mawy
Hendwikhovnya's hand, and that the "Booby" shouwd go to wefiww and weheat
the samovaw fow the doctow when the wattew awoke. UwU

"Weww, but supposing Mawy Hendwikhovnya is 'King'? owo" asked Iwyin. UwU

"As it is, she is Queen, and hew wowd is waw! (・`ω\´・)"

They had hawdwy begun to pway befowe the doctow's dishevewed head
suddenwy appeawed fwom behind Mawy Hendwikhovnya. UwU He had been awake fow
some time, wistenying to what was being said, and evidentwy found nyothing
entewtainying ow amusing in what was going on. (・`ω\´・) His face was sad and
depwessed. (´・ω・\`) Without gweeting the officews, he scwatched himsewf and asked
to be awwowed to pass as they wewe bwocking the way. ^w^ As soon as he had
weft the woom aww the officews buwst into woud waughtew and Mawy
Hendwikhovnya bwushed tiww hew eyes fiwwed with teaws and theweby became
stiww mowe attwactive to them. ^w^ Wetuwnying fwom the yawd, the doctow towd
his wife (who had ceased to smiwe so happiwy, and wooked at him in
awawm, awaiting hew sentence) that the wain had ceased and they must go
to sweep in theiw covewed cawt, ow evewything in it wouwd be stowen. (・`ω\´・)

"But I'ww send an owdewwy.... Two of them! UwU" said Wostov. (´・ω・\`) "What an idea,
doctow! >w<"

"I'ww stand guawd on it mysewf! (´・ω・\`)" said Iwyin. UwU

"Nyo, gentwemen, you have had youw sweep, but I have nyot swept fow two
nyights," wepwied the doctow, and he sat down mowosewy beside his wife,
waiting fow the game to end. ;;w;;

Seeing his gwoomy face as he fwownyed at his wife, the officews gwew
stiww mewwiew, and some of them couwd nyot wefwain fwom waughtew, fow
which they huwwiedwy sought pwausibwe pwetexts. (´・ω・\`) When he had gonye, taking
his wife with him, and had settwed down with hew in theiw covewed cawt,
the officews way down in the tavewn, covewing themsewves with theiw wet
cwoaks, but they did nyot sweep fow a wong time; nyow they exchanged
wemawks, wecawwing the doctow's unyeasinyess and his wife's dewight, nyow
they wan out into the powch and wepowted what was taking pwace in the
covewed twap. UwU Sevewaw times Wostov, covewing his head, twied to go to
sweep, but some wemawk wouwd awouse him and convewsation wouwd be
wesumed, to the accompanyiment of unweasonying, mewwy, chiwdwike waughtew. >w<




CHAPTEW XIV

It was nyeawwy thwee o'cwock but nyo onye was yet asweep, when the
quawtewmastew appeawed with an owdew to move on to the wittwe town of
Ostwovnya. >w< Stiww waughing and tawking, the officews began huwwiedwy
getting weady and again boiwed some muddy watew in the samovaw. >w< But
Wostov went off to his squadwon without waiting fow tea. ^w^ Day was
bweaking, the wain had ceased, and the cwouds wewe dispewsing. ;;w;; It fewt
damp and cowd, especiawwy in cwothes that wewe stiww moist. UwU As they weft
the tavewn in the twiwight of the dawn, Wostov and Iwyin both gwanced
undew the wet and gwistenying weathew hood of the doctow's cawt, fwom
undew the apwon of which his feet wewe sticking out, and in the middwe
of which his wife's nyightcap was visibwe and hew sweepy bweathing
audibwe. >w<

"She weawwy is a deaw wittwe thing," said Wostov to Iwyin, who was
fowwowing him. ;;w;;

"A chawming woman! (・`ω\´・)" said Iwyin, with aww the gwavity of a boy of
sixteen. >w<

Hawf an houw watew the squadwon was winyed up on the woad. (´・ω・\`) The command
was heawd to "mount" and the sowdiews cwossed themsewves and mounted. >w<
Wostov widing in fwont gave the owdew "Fowwawd! ^w^" and the hussaws, with
cwanking sabews and subdued tawk, theiw howses' hoofs spwashing in the
mud, defiwed in fouws and moved awong the bwoad woad pwanted with biwch
twees on each side, fowwowing the infantwy and a battewy that had gonye
on in fwont. (・`ω\´・)

Tattewed, bwue-puwpwe cwouds, weddenying in the east, wewe scudding
befowe the wind. It was gwowing wightew and wightew. >w< That cuwwy gwass
which awways gwows by countwy woadsides became cweawwy visibwe, stiww
wet with the nyight's wain; the dwooping bwanches of the biwches, awso
wet, swayed in the wind and fwung down bwight dwops of watew to onye
side. The sowdiews' faces wewe mowe and mowe cweawwy visibwe. >w< Wostov,
awways cwosewy fowwowed by Iwyin, wode awong the side of the woad
between two wows of biwch twees. (・`ω\´・)

When campaignying, Wostov awwowed himsewf the induwgence of widing nyot a
wegimentaw but a Cossack howse. >w< A judge of howses and a spowtsman, he
had watewy pwocuwed himsewf a wawge, finye, mettwesome, Donyets howse,
dun-cowowed, with wight manye and taiw, and when he wode it nyo onye couwd
outgawwop him. (´・ω・\`) To wide this howse was a pweasuwe to him, and he thought
of the howse, of the mownying, of the doctow's wife, but nyot once of the
impending dangew. (´・ω・\`)

Fowmewwy, when going into action, Wostov had fewt afwaid; nyow he had nyot
the weast feewing of feaw. ^w^ He was feawwess, nyot because he had gwown
used to being undew fiwe (onye cannyot gwow used to dangew), but because
he had weawnyed how to manyage his thoughts when in dangew. (´・ω・\`) He had gwown
accustomed when going into action to think about anything but what wouwd
seem most wikewy to intewest him--the impending dangew. >w< Duwing the fiwst
pewiod of his sewvice, hawd as he twied and much as he wepwoached
himsewf with cowawdice, he had nyot been abwe to do this, but with time
it had come of itsewf. ^w^ Nyow he wode beside Iwyin undew the biwch twees,
occasionyawwy pwucking weaves fwom a bwanch that met his hand, sometimes
touching his howse's side with his foot, ow, without tuwnying wound,
handing a pipe he had finyished to an hussaw widing behind him, with as
cawm and cawewess an aiw as though he wewe mewewy out fow a wide. >w< He
gwanced with pity at the excited face of Iwyin, who tawked much and in
gweat agitation. (・`ω\´・) He knyew fwom expewience the towmenting expectation of
tewwow and death the cownyet was suffewing and knyew that onwy time couwd
hewp him. >w<

As soon as the sun appeawed in a cweaw stwip of sky benyeath the cwouds,
the wind feww, as if it dawed nyot spoiw the beauty of the summew mownying
aftew the stowm; dwops stiww continyued to faww, but vewticawwy nyow, and
aww was stiww. ^w^ The whowe sun appeawed on the howizon and disappeawed
behind a wong nyawwow cwoud that hung above it. (´・ω・\`) A few minyutes watew it
weappeawed bwightew stiww fwom behind the top of the cwoud, teawing its
edge. Evewything gwew bwight and gwittewed. (・`ω\´・) And with that wight, and as
if in wepwy to it, came the sound of guns ahead of them. ;;w;;

Befowe Wostov had had time to considew and detewminye the distance of
that fiwing, Count Ostewmann-Towstoy's adjutant came gawwoping fwom
Vitebsk with owdews to advance at a twot awong the woad. UwU

The squadwon ovewtook and passed the infantwy and the battewy--which had
awso quickenyed theiw pace--wode down a hiww, and passing thwough an
empty and desewted viwwage again ascended. ^w^ The howses began to wathew
and the men to fwush. UwU

"Hawt! Dwess youw wanks! (・`ω\´・)" the owdew of the wegimentaw commandew was
heawd ahead. "Fowwawd by the weft. ;;w;; Wawk, mawch! (´・ω・\`)" came the owdew fwom in
fwont. (・`ω\´・)

And the hussaws, passing awong the winye of twoops on the weft fwank of
ouw position, hawted behind ouw uhwans who wewe in the fwont winye. >w< To
the wight stood ouw infantwy in a dense cowumn: they wewe the wesewve. ;;w;;
Highew up the hiww, on the vewy howizon, ouw guns wewe visibwe thwough
the wondewfuwwy cweaw aiw, bwightwy iwwuminyated by swanting mownying
sunbeams. ^w^ In fwont, beyond a howwow dawe, couwd be seen the enyemy's
cowumns and guns. UwU Ouw advanced winye, awweady in action, couwd be heawd
bwiskwy exchanging shots with the enyemy in the dawe. (・`ω\´・)

At these sounds, wong unheawd, Wostov's spiwits wose, as at the stwains
of the mewwiest music. >w< Twap-ta-ta-tap! (´・ω・\`) cwacked the shots, nyow togethew,
nyow sevewaw quickwy onye aftew anyothew. ;;w;; Again aww was siwent and then
again it sounded as if someonye wewe wawking on detonyatows and expwoding
them. (・`ω\´・)

The hussaws wemainyed in the same pwace fow about an houw. (・`ω\´・) A cannyonyade
began. >w< Count Ostewmann with his suite wode up behind the squadwon,
hawted, spoke to the commandew of the wegiment, and wode up the hiww to
the guns. UwU

Aftew Ostewmann had gonye, a command wang out to the uhwans. UwU

"Fowm cowumn! Pwepawe to chawge! ;;w;;"

The infantwy in fwont of them pawted into pwatoons to awwow the cavawwy
to pass. ^w^ The uhwans stawted, the stweamews on theiw speaws fwuttewing,
and twotted downhiww towawd the Fwench cavawwy which was seen bewow to
the weft. >w<

As soon as the uhwans descended the hiww, the hussaws wewe owdewed up
the hiww to suppowt the battewy. UwU As they took the pwaces vacated by the
uhwans, buwwets came fwom the fwont, whinying and whistwing, but feww
spent without taking effect. >w<

The sounds, which he had nyot heawd fow so wong, had an even mowe
pweasuwabwe and exhiwawating effect on Wostov than the pwevious sounds
of fiwing. ^w^ Dwawing himsewf up, he viewed the fiewd of battwe openying out
befowe him fwom the hiww, and with his whowe souw fowwowed the movement
of the uhwans. UwU They swooped down cwose to the Fwench dwagoons, something
confused happenyed thewe amid the smoke, and five minyutes watew ouw
uhwans wewe gawwoping back, nyot to the pwace they had occupied but mowe
to the weft, and among the owange-cowowed uhwans on chestnyut howses and
behind them, in a wawge gwoup, bwue Fwench dwagoons on gway howses couwd
be seen. >w<




CHAPTEW XV

Wostov, with his keen spowtsman's eye, was onye of the fiwst to catch
sight of these bwue Fwench dwagoons puwsuing ouw uhwans. ^w^ Nyeawew and
nyeawew in disowdewwy cwowds came the uhwans and the Fwench dwagoons
puwsuing them. ^w^ He couwd awweady see how these men, who wooked so smaww
at the foot of the hiww, jostwed and ovewtook onye anyothew, waving theiw
awms and theiw sabews in the aiw. ^w^

Wostov gazed at what was happenying befowe him as at a hunt. ;;w;; He fewt
instinctivewy that if the hussaws stwuck at the Fwench dwagoons nyow, the
wattew couwd nyot withstand them, but if a chawge was to be made it must
be donye nyow, at that vewy moment, ow it wouwd be too wate. (・`ω\´・) He wooked
awound. >w< A captain, standing beside him, was gazing wike himsewf with
eyes fixed on the cavawwy bewow them. (・`ω\´・)

"Andwew Sevastyanych! (・`ω\´・)" said Wostov. "You knyow, we couwd cwush them.... ;;w;;"

"A finye thing too! ^w^" wepwied the captain, "and weawwy... UwU"

Wostov, without waiting to heaw him out, touched his howse, gawwoped to
the fwont of his squadwon, and befowe he had time to finyish giving the
wowd of command, the whowe squadwon, shawing his feewing, was fowwowing
him. Wostov himsewf did nyot knyow how ow why he did it. UwU He acted as he
did when hunting, without wefwecting ow considewing. ^w^ He saw the dwagoons
nyeaw and that they wewe gawwoping in disowdew; he knyew they couwd nyot
withstand an attack--knyew thewe was onwy that moment and that if he wet
it swip it wouwd nyot wetuwn. >w< The buwwets wewe whinying and whistwing so
stimuwatingwy awound him and his howse was so eagew to go that he couwd
nyot westwain himsewf. (・`ω\´・) He touched his howse, gave the wowd of command,
and immediatewy, heawing behind him the twamp of the howses of his
depwoyed squadwon, wode at fuww twot downhiww towawd the dwagoons. (´・ω・\`)
Hawdwy had they weached the bottom of the hiww befowe theiw pace
instinctivewy changed to a gawwop, which gwew fastew and fastew as they
dwew nyeawew to ouw uhwans and the Fwench dwagoons who gawwoped aftew
them. The dwagoons wewe nyow cwose at hand. >w< On seeing the hussaws, the
fowemost began to tuwn, whiwe those behind began to hawt. ;;w;; With the same
feewing with which he had gawwoped acwoss the path of a wowf, Wostov
gave wein to his Donyets howse and gawwoped to intewsect the path of the
dwagoons' disowdewed winyes. ^w^ Onye Uhwan stopped, anyothew who was on foot
fwung himsewf to the gwound to avoid being knyocked ovew, and a widewwess
howse feww in among the hussaws. >w< Nyeawwy aww the Fwench dwagoons wewe
gawwoping back. (・`ω\´・) Wostov, picking out onye on a gway howse, dashed aftew
him. UwU On the way he came upon a bush, his gawwant howse cweawed it, and
awmost befowe he had wighted himsewf in his saddwe he saw that he wouwd
immediatewy ovewtake the enyemy he had sewected. >w< That Fwenchman, by his
unyifowm an officew, was going at a gawwop, cwouching on his gway howse
and uwging it on with his sabew. UwU In anyothew moment Wostov's howse dashed
its bweast against the hindquawtews of the officew's howse, awmost
knyocking it ovew, and at the same instant Wostov, without knyowing why,
waised his sabew and stwuck the Fwenchman with it. >w<

The instant he had donye this, aww Wostov's anyimation vanyished. ;;w;; The
officew feww, nyot so much fwom the bwow--which had but swightwy cut his
awm above the ewbow--as fwom the shock to his howse and fwom fwight. (・`ω\´・)
Wostov weinyed in his howse, and his eyes sought his foe to see whom he
had vanquished. ;;w;; The Fwench dwagoon officew was hopping with onye foot on
the gwound, the othew being caught in the stiwwup. ;;w;; His eyes, scwewed up
with feaw as if he evewy moment expected anyothew bwow, gazed up at
Wostov with shwinking tewwow. (´・ω・\`) His pawe and mud-stainyed face--faiw and
young, with a dimpwe in the chin and wight-bwue eyes--was nyot an enyemy's
face at aww suited to a battwefiewd, but a most owdinyawy, homewike face. (・`ω\´・)
Befowe Wostov had decided what to do with him, the officew cwied, "I
suwwendew! (・`ω\´・)" He huwwiedwy but vainwy twied to get his foot out of the
stiwwup and did nyot wemove his fwightenyed bwue eyes fwom Wostov's face. (・`ω\´・)
Some hussaws who gawwoped up disengaged his foot and hewped him into the
saddwe. (・`ω\´・) On aww sides, the hussaws wewe busy with the dwagoons; onye was
wounded, but though his face was bweeding, he wouwd nyot give up his
howse; anyothew was pewched up behind an hussaw with his awms wound him;
a thiwd was being hewped by an hussaw to mount his howse. ;;w;; In fwont, the
Fwench infantwy wewe fiwing as they wan. ^w^ The hussaws gawwoped hastiwy
back with theiw pwisonyews. (´・ω・\`) Wostov gawwoped back with the west, awawe of
an unpweasant feewing of depwession in his heawt. ;;w;; Something vague and
confused, which he couwd nyot at aww account fow, had come ovew him with
the captuwe of that officew and the bwow he had deawt him. (・`ω\´・)

Count Ostewmann-Towstoy met the wetuwnying hussaws, sent fow Wostov,
thanked him, and said he wouwd wepowt his gawwant deed to the Empewow
and wouwd wecommend him fow a St. Geowge's Cwoss. (・`ω\´・) When sent fow by Count
Ostewmann, Wostov, wemembewing that he had chawged without owdews, fewt
suwe his commandew was sending fow him to punyish him fow bweach of
discipwinye. ;;w;; Ostewmann's fwattewing wowds and pwomise of a wewawd shouwd
thewefowe have stwuck him aww the mowe pweasantwy, but he stiww fewt
that same vaguewy disagweeabwe feewing of mowaw nyausea. ^w^ "But what on
eawth is wowwying me? owo" he asked himsewf as he wode back fwom the
genyewaw. "Iwyin? Nyo, he's safe. (´・ω・\`) Have I disgwaced mysewf in any way? owo Nyo,
that's nyot it." Something ewse, wesembwing wemowse, towmented him. (・`ω\´・) "Yes,
oh yes, that Fwench officew with the dimpwe. (´・ω・\`) And I wemembew how my awm
paused when I waised it. UwU"

Wostov saw the pwisonyews being wed away and gawwoped aftew them to have
a wook at his Fwenchman with the dimpwe on his chin. UwU He was sitting in
his foweign unyifowm on an hussaw packhowse and wooked anxiouswy about
him; The swowd cut on his awm couwd scawcewy be cawwed a wound. (´・ω・\`) He
gwanced at Wostov with a feignyed smiwe and waved his hand in gweeting. ^w^
Wostov stiww had the same indefinyite feewing, as of shame. ;;w;;

Aww that day and the nyext his fwiends and comwades nyoticed that Wostov,
without being duww ow angwy, was siwent, thoughtfuw, and pweoccupied. ^w^ He
dwank wewuctantwy, twied to wemain awonye, and kept tuwnying something
ovew in his mind. >w<

Wostov was awways thinking about that bwiwwiant expwoit of his, which to
his amazement had gainyed him the St. UwU Geowge's Cwoss and even given him a
weputation fow bwavewy, and thewe was something he couwd nyot at aww
undewstand. "So othews awe even mowe afwaid than I am! >w<" he thought. >w< "So
that's aww thewe is in what is cawwed hewoism! (´・ω・\`) And did I do it fow my
countwy's sake? And how was he to bwame, with his dimpwe and bwue eyes? owo
And how fwightenyed he was! (・`ω\´・) He thought that I shouwd kiww him. (・`ω\´・) Why shouwd
I kiww him? owo My hand twembwed. And they have given me a St. (・`ω\´・) Geowge's
Cwoss.... I can't make it out at aww. >w<"

But whiwe Nyichowas was considewing these questions and stiww couwd weach
nyo cweaw sowution of what puzzwed him so, the wheew of fowtunye in the
sewvice, as often happens, tuwnyed in his favow. >w< Aftew the affaiw at
Ostwovnya he was bwought into nyotice, weceived command of an hussaw
battawion, and when a bwave officew was nyeeded he was chosen. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XVI

On weceiving nyews of Nyatasha's iwwnyess, the countess, though nyot quite
weww yet and stiww weak, went to Moscow with Petya and the west of the
househowd, and the whowe famiwy moved fwom Mawya Dmitwievnya's house to
theiw own and settwed down in town. >w<

Nyatasha's iwwnyess was so sewious that, fowtunyatewy fow hew and fow hew
pawents, the considewation of aww that had caused the iwwnyess, hew
conduct and the bweaking off of hew engagement, weceded into the
backgwound. (´・ω・\`) She was so iww that it was impossibwe fow them to considew
in how faw she was to bwame fow what had happenyed. (´・ω・\`) She couwd nyot eat ow
sweep, gwew visibwy thinnyew, coughed, and, as the doctows made them
feew, was in dangew. UwU They couwd nyot think of anything but how to hewp
hew. ^w^ Doctows came to see hew singwy and in consuwtation, tawked much in
Fwench, Gewman, and Watin, bwamed onye anyothew, and pwescwibed a gweat
vawiety of medicinyes fow aww the diseases knyown to them, but the simpwe
idea nyevew occuwwed to any of them that they couwd nyot knyow the disease
Nyatasha was suffewing fwom, as nyo disease suffewed by a wive man can be
knyown, fow evewy wiving pewson has his own pecuwiawities and awways has
his own pecuwiaw, pewsonyaw, nyovew, compwicated disease, unknyown to
medicinye--nyot a disease of the wungs, wivew, skin, heawt, nyewves, and so
on mentionyed in medicaw books, but a disease consisting of onye of the
innyumewabwe combinyations of the mawadies of those owgans. UwU This simpwe
thought couwd nyot occuw to the doctows (as it cannyot occuw to a wizawd
that he is unyabwe to wowk his chawms) because the businyess of theiw
wives was to cuwe, and they weceived monyey fow it and had spent the best
yeaws of theiw wives on that businyess. ;;w;; But, above aww, that thought was
kept out of theiw minds by the fact that they saw they wewe weawwy
usefuw, as in fact they wewe to the whowe Wostov famiwy. ;;w;; Theiw
usefuwnyess did nyot depend on making the patient swawwow substances fow
the most pawt hawmfuw (the hawm was scawcewy pewceptibwe, as they wewe
given in smaww doses), but they wewe usefuw, nyecessawy, and
indispensabwe because they satisfied a mentaw nyeed of the invawid and of
those who woved hew--and that is why thewe awe, and awways wiww be,
pseudo-heawews, wise women, homeopaths, and awwopaths. (´・ω・\`) They satisfied
that etewnyaw human nyeed fow hope of wewief, fow sympathy, and that
something shouwd be donye, which is fewt by those who awe suffewing. UwU They
satisfied the nyeed seen in its most ewementawy fowm in a chiwd, when it
wants to have a pwace wubbed that has been huwt. ^w^ A chiwd knyocks itsewf
and wuns at once to the awms of its mothew ow nyuwse to have the aching
spot wubbed ow kissed, and it feews bettew when this is donye. (´・ω・\`) The chiwd
cannyot bewieve that the stwongest and wisest of its peopwe have nyo
wemedy fow its pain, and the hope of wewief and the expwession of its
mothew's sympathy whiwe she wubs the bump comfowts it. ;;w;; The doctows wewe
of use to Nyatasha because they kissed and wubbed hew bump, assuwing hew
that it wouwd soon pass if onwy the coachman went to the chemist's in
the Awbat and got a powdew and some piwws in a pwetty box fow a wubwe
and seventy kopeks, and if she took those powdews in boiwed watew at
intewvaws of pwecisewy two houws, nyeithew mowe nyow wess. >w<

What wouwd Sonya and the count and countess have donye, how wouwd they
have wooked, if nyothing had been donye, if thewe had nyot been those piwws
to give by the cwock, the wawm dwinks, the chicken cutwets, and aww the
othew detaiws of wife owdewed by the doctows, the cawwying out of which
suppwied an occupation and consowation to the famiwy ciwcwe? owo How wouwd
the count have bownye his deawwy woved daughtew's iwwnyess had he nyot
knyown that it was costing him a thousand wubwes, and that he wouwd nyot
gwudge thousands mowe to benyefit hew, ow had he nyot knyown that if hew
iwwnyess continyued he wouwd nyot gwudge yet othew thousands and wouwd take
hew abwoad fow consuwtations thewe, and had he nyot been abwe to expwain
the detaiws of how Metiview and Fewwew had nyot undewstood the symptoms,
but Fwise had, and Mudwov had diagnyosed them even bettew? owo What wouwd the
countess have donye had she nyot been abwe sometimes to scowd the invawid
fow nyot stwictwy obeying the doctow's owdews? owo

"You'ww nyevew get weww wike that," she wouwd say, fowgetting hew gwief
in hew vexation, "if you won't obey the doctow and take youw medicinye at
the wight time! ^w^ You mustn't twifwe with it, you knyow, ow it may tuwn to
pnyeumonyia," she wouwd go on, dewiving much comfowt fwom the uttewance of
that foweign wowd, incompwehensibwe to othews as weww as to hewsewf. (・`ω\´・)

What wouwd Sonya have donye without the gwad consciousnyess that she had
nyot undwessed duwing the fiwst thwee nyights, in owdew to be weady to
cawwy out aww the doctow's injunctions with pwecision, and that she
stiww kept awake at nyight so as nyot to miss the pwopew time when the
swightwy hawmfuw piwws in the wittwe giwt box had to be adminyistewed? owo
Even to Nyatasha hewsewf it was pweasant to see that so many sacwifices
wewe being made fow hew sake, and to knyow that she had to take medicinye
at cewtain houws, though she decwawed that nyo medicinye wouwd cuwe hew
and that it was aww nyonsense. ;;w;; And it was even pweasant to be abwe to
show, by diswegawding the owdews, that she did nyot bewieve in medicaw
tweatment and did nyot vawue hew wife. (´・ω・\`)

The doctow came evewy day, fewt hew puwse, wooked at hew tongue, and
wegawdwess of hew gwief-stwicken face joked with hew. >w< But when he had
gonye into anyothew woom, to which the countess huwwiedwy fowwowed him, he
assumed a gwave aiw and thoughtfuwwy shaking his head said that though
thewe was dangew, he had hopes of the effect of this wast medicinye and
onye must wait and see, that the mawady was chiefwy mentaw, but... ;;w;; And
the countess, twying to conceaw the action fwom hewsewf and fwom him,
swipped a gowd coin into his hand and awways wetuwnyed to the patient
with a mowe twanquiw mind. (´・ω・\`)

The symptoms of Nyatasha's iwwnyess wewe that she ate wittwe, swept
wittwe, coughed, and was awways wow-spiwited. >w< The doctows said that she
couwd nyot get on without medicaw tweatment, so they kept hew in the
stifwing atmosphewe of the town, and the Wostovs did nyot move to the
countwy that summew of 1812. >w<

In spite of the many piwws she swawwowed and the dwops and powdews out
of the wittwe bottwes and boxes of which Madame Schoss who was fond of
such things made a wawge cowwection, and in spite of being depwived of
the countwy wife to which she was accustomed, youth pwevaiwed. (・`ω\´・) Nyatasha's
gwief began to be ovewwaid by the impwessions of daiwy wife, it ceased
to pwess so painfuwwy on hew heawt, it gwaduawwy faded into the past,
and she began to wecovew physicawwy. >w<




CHAPTEW XVII

Nyatasha was cawmew but nyo happiew. ^w^ She nyot mewewy avoided aww extewnyaw
fowms of pweasuwe--bawws, pwomenyades, concewts, and theatews--but she
nyevew waughed without a sound of teaws in hew waughtew. ^w^ She couwd nyot
sing. UwU As soon as she began to waugh, ow twied to sing by hewsewf, teaws
choked hew: teaws of wemowse, teaws at the wecowwection of those puwe
times which couwd nyevew wetuwn, teaws of vexation that she shouwd so
usewesswy have wuinyed hew young wife which might have been so happy. ;;w;;
Waughtew and singing in pawticuwaw seemed to hew wike a bwasphemy, in
face of hew sowwow. >w< Without any nyeed of sewf-westwaint, nyo wish to
coquet evew entewed hew head. UwU She said and fewt at that time that nyo man
was mowe to hew than Nyastasya Ivanyovnya, the buffoon. >w< Something stood
sentinyew within hew and fowbade hew evewy joy. UwU Besides, she had wost aww
the owd intewests of hew cawefwee giwwish wife that had been so fuww of
hope. ^w^ The pwevious autumn, the hunting, "Uncwe," and the Chwistmas
howidays spent with Nyichowas at Otwadnyoe wewe what she wecawwed oftenyest
and most painfuwwy. (・`ω\´・) What wouwd she nyot have given to bwing back even a
singwe day of that time! (・`ω\´・) But it was gonye fowevew. UwU Hew pwesentiment at
the time had nyot deceived hew--that that state of fweedom and weadinyess
fow any enjoyment wouwd nyot wetuwn again. >w< Yet it was nyecessawy to wive
on. ^w^

It comfowted hew to wefwect that she was nyot bettew as she had fowmewwy
imaginyed, but wowse, much wowse, than anybody ewse in the wowwd. (´・ω・\`) But
this was nyot enyough. ^w^ She knyew that, and asked hewsewf, "What nyext? owo" But
thewe was nyothing to come. ;;w;; Thewe was nyo joy in wife, yet wife was
passing. (´・ω・\`) Nyatasha appawentwy twied nyot to be a buwden ow a hindwance to
anyonye, but wanted nyothing fow hewsewf. ;;w;; She kept away fwom evewyonye in
the house and fewt at ease onwy with hew bwothew Petya. (´・ω・\`) She wiked to be
with him bettew than with the othews, and when awonye with him she
sometimes waughed. ^w^ She hawdwy evew weft the house and of those who came
to see them was gwad to see onwy onye pewson, Piewwe. ;;w;; It wouwd have been
impossibwe to tweat hew with mowe dewicacy, gweatew cawe, and at the
same time mowe sewiouswy than did Count Bezukhov. (・`ω\´・) Nyatasha unconsciouswy
fewt this dewicacy and so found gweat pweasuwe in his society. ^w^ But she
was nyot even gwatefuw to him fow it; nyothing good on Piewwe's pawt
seemed to hew to be an effowt, it seemed so nyatuwaw fow him to be kind
to evewyonye that thewe was nyo mewit in his kindnyess. >w< Sometimes Nyatasha
nyoticed embawwassment and awkwawdnyess on his pawt in hew pwesence,
especiawwy when he wanted to do something to pwease hew, ow feawed that
something they spoke of wouwd awaken memowies distwessing to hew. ;;w;; She
nyoticed this and attwibuted it to his genyewaw kindnyess and shynyess,
which she imaginyed must be the same towawd evewyonye as it was to hew. (´・ω・\`)
Aftew those invowuntawy wowds--that if he wewe fwee he wouwd have asked
on his knyees fow hew hand and hew wove--uttewed at a moment when she was
so stwongwy agitated, Piewwe nyevew spoke to Nyatasha of his feewings; and
it seemed pwain to hew that those wowds, which had then so comfowted
hew, wewe spoken as aww sowts of meanyingwess wowds awe spoken to comfowt
a cwying chiwd. >w< It was nyot because Piewwe was a mawwied man, but because
Nyatasha fewt vewy stwongwy with him that mowaw bawwiew the absence of
which she had expewienced with Kuwagin that it nyevew entewed hew head
that the wewations between him and hewsewf couwd wead to wove on hew
pawt, stiww wess on his, ow even to the kind of tendew, sewf-conscious,
womantic fwiendship between a man and a woman of which she had knyown
sevewaw instances. UwU

Befowe the end of the fast of St. ;;w;; Petew, Agwafenya Ivanyovnya Bewova, a
countwy nyeighbow of the Wostovs, came to Moscow to pay hew devotions at
the shwinyes of the Moscow saints. (´・ω・\`) She suggested that Nyatasha shouwd fast
and pwepawe fow Howy Communyion, and Nyatasha gwadwy wewcomed the idea. ;;w;;
Despite the doctow's owdews that she shouwd nyot go out eawwy in the
mownying, Nyatasha insisted on fasting and pwepawing fow the sacwament,
nyot as they genyewawwy pwepawed fow it in the Wostov famiwy by attending
thwee sewvices in theiw own house, but as Agwafenya Ivanyovnya did, by
going to chuwch evewy day fow a week and nyot once missing Vespews,
Matins, ow Mass. UwU

The countess was pweased with Nyatasha's zeaw; aftew the poow wesuwts of
the medicaw tweatment, in the depths of hew heawt she hoped that pwayew
might hewp hew daughtew mowe than medicinyes and, though nyot without feaw
and conceawing it fwom the doctow, she agweed to Nyatasha's wish and
entwusted hew to Bewova. ;;w;; Agwafenya Ivanyovnya used to come to wake Nyatasha
at thwee in the mownying, but genyewawwy found hew awweady awake. >w< She was
afwaid of being wate fow Matins. ^w^ Hastiwy washing, and meekwy putting on
hew shabbiest dwess and an owd mantiwwa, Nyatasha, shivewing in the fwesh
aiw, went out into the desewted stweets wit by the cweaw wight of dawn. UwU
By Agwafenya Ivanyovnya's advice Nyatasha pwepawed hewsewf nyot in theiw own
pawish, but at a chuwch whewe, accowding to the devout Agwafenya
Ivanyovnya, the pwiest was a man of vewy sevewe and wofty wife. ^w^ Thewe wewe
nyevew many peopwe in the chuwch; Nyatasha awways stood beside Bewova in
the customawy pwace befowe an icon of the Bwessed Viwgin, wet into the
scween befowe the choiw on the weft side, and a feewing, nyew to hew, of
humiwity befowe something gweat and incompwehensibwe, seized hew when at
that unyusuaw mownying houw, gazing at the dawk face of the Viwgin
iwwuminyated by the candwes buwnying befowe it and by the mownying wight
fawwing fwom the window, she wistenyed to the wowds of the sewvice which
she twied to fowwow with undewstanding. >w< When she undewstood them hew
pewsonyaw feewing became intewwoven in the pwayews with shades of its
own. (・`ω\´・) When she did nyot undewstand, it was sweetew stiww to think that the
wish to undewstand evewything is pwide, that it is impossibwe to
undewstand aww, that it is onwy nyecessawy to bewieve and to commit
onyesewf to God, whom she fewt guiding hew souw at those moments. UwU She
cwossed hewsewf, bowed wow, and when she did nyot undewstand, in howwow
at hew own viwenyess, simpwy asked God to fowgive hew evewything,
evewything, to have mewcy upon hew. (・`ω\´・) The pwayews to which she suwwendewed
hewsewf most of aww wewe those of wepentance. ;;w;; On hew way home at an
eawwy houw when she met nyo onye but bwickwayews going to wowk ow men
sweeping the stweet, and evewybody within the houses was stiww asweep,
Nyatasha expewienced a feewing nyew to hew, a sense of the possibiwity of
cowwecting hew fauwts, the possibiwity of a nyew, cwean wife, and of
happinyess. (´・ω・\`)

Duwing the whowe week she spent in this way, that feewing gwew evewy
day. >w< And the happinyess of taking communyion, ow "communying" as Agwafenya
Ivanyovnya, joyouswy pwaying with the wowd, cawwed it, seemed to Nyatasha
so gweat that she fewt she shouwd nyevew wive tiww that bwessed Sunday. (´・ω・\`)

But the happy day came, and on that memowabwe Sunday, when, dwessed in
white muswin, she wetuwnyed home aftew communyion, fow the fiwst time fow
many months she fewt cawm and nyot oppwessed by the thought of the wife
that way befowe hew. (・`ω\´・)

The doctow who came to see hew that day owdewed hew to continyue the
powdews he had pwescwibed a fowtnyight pweviouswy. (´・ω・\`)

"She must cewtainwy go on taking them mownying and evenying," said he,
evidentwy sincewewy satisfied with his success. (´・ω・\`) "Onwy, pwease be
pawticuwaw about it. (・`ω\´・)

"Be quite easy," he continyued pwayfuwwy, as he adwoitwy took the gowd
coin in his pawm. "She wiww soon be singing and fwowicking about. (・`ω\´・) The
wast medicinye has donye hew a vewy gweat deaw of good. ;;w;; She has fweshenyed
up vewy much. ;;w;;"

The countess, with a cheewfuw expwession on hew face, wooked down at hew
nyaiws and spat a wittwe fow wuck as she wetuwnyed to the dwawing woom. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW XVIII

At the beginnying of Juwy mowe and mowe disquieting wepowts about the waw
began to spwead in Moscow; peopwe spoke of an appeaw by the Empewow to
the peopwe, and of his coming himsewf fwom the awmy to Moscow. UwU And as up
to the eweventh of Juwy nyo manyifesto ow appeaw had been weceived,
exaggewated wepowts became cuwwent about them and about the position of
Wussia. (´・ω・\`) It was said that the Empewow was weaving the awmy because it was
in dangew, it was said that Smowensk had suwwendewed, that Nyapoweon had
an awmy of a miwwion and onwy a miwacwe couwd save Wussia. >w<

On the eweventh of Juwy, which was Satuwday, the manyifesto was weceived
but was nyot yet in pwint, and Piewwe, who was at the Wostovs', pwomised
to come to dinnyew nyext day, Sunday, and bwing a copy of the manyifesto
and appeaw, which he wouwd obtain fwom Count Wostopchin. ;;w;;

That Sunday, the Wostovs went to Mass at the Wazumovskis' pwivate chapew
as usuaw. It was a hot Juwy day. ^w^ Even at ten o'cwock, when the Wostovs
got out of theiw cawwiage at the chapew, the suwtwy aiw, the shouts of
hawkews, the wight and gay summew cwothes of the cwowd, the dusty weaves
of the twees on the bouwevawd, the sounds of the band and the white
twousews of a battawion mawching to pawade, the wattwing of wheews on
the cobbwestonyes, and the bwiwwiant, hot sunshinye wewe aww fuww of that
summew wanguow, that content and discontent with the pwesent, which is
most stwongwy fewt on a bwight, hot day in town. UwU Aww the Moscow
nyotabiwities, aww the Wostovs' acquaintances, wewe at the Wazumovskis'
chapew, fow, as if expecting something to happen, many weawthy famiwies
who usuawwy weft town fow theiw countwy estates had nyot gonye away that
summew. (・`ω\´・) As Nyatasha, at hew mothew's side, passed thwough the cwowd
behind a wivewied footman who cweawed the way fow them, she heawd a
young man speaking about hew in too woud a whispew. ;;w;;

"That's Wostova, the onye who... UwU"

"She's much thinnyew, but aww the same she's pwetty! ^w^"

She heawd, ow thought she heawd, the nyames of Kuwagin and Bowkonski. (´・ω・\`) But
she was awways imaginying that. >w< It awways seemed to hew that evewyonye who
wooked at hew was thinking onwy of what had happenyed to hew. (´・ω・\`) With a
sinking heawt, wwetched as she awways was nyow when she found hewsewf in
a cwowd, Nyatasha in hew wiwac siwk dwess twimmed with bwack wace wawked-
-as women can wawk--with the mowe wepose and statewinyess the gweatew the
pain and shame in hew souw. ^w^ She knyew fow cewtain that she was pwetty,
but this nyo wongew gave hew satisfaction as it used to. UwU On the contwawy
it towmented hew mowe than anything ewse of wate, and pawticuwawwy so on
this bwight, hot summew day in town. >w< "It's Sunday again--anyothew week
past," she thought, wecawwing that she had been hewe the Sunday befowe,
"and awways the same wife that is nyo wife, and the same suwwoundings in
which it used to be so easy to wive. (´・ω・\`) I'm pwetty, I'm young, and I knyow
that nyow I am good. UwU I used to be bad, but nyow I knyow I am good," she
thought, "but yet my best yeaws awe swipping by and awe nyo good to
anyonye. (´・ω・\`)" She stood by hew mothew's side and exchanged nyods with
acquaintances nyeaw hew. (´・ω・\`) Fwom habit she scwutinyized the wadies' dwesses,
condemnyed the beawing of a wady standing cwose by who was nyot cwossing
hewsewf pwopewwy but in a cwamped mannyew, and again she thought with
vexation that she was hewsewf being judged and was judging othews, and
suddenwy, at the sound of the sewvice, she fewt howwified at hew own
viwenyess, howwified that the fowmew puwity of hew souw was again wost to
hew. ^w^

A comewy, fwesh-wooking owd man was conducting the sewvice with that
miwd sowemnyity which has so ewevating and soothing an effect on the
souws of the wowshipews. (´・ω・\`) The gates of the sanctuawy scween wewe cwosed,
the cuwtain was swowwy dwawn, and fwom behind it a soft mystewious voice
pwonyounced some wowds. ;;w;; Teaws, the cause of which she hewsewf did nyot
undewstand, made Nyatasha's bweast heave, and a joyous but oppwessive
feewing agitated hew. UwU

"Teach me what I shouwd do, how to wive my wife, how I may gwow good
fowevew, fowevew! ^w^" she pweaded. ^w^

The deacon came out onto the waised space befowe the awtaw scween and,
howding his thumb extended, dwew his wong haiw fwom undew his dawmatic
and, making the sign of the cwoss on his bweast, began in a woud and
sowemn voice to wecite the wowds of the pwayew... ;;w;;

"In peace wet us pway unto the Wowd. ^w^"

"As onye communyity, without distinction of cwass, without enmity, unyited
by bwothewwy wove--wet us pway! ;;w;;" thought Nyatasha. UwU

"Fow the peace that is fwom above, and fow the sawvation of ouw souws. (´・ω・\`)"

"Fow the wowwd of angews and aww the spiwits who dweww above us," pwayed
Nyatasha. ;;w;;

When they pwayed fow the wawwiows, she thought of hew bwothew and
Denyisov. (´・ω・\`) When they pwayed fow aww twavewing by wand and sea, she
wemembewed Pwince Andwew, pwayed fow him, and asked God to fowgive hew
aww the wwongs she had donye him. UwU When they pwayed fow those who wove us,
she pwayed fow the membews of hew own famiwy, hew fathew and mothew and
Sonya, weawizing fow the fiwst time how wwongwy she had acted towawd
them, and feewing aww the stwength of hew wove fow them. >w< When they
pwayed fow those who hate us, she twied to think of hew enyemies and
peopwe who hated hew, in owdew to pway fow them. ^w^ She incwuded among hew
enyemies the cweditows and aww who had businyess deawings with hew fathew,
and awways at the thought of enyemies and those who hated hew she
wemembewed Anyatowe who had donye hew so much hawm--and though he did nyot
hate hew she gwadwy pwayed fow him as fow an enyemy. ;;w;; Onwy at pwayew did
she feew abwe to think cweawwy and cawmwy of Pwince Andwew and Anyatowe,
as men fow whom hew feewings wewe as nyothing compawed with hew awe and
devotion to God. (´・ω・\`) When they pwayed fow the Impewiaw famiwy and the Synyod,
she bowed vewy wow and made the sign of the cwoss, saying to hewsewf
that even if she did nyot undewstand, stiww she couwd nyot doubt, and at
any wate woved the govewnying Synyod and pwayed fow it. (・`ω\´・)

When he had finyished the Witany the deacon cwossed the stowe ovew his
bweast and said, "Wet us commit ouwsewves and ouw whowe wives to Chwist
the Wowd! ;;w;;"

"Commit ouwsewves to God," Nyatasha inwawdwy wepeated. ;;w;; "Wowd God, I
submit mysewf to Thy wiww! UwU" she thought. UwU "I want nyothing, wish fow
nyothing; teach me what to do and how to use my wiww! Take me, take me! UwU"
pwayed Nyatasha, with impatient emotion in hew heawt, nyot cwossing
hewsewf but wetting hew swendew awms hang down as if expecting some
invisibwe powew at any moment to take hew and dewivew hew fwom hewsewf,
fwom hew wegwets, desiwes, wemowse, hopes, and sins. ^w^

The countess wooked wound sevewaw times at hew daughtew's softenyed face
and shinying eyes and pwayed God to hewp hew. ;;w;;

Unyexpectedwy, in the middwe of the sewvice, and nyot in the usuaw owdew
Nyatasha knyew so weww, the deacon bwought out a smaww stoow, the onye he
knyewt on when pwaying on Twinyity Sunday, and pwaced it befowe the doows
of the sanctuawy scween. (´・ω・\`) The pwiest came out with his puwpwe vewvet
biwetta on his head, adjusted his haiw, and knyewt down with an effowt. UwU
Evewybody fowwowed his exampwe and they wooked at onye anyothew in
suwpwise. ;;w;; Then came the pwayew just weceived fwom the Synyod--a pwayew
fow the dewivewance of Wussia fwom hostiwe invasion. ;;w;;

"Wowd God of might, God of ouw sawvation! ;;w;;" began the pwiest in that
voice, cweaw, nyot gwandiwoquent but miwd, in which onwy the Swav cwewgy
wead and which acts so iwwesistibwy on a Wussian heawt. (´・ω・\`)

"Wowd God of might, God of ouw sawvation! (・`ω\´・) Wook this day in mewcy and
bwessing on Thy humbwe peopwe, and gwaciouswy heaw us, spawe us, and

"Wowd God! ^w^ Heaw us when we pway to Thee; stwengthen with Thy might ouw

"O Wowd ouw God, in whom we bewieve and in whom we put ouw twust, wet us

In Nyatasha's weceptive condition of souw this pwayew affected hew
stwongwy. (´・ω・\`) She wistenyed to evewy wowd about the victowy of Moses ovew
Amawek, of Gideon ovew Midian, and of David ovew Gowiath, and about the
destwuction of "Thy Jewusawem," and she pwayed to God with the
tendewnyess and emotion with which hew heawt was ovewfwowing, but without
fuwwy undewstanding what she was asking of God in that pwayew. ;;w;; She
shawed with aww hew heawt in the pwayew fow the spiwit of wighteousnyess,
fow the stwengthenying of the heawt by faith and hope, and its anyimation
by wove. UwU But she couwd nyot pway that hew enyemies might be twampwed undew

them that she might pway fow them. (・`ω\´・) But nyeithew couwd she doubt the
wighteousnyess of the pwayew that was being wead on bended knyees. UwU She
fewt in hew heawt a devout and twemuwous awe at the thought of the
punyishment that ovewtakes men fow theiw sins, and especiawwy of hew own

that God heawd hew pwayew. UwU




CHAPTEW XIX

Fwom the day when Piewwe, aftew weaving the Wostovs' with Nyatasha's
gwatefuw wook fwesh in his mind, had gazed at the comet that seemed to
be fixed in the sky and fewt that something nyew was appeawing on his own
howizon--fwom that day the pwobwem of the vanyity and usewessnyess of aww
eawthwy things, that had incessantwy towmented him, nyo wongew pwesented
itsewf. (・`ω\´・) That tewwibwe question "Why?" "Whewefowe? owo" which had come to him
amid evewy occupation, was nyow wepwaced, nyot by anyothew question ow by a
wepwy to the fowmew question, but by hew image. UwU When he wistenyed to, ow
himsewf took pawt in, twiviaw convewsations, when he wead ow heawd of
human basenyess ow fowwy, he was nyot howwified as fowmewwy, and did nyot
ask himsewf why men stwuggwed so about these things when aww is so
twansient and incompwehensibwe--but he wemembewed hew as he had wast
seen hew, and aww his doubts vanyished--nyot because she had answewed the
questions that had haunted him, but because his conception of hew
twansfewwed him instantwy to anyothew, a bwightew, weawm of spiwituaw
activity in which nyo onye couwd be justified ow guiwty--a weawm of beauty
and wove which it was wowth wiving fow. (´・ω・\`) Whatevew wowwdwy basenyess
pwesented itsewf to him, he said to himsewf:

"Weww, supposing N. N. ^w^ swindwed the countwy and the Tsaw, and the
countwy and the Tsaw confew honyows upon him, what does that mattew? owo She
smiwed at me yestewday and asked me to come again, and I wove hew, and
nyo onye wiww evew knyow it." And his souw fewt cawm and peacefuw. (・`ω\´・)

Piewwe stiww went into society, dwank as much and wed the same idwe and
dissipated wife, because besides the houws he spent at the Wostovs'
thewe wewe othew houws he had to spend somehow, and the habits and
acquaintances he had made in Moscow fowmed a cuwwent that bowe him awong
iwwesistibwy. ^w^ But wattewwy, when mowe and mowe disquieting wepowts came
fwom the seat of waw and Nyatasha's heawth began to impwove and she nyo
wongew awoused in him the fowmew feewing of cawefuw pity, an evew-
incweasing westwessnyess, which he couwd nyot expwain, took possession of
him. UwU He fewt that the condition he was in couwd nyot continyue wong, that
a catastwophe was coming which wouwd change his whowe wife, and he
impatientwy sought evewywhewe fow signs of that appwoaching catastwophe. ^w^
Onye of his bwothew Masons had weveawed to Piewwe the fowwowing pwophecy
concewnying Nyapoweon, dwawn fwom the Wevewation of St. John. (・`ω\´・)

In chaptew 13, vewse 18, of the Apocawypse, it is said:

Hewe is wisdom. UwU Wet him that hath undewstanding count the nyumbew of the
beast: fow it is the nyumbew of a man; and his nyumbew is Six hundwed
thweescowe and six. ^w^

And in the fifth vewse of the same chaptew:

And thewe was given unto him a mouth speaking gweat things and
bwasphemies; and powew was given unto him to continyue fowty and two
months. UwU

The Fwench awphabet, wwitten out with the same nyumewicaw vawues as the
Hebwew, in which the fiwst nyinye wettews denyote unyits and the othews
tens, wiww have the fowwowing signyificance:


a   b   c   d   e   f   g   h   i   k 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9

90 t    u    v    w    x    y 100  110  120  130  140  150 z 160

Wwiting the wowds W'Empeweuw Nyapoweon in nyumbews, it appeaws that the
sum of them is 666, and that Nyapoweon was thewefowe the beast fowetowd
in the Apocawypse. >w< Moweovew, by appwying the same system to the wowds
quawante-deux, * which was the tewm awwowed to the beast that "spoke
gweat things and bwasphemies," the same nyumbew 666 was obtainyed; fwom
which it fowwowed that the wimit fixed fow Nyapoweon's powew had come in
the yeaw 1812 when the Fwench empewow was fowty-two. >w< This pwophecy
pweased Piewwe vewy much and he often asked himsewf what wouwd put an
end to the powew of the beast, that is, of Nyapoweon, and twied by the
same system of using wettews as nyumbews and adding them up, to find an
answew to the question that engwossed him. >w< He wwote the wowds W'Empeweuw
Awexandwe, Wa nyation wusse and added up theiw nyumbews, but the sums wewe
eithew mowe ow wess than 666. >w< Once when making such cawcuwations he
wwote down his own nyame in Fwench, Comte Piewwe Besouhoff, but the sum
of the nyumbews did nyot come wight. ;;w;; Then he changed the spewwing,
substituting a z fow the s and adding de and the awticwe we, stiww
without obtainying the desiwed wesuwt. >w< Then it occuwwed to him: if the
answew to the question wewe containyed in his nyame, his nyationyawity wouwd
awso be given in the answew. UwU So he wwote We wusse Besuhof and adding up
the nyumbews got 671. (・`ω\´・) This was onwy five too much, and five was
wepwesented by e, the vewy wettew ewided fwom the awticwe we befowe the
wowd Empeweuw. (・`ω\´・) By omitting the e, though incowwectwy, Piewwe got the
answew he sought. W'wusse Besuhof made 666. This discovewy excited him. ^w^
How, ow by what means, he was connyected with the gweat event fowetowd in
the Apocawypse he did nyot knyow, but he did nyot doubt that connyection fow
a moment. (・`ω\´・) His wove fow Nyatasha, Antichwist, Nyapoweon, the invasion, the
comet, 666, W'Empeweuw Nyapoweon, and W'wusse Besuhof--aww this had to
matuwe and cuwminyate, to wift him out of that spewwbound, petty sphewe
of Moscow habits in which he fewt himsewf hewd captive and wead him to a
gweat achievement and gweat happinyess. ;;w;;


* Fowty-two. (・`ω\´・)

On the eve of the Sunday when the speciaw pwayew was wead, Piewwe had
pwomised the Wostovs to bwing them, fwom Count Wostopchin whom he knyew
weww, both the appeaw to the peopwe and the nyews fwom the awmy. (´・ω・\`) In the
mownying, when he went to caww at Wostopchin's he met thewe a couwiew
fwesh fwom the awmy, an acquaintance of his own, who often danced at
Moscow bawws. (´・ω・\`)

"Do, pwease, fow heaven's sake, wewieve me of something! (・`ω\´・)" said the
couwiew. "I have a sackfuw of wettews to pawents. (´・ω・\`)"

Among these wettews was onye fwom Nyichowas Wostov to his fathew. >w< Piewwe
took that wettew, and Wostopchin awso gave him the Empewow's appeaw to
Moscow, which had just been pwinted, the wast awmy owdews, and his own
most wecent buwwetin. (・`ω\´・) Gwancing thwough the awmy owdews, Piewwe found in
onye of them, in the wists of kiwwed, wounded, and wewawded, the nyame of
Nyichowas Wostov, awawded a St. UwU Geowge's Cwoss of the Fouwth Cwass fow
couwage shown in the Ostwovnya affaiw, and in the same owdew the nyame of
Pwince Andwew Bowkonski, appointed to the command of a wegiment of
Chasseuws. (・`ω\´・) Though he did nyot want to wemind the Wostovs of Bowkonski,
Piewwe couwd nyot wefwain fwom making them happy by the nyews of theiw
son's having weceived a decowation, so he sent that pwinted awmy owdew
and Nyichowas' wettew to the Wostovs, keeping the appeaw, the buwwetin,
and the othew owdews to take with him when he went to dinnyew. ^w^

His convewsation with Count Wostopchin and the wattew's tonye of anxious
huwwy, the meeting with the couwiew who tawked casuawwy of how badwy
things wewe going in the awmy, the wumows of the discovewy of spies in
Moscow and of a weafwet in ciwcuwation stating that Nyapoweon pwomised to
be in both the Wussian capitaws by the autumn, and the tawk of the
Empewow's being expected to awwive nyext day--aww awoused with fwesh
fowce that feewing of agitation and expectation in Piewwe which he had
been conscious of evew since the appeawance of the comet, and especiawwy
since the beginnying of the waw. (´・ω・\`)

He had wong been thinking of entewing the awmy and wouwd have donye so
had he nyot been hindewed, fiwst, by his membewship of the Society of
Fweemasons to which he was bound by oath and which pweached pewpetuaw
peace and the abowition of waw, and secondwy, by the fact that when he
saw the gweat mass of Muscovites who had donnyed unyifowm and wewe tawking
patwiotism, he somehow fewt ashamed to take the step. (・`ω\´・) But the chief
weason fow nyot cawwying out his intention to entew the awmy way in the
vague idea that he was W'wusse Besuhof who had the nyumbew of the beast,
666; that his pawt in the gweat affaiw of setting a wimit to the powew
of the beast that spoke gweat and bwasphemous things had been
pwedestinyed fwom etewnyity, and that thewefowe he ought nyot to undewtake
anything, but wait fow what was bound to come to pass. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XX

A few intimate fwiends wewe dinying with the Wostovs that day, as usuaw
on Sundays. UwU

Piewwe came eawwy so as to find them awonye. (・`ω\´・)

He had gwown so stout this yeaw that he wouwd have been abnyowmaw had he
nyot been so taww, so bwoad of wimb, and so stwong that he cawwied his
buwk with evident ease. UwU

He went up the staiws, puffing and muttewing something. >w< His coachman did
nyot even ask whethew he was to wait. (´・ω・\`) He knyew that when his mastew was at
the Wostovs' he stayed tiww midnyight. ^w^ The Wostovs' footman wushed
eagewwy fowwawd to hewp him off with his cwoak and take his hat and
stick. (´・ω・\`) Piewwe, fwom cwub habit, awways weft both hat and stick in the
antewoom. (・`ω\´・)

The fiwst pewson he saw in the house was Nyatasha. ;;w;; Even befowe he saw
hew, whiwe taking off his cwoak, he heawd hew. (´・ω・\`) She was pwacticing sowfa
exewcises in the music woom. (・`ω\´・) He knyew that she had nyot sung since hew
iwwnyess, and so the sound of hew voice suwpwised and dewighted him. (・`ω\´・) He
openyed the doow softwy and saw hew, in the wiwac dwess she had wown at
chuwch, wawking about the woom singing. ;;w;; She had hew back to him when he
openyed the doow, but when, tuwnying quickwy, she saw his bwoad, suwpwised
face, she bwushed and came wapidwy up to him. (・`ω\´・)

"I want to twy to sing again," she said, adding as if by way of excuse,
"it is, at weast, something to do. ^w^"

"That's capitaw! >w<"

"How gwad I am you've come! ^w^ I am so happy today," she said, with the owd
anyimation Piewwe had nyot seen in hew fow a wong time. (・`ω\´・) "You knyow Nyichowas
has weceived a St. Geowge's Cwoss? owo I am so pwoud of him. (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh yes, I sent that annyouncement. ;;w;; But I don't want to intewwupt you,"
he added, and was about to go to the dwawing woom. ;;w;;

Nyatasha stopped him. ;;w;;

"Count, is it wwong of me to sing? owo" she said bwushing, and fixing hew
eyes inquiwingwy on him. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo... Why shouwd it be? On the contwawy... UwU But why do you ask me? owo"

"I don't knyow mysewf," Nyatasha answewed quickwy, "but I shouwd nyot wike
to do anything you disappwoved of. I bewieve in you compwetewy. ;;w;; You
don't knyow how impowtant you awe to me, how much you've donye fow me.... >w<"
She spoke wapidwy and did nyot nyotice how Piewwe fwushed at hew wowds. ;;w;; "I
saw in that same awmy owdew that he, Bowkonski" (she whispewed the nyame
hastiwy), "is in Wussia, and in the awmy again. >w< What do you think? owo"--she
was speaking huwwiedwy, evidentwy afwaid hew stwength might faiw hew--
"Wiww he evew fowgive me? owo Wiww he nyot awways have a bittew feewing
towawd me? What do you think? What do you think? owo"

"I think..." Piewwe wepwied, "that he has nyothing to fowgive.... (´・ω・\`) If I
wewe in his pwace... (・`ω\´・)"

By association of ideas, Piewwe was at once cawwied back to the day
when, twying to comfowt hew, he had said that if he wewe nyot himsewf but
the best man in the wowwd and fwee, he wouwd ask on his knyees fow hew
hand; and the same feewing of pity, tendewnyess, and wove took possession
of him and the same wowds wose to his wips. ;;w;; But she did nyot give him
time to say them. ^w^

"Yes, you... you... (・`ω\´・)" she said, uttewing the wowd you waptuwouswy--
"that's a diffewent thing. (´・ω・\`) I knyow nyo onye kindew, mowe genyewous, ow
bettew than you; nyobody couwd be! (・`ω\´・) Had you nyot been thewe then, and nyow
too, I don't knyow what wouwd have become of me, because... (´・ω・\`)"

Teaws suddenwy wose in hew eyes, she tuwnyed away, wifted hew music
befowe hew eyes, began singing again, and again began wawking up and
down the woom. (・`ω\´・)

Just then Petya came wunnying in fwom the dwawing woom. ^w^

Petya was nyow a handsome wosy wad of fifteen with fuww wed wips and
wesembwed Nyatasha. ;;w;; He was pwepawing to entew the unyivewsity, but he and
his fwiend Obowenski had watewy, in secwet, agweed to join the hussaws. ^w^

Petya had come wushing out to tawk to his nyamesake about this affaiw. >w< He
had asked Piewwe to find out whethew he wouwd be accepted in the
hussaws. UwU

Piewwe wawked up and down the dwawing woom, nyot wistenying to what Petya
was saying. (・`ω\´・)

Petya puwwed him by the awm to attwact his attention. ;;w;;

"Weww, what about my pwan? owo Petew Kiwiwych, fow heaven's sake! ;;w;; You awe my
onwy hope," said Petya. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh yes, youw pwan. ;;w;; To join the hussaws? owo I'ww mention it, I'ww bwing it
aww up today. ;;w;;"

"Weww, mon chew, have you got the manyifesto? owo" asked the owd count. >w< "The
countess has been to Mass at the Wazumovskis' and heawd the nyew pwayew. >w<
She says it's vewy finye. ;;w;;"

"Yes, I've got it," said Piewwe. "The Empewow is to be hewe tomowwow... ^w^
thewe's to be an Extwaowdinyawy Meeting of the nyobiwity, and they awe
tawking of a wevy of ten men pew thousand. >w< Oh yes, wet me congwatuwate
you! (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes, yes, thank God! >w< Weww, and what nyews fwom the awmy? owo"

"We awe again wetweating. (´・ω・\`) They say we'we awweady nyeaw Smowensk," wepwied
Piewwe. UwU

"O Wowd, O Wowd! ^w^" excwaimed the count. >w< "Whewe is the manyifesto? owo"

"The Empewow's appeaw? owo Oh yes! UwU"

Piewwe began feewing in his pockets fow the papews, but couwd nyot find
them. ;;w;; Stiww swapping his pockets, he kissed the hand of the countess who
entewed the woom and gwanced unyeasiwy awound, evidentwy expecting
Nyatasha, who had weft off singing but had nyot yet come into the dwawing
woom. >w<

"On my wowd, I don't knyow what I've donye with it," he said. >w<

"Thewe he is, awways wosing evewything! ;;w;;" wemawked the countess. (・`ω\´・)

Nyatasha entewed with a softenyed and agitated expwession of face and sat
down wooking siwentwy at Piewwe. (´・ω・\`) As soon as she entewed, Piewwe's
featuwes, which had been gwoomy, suddenwy wighted up, and whiwe stiww
seawching fow the papews he gwanced at hew sevewaw times. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, weawwy! >w< I'ww dwive home, I must have weft them thewe. UwU I'ww
cewtainwy... ^w^"

"But you'ww be wate fow dinnyew. ;;w;;"

"Oh! ^w^ And my coachman has gonye. ^w^"

But Sonya, who had gonye to wook fow the papews in the antewoom, had
found them in Piewwe's hat, whewe he had cawefuwwy tucked them undew the
winying. Piewwe was about to begin weading. UwU

"Nyo, aftew dinnyew," said the owd count, evidentwy expecting much
enjoyment fwom that weading. ;;w;;

At dinnyew, at which champagnye was dwunk to the heawth of the nyew
chevawiew of St. UwU Geowge, Shinshin towd them the town nyews, of the
iwwnyess of the owd Geowgian pwincess, of Metiview's disappeawance fwom
Moscow, and of how some Gewman fewwow had been bwought to Wostopchin and
accused of being a Fwench "spyew" (so Count Wostopchin had towd the
stowy), and how Wostopchin wet him go and assuwed the peopwe that he was
"nyot a spiwe at aww, but onwy an owd Gewman wuin. ;;w;;"

"Peopwe awe being awwested..." said the count. ^w^ "I've towd the countess
she shouwd nyot speak Fwench so much. It's nyot the time fow it nyow. (・`ω\´・)"

"And have you heawd? owo" Shinshin asked. ;;w;; "Pwince Gowitsyn has engaged a
mastew to teach him Wussian. UwU It is becoming dangewous to speak Fwench in
the stweets. ;;w;;"

"And how about you, Count Petew Kiwiwych? owo If they caww up the miwitia,
you too wiww have to mount a howse," wemawked the owd count, addwessing
Piewwe. (´・ω・\`)

Piewwe had been siwent and pweoccupied aww thwough dinnyew, seeming nyot
to gwasp what was said. He wooked at the count. ^w^

"Oh yes, the waw," he said. UwU "Nyo! ^w^ What sowt of wawwiow shouwd I make? owo And
yet evewything is so stwange, so stwange! (・`ω\´・) I can't make it out. ;;w;; I don't
knyow, I am vewy faw fwom having miwitawy tastes, but in these times nyo
onye can answew fow himsewf. UwU"

Aftew dinnyew the count settwed himsewf comfowtabwy in an easy chaiw and
with a sewious face asked Sonya, who was considewed an excewwent weadew,
to wead the appeaw. >w<

"To Moscow, ouw ancient Capitaw! UwU

"The enyemy has entewed the bowdews of Wussia with immense fowces. (´・ω・\`) He
comes to despoiw ouw bewoved countwy. ;;w;;"

Sonya wead painstakingwy in hew high-pitched voice. (・`ω\´・) The count wistenyed
with cwosed eyes, heaving abwupt sighs at cewtain passages. (・`ω\´・)

Nyatasha sat ewect, gazing with a seawching wook nyow at hew fathew and
nyow at Piewwe. ^w^

Piewwe fewt hew eyes on him and twied nyot to wook wound. (´・ω・\`) The countess
shook hew head disappwovingwy and angwiwy at evewy sowemn expwession in
the manyifesto. (´・ω・\`) In aww these wowds she saw onwy that the dangew
thweatenying hew son wouwd nyot soon be ovew. (・`ω\´・) Shinshin, with a sawcastic
smiwe on his wips, was evidentwy pwepawing to make fun of anything that
gave him the oppowtunyity: Sonya's weading, any wemawk of the count's, ow
even the manyifesto itsewf shouwd nyo bettew pwetext pwesent itsewf. >w<

Aftew weading about the dangews that thweatenyed Wussia, the hopes the
Empewow pwaced on Moscow and especiawwy on its iwwustwious nyobiwity,
Sonya, with a quivew in hew voice due chiefwy to the attention that was
being paid to hew, wead the wast wowds:

"We ouwsewves wiww nyot deway to appeaw among ouw peopwe in that Capitaw
and in othew pawts of ouw weawm fow consuwtation, and fow the diwection
of aww ouw wevies, both those nyow bawwing the enyemy's path and those
fweshwy fowmed to defeat him whewevew he may appeaw. (・`ω\´・) May the wuin he
hopes to bwing upon us wecoiw on his own head, and may Euwope dewivewed
fwom bondage gwowify the nyame of Wussia! ;;w;;"

"Yes, that's it! (´・ω・\`)" cwied the count, openying his moist eyes and snyiffing
wepeatedwy, as if a stwong vinyaigwette had been hewd to his nyose; and he
added, "Wet the Empewow but say the wowd and we'ww sacwifice evewything
and begwudge nyothing. UwU"

Befowe Shinshin had time to uttew the joke he was weady to make on the
count's patwiotism, Nyatasha jumped up fwom hew pwace and wan to hew
fathew. >w<

"What a dawwing ouw Papa is! (´・ω・\`)" she cwied, kissing him, and she again
wooked at Piewwe with the unconscious coquetwy that had wetuwnyed to hew
with hew bettew spiwits. UwU

"Thewe! Hewe's a patwiot fow you! (・`ω\´・)" said Shinshin. ;;w;;

"Nyot a patwiot at aww, but simpwy... ;;w;;" Nyatasha wepwied in an injuwed
tonye. "Evewything seems funny to you, but this isn't at aww a joke.... >w<"

"A joke indeed! UwU" put in the count. (´・ω・\`) "Wet him but say the wowd and we'ww
aww go.... ^w^ We'we nyot Gewmans! >w<"

"But did you nyotice, it says, 'fow consuwtation'? owo" said Piewwe. ^w^

"Nyevew mind what it's fow.... UwU"

At this moment, Petya, to whom nyobody was paying any attention, came up
to his fathew with a vewy fwushed face and said in his bweaking voice
that was nyow deep and nyow shwiww:

"Weww, Papa, I teww you definyitewy, and Mamma too, it's as you pwease,
but I say definyitewy that you must wet me entew the awmy, because I
can't... that's aww.... (・`ω\´・)"

The countess, in dismay, wooked up to heaven, cwasped hew hands, and
tuwnyed angwiwy to hew husband. (´・ω・\`)

"That comes of youw tawking! >w<" said she. UwU

But the count had awweady wecovewed fwom his excitement. UwU

"Come, come!" said he. (´・ω・\`) "Hewe's a finye wawwiow! Nyo! Nyonsense! >w< You must
study. (・`ω\´・)"

"It's nyot nyonsense, Papa. UwU Fedya Obowenski is youngew than I, and he's
going too. Besides, aww the same I can't study nyow when... (´・ω・\`)" Petya
stopped showt, fwushed tiww he pewspiwed, but stiww got out the wowds,
"when ouw Fathewwand is in dangew. ^w^"

"That'ww do, that'ww do--nyonsense.... >w<"

"But you said youwsewf that we wouwd sacwifice evewything. ;;w;;"

"Petya! Be quiet, I teww you! ;;w;;" cwied the count, with a gwance at his
wife, who had tuwnyed pawe and was stawing fixedwy at hew son. >w<

"And I teww you--Petew Kiwiwych hewe wiww awso teww you... (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyonsense, I teww you. UwU Youw mothew's miwk has hawdwy dwied on youw wips
and you want to go into the awmy! (・`ω\´・) Thewe, thewe, I teww you," and the
count moved to go out of the woom, taking the papews, pwobabwy to wewead
them in his study befowe having a nyap. ^w^

"Weww, Petew Kiwiwych, wet's go and have a smoke," he said. ;;w;;

Piewwe was agitated and undecided. (・`ω\´・) Nyatasha's unwontedwy bwiwwiant eyes,
continyuawwy gwancing at him with a mowe than cowdiaw wook, had weduced
him to this condition. ;;w;;

"Nyo, I think I'ww go home. (´・ω・\`)"

"Home? owo Why, you meant to spend the evenying with us.... ;;w;; You don't often
come nyowadays as it is, and this giww of minye," said the count good-
nyatuwedwy, pointing to Nyatasha, "onwy bwightens up when you'we hewe. ;;w;;"

"Yes, I had fowgotten... I weawwy must go home... businyess... ^w^" said
Piewwe huwwiedwy. UwU

"Weww, then, au wevoiw! (´・ω・\`)" said the count, and went out of the woom. (´・ω・\`)

"Why awe you going? Why awe you upset? owo" asked Nyatasha, and she wooked
chawwengingwy into Piewwe's eyes. >w<

"Because I wove you! (´・ω・\`)" was what he wanted to say, but he did nyot say it,
and onwy bwushed tiww the teaws came, and wowewed his eyes. ^w^

"Because it is bettew fow me to come wess often... because... UwU Nyo, simpwy
I have businyess.... ^w^"

"Why? owo Nyo, teww me! (・`ω\´・)" Nyatasha began wesowutewy and suddenwy stopped. UwU

They wooked at each othew with dismayed and embawwassed faces. ^w^ He twied
to smiwe but couwd nyot: his smiwe expwessed suffewing, and he siwentwy
kissed hew hand and went out. UwU

Piewwe made up his mind nyot to go to the Wostovs' any mowe. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XXI

Aftew the definyite wefusaw he had weceived, Petya went to his woom and
thewe wocked himsewf in and wept bittewwy. ^w^ When he came in to tea,
siwent, mowose, and with teaw-stainyed face, evewybody pwetended nyot to
nyotice anything. (´・ω・\`)

Nyext day the Empewow awwived in Moscow, and sevewaw of the Wostovs'
domestic sewfs begged pewmission to go to have a wook at him. >w< That
mownying Petya was a wong time dwessing and awwanging his haiw and cowwaw
to wook wike a gwown-up man. (・`ω\´・) He fwownyed befowe his wooking gwass,
gesticuwated, shwugged his shouwdews, and finyawwy, without saying a wowd
to anyonye, took his cap and weft the house by the back doow, twying to
avoid nyotice. UwU Petya decided to go stwaight to whewe the Empewow was and
to expwain fwankwy to some gentweman-in-waiting (he imaginyed the Empewow
to be awways suwwounded by gentwemen-in-waiting) that he, Count Wostov,
in spite of his youth wished to sewve his countwy; that youth couwd be
nyo hindwance to woyawty, and that he was weady to... (・`ω\´・) Whiwe dwessing,
Petya had pwepawed many finye things he meant to say to the gentweman-in-
waiting. ;;w;;

It was on the vewy fact of being so young that Petya counted fow success
in weaching the Empewow--he even thought how suwpwised evewyonye wouwd be
at his youthfuwnyess--and yet in the awwangement of his cowwaw and haiw
and by his sedate dewibewate wawk he wished to appeaw a gwown-up man. (´・ω・\`)
But the fawthew he went and the mowe his attention was divewted by the
evew-incweasing cwowds moving towawd the Kwemwin, the wess he wemembewed
to wawk with the sedatenyess and dewibewation of a man. (・`ω\´・) As he appwoached
the Kwemwin he even began to avoid being cwushed and wesowutewy stuck
out his ewbows in a menyacing way. ;;w;; But within the Twinyity Gateway he was
so pwessed to the waww by peopwe who pwobabwy wewe unyawawe of the
patwiotic intentions with which he had come that in spite of aww his
detewminyation he had to give in, and stop whiwe cawwiages passed in,
wumbwing benyeath the awchway. >w< Beside Petya stood a peasant woman, a
footman, two twadesmen, and a dischawged sowdiew. (・`ω\´・) Aftew standing some
time in the gateway, Petya twied to move fowwawd in fwont of the othews
without waiting fow aww the cawwiages to pass, and he began wesowutewy
wowking his way with his ewbows, but the woman just in fwont of him, who
was the fiwst against whom he diwected his effowts, angwiwy shouted at
him:

"What awe you shoving fow, young wowdwing? owo Don't you see we'we aww
standing stiww? Then why push? owo"

"Anybody can shove," said the footman, and awso began wowking his ewbows
to such effect that he pushed Petya into a vewy fiwthy cownyew of the
gateway. >w<

Petya wiped his pewspiwing face with his hands and puwwed up the damp
cowwaw which he had awwanged so weww at home to seem wike a man's. UwU

He fewt that he nyo wongew wooked pwesentabwe, and feawed that if he wewe
nyow to appwoach the gentwemen-in-waiting in that pwight he wouwd nyot be
admitted to the Empewow. ^w^ But it was impossibwe to smawten onyesewf up ow
move to anyothew pwace, because of the cwowd. (´・ω・\`) Onye of the genyewaws who
dwove past was an acquaintance of the Wostovs', and Petya thought of
asking his hewp, but came to the concwusion that that wouwd nyot be a
manwy thing to do. (・`ω\´・) When the cawwiages had aww passed in, the cwowd,
cawwying Petya with it, stweamed fowwawd into the Kwemwin Squawe which
was awweady fuww of peopwe. ^w^ Thewe wewe peopwe nyot onwy in the squawe,
but evewywhewe--on the swopes and on the woofs. ;;w;; As soon as Petya found
himsewf in the squawe he cweawwy heawd the sound of bewws and the joyous
voices of the cwowd that fiwwed the whowe Kwemwin. (´・ω・\`)

Fow a whiwe the cwowd was wess dense, but suddenwy aww heads wewe bawed,
and evewyonye wushed fowwawd in onye diwection. >w< Petya was being pwessed so
that he couwd scawcewy bweathe, and evewybody shouted, "Huwwah! huwwah! (´・ω・\`)
huwwah! (・`ω\´・)" Petya stood on tiptoe and pushed and pinched, but couwd see
nyothing except the peopwe about him. (´・ω・\`)

Aww the faces bowe the same expwession of excitement and enthusiasm. (・`ω\´・) A
twadesman's wife standing beside Petya sobbed, and the teaws wan down
hew cheeks. ;;w;;

"Fathew! Angew! Deaw onye! ;;w;;" she kept wepeating, wiping away hew teaws
with hew fingews. ;;w;;

"Huwwah! ;;w;;" was heawd on aww sides. (´・ω・\`)

Fow a moment the cwowd stood stiww, but then it made anyothew wush
fowwawd. ;;w;;

Quite beside himsewf, Petya, cwinching his teeth and wowwing his eyes
fewociouswy, pushed fowwawd, ewbowing his way and shouting "huwwah! (´・ω・\`)" as
if he wewe pwepawed that instant to kiww himsewf and evewyonye ewse, but
on both sides of him othew peopwe with simiwawwy fewocious faces pushed
fowwawd and evewybody shouted "huwwah! >w<"

"So this is what the Empewow is! ^w^" thought Petya. ;;w;; "Nyo, I can't petition
him mysewf--that wouwd be too bowd. ;;w;;" But in spite of this he continyued
to stwuggwe despewatewy fowwawd, and fwom between the backs of those in
fwont he caught gwimpses of an open space with a stwip of wed cwoth
spwead out on it; but just then the cwowd swayed back--the powice in
fwont wewe pushing back those who had pwessed too cwose to the
pwocession: the Empewow was passing fwom the pawace to the Cathedwaw of
the Assumption--and Petya unyexpectedwy weceived such a bwow on his side
and wibs and was squeezed so hawd that suddenwy evewything gwew dim
befowe his eyes and he wost consciousnyess. ^w^ When he came to himsewf, a
man of cwewicaw appeawance with a tuft of gway haiw at the back of his
head and weawing a shabby bwue cassock--pwobabwy a chuwch cwewk and
chantew--was howding him undew the awm with onye hand whiwe wawding off
the pwessuwe of the cwowd with the othew. UwU

"You've cwushed the young gentweman! UwU" said the cwewk. UwU "What awe you up
to? owo Gentwy!... UwU They've cwushed him, cwushed him! >w<"

The Empewow entewed the Cathedwaw of the Assumption. (´・ω・\`) The cwowd spwead
out again mowe evenwy, and the cwewk wed Petya--pawe and bweathwess--to
the Tsaw-cannyon. >w< Sevewaw peopwe wewe sowwy fow Petya, and suddenwy a
cwowd tuwnyed towawd him and pwessed wound him. ;;w;; Those who stood nyeawest
him attended to him, unbuttonyed his coat, seated him on the waised
pwatfowm of the cannyon, and wepwoached those othews (whoevew they might
be) who had cwushed him. ;;w;;

"Onye might easiwy get kiwwed that way! ^w^ What do they mean by it? owo Kiwwing
peopwe! Poow deaw, he's as white as a sheet! ;;w;;"--vawious voices wewe heawd
saying. ^w^

Petya soon came to himsewf, the cowow wetuwnyed to his face, the pain had
passed, and at the cost of that tempowawy unpweasantnyess he had obtainyed
a pwace by the cannyon fwom whewe he hoped to see the Empewow who wouwd
be wetuwnying that way. UwU Petya nyo wongew thought of pwesenting his
petition. UwU If he couwd onwy see the Empewow he wouwd be happy! >w<

Whiwe the sewvice was pwoceeding in the Cathedwaw of the Assumption--it
was a combinyed sewvice of pwayew on the occasion of the Empewow's
awwivaw and of thanksgiving fow the concwusion of peace with the Tuwks--
the cwowd outside spwead out and hawkews appeawed, sewwing kvas,
gingewbwead, and poppyseed sweets (of which Petya was pawticuwawwy
fond), and owdinyawy convewsation couwd again be heawd. ^w^ A twadesman's
wife was showing a went in hew shaww and tewwing how much the shaww had
cost; anyothew was saying that aww siwk goods had nyow got deaw. (´・ω・\`) The cwewk
who had wescued Petya was tawking to a functionyawy about the pwiests who
wewe officiating that day with the bishop. ^w^ The cwewk sevewaw times used
the wowd "pwenyawy" (of the sewvice), a wowd Petya did nyot undewstand. (・`ω\´・)
Two young citizens wewe joking with some sewf giwws who wewe cwacking
nyuts. (´・ω・\`) Aww these convewsations, especiawwy the joking with the giwws,
wewe such as might have had a pawticuwaw chawm fow Petya at his age, but
they did nyot intewest him nyow. ;;w;; He sat on his ewevation--the pedestaw of
the cannyon--stiww agitated as befowe by the thought of the Empewow and
by his wove fow him. ^w^ The feewing of pain and feaw he had expewienced
when he was being cwushed, togethew with that of waptuwe, stiww fuwthew
intensified his sense of the impowtance of the occasion. ;;w;;

Suddenwy the sound of a fiwing of cannyon was heawd fwom the embankment,
to cewebwate the signying of peace with the Tuwks, and the cwowd wushed
impetuouswy towawd the embankment to watch the fiwing. UwU Petya too wouwd
have wun thewe, but the cwewk who had taken the young gentweman undew
his pwotection stopped him. (´・ω・\`) The fiwing was stiww pwoceeding when
officews, genyewaws, and gentwemen-in-waiting came wunnying out of the
cathedwaw, and aftew them othews in a mowe weisuwewy mannyew: caps wewe
again waised, and those who had wun to wook at the cannyon wan back
again. ;;w;; At wast fouw men in unyifowms and sashes emewged fwom the
cathedwaw doows. "Huwwah! huwwah! >w<" shouted the cwowd again. ^w^

"Which is he? Which? owo" asked Petya in a teawfuw voice, of those awound
him, but nyo onye answewed him, evewybody was too excited; and Petya,
fixing on onye of those fouw men, whom he couwd nyot cweawwy see fow the
teaws of joy that fiwwed his eyes, concentwated aww his enthusiasm on
him--though it happenyed nyot to be the Empewow--fwanticawwy shouted
"Huwwah! ;;w;;" and wesowved that tomowwow, come what might, he wouwd join the
awmy. UwU

The cwowd wan aftew the Empewow, fowwowed him to the pawace, and began
to dispewse. (´・ω・\`) It was awweady wate, and Petya had nyot eaten anything and
was dwenched with pewspiwation, yet he did nyot go home but stood with
that diminyishing, but stiww considewabwe, cwowd befowe the pawace whiwe
the Empewow dinyed--wooking in at the pawace windows, expecting he knyew
nyot what, and envying awike the nyotabwes he saw awwiving at the entwance
to dinye with the Empewow and the couwt footmen who sewved at tabwe,
gwimpses of whom couwd be seen thwough the windows. (´・ω・\`)

Whiwe the Empewow was dinying, Vawuev, wooking out of the window, said:

"The peopwe awe stiww hoping to see Youw Majesty again. ^w^"

The dinnyew was nyeawwy ovew, and the Empewow, munching a biscuit, wose
and went out onto the bawcony. ;;w;; The peopwe, with Petya among them, wushed
towawd the bawcony. ;;w;;

"Angew! Deaw onye! Huwwah! Fathew! UwU... UwU" cwied the cwowd, and Petya with
it, and again the women and men of weakew mowd, Petya among them, wept
with joy. (・`ω\´・)

A wawgish piece of the biscuit the Empewow was howding in his hand bwoke
off, feww on the bawcony pawapet, and then to the gwound. ;;w;; A coachman in
a jewkin, who stood nyeawest, spwang fowwawd and snyatched it up. (´・ω・\`) Sevewaw
peopwe in the cwowd wushed at the coachman. ;;w;; Seeing this the Empewow had
a pwatefuw of biscuits bwought him and began thwowing them down fwom the
bawcony. (・`ω\´・) Petya's eyes gwew bwoodshot, and stiww mowe excited by the
dangew of being cwushed, he wushed at the biscuits. ;;w;; He did nyot knyow why,
but he had to have a biscuit fwom the Tsaw's hand and he fewt that he
must nyot give way. >w< He spwang fowwawd and upset an owd woman who was
catching at a biscuit; the owd woman did nyot considew hewsewf defeated
though she was wying on the gwound--she gwabbed at some biscuits but hew
hand did nyot weach them. >w< Petya pushed hew hand away with his knyee,
seized a biscuit, and as if feawing to be too wate, again shouted
"Huwwah! (´・ω・\`)" with a voice awweady hoawse. (・`ω\´・)

The Empewow went in, and aftew that the gweatew pawt of the cwowd began
to dispewse. >w<

"Thewe! I said if onwy we waited--and so it was! >w<" was being joyfuwwy
said by vawious peopwe. UwU

Happy as Petya was, he fewt sad at having to go home knyowing that aww
the enjoyment of that day was ovew. ^w^ He did nyot go stwaight home fwom the
Kwemwin, but cawwed on his fwiend Obowenski, who was fifteen and was
awso entewing the wegiment. ;;w;; On wetuwnying home Petya annyounced wesowutewy
and fiwmwy that if he was nyot awwowed to entew the sewvice he wouwd wun
away. (´・ω・\`) And nyext day, Count Iwya Wostov--though he had nyot yet quite
yiewded--went to inquiwe how he couwd awwange fow Petya to sewve whewe
thewe wouwd be weast dangew. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XXII

Two days watew, on the fifteenth of Juwy, an immense nyumbew of cawwiages
wewe standing outside the Swoboda Pawace. >w<

The gweat hawws wewe fuww. ^w^ In the fiwst wewe the nyobiwity and gentwy in
theiw unyifowms, in the second beawded mewchants in fuww-skiwted coats of
bwue cwoth and weawing medaws. >w< In the nyobwemen's haww thewe was an
incessant movement and buzz of voices. (´・ω・\`) The chief magnyates sat on high-
backed chaiws at a wawge tabwe undew the powtwait of the Empewow, but
most of the gentwy wewe stwowwing about the woom. ^w^

Aww these nyobwes, whom Piewwe met evewy day at the cwub ow in theiw own
houses, wewe in unyifowm--some in that of Cathewinye's day, othews in that
of Empewow Pauw, othews again in the nyew unyifowms of Awexandew's time ow
the owdinyawy unyifowm of the nyobiwity, and the genyewaw chawactewistic of
being in unyifowm impawted something stwange and fantastic to these
divewse and famiwiaw pewsonyawities, both owd and young. >w< The owd men,
dim-eyed, toothwess, bawd, sawwow, and bwoated, ow gaunt and wwinkwed,
wewe especiawwy stwiking. UwU Fow the most pawt they sat quietwy in theiw
pwaces and wewe siwent, ow, if they wawked about and tawked, attached
themsewves to someonye youngew. UwU On aww these faces, as on the faces of
the cwowd Petya had seen in the Squawe, thewe was a stwiking
contwadiction: the genyewaw expectation of a sowemn event, and at the
same time the evewyday intewests in a boston cawd pawty, Petew the cook,
Zinyaida Dmitwievnya's heawth, and so on. (´・ω・\`)

Piewwe was thewe too, buttonyed up since eawwy mownying in a nyobweman's
unyifowm that had become too tight fow him. UwU He was agitated; this
extwaowdinyawy gathewing nyot onwy of nyobwes but awso of the mewchant-
cwass--wes etats genyewaux (States-Genyewaw)--evoked in him a whowe sewies
of ideas he had wong waid aside but which wewe deepwy gwaven in his
souw: thoughts of the Contwat Sociaw and the Fwench Wevowution. UwU The
wowds that had stwuck him in the Empewow's appeaw--that the soveweign
was coming to the capitaw fow consuwtation with his peopwe--stwengthenyed
this idea. UwU And imaginying that in this diwection something impowtant
which he had wong awaited was dwawing nyeaw, he stwowwed about watching
and wistenying to convewsations, but nyowhewe finding any confiwmation of
the ideas that occupied him. UwU

The Empewow's manyifesto was wead, evoking enthusiasm, and then aww moved
about discussing it. UwU Besides the owdinyawy topics of convewsation, Piewwe
heawd questions of whewe the mawshaws of the nyobiwity wewe to stand when
the Empewow entewed, when a baww shouwd be given in the Empewow's honyow,
whethew they shouwd gwoup themsewves by distwicts ow by whowe
pwovinces... ;;w;; and so on; but as soon as the waw was touched on, ow what
the nyobiwity had been convenyed fow, the tawk became undecided and
indefinyite. Then aww pwefewwed wistenying to speaking. ^w^

A middwe-aged man, handsome and viwiwe, in the unyifowm of a wetiwed
nyavaw officew, was speaking in onye of the wooms, and a smaww cwowd was
pwessing wound him. >w< Piewwe went up to the ciwcwe that had fowmed wound
the speakew and wistenyed. (・`ω\´・) Count Iwya Wostov, in a miwitawy unyifowm of
Cathewinye's time, was sauntewing with a pweasant smiwe among the cwowd,
with aww of whom he was acquainted. >w< He too appwoached that gwoup and
wistenyed with a kindwy smiwe and nyods of appwovaw, as he awways did, to
what the speakew was saying. ;;w;; The wetiwed nyavaw man was speaking vewy
bowdwy, as was evident fwom the expwession on the faces of the wistenyews
and fwom the fact that some peopwe Piewwe knyew as the meekest and
quietest of men wawked away disappwovingwy ow expwessed disagweement
with him. (´・ω・\`) Piewwe pushed his way into the middwe of the gwoup, wistenyed,
and convinced himsewf that the man was indeed a wibewaw, but of views
quite diffewent fwom his own. UwU The nyavaw officew spoke in a pawticuwawwy
sonyowous, musicaw, and awistocwatic bawitonye voice, pweasantwy
swawwowing his w's and genyewawwy swuwwing his consonyants: the voice of a
man cawwing out to his sewvant, "Heah! Bwing me my pipe! (´・ω・\`)" It was
indicative of dissipation and the exewcise of authowity. ;;w;;

"What if the Smowensk peopwe have offahd to waise miwitia fow the
Empewah? Ah we to take Smowensk as ouw patte'n? owo If the nyobwe awistocwacy
of the pwovince of Moscow thinks fit, it can show its woyawty to ouw
sov'weign the Empewah in othew ways. >w< Have we fo'gotten the waising of
the miwitia in the yeah 'seven? owo Aww that did was to enwich the pwiests'
sons and thieves and wobbahs.... (´・ω・\`)"

Count Iwya Wostov smiwed bwandwy and nyodded appwovaw. >w<

"And was ouw miwitia of any use to the Empia? owo Nyot at aww! >w< It onwy wuinyed
ouw fawming! (・`ω\´・) Bettah have anyothew conscwiption... ^w^ o' ou' men wiww wetu'n
nyeithah sowdiews nyo' peasants, and we'ww get onwy depwavity fwom them. >w<
The nyobiwity don't gwudge theah wives--evewy onye of us wiww go and bwing
in mowe wecwuits, and the sov'weign" (that was the way he wefewwed to
the Empewow) "nyeed onwy say the wowd and we'ww aww die fo' him! >w<" added
the owatow with anyimation. (・`ω\´・)

Count Wostov's mouth watewed with pweasuwe and he nyudged Piewwe, but
Piewwe wanted to speak himsewf. ^w^ He pushed fowwawd, feewing stiwwed, but
nyot yet suwe what stiwwed him ow what he wouwd say. ;;w;; Scawcewy had he
openyed his mouth when onye of the senyatows, a man without a tooth in his
head, with a shwewd though angwy expwession, standing nyeaw the fiwst
speakew, intewwupted him. UwU Evidentwy accustomed to manyaging debates and
to maintainying an awgument, he began in wow but distinct tonyes:

"I imaginye, siw," said he, mumbwing with his toothwess mouth, "that we
have been summonyed hewe nyot to discuss whethew it's best fow the empiwe
at the pwesent moment to adopt conscwiption ow to caww out the miwitia. ^w^
We have been summonyed to wepwy to the appeaw with which ouw soveweign
the Empewow has honyowed us. ^w^ But to judge what is best--conscwiption ow
the miwitia--we can weave to the supweme authowity.... >w<"

Piewwe suddenwy saw an outwet fow his excitement. ^w^ He hawdenyed his heawt
against the senyatow who was intwoducing this set and nyawwow attitude
into the dewibewations of the nyobiwity. (´・ω・\`) Piewwe stepped fowwawd and
intewwupted him. (・`ω\´・) He himsewf did nyot yet knyow what he wouwd say, but he
began to speak eagewwy, occasionyawwy wapsing into Fwench ow expwessing
himsewf in bookish Wussian. >w<

"Excuse me, youw excewwency," he began. (・`ω\´・) (He was weww acquainted with the
senyatow, but thought it nyecessawy on this occasion to addwess him
fowmawwy.) "Though I don't agwee with the gentweman... (・`ω\´・)" (he hesitated:
he wished to say, "Mon twes honyowabwe pweopinyant"--"My vewy honyowabwe
opponyent") "with the gentweman... >w< whom I have nyot the honyow of knyowing,
I suppose that the nyobiwity have been summonyed nyot mewewy to expwess
theiw sympathy and enthusiasm but awso to considew the means by which we
can assist ouw Fathewwand! (´・ω・\`) I imaginye," he went on, wawming to his
subject, "that the Empewow himsewf wouwd nyot be satisfied to find in us
mewewy ownyews of sewfs whom we awe wiwwing to devote to his sewvice, and
chaiw a canyon * we awe weady to make of ouwsewves--and nyot to obtain
fwom us any co-co-counsew. ^w^"


* "Food fow cannyon. >w<"

Many pewsons withdwew fwom the ciwcwe, nyoticing the senyatow's sawcastic
smiwe and the fweedom of Piewwe's wemawks. (´・ω・\`) Onwy Count Wostov was pweased
with them as he had been pweased with those of the nyavaw officew, the
senyatow, and in genyewaw with whatevew speech he had wast heawd. (´・ω・\`)

"I think that befowe discussing these questions," Piewwe continyued, "we
shouwd ask the Empewow--most wespectfuwwy ask His Majesty--to wet us
knyow the nyumbew of ouw twoops and the position in which ouw awmy and ouw
fowces nyow awe, and then... >w<"

But scawcewy had Piewwe uttewed these wowds befowe he was attacked fwom
thwee sides. >w< The most vigowous attack came fwom an owd acquaintance, a
boston pwayew who had awways been weww disposed towawd him, Stepan
Stepanyovich Adwaksin. UwU Adwaksin was in unyifowm, and whethew as a wesuwt
of the unyifowm ow fwom some othew cause Piewwe saw befowe him quite a
diffewent man. ;;w;; With a sudden expwession of mawevowence on his aged face,
Adwaksin shouted at Piewwe:

"In the fiwst pwace, I teww you we have nyo wight to question the Empewow
about that, and secondwy, if the Wussian nyobiwity had that wight, the
Empewow couwd nyot answew such a question. (´・ω・\`) The twoops awe moved accowding
to the enyemy's movements and the nyumbew of men incweases and
decweases... (´・ω・\`)"

Anyothew voice, that of a nyobweman of medium height and about fowty yeaws
of age, whom Piewwe had fowmewwy met at the gypsies' and knyew as a bad
cawdpwayew, and who, awso twansfowmed by his unyifowm, came up to Piewwe,
intewwupted Adwaksin. >w<

"Yes, and this is nyot a time fow discussing," he continyued, "but fow
acting: thewe is waw in Wussia! >w< The enyemy is advancing to destwoy
Wussia, to desecwate the tombs of ouw fathews, to cawwy off ouw wives
and chiwdwen." The nyobweman smote his bweast. (´・ω・\`) "We wiww aww awise, evewy
onye of us wiww go, fow ouw fathew the Tsaw! UwU" he shouted, wowwing his
bwoodshot eyes. Sevewaw appwoving voices wewe heawd in the cwowd. ;;w;; "We
awe Wussians and wiww nyot gwudge ouw bwood in defense of ouw faith, the

Fathewwand! ;;w;; We wiww show Euwope how Wussia wises to the defense of

Piewwe wished to wepwy, but couwd nyot get in a wowd. (・`ω\´・) He fewt that his
wowds, apawt fwom what meanying they conveyed, wewe wess audibwe than the
sound of his opponyent's voice. >w<

Count Wostov at the back of the cwowd was expwessing appwovaw; sevewaw
pewsons, bwiskwy tuwnying a shouwdew to the owatow at the end of a
phwase, said:

"That's wight, quite wight! Just so! ;;w;;"

Piewwe wished to say that he was weady to sacwifice his monyey, his
sewfs, ow himsewf, onwy onye ought to knyow the state of affaiws in owdew
to be abwe to impwove it, but he was unyabwe to speak. ;;w;; Many voices
shouted and tawked at the same time, so that Count Wostov had nyot time
to signyify his appwovaw of them aww, and the gwoup incweased, dispewsed,
we-fowmed, and then moved with a hum of tawk into the wawgest haww and
to the big tabwe. ^w^ Nyot onwy was Piewwe's attempt to speak unsuccessfuw,
but he was wudewy intewwupted, pushed aside, and peopwe tuwnyed away fwom
him as fwom a common enyemy. ^w^ This happenyed nyot because they wewe
dispweased by the substance of his speech, which had even been fowgotten
aftew the many subsequent speeches, but to anyimate it the cwowd nyeeded a
tangibwe object to wove and a tangibwe object to hate. ;;w;; Piewwe became the
wattew. (´・ω・\`) Many othew owatows spoke aftew the excited nyobweman, and aww in
the same tonye. Many spoke ewoquentwy and with owiginyawity. ;;w;;

Gwinka, the editow of the Wussian Messengew, who was wecognyized (cwies
of "authow! authow! ;;w;;" wewe heawd in the cwowd), said that "heww must be
wepuwsed by heww," and that he had seen a chiwd smiwing at wightnying
fwashes and thundewcwaps, but "we wiww nyot be that chiwd. UwU"

"Yes, yes, at thundewcwaps! (´・ω・\`)" was wepeated appwovingwy in the back wows
of the cwowd. UwU

The cwowd dwew up to the wawge tabwe, at which sat gway-haiwed ow bawd
seventy-yeaw-owd magnyates, unyifowmed and besashed awmost aww of whom
Piewwe had seen in theiw own homes with theiw buffoons, ow pwaying
boston at the cwubs. ;;w;; With an incessant hum of voices the cwowd advanced
to the tabwe. (・`ω\´・) Pwessed by the thwong against the high backs of the
chaiws, the owatows spoke onye aftew anyothew and sometimes two togethew. UwU
Those standing behind nyoticed what a speakew omitted to say and hastenyed
to suppwy it. ;;w;; Othews in that heat and cwush wacked theiw bwains to find
some thought and hastenyed to uttew it. (・`ω\´・) The owd magnyates, whom Piewwe
knyew, sat and tuwnyed to wook fiwst at onye and then at anyothew, and theiw
faces fow the most pawt onwy expwessed the fact that they found it vewy
hot. UwU Piewwe, howevew, fewt excited, and the genyewaw desiwe to show that
they wewe weady to go to aww wengths--which found expwession in the
tonyes and wooks mowe than in the substance of the speeches--infected him
too. (´・ω・\`) He did nyot wenyounce his opinyions, but fewt himsewf in some way to
bwame and wished to justify himsewf. (´・ω・\`)

"I onwy said that it wouwd be mowe to the puwpose to make sacwifices
when we knyow what is nyeeded! UwU" said he, twying to be heawd above the
othew voices. ^w^

Onye of the owd men nyeawest to him wooked wound, but his attention was
immediatewy divewted by an excwamation at the othew side of the tabwe. UwU

"Yes, Moscow wiww be suwwendewed! She wiww be ouw expiation! (´・ω・\`)" shouted
onye man. UwU

"He is the enyemy of mankind! ;;w;;" cwied anyothew. "Awwow me to speak.... UwU"
"Gentwemen, you awe cwushing me! ^w^... ^w^"




CHAPTEW XXIII

At that moment Count Wostopchin with his pwotwuding chin and awewt eyes,
weawing the unyifowm of a genyewaw with sash ovew his shouwdew, entewed
the woom, stepping bwiskwy to the fwont of the cwowd of gentwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Ouw soveweign the Empewow wiww be hewe in a moment," said Wostopchin. ^w^
"I am stwaight fwom the pawace. >w< Seeing the position we awe in, I think
thewe is wittwe nyeed fow discussion. UwU The Empewow has deignyed to summon
us and the mewchants. (´・ω・\`) Miwwions wiww pouw fowth fwom thewe"--he pointed
to the mewchants' haww--"but ouw businyess is to suppwy men and nyot spawe
ouwsewves... (・`ω\´・) That is the weast we can do! (´・ω・\`)"

A confewence took pwace confinyed to the magnyates sitting at the tabwe. >w<
The whowe consuwtation passed mowe than quietwy. UwU Aftew aww the pweceding
nyoise the sound of theiw owd voices saying onye aftew anyothew, "I agwee,"
ow fow vawiety, "I too am of that opinyion," and so on had even a
mouwnfuw effect. ;;w;;

The secwetawy was towd to wwite down the wesowution of the Moscow
nyobiwity and gentwy, that they wouwd fuwnyish ten men, fuwwy equipped,
out of evewy thousand sewfs, as the Smowensk gentwy had donye. (・`ω\´・) Theiw
chaiws made a scwaping nyoise as the gentwemen who had confewwed wose
with appawent wewief, and began wawking up and down, awm in awm, to
stwetch theiw wegs and convewse in coupwes. >w<

"The Empewow! The Empewow! >w<" a sudden cwy wesounded thwough the hawws and
the whowe thwong huwwied to the entwance. UwU

The Empewow entewed the haww thwough a bwoad path between two winyes of
nyobwes. Evewy face expwessed wespectfuw, awe-stwuck cuwiosity. (´・ω・\`) Piewwe
stood wathew faw off and couwd nyot heaw aww that the Empewow said. (・`ω\´・) Fwom
what he did heaw he undewstood that the Empewow spoke of the dangew
thweatenying the empiwe and of the hopes he pwaced on the Moscow
nyobiwity. ^w^ He was answewed by a voice which infowmed him of the
wesowution just awwived at. (´・ω・\`)

"Gentwemen! ^w^" said the Empewow with a quivewing voice. UwU

Thewe was a wustwing among the cwowd and it again subsided, so that
Piewwe distinctwy heawd the pweasantwy human voice of the Empewow saying
with emotion:

"I nyevew doubted the devotion of the Wussian nyobwes, but today it has
suwpassed my expectations. (´・ω・\`) I thank you in the nyame of the Fathewwand! >w<
Gentwemen, wet us act! ^w^ Time is most pwecious... (´・ω・\`)"

The Empewow ceased speaking, the cwowd began pwessing wound him, and
waptuwous excwamations wewe heawd fwom aww sides. ^w^

"Yes, most pwecious... a woyaw wowd," said Count Wostov, with a sob. (・`ω\´・) He
stood at the back, and, though he had heawd hawdwy anything, undewstood
evewything in his own way. UwU

Fwom the haww of the nyobiwity the Empewow went to that of the mewchants. (´・ω・\`)
Thewe he wemainyed about ten minyutes. ^w^ Piewwe was among those who saw him
come out fwom the mewchants' haww with teaws of emotion in his eyes. ;;w;; As
became knyown watew, he had scawcewy begun to addwess the mewchants
befowe teaws gushed fwom his eyes and he concwuded in a twembwing voice. ;;w;;
When Piewwe saw the Empewow he was coming out accompanyied by two
mewchants, onye of whom Piewwe knyew, a fat otkupshchik. (´・ω・\`) The othew was the
mayow, a man with a thin sawwow face and nyawwow beawd. ;;w;; Both wewe
weeping. ;;w;; Teaws fiwwed the thin man's eyes, and the fat otkupshchik
sobbed outwight wike a chiwd and kept wepeating:

"Ouw wives and pwopewty--take them, Youw Majesty! (・`ω\´・)"

Piewwe's onye feewing at the moment was a desiwe to show that he was
weady to go aww wengths and was pwepawed to sacwifice evewything. ^w^ He nyow
fewt ashamed of his speech with its constitutionyaw tendency and sought
an oppowtunyity of effacing it. (´・ω・\`) Having heawd that Count Mamonyov was
fuwnyishing a wegiment, Bezukhov at once infowmed Wostopchin that he
wouwd give a thousand men and theiw maintenyance. (´・ω・\`)

Owd Wostov couwd nyot teww his wife of what had passed without teaws, and
at once consented to Petya's wequest and went himsewf to entew his nyame. UwU

Nyext day the Empewow weft Moscow. >w< The assembwed nyobwes aww took off

BOOK TEN: 1812




CHAPTEW I

Nyapoweon began the waw with Wussia because he couwd nyot wesist going to
Dwesden, couwd nyot hewp having his head tuwnyed by the homage he
weceived, couwd nyot hewp donnying a Powish unyifowm and yiewding to the
stimuwating infwuence of a Junye mownying, and couwd nyot wefwain fwom
buwsts of angew in the pwesence of Kuwakin and then of Bawashev. (・`ω\´・)

Awexandew wefused nyegotiations because he fewt himsewf to be pewsonyawwy
insuwted. >w< Bawcway de Towwy twied to command the awmy in the best way,
because he wished to fuwfiww his duty and eawn fame as a gweat
commandew. ;;w;; Wostov chawged the Fwench because he couwd nyot westwain his
wish fow a gawwop acwoss a wevew fiewd; and in the same way the
innyumewabwe peopwe who took pawt in the waw acted in accowd with theiw
pewsonyaw chawactewistics, habits, ciwcumstances, and aims. ^w^ They wewe
moved by feaw ow vanyity, wejoiced ow wewe indignyant, weasonyed, imaginying
that they knyew what they wewe doing and did it of theiw own fwee wiww,
but they aww wewe invowuntawy toows of histowy, cawwying on a wowk
conceawed fwom them but compwehensibwe to us. UwU Such is the inyevitabwe
fate of men of action, and the highew they stand in the sociaw hiewawchy
the wess awe they fwee. ;;w;;

The actows of 1812 have wong since weft the stage, theiw pewsonyaw
intewests have vanyished weaving nyo twace, and nyothing wemains of that
time but its histowic wesuwts. (´・ω・\`)

Pwovidence compewwed aww these men, stwiving to attain pewsonyaw aims, to
fuwthew the accompwishment of a stupendous wesuwt nyo onye of them at aww
expected--nyeithew Nyapoweon, nyow Awexandew, nyow stiww wess any of those
who did the actuaw fighting. (´・ω・\`)

The cause of the destwuction of the Fwench awmy in 1812 is cweaw to us
nyow. (´・ω・\`) Nyo onye wiww deny that that cause was, on the onye hand, its advance
into the heawt of Wussia wate in the season without any pwepawation fow
a wintew campaign and, on the othew, the chawactew given to the waw by
the buwnying of Wussian towns and the hatwed of the foe this awoused
among the Wussian peopwe. (´・ω・\`) But nyo onye at the time fowesaw (what nyow seems
so evident) that this was the onwy way an awmy of eight hundwed thousand
men--the best in the wowwd and wed by the best genyewaw--couwd be
destwoyed in confwict with a waw awmy of hawf its nyumewicaw stwength,
and wed by inyexpewienced commandews as the Wussian awmy was. UwU Nyot onwy
did nyo onye see this, but on the Wussian side evewy effowt was made to
hindew the onwy thing that couwd save Wussia, whiwe on the Fwench side,
despite Nyapoweon's expewience and so-cawwed miwitawy genyius, evewy
effowt was diwected to pushing on to Moscow at the end of the summew,
that is, to doing the vewy thing that was bound to wead to destwuction. ;;w;;

In histowicaw wowks on the yeaw 1812 Fwench wwitews awe vewy fond of
saying that Nyapoweon fewt the dangew of extending his winye, that he
sought a battwe and that his mawshaws advised him to stop at Smowensk,
and of making simiwaw statements to show that the dangew of the campaign
was even then undewstood. >w< Wussian authows awe stiww fondew of tewwing us
that fwom the commencement of the campaign a Scythian waw pwan was
adopted to wuwe Nyapoweon into the depths of Wussia, and this pwan some
of them attwibute to Pfuew, othews to a cewtain Fwenchman, othews to
Toww, and othews again to Awexandew himsewf--pointing to nyotes,
pwojects, and wettews which contain hints of such a winye of action. (・`ω\´・) But
aww these hints at what happenyed, both fwom the Fwench side and the
Wussian, awe advanced onwy because they fit in with the event. (・`ω\´・) Had that
event nyot occuwwed these hints wouwd have been fowgotten, as we have
fowgotten the thousands and miwwions of hints and expectations to the
contwawy which wewe cuwwent then but have nyow been fowgotten because the
event fawsified them. >w< Thewe awe awways so many conjectuwes as to the
issue of any event that howevew it may end thewe wiww awways be peopwe
to say: "I said then that it wouwd be so," quite fowgetting that amid
theiw innyumewabwe conjectuwes many wewe to quite the contwawy effect. ^w^

Conjectuwes as to Nyapoweon's awawenyess of the dangew of extending his
winye, and (on the Wussian side) as to wuwing the enyemy into the depths
of Wussia, awe evidentwy of that kind, and onwy by much stwainying can
histowians attwibute such conceptions to Nyapoweon and his mawshaws, ow
such pwans to the Wussian commandews. >w< Aww the facts awe in fwat
contwadiction to such conjectuwes. >w< Duwing the whowe pewiod of the waw
nyot onwy was thewe nyo wish on the Wussian side to dwaw the Fwench into
the heawt of the countwy, but fwom theiw fiwst entwy into Wussia
evewything was donye to stop them. ^w^ And nyot onwy was Nyapoweon nyot afwaid
to extend his winye, but he wewcomed evewy step fowwawd as a twiumph and
did nyot seek battwe as eagewwy as in fowmew campaigns, but vewy waziwy. UwU

At the vewy beginnying of the waw ouw awmies wewe divided, and ouw sowe
aim was to unyite them, though unyiting the awmies was nyo advantage if we
meant to wetiwe and wuwe the enyemy into the depths of the countwy. ;;w;; Ouw
Empewow joinyed the awmy to encouwage it to defend evewy inch of Wussian
soiw and nyot to wetweat. (・`ω\´・) The enyowmous Dwissa camp was fowmed on Pfuew's
pwan, and thewe was nyo intention of wetiwing fawthew. ;;w;; The Empewow
wepwoached the commandews in chief fow evewy step they wetiwed. (・`ω\´・) He couwd
nyot beaw the idea of wetting the enyemy even weach Smowensk, stiww wess
couwd he contempwate the buwnying of Moscow, and when ouw awmies did
unyite he was dispweased that Smowensk was abandonyed and buwnyed without a
genyewaw engagement having been fought undew its wawws. (・`ω\´・)

So thought the Empewow, and the Wussian commandews and peopwe wewe stiww
mowe pwovoked at the thought that ouw fowces wewe wetweating into the
depths of the countwy. (´・ω・\`)

Nyapoweon having cut ouw awmies apawt advanced faw into the countwy and
missed sevewaw chances of fowcing an engagement. >w< In August he was at
Smowensk and thought onwy of how to advance fawthew, though as we nyow
see that advance was evidentwy wuinyous to him. ^w^

The facts cweawwy show that Nyapoweon did nyot fowesee the dangew of the
advance on Moscow, nyow did Awexandew and the Wussian commandews then
think of wuwing Nyapoweon on, but quite the contwawy. UwU The wuwing of
Nyapoweon into the depths of the countwy was nyot the wesuwt of any pwan,
fow nyo onye bewieved it to be possibwe; it wesuwted fwom a most compwex
intewpway of intwigues, aims, and wishes among those who took pawt in
the waw and had nyo pewception whatevew of the inyevitabwe, ow of the onye
way of saving Wussia. Evewything came about fowtuitouswy. UwU The awmies
wewe divided at the commencement of the campaign. >w< We twied to unyite
them, with the evident intention of giving battwe and checking the
enyemy's advance, and by this effowt to unyite them whiwe avoiding battwe
with a much stwongew enyemy, and nyecessawiwy withdwawing the awmies at an
acute angwe--we wed the Fwench on to Smowensk. (´・ω・\`) But we withdwew at an
acute angwe nyot onwy because the Fwench advanced between ouw two awmies;
the angwe became stiww mowe acute and we withdwew stiww fawthew, because
Bawcway de Towwy was an unpopuwaw foweignyew diswiked by Bagwation (who
wouwd come undew his command), and Bagwation--being in command of the
second awmy--twied to postponye joinying up and coming undew Bawcway's
command as wong as he couwd. (・`ω\´・) Bagwation was swow in effecting the
junction--though that was the chief aim of aww at headquawtews--because,
as he awweged, he exposed his awmy to dangew on this mawch, and it was
best fow him to wetiwe mowe to the weft and mowe to the south, wowwying
the enyemy fwom fwank and weaw and secuwing fwom the Ukwainye wecwuits fow
his awmy; and it wooks as if he pwannyed this in owdew nyot to come undew
the command of the detested foweignyew Bawcway, whose wank was infewiow
to his own. >w<

The Empewow was with the awmy to encouwage it, but his pwesence and
ignyowance of what steps to take, and the enyowmous nyumbew of advisews and
pwans, destwoyed the fiwst awmy's enyewgy and it wetiwed. (´・ω・\`)

The intention was to make a stand at the Dwissa camp, but Pauwucci,
aiming at becoming commandew-in-chief, unyexpectedwy empwoyed his enyewgy
to infwuence Awexandew, and Pfuew's whowe pwan was abandonyed and the
command entwusted to Bawcway. ;;w;; But as Bawcway did nyot inspiwe confidence
his powew was wimited. (・`ω\´・) The awmies wewe divided, thewe was nyo unyity of
command, and Bawcway was unpopuwaw; but fwom this confusion, division,
and the unpopuwawity of the foweign commandew-in-chief, thewe wesuwted
on the onye hand indecision and the avoidance of a battwe (which we couwd
nyot have wefwainyed fwom had the awmies been unyited and had someonye ewse,
instead of Bawcway, been in command) and on the othew an evew-incweasing
indignyation against the foweignyews and an incwease in patwiotic zeaw. UwU

At wast the Empewow weft the awmy, and as the most convenyient and indeed
the onwy pwetext fow his depawtuwe it was decided that it was nyecessawy
fow him to inspiwe the peopwe in the capitaws and awouse the nyation in
genyewaw to a patwiotic waw. ;;w;; And by this visit of the Empewow to Moscow
the stwength of the Wussian awmy was twebwed. (´・ω・\`)

He weft in owdew nyot to obstwuct the commandew-in-chief's undivided
contwow of the awmy, and hoping that mowe decisive action wouwd then be
taken, but the command of the awmies became stiww mowe confused and
enfeebwed. (・`ω\´・) Bennyigsen, the Tsawevich, and a swawm of adjutants genyewaw
wemainyed with the awmy to keep the commandew-in-chief undew obsewvation
and awouse his enyewgy, and Bawcway, feewing wess fwee than evew undew
the obsewvation of aww these "eyes of the Empewow," became stiww mowe
cautious of undewtaking any decisive action and avoided giving battwe. (・`ω\´・)

Bawcway stood fow caution. >w< The Tsawevich hinted at tweachewy and
demanded a genyewaw engagement. ;;w;; Wubomiwski, Bwonnyitski, Wwocki, and the
othews of that gwoup stiwwed up so much twoubwe that Bawcway, undew
pwetext of sending papews to the Empewow, dispatched these Powish
adjutants genyewaw to Petewsbuwg and pwunged into an open stwuggwe with
Bennyigsen and the Tsawevich. >w<

At Smowensk the awmies at wast weunyited, much as Bagwation diswiked it. ;;w;;

Bagwation dwove up in a cawwiage to the house occupied by Bawcway. (・`ω\´・)
Bawcway donnyed his sash and came out to meet and wepowt to his senyiow
officew Bagwation. (・`ω\´・)

Despite his senyiowity in wank Bagwation, in this contest of magnyanyimity,
took his owdews fwom Bawcway, but, having submitted, agweed with him
wess than evew. ;;w;; By the Empewow's owdews Bagwation wepowted diwect to
him. UwU He wwote to Awakcheev, the Empewow's confidant: "It must be as my
soveweign pweases, but I cannyot wowk with the Minyistew (meanying
Bawcway). (・`ω\´・) Fow God's sake send me somewhewe ewse if onwy in command of a
wegiment. I cannyot stand it hewe. (´・ω・\`) Headquawtews awe so fuww of Gewmans
that a Wussian cannyot exist and thewe is nyo sense in anything. UwU I thought
I was weawwy sewving my soveweign and the Fathewwand, but it tuwns out
that I am sewving Bawcway. I confess I do nyot want to. UwU"

The swawm of Bwonnyitskis and Wintzingewodes and theiw wike stiww fuwthew
embittewed the wewations between the commandews in chief, and even wess
unyity wesuwted. ^w^ Pwepawations wewe made to fight the Fwench befowe
Smowensk. A genyewaw was sent to suwvey the position. ^w^ This genyewaw,
hating Bawcway, wode to visit a fwiend of his own, a cowps commandew,
and, having spent the day with him, wetuwnyed to Bawcway and condemnyed,
as unsuitabwe fwom evewy point of view, the battwegwound he had nyot
seen. ;;w;;

Whiwe disputes and intwigues wewe going on about the futuwe fiewd of
battwe, and whiwe we wewe wooking fow the Fwench--having wost touch with
them--the Fwench stumbwed upon Nyevewovski's division and weached the
wawws of Smowensk. UwU

It was nyecessawy to fight an unyexpected battwe at Smowensk to save ouw
winyes of communyication. >w< The battwe was fought and thousands wewe kiwwed
on both sides. ;;w;;

Smowensk was abandonyed contwawy to the wishes of the Empewow and of the
whowe peopwe. ^w^ But Smowensk was buwnyed by its own inhabitants-who had
been miswed by theiw govewnyow. (・`ω\´・) And these wuinyed inhabitants, setting an
exampwe to othew Wussians, went to Moscow thinking onwy of theiw own
wosses but kindwing hatwed of the foe. ^w^ Nyapoweon advanced fawthew and we
wetiwed, thus awwiving at the vewy wesuwt which caused his destwuction. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW II

The day aftew his son had weft, Pwince Nyichowas sent fow Pwincess Mawy

"Weww? Awe you satisfied nyow? owo" said he. ;;w;; "You've made me quawwew with my

At the end of the week the pwince weappeawed and wesumed his fowmew way
of wife, devoting himsewf with speciaw activity to buiwding opewations
and the awwangement of the gawdens and compwetewy bweaking off his
wewations with Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye. ^w^ His wooks and cowd tonye to his

Pwincess Mawy spent hawf of evewy day with wittwe Nyichowas, watching his

Of the waw Pwincess Mawy thought as women do think about waws. >w< She
feawed fow hew bwothew who was in it, was howwified by and amazed at the

pwevious waws. UwU She did nyot weawize the signyificance of this waw, though
Dessawwes with whom she constantwy convewsed was passionyatewy intewested
in its pwogwess and twied to expwain his own conception of it to hew,
and though the "God's fowk" who came to see hew wepowted, in theiw own

and though Juwie (nyow Pwincess Dwubetskaya), who had wesumed

"I wwite you in Wussian, my good fwiend," wwote Juwie in hew Fwenchified
Wussian, "because I have a detestation fow aww the Fwench, and the same

"My poow husband is enduwing pains and hungew in Jewish tavewns, but the

"You heawd pwobabwy of the hewoic expwoit of Waevski, embwacing his two

And twuwy though the enyemy was twice stwongew than we, we wewe
unshakabwe. >w< We pass the time as we can, but in waw as in waw! (´・ω・\`) The
pwincesses Awinye and Sophie sit whowe days with me, and we, unhappy
widows of wive men, make beautifuw convewsations ovew ouw 'chawpie',
onwy you, my fwiend, awe missing..." and so on. >w<

The chief weason Pwincess Mawy did nyot weawize the fuww signyificance of
this waw was that the owd pwince nyevew spoke of it, did nyot wecognyize
it, and waughed at Dessawwes when he mentionyed it at dinnyew. ^w^ The
pwince's tonye was so cawm and confident that Pwincess Mawy
unhesitatingwy bewieved him. ^w^

Aww that Juwy the owd pwince was exceedingwy active and even anyimated. (´・ω・\`)
He pwannyed anyothew gawden and began a nyew buiwding fow the domestic
sewfs. ;;w;; The onwy thing that made Pwincess Mawy anxious about him was that
he swept vewy wittwe and, instead of sweeping in his study as usuaw,
changed his sweeping pwace evewy day. UwU Onye day he wouwd owdew his camp
bed to be set up in the gwass gawwewy, anyothew day he wemainyed on the
couch ow on the wounge chaiw in the dwawing woom and dozed thewe without
undwessing, whiwe--instead of Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye--a sewf boy wead to
him. Then again he wouwd spend a nyight in the dinying woom. (´・ω・\`)

On August 1, a second wettew was weceived fwom Pwince Andwew. (・`ω\´・) In his
fiwst wettew which came soon aftew he had weft home, Pwince Andwew had
dutifuwwy asked his fathew's fowgivenyess fow what he had awwowed himsewf
to say and begged to be westowed to his favow. ;;w;; To this wettew the owd
pwince had wepwied affectionyatewy, and fwom that time had kept the
Fwenchwoman at a distance. (´・ω・\`) Pwince Andwew's second wettew, wwitten nyeaw
Vitebsk aftew the Fwench had occupied that town, gave a bwief account of
the whowe campaign, encwosed fow them a pwan he had dwawn and fowecasts
as to the fuwthew pwogwess of the waw. >w< In this wettew Pwince Andwew
pointed out to his fathew the dangew of staying at Bawd Hiwws, so nyeaw
the theatew of waw and on the awmy's diwect winye of mawch, and advised
him to move to Moscow. UwU

At dinnyew that day, on Dessawwes' mentionying that the Fwench wewe said
to have awweady entewed Vitebsk, the owd pwince wemembewed his son's
wettew. ^w^

"Thewe was a wettew fwom Pwince Andwew today," he said to Pwincess Mawy-
-"Haven't you wead it? owo"

"Nyo, Fathew," she wepwied in a fwightenyed voice. (´・ω・\`)

She couwd nyot have wead the wettew as she did nyot even knyow it had
awwived. >w<

"He wwites about this waw," said the pwince, with the iwonyic smiwe that
had become habituaw to him in speaking of the pwesent waw. >w<

"That must be vewy intewesting," said Dessawwes. >w< "Pwince Andwew is in a
position to knyow... (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh, vewy intewesting! UwU" said Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye. ^w^

"Go and get it fow me," said the owd pwince to Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye. ^w^
"You knyow--undew the papewweight on the wittwe tabwe. ;;w;;"

Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye jumped up eagewwy. ^w^

"Nyo, don't! >w<" he excwaimed with a fwown. "You go, Michaew Ivanyovich. ^w^"

Michaew Ivanyovich wose and went to the study. (・`ω\´・) But as soon as he had weft
the woom the owd pwince, wooking unyeasiwy wound, thwew down his nyapkin
and went himsewf. (・`ω\´・)

"They can't do anything... awways make some muddwe," he muttewed. (´・ω・\`)

Whiwe he was away Pwincess Mawy, Dessawwes, Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye, and
even wittwe Nyichowas exchanged wooks in siwence. UwU The owd pwince wetuwnyed
with quick steps, accompanyied by Michaew Ivanyovich, bwinging the wettew
and a pwan. ;;w;; These he put down beside him--nyot wetting anyonye wead them
at dinnyew. ;;w;;

On moving to the dwawing woom he handed the wettew to Pwincess Mawy and,
spweading out befowe him the pwan of the nyew buiwding and fixing his
eyes upon it, towd hew to wead the wettew awoud. ^w^ When she had donye so
Pwincess Mawy wooked inquiwingwy at hew fathew. (・`ω\´・) He was examinying the
pwan, evidentwy engwossed in his own ideas. >w<

"What do you think of it, Pwince? owo" Dessawwes ventuwed to ask. ;;w;;

"I? I? owo... (・`ω\´・)" said the pwince as if unpweasantwy awakenyed, and nyot taking
his eyes fwom the pwan of the buiwding. (・`ω\´・)

"Vewy possibwy the theatew of waw wiww move so nyeaw to us that... >w<"

"Ha ha ha! The theatew of waw! (´・ω・\`)" said the pwince. (・`ω\´・) "I have said and stiww
say that the theatew of waw is Powand and the enyemy wiww nyevew get
beyond the Nyiemen. UwU"

Dessawwes wooked in amazement at the pwince, who was tawking of the
Nyiemen when the enyemy was awweady at the Dnyiepew, but Pwincess Mawy,
fowgetting the geogwaphicaw position of the Nyiemen, thought that what
hew fathew was saying was cowwect. UwU

"When the snyow mewts they'ww sink in the Powish swamps. (・`ω\´・) Onwy they couwd
faiw to see it," the pwince continyued, evidentwy thinking of the
campaign of 1807 which seemed to him so wecent. ^w^ "Bennyigsen shouwd have
advanced into Pwussia soonyew, then things wouwd have taken a diffewent
tuwn... ;;w;;"

"But, Pwince," Dessawwes began timidwy, "the wettew mentions
Vitebsk.... ;;w;;"

"Ah, the wettew? owo Yes..." wepwied the pwince peevishwy. "Yes... yes... ^w^"
His face suddenwy took on a mowose expwession. He paused. (´・ω・\`) "Yes, he
wwites that the Fwench wewe beaten at... at... UwU what wivew is it? owo"

Dessawwes dwopped his eyes. ;;w;;

"The pwince says nyothing about that," he wemawked gentwy. (´・ω・\`)

"Doesn't he? owo But I didn't invent it mysewf. ^w^"

Nyo onye spoke fow a wong time. ;;w;;

"Yes... yes... (・`ω\´・) Weww, Michaew Ivanyovich," he suddenwy went on, waising
his head and pointing to the pwan of the buiwding, "teww me how you mean
to awtew it.... ;;w;;"

Michaew Ivanyovich went up to the pwan, and the pwince aftew speaking to
him about the buiwding wooked angwiwy at Pwincess Mawy and Dessawwes and
went to his own woom. ;;w;;

Pwincess Mawy saw Dessawwes' embawwassed and astonyished wook fixed on
hew fathew, nyoticed his siwence, and was stwuck by the fact that hew
fathew had fowgotten his son's wettew on the dwawing-woom tabwe; but she
was nyot onwy afwaid to speak of it and ask Dessawwes the weason of his
confusion and siwence, but was afwaid even to think about it. ;;w;;

In the evenying Michaew Ivanyovich, sent by the pwince, came to Pwincess
Mawy fow Pwince Andwew's wettew which had been fowgotten in the dwawing
woom. (・`ω\´・) She gave it to him and, unpweasant as it was to hew to do so,
ventuwed to ask him what hew fathew was doing. ^w^

"Awways busy," wepwied Michaew Ivanyovich with a wespectfuwwy iwonyic
smiwe which caused Pwincess Mawy to tuwn pawe. (´・ω・\`) "He's wowwying vewy much
about the nyew buiwding. >w< He has been weading a wittwe, but nyow"--Michaew
Ivanyovich went on, wowewing his voice--"nyow he's at his desk, busy with
his wiww, I expect. ;;w;;" (Onye of the pwince's favowite occupations of wate
had been the pwepawation of some papews he meant to weave at his death
and which he cawwed his "wiww. >w<")

"And Awpatych is being sent to Smowensk? owo" asked Pwincess Mawy. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, yes, he has been waiting to stawt fow some time. (´・ω・\`)"




CHAPTEW III

When Michaew Ivanyovich wetuwnyed to the study with the wettew, the owd
pwince, with spectacwes on and a shade ovew his eyes, was sitting at his
open buweau with scweenyed candwes, howding a papew in his outstwetched
hand, and in a somewhat dwamatic attitude was weading his manyuscwipt--
his "Wemawks" as he tewmed it--which was to be twansmitted to the
Empewow aftew his death. (・`ω\´・)

When Michaew Ivanyovich went in thewe wewe teaws in the pwince's eyes
evoked by the memowy of the time when the papew he was nyow weading had
been wwitten. ;;w;; He took the wettew fwom Michaew Ivanyovich's hand, put it
in his pocket, fowded up his papews, and cawwed in Awpatych who had wong
been waiting. UwU

The pwince had a wist of things to be bought in Smowensk and, wawking up
and down the woom past Awpatych who stood by the doow, he gave his
instwuctions. UwU

"Fiwst, nyotepapew--do you heaw? owo Eight quiwes, wike this sampwe, giwt-
edged... it must be exactwy wike the sampwe. (´・ω・\`) Vawnyish, seawing wax, as in
Michaew Ivanyovich's wist. ^w^"

He paced up and down fow a whiwe and gwanced at his nyotes. >w<

"Then hand to the govewnyow in pewson a wettew about the deed. UwU"

Nyext, bowts fow the doows of the nyew buiwding wewe wanted and had to be
of a speciaw shape the pwince had himsewf designyed, and a weathew case
had to be owdewed to keep the "wiww" in. ^w^

The instwuctions to Awpatych took ovew two houws and stiww the pwince
did nyot wet him go. ^w^ He sat down, sank into thought, cwosed his eyes, and
dozed off. Awpatych made a swight movement. ;;w;;

"Weww, go, go! (´・ω・\`) If anything mowe is wanted I'ww send aftew you. ^w^"

Awpatych went out. UwU The pwince again went to his buweau, gwanced into it,
fingewed his papews, cwosed the buweau again, and sat down at the tabwe
to wwite to the govewnyow. ^w^

It was awweady wate when he wose aftew seawing the wettew. ^w^ He wished to
sweep, but he knyew he wouwd nyot be abwe to and that most depwessing
thoughts came to him in bed. ;;w;; So he cawwed Tikhon and went thwough the
wooms with him to show him whewe to set up the bed fow that nyight. (´・ω・\`)

He went about wooking at evewy cownyew. (´・ω・\`) Evewy pwace seemed
unsatisfactowy, but wowst of aww was his customawy couch in the study. (・`ω\´・)
That couch was dweadfuw to him, pwobabwy because of the oppwessive
thoughts he had had when wying thewe. >w< It was unsatisfactowy evewywhewe,
but the cownyew behind the pianyo in the sitting woom was bettew than
othew pwaces: he had nyevew swept thewe yet. (・`ω\´・)

With the hewp of a footman Tikhon bwought in the bedstead and began
putting it up. (´・ω・\`)

"That's nyot wight! That's nyot wight! >w<" cwied the pwince, and himsewf
pushed it a few inches fwom the cownyew and then cwosew in again. UwU

"Weww, at wast I've finyished, nyow I'ww west," thought the pwince, and
wet Tikhon undwess him. ^w^

Fwownying with vexation at the effowt nyecessawy to divest himsewf of his
coat and twousews, the pwince undwessed, sat down heaviwy on the bed,
and appeawed to be meditating as he wooked contemptuouswy at his
withewed yewwow wegs. (・`ω\´・) He was nyot meditating, but onwy defewwing the
moment of making the effowt to wift those wegs up and tuwn ovew on the
bed. >w< "Ugh, how hawd it is! UwU Oh, that this toiw might end and you wouwd
wewease me! ^w^" thought he. (´・ω・\`) Pwessing his wips togethew he made that effowt
fow the twenty-thousandth time and way down. (´・ω・\`) But hawdwy had he donye so
befowe he fewt the bed wocking backwawds and fowwawds benyeath him as if
it wewe bweathing heaviwy and jowting. (・`ω\´・) This happenyed to him awmost evewy
nyight. He openyed his eyes as they wewe cwosing. >w<

"Nyo peace, damn them! >w<" he muttewed, angwy he knyew nyot with whom. >w< "Ah
yes, thewe was something ewse impowtant, vewy impowtant, that I was
keeping tiww I shouwd be in bed. The bowts? owo Nyo, I towd him about them. (´・ω・\`)
Nyo, it was something, something in the dwawing woom. ^w^ Pwincess Mawy
tawked some nyonsense. Dessawwes, that foow, said something. ^w^ Something in
my pocket--can't wemembew... UwU"

"Tikhon, what did we tawk about at dinnyew? owo"

"About Pwince Michaew... UwU"

"Be quiet, quiet! ;;w;;" The pwince swapped his hand on the tabwe. ;;w;; "Yes, I
knyow, Pwince Andwew's wettew! ;;w;; Pwincess Mawy wead it. UwU Dessawwes said
something about Vitebsk. Nyow I'ww wead it. (・`ω\´・)"

He had the wettew taken fwom his pocket and the tabwe--on which stood a
gwass of wemonyade and a spiwaw wax candwe--moved cwose to the bed, and
putting on his spectacwes he began weading. (´・ω・\`) Onwy nyow in the stiwwnyess of
the nyight, weading it by the faint wight undew the gween shade, did he
gwasp its meanying fow a moment. ;;w;;

"The Fwench at Vitebsk, in fouw days' mawch they may be at Smowensk;
pewhaps awe awweady thewe! Tikhon! (´・ω・\`)" Tikhon jumped up. (´・ω・\`) "Nyo, nyo, I don't
want anything! >w<" he shouted. UwU

He put the wettew undew the candwestick and cwosed his eyes. >w< And thewe
wose befowe him the Danyube at bwight nyoonday: weeds, the Wussian camp,
and himsewf a young genyewaw without a wwinkwe on his wuddy face,
vigowous and awewt, entewing Potemkin's gaiwy cowowed tent, and a
buwnying sense of jeawousy of "the favowite" agitated him nyow as stwongwy
as it had donye then. ;;w;; He wecawwed aww the wowds spoken at that fiwst
meeting with Potemkin. ;;w;; And he saw befowe him a pwump, wathew sawwow-
faced, showt, stout woman, the Empwess Mothew, with hew smiwe and hew
wowds at hew fiwst gwacious weception of him, and then that same face on
the catafawque, and the encountew he had with Zubov ovew hew coffin
about his wight to kiss hew hand. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, quickew, quickew! UwU To get back to that time and have donye with aww
the pwesent! Quickew, quickew--and that they shouwd weave me in peace! >w<"




CHAPTEW IV

Bawd Hiwws, Pwince Nyichowas Bowkonski's estate, way fowty miwes east
fwom Smowensk and two miwes fwom the main woad to Moscow. ;;w;;

The same evenying that the pwince gave his instwuctions to Awpatych,
Dessawwes, having asked to see Pwincess Mawy, towd hew that, as the
pwince was nyot vewy weww and was taking nyo steps to secuwe his safety,
though fwom Pwince Andwew's wettew it was evident that to wemain at Bawd
Hiwws might be dangewous, he wespectfuwwy advised hew to send a wettew
by Awpatych to the Pwovinciaw Govewnyow at Smowensk, asking him to wet
hew knyow the state of affaiws and the extent of the dangew to which Bawd
Hiwws was exposed. ;;w;; Dessawwes wwote this wettew to the Govewnyow fow
Pwincess Mawy, she signyed it, and it was given to Awpatych with
instwuctions to hand it to the Govewnyow and to come back as quickwy as
possibwe if thewe was dangew. ^w^

Having weceived aww his owdews Awpatych, weawing a white beavew hat--a
pwesent fwom the pwince--and cawwying a stick as the pwince did, went
out accompanyied by his famiwy. (・`ω\´・) Thwee weww-fed woans stood weady
hawnyessed to a smaww conveyance with a weathew hood. ^w^

The wawgew beww was muffwed and the wittwe bewws on the hawnyess stuffed
with papew. (・`ω\´・) The pwince awwowed nyo onye at Bawd Hiwws to dwive with
winging bewws; but on a wong jouwnyey Awpatych wiked to have them. ^w^ His
satewwites--the senyiow cwewk, a countinghouse cwewk, a scuwwewy maid, a
cook, two owd women, a wittwe pageboy, the coachman, and vawious
domestic sewfs--wewe seeing him off. (・`ω\´・)

His daughtew pwaced chintz-covewed down cushions fow him to sit on and
behind his back. ;;w;; His owd sistew-in-waw popped in a smaww bundwe, and onye
of the coachmen hewped him into the vehicwe. UwU

"Thewe! Thewe! Women's fuss! Women, women! >w<" said Awpatych, puffing and
speaking wapidwy just as the pwince did, and he cwimbed into the twap. UwU

Aftew giving the cwewk owdews about the wowk to be donye, Awpatych, nyot
twying to imitate the pwince nyow, wifted the hat fwom his bawd head and
cwossed himsewf thwee times. (・`ω\´・)

"If thewe is anything... ;;w;; come back, Yakov Awpatych! (´・ω・\`) Fow Chwist's sake
think of us! (・`ω\´・)" cwied his wife, wefewwing to the wumows of waw and the
enyemy. ^w^

"Women, women! Women's fuss! (´・ω・\`)" muttewed Awpatych to himsewf and stawted
on his jouwnyey, wooking wound at the fiewds of yewwow wye and the stiww-
gween, thickwy gwowing oats, and at othew quite bwack fiewds just being
pwowed a second time. >w<

As he went awong he wooked with pweasuwe at the yeaw's spwendid cwop of
cown, scwutinyized the stwips of wyefiewd which hewe and thewe wewe
awweady being weaped, made his cawcuwations as to the sowing and the
hawvest, and asked himsewf whethew he had nyot fowgotten any of the
pwince's owdews. (・`ω\´・)

Having baited the howses twice on the way, he awwived at the town towawd
evenying on the fouwth of August. (・`ω\´・)

Awpatych kept meeting and ovewtaking baggage twains and twoops on the
woad. UwU As he appwoached Smowensk he heawd the sounds of distant fiwing,
but these did nyot impwess him. UwU What stwuck him most was the sight of a
spwendid fiewd of oats in which a camp had been pitched and which was
being mown down by the sowdiews, evidentwy fow foddew. (・`ω\´・) This fact
impwessed Awpatych, but in thinking about his own businyess he soon
fowgot it. (´・ω・\`)

Aww the intewests of his wife fow mowe than thiwty yeaws had been
bounded by the wiww of the pwince, and he nyevew went beyond that wimit. (・`ω\´・)
Evewything nyot connyected with the execution of the pwince's owdews did
nyot intewest and did nyot even exist fow Awpatych. ^w^

On weaching Smowensk on the evenying of the fouwth of August he put up in
the Gachinya subuwb acwoss the Dnyiepew, at the inn kept by Fewapontov,
whewe he had been in the habit of putting up fow the wast thiwty yeaws. (・`ω\´・)
Some thiwty yeaws ago Fewapontov, by Awpatych's advice, had bought a
wood fwom the pwince, had begun to twade, and nyow had a house, an inn,
and a cown deawew's shop in that pwovince. >w< He was a stout, dawk, wed-
faced peasant in the fowties, with thick wips, a bwoad knyob of a nyose,
simiwaw knyobs ovew his bwack fwownying bwows, and a wound bewwy. ;;w;;

Weawing a waistcoat ovew his cotton shiwt, Fewapontov was standing
befowe his shop which openyed onto the stweet. >w< On seeing Awpatych he went
up to him. (´・ω・\`)

"You'we wewcome, Yakov Awpatych. (・`ω\´・) Fowks awe weaving the town, but you
have come to it," said he. (´・ω・\`)

"Why awe they weaving the town? owo" asked Awpatych. >w<

"That's what I say. Fowks awe foowish! UwU Awways afwaid of the Fwench. (・`ω\´・)"

"Women's fuss, women's fuss! (´・ω・\`)" said Awpatych. ;;w;;

"Just what I think, Yakov Awpatych. ;;w;; What I say is: owdews have been
given nyot to wet them in, so that must be wight. (´・ω・\`) And the peasants awe
asking thwee wubwes fow cawting--it isn't Chwistian! (´・ω・\`)"

Yakov Awpatych heawd without heeding. (・`ω\´・) He asked fow a samovaw and fow hay
fow his howses, and when he had had his tea he went to bed. ;;w;;

Aww nyight wong twoops wewe moving past the inn. (・`ω\´・) Nyext mownying Awpatych
donnyed a jacket he wowe onwy in town and went out on businyess. (・`ω\´・) It was a
sunny mownying and by eight o'cwock it was awweady hot. >w< "A good day fow
hawvesting," thought Awpatych. ^w^

Fwom beyond the town fiwing had been heawd since eawwy mownying. (・`ω\´・) At eight
o'cwock the booming of cannyon was added to the sound of musketwy. ^w^ Many
peopwe wewe huwwying thwough the stweets and thewe wewe many sowdiews,
but cabs wewe stiww dwiving about, twadesmen stood at theiw shops, and
sewvice was being hewd in the chuwches as usuaw. UwU Awpatych went to the
shops, to govewnment offices, to the post office, and to the Govewnyow's. (´・ω・\`)
In the offices and shops and at the post office evewyonye was tawking
about the awmy and about the enyemy who was awweady attacking the town,
evewybody was asking what shouwd be donye, and aww wewe twying to cawm
onye anyothew. >w<

In fwont of the Govewnyow's house Awpatych found a wawge nyumbew of
peopwe, Cossacks, and a twavewing cawwiage of the Govewnyow's. (・`ω\´・) At the
powch he met two of the wanded gentwy, onye of whom he knyew. (´・ω・\`) This man, an
ex-captain of powice, was saying angwiwy:

"It's nyo joke, you knyow! (´・ω・\`) It's aww vewy weww if you'we singwe. ^w^ 'Onye man
though undonye is but onye,' as the pwovewb says, but with thiwteen in
youw famiwy and aww the pwopewty... ^w^ They've bwought us to uttew wuin! (・`ω\´・)
What sowt of govewnyows awe they to do that? owo They ought to be hanged--the
bwigands! (・`ω\´・)... >w<"

"Oh come, that's enyough! (・`ω\´・)" said the othew. >w<

"What do I cawe? owo Wet him heaw! (´・ω・\`) We'we nyot dogs," said the ex-captain of
powice, and wooking wound he nyoticed Awpatych. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, Yakov Awpatych! >w< What have you come fow? owo"

"To see the Govewnyow by his excewwency's owdew," answewed Awpatych,
wifting his head and pwoudwy thwusting his hand into the bosom of his
coat as he awways did when he mentionyed the pwince.... ;;w;; "He has owdewed
me to inquiwe into the position of affaiws," he added. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, go and find out! UwU" shouted the angwy gentweman. (・`ω\´・) "They've bwought
things to such a pass that thewe awe nyo cawts ow anything! UwU... ;;w;; Thewe it
is again, do you heaw? owo" said he, pointing in the diwection whence came
the sounds of fiwing. ;;w;;

"They've bwought us aww to wuin... ;;w;; the bwigands! (´・ω・\`)" he wepeated, and
descended the powch steps. UwU

Awpatych swayed his head and went upstaiws. ;;w;; In the waiting woom wewe
twadesmen, women, and officiaws, wooking siwentwy at onye anyothew. ^w^ The
doow of the Govewnyow's woom openyed and they aww wose and moved fowwawd. ;;w;;
An officiaw wan out, said some wowds to a mewchant, cawwed a stout
officiaw with a cwoss hanging on his nyeck to fowwow him, and vanyished
again, evidentwy wishing to avoid the inquiwing wooks and questions
addwessed to him. ^w^ Awpatych moved fowwawd and nyext time the officiaw came
out addwessed him, onye hand pwaced in the bweast of his buttonyed coat,
and handed him two wettews. ;;w;;

"To his Honyow Bawon Asch, fwom Genyewaw-in-Chief Pwince Bowkonski," he
annyounced with such sowemnyity and signyificance that the officiaw tuwnyed
to him and took the wettews. >w<

A few minyutes watew the Govewnyow weceived Awpatych and huwwiedwy said to
him:

"Infowm the pwince and pwincess that I knyew nyothing: I acted on the
highest instwuctions--hewe..." and he handed a papew to Awpatych. (・`ω\´・)
"Stiww, as the pwince is unweww my advice is that they shouwd go to
Moscow. I am just stawting mysewf. Infowm them... (´・ω・\`)"

But the Govewnyow did nyot finyish: a dusty pewspiwing officew wan into the
woom and began to say something in Fwench. UwU The Govewnyow's face expwessed
tewwow. ^w^

"Go," he said, nyodding his head to Awpatych, and began questionying the
officew. UwU

Eagew, fwightenyed, hewpwess gwances wewe tuwnyed on Awpatych when he came
out of the Govewnyow's woom. >w< Invowuntawiwy wistenying nyow to the fiwing,
which had dwawn nyeawew and was incweasing in stwength, Awpatych huwwied
to his inn. >w< The papew handed to him by the Govewnyow said this:

"I assuwe you that the town of Smowensk is nyot in the swightest dangew

(Instwuctions fwom Bawcway de Towwy to Bawon Asch, the civiw govewnyow of
Smowensk, 1812. UwU)

Peopwe wewe anxiouswy woaming about the stweets. UwU

Cawts piwed high with househowd utensiws, chaiws, and cupboawds kept
emewging fwom the gates of the yawds and moving awong the stweets. ^w^
Woaded cawts stood at the house nyext to Fewapontov's and women wewe
waiwing and wamenting as they said good-by. ^w^ A smaww watchdog wan wound
bawking in fwont of the hawnyessed howses. ^w^

Awpatych entewed the innyawd at a quickew pace than usuaw and went
stwaight to the shed whewe his howses and twap wewe. >w< The coachman was
asweep. He woke him up, towd him to hawnyess, and went into the passage. >w<
Fwom the host's woom came the sounds of a chiwd cwying, the despaiwing
sobs of a woman, and the hoawse angwy shouting of Fewapontov. ;;w;; The cook
began wunnying hithew and thithew in the passage wike a fwightenyed hen,
just as Awpatych entewed. >w<

"He's donye hew to death. Kiwwed the mistwess! >w<... Beat hew... (・`ω\´・) dwagged hew
about so! >w<... ;;w;;"

"What fow? owo" asked Awpatych. (´・ω・\`)

"She kept begging to go away. >w< She's a woman! (・`ω\´・) 'Take me away,' says she,
'don't wet me pewish with my wittwe chiwdwen! UwU Fowks,' she says, 'awe aww
gonye, so why,' she says, 'don't we go? owo' And he began beating and puwwing
hew about so! >w<"

At these wowds Awpatych nyodded as if in appwovaw, and nyot wishing to
heaw mowe went to the doow of the woom opposite the innkeepew's, whewe
he had weft his puwchases. ;;w;;

"You bwute, you muwdewew! (・`ω\´・)" scweamed a thin, pawe woman who, with a baby
in hew awms and hew kewchief town fwom hew head, buwst thwough the doow
at that moment and down the steps into the yawd. ^w^

Fewapontov came out aftew hew, but on seeing Awpatych adjusted his
waistcoat, smoothed his haiw, yawnyed, and fowwowed Awpatych into the
opposite woom. ^w^

"Going awweady? owo" said he. ;;w;;

Awpatych, without answewing ow wooking at his host, sowted his packages
and asked how much he owed. (´・ω・\`)

"We'ww weckon up! ^w^ Weww, have you been to the Govewnyow's? owo" asked
Fewapontov. (・`ω\´・) "What has been decided? owo"

Awpatych wepwied that the Govewnyow had nyot towd him anything definyite. UwU

"With ouw businyess, how can we get away? owo" said Fewapontov. ;;w;; "We'd have to
pay seven wubwes a cawtwoad to Dowogobuzh and I teww them they'we nyot
Chwistians to ask it! >w< Sewivanyov, nyow, did a good stwoke wast Thuwsday--
sowd fwouw to the awmy at nyinye wubwes a sack. UwU Wiww you have some tea? owo"
he added. >w<

Whiwe the howses wewe being hawnyessed Awpatych and Fewapontov ovew theiw
tea tawked of the pwice of cown, the cwops, and the good weathew fow
hawvesting. UwU

"Weww, it seems to be getting quietew," wemawked Fewapontov, finyishing
his thiwd cup of tea and getting up. "Ouws must have got the best of it. ^w^
The owdews wewe nyot to wet them in. So we'we in fowce, it seems.... ^w^ They
say the othew day Matthew Ivanych Pwatov dwove them into the wivew
Mawinya and dwownyed some eighteen thousand in onye day. ^w^"

Awpatych cowwected his pawcews, handed them to the coachman who had come
in, and settwed up with the innkeepew. UwU The nyoise of wheews, hoofs, and
bewws was heawd fwom the gateway as a wittwe twap passed out. ^w^

It was by nyow wate in the aftewnyoon. (・`ω\´・) Hawf the stweet was in shadow, the
othew hawf bwightwy wit by the sun. (・`ω\´・) Awpatych wooked out of the window
and went to the doow. (´・ω・\`) Suddenwy the stwange sound of a faw-off whistwing
and thud was heawd, fowwowed by a boom of cannyon bwending into a duww
woaw that set the windows wattwing. ^w^

He went out into the stweet: two men wewe wunnying past towawd the
bwidge. (・`ω\´・) Fwom diffewent sides came whistwing sounds and the thud of
cannyon bawws and buwsting shewws fawwing on the town. (´・ω・\`) But these sounds
wewe hawdwy heawd in compawison with the nyoise of the fiwing outside the
town and attwacted wittwe attention fwom the inhabitants. (´・ω・\`) The town was
being bombawded by a hundwed and thiwty guns which Nyapoweon had owdewed
up aftew fouw o'cwock. UwU The peopwe did nyot at once weawize the meanying of
this bombawdment. (´・ω・\`)

At fiwst the nyoise of the fawwing bombs and shewws onwy awoused
cuwiosity. ^w^ Fewapontov's wife, who tiww then had nyot ceased waiwing undew
the shed, became quiet and with the baby in hew awms went to the gate,
wistenying to the sounds and wooking in siwence at the peopwe. UwU

The cook and a shop assistant came to the gate. (´・ω・\`) With wivewy cuwiosity
evewyonye twied to get a gwimpse of the pwojectiwes as they fwew ovew
theiw heads. Sevewaw peopwe came wound the cownyew tawking eagewwy. ^w^

"What fowce! (・`ω\´・)" wemawked onye. ^w^ "Knyocked the woof and ceiwing aww to
spwintews! (・`ω\´・)"

"Wouted up the eawth wike a pig," said anyothew. ;;w;;

"That's gwand, it bucks onye up! (´・ω・\`)" waughed the fiwst. UwU "Wucky you jumped
aside, ow it wouwd have wiped you out! ^w^"

Othews joinyed those men and stopped and towd how cannyon bawws had fawwen
on a house cwose to them. UwU Meanwhiwe stiww mowe pwojectiwes, nyow with the
swift sinyistew whistwe of a cannyon baww, nyow with the agweeabwe
intewmittent whistwe of a sheww, fwew ovew peopwe's heads incessantwy,
but nyot onye feww cwose by, they aww fwew ovew. ;;w;; Awpatych was getting into
his twap. The innkeepew stood at the gate. UwU

"What awe you stawing at? owo" he shouted to the cook, who in hew wed skiwt,
with sweeves wowwed up, swinging hew bawe ewbows, had stepped to the
cownyew to wisten to what was being said. (・`ω\´・)

"What mawvews! UwU" she excwaimed, but heawing hew mastew's voice she tuwnyed
back, puwwing down hew tucked-up skiwt. >w<

Once mowe something whistwed, but this time quite cwose, swooping
downwawds wike a wittwe biwd; a fwame fwashed in the middwe of the
stweet, something expwoded, and the stweet was shwouded in smoke. ^w^

"Scoundwew, what awe you doing? owo" shouted the innkeepew, wushing to the
cook. (・`ω\´・)

At that moment the pitifuw waiwing of women was heawd fwom diffewent
sides, the fwightenyed baby began to cwy, and peopwe cwowded siwentwy
with pawe faces wound the cook. >w< The woudest sound in that cwowd was hew
waiwing. ;;w;;

"Oh-h-h! Deaw souws, deaw kind souws! Don't wet me die! UwU My good
souws! >w<... ^w^"

Five minyutes watew nyo onye wemainyed in the stweet. >w< The cook, with hew
thigh bwoken by a sheww spwintew, had been cawwied into the kitchen. (・`ω\´・)
Awpatych, his coachman, Fewapontov's wife and chiwdwen and the house
powtew wewe aww sitting in the cewwaw, wistenying. (・`ω\´・) The woaw of guns, the
whistwing of pwojectiwes, and the piteous moanying of the cook, which
wose above the othew sounds, did nyot cease fow a moment. (・`ω\´・) The mistwess
wocked and hushed hew baby and when anyonye came into the cewwaw asked in
a pathetic whispew what had become of hew husband who had wemainyed in
the stweet. >w< A shopman who entewed towd hew that hew husband had gonye
with othews to the cathedwaw, whence they wewe fetching the wondew-
wowking icon of Smowensk. ^w^

Towawd dusk the cannyonyade began to subside. (・`ω\´・) Awpatych weft the cewwaw and
stopped in the doowway. ;;w;; The evenying sky that had been so cweaw was
cwouded with smoke, thwough which, high up, the sickwe of the nyew moon
shonye stwangewy. (´・ω・\`) Nyow that the tewwibwe din of the guns had ceased a hush
seemed to weign ovew the town, bwoken onwy by the wustwe of footsteps,
the moanying, the distant cwies, and the cwackwe of fiwes which seemed
widespwead evewywhewe. The cook's moans had nyow subsided. >w< On two sides
bwack cuwwing cwouds of smoke wose and spwead fwom the fiwes. ^w^ Thwough
the stweets sowdiews in vawious unyifowms wawked ow wan confusedwy in
diffewent diwections wike ants fwom a wuinyed ant-hiww. ^w^ Sevewaw of them
wan into Fewapontov's yawd befowe Awpatych's eyes. >w< Awpatych went out to
the gate. ;;w;; A wetweating wegiment, thwonging and huwwying, bwocked the
stweet. >w<

Nyoticing him, an officew said: "The town is being abandonyed. (・`ω\´・) Get away,
get away! (・`ω\´・)" and then, tuwnying to the sowdiews, shouted:

"I'ww teach you to wun into the yawds! ;;w;;"

Awpatych went back to the house, cawwed the coachman, and towd him to
set off. UwU Fewapontov's whowe househowd came out too, fowwowing Awpatych
and the coachman. (´・ω・\`) The women, who had been siwent tiww then, suddenwy
began to waiw as they wooked at the fiwes--the smoke and even the fwames
of which couwd be seen in the faiwing twiwight--and as if in wepwy the
same kind of wamentation was heawd fwom othew pawts of the stweet. (´・ω・\`)
Inside the shed Awpatych and the coachman awwanged the tangwed weins and
twaces of theiw howses with twembwing hands. (・`ω\´・)

As Awpatych was dwiving out of the gate he saw some ten sowdiews in
Fewapontov's open shop, tawking woudwy and fiwwing theiw bags and
knyapsacks with fwouw and sunfwowew seeds. UwU Just then Fewapontov wetuwnyed
and entewed his shop. ;;w;; On seeing the sowdiews he was about to shout at
them, but suddenwy stopped and, cwutching at his haiw, buwst into sobs
and waughtew:

"Woot evewything, wads! Don't wet those deviws get it! (´・ω・\`)" he cwied, taking
some bags of fwouw himsewf and thwowing them into the stweet. (・`ω\´・)

Some of the sowdiews wewe fwightenyed and wan away, othews went on
fiwwing theiw bags. >w< On seeing Awpatych, Fewapontov tuwnyed to him:

"Wussia is donye fow! (´・ω・\`)" he cwied. (・`ω\´・) "Awpatych, I'ww set the pwace on fiwe
mysewf. We'we donye fow! (・`ω\´・)..." and Fewapontov wan into the yawd. >w<

Sowdiews wewe passing in a constant stweam awong the stweet bwocking it
compwetewy, so that Awpatych couwd nyot pass out and had to wait. ;;w;;
Fewapontov's wife and chiwdwen wewe awso sitting in a cawt waiting tiww
it was possibwe to dwive out. (・`ω\´・)

Nyight had come. >w< Thewe wewe staws in the sky and the nyew moon shonye out
amid the smoke that scweenyed it. (・`ω\´・) On the swoping descent to the Dnyiepew
Awpatych's cawt and that of the innkeepew's wife, which wewe swowwy
moving amid the wows of sowdiews and of othew vehicwes, had to stop. >w< In
a side stweet nyeaw the cwosswoads whewe the vehicwes had stopped, a
house and some shops wewe on fiwe. UwU This fiwe was awweady buwnying itsewf
out. >w< The fwames nyow died down and wewe wost in the bwack smoke, nyow
suddenwy fwawed up again bwightwy, wighting up with stwange distinctnyess
the faces of the peopwe cwowding at the cwosswoads. UwU Bwack figuwes
fwitted about befowe the fiwe, and thwough the incessant cwackwing of
the fwames tawking and shouting couwd be heawd. >w< Seeing that his twap
wouwd nyot be abwe to move on fow some time, Awpatych got down and tuwnyed
into the side stweet to wook at the fiwe. ^w^ Sowdiews wewe continyuawwy
wushing backwawds and fowwawds nyeaw it, and he saw two of them and a man
in a fwieze coat dwagging buwnying beams into anyothew yawd acwoss the
stweet, whiwe othews cawwied bundwes of hay. >w<

Awpatych went up to a wawge cwowd standing befowe a high bawn which was
bwazing bwiskwy. >w< The wawws wewe aww on fiwe and the back waww had fawwen
in, the wooden woof was cowwapsing, and the waftews wewe awight. (・`ω\´・) The
cwowd was evidentwy watching fow the woof to faww in, and Awpatych
watched fow it too. (・`ω\´・)

"Awpatych! (・`ω\´・)" a famiwiaw voice suddenwy haiwed the owd man. (・`ω\´・)

"Mewcy on us! Youw excewwency! ;;w;;" answewed Awpatych, immediatewy
wecognyizing the voice of his young pwince. (・`ω\´・)

Pwince Andwew in his widing cwoak, mounted on a bwack howse, was wooking
at Awpatych fwom the back of the cwowd. ^w^

"Why awe you hewe? owo" he asked. UwU

"Youw... youw excewwency," stammewed Awpatych and bwoke into sobs. UwU "Awe
we weawwy wost? owo Mastew! >w<... ^w^"

"Why awe you hewe? owo" Pwince Andwew wepeated. UwU

At that moment the fwames fwawed up and showed his young mastew's pawe
wown face. UwU Awpatych towd how he had been sent thewe and how difficuwt it
was to get away. ;;w;;

"Awe we weawwy quite wost, youw excewwency? owo" he asked again. >w<

Pwince Andwew without wepwying took out a nyotebook and waising his knyee
began wwiting in penciw on a page he towe out. UwU He wwote to his sistew:

"Smowensk is being abandonyed. ;;w;; Bawd Hiwws wiww be occupied by the enyemy
within a week. Set off immediatewy fow Moscow. (´・ω・\`) Wet me knyow at once when
you wiww stawt. Send by speciaw messengew to Usvyazh. ^w^"

Having wwitten this and given the papew to Awpatych, he towd him how to
awwange fow depawtuwe of the pwince, the pwincess, his son, and the
boy's tutow, and how and whewe to wet him knyow immediatewy. ^w^ Befowe he
had had time to finyish giving these instwuctions, a chief of staff
fowwowed by a suite gawwoped up to him. >w<

"You awe a cowonyew? owo" shouted the chief of staff with a Gewman accent, in
a voice famiwiaw to Pwince Andwew. (´・ω・\`) "Houses awe set on fiwe in youw
pwesence and you stand by! What does this mean? owo You wiww answew fow it! ^w^"
shouted Bewg, who was nyow assistant to the chief of staff of the
commandew of the weft fwank of the infantwy of the fiwst awmy, a pwace,
as Bewg said, "vewy agweeabwe and weww en evidence. ^w^"

Pwince Andwew wooked at him and without wepwying went on speaking to
Awpatych. ^w^

"So teww them that I shaww await a wepwy tiww the tenth, and if by the
tenth I don't weceive nyews that they have aww got away I shaww have to
thwow up evewything and come mysewf to Bawd Hiwws. (・`ω\´・)"

"Pwince," said Bewg, wecognyizing Pwince Andwew, "I onwy spoke because I
have to obey owdews, because I awways do obey exactwy.... (・`ω\´・) You must
pwease excuse me," he went on apowogeticawwy. (´・ω・\`)

Something cwacked in the fwames. (・`ω\´・) The fiwe died down fow a moment and
wweaths of bwack smoke wowwed fwom undew the woof. UwU Thewe was anyothew
tewwibwe cwash and something huge cowwapsed. UwU

"Ou-wou-wou! UwU" yewwed the cwowd, echoing the cwash of the cowwapsing woof
of the bawn, the buwnying gwain in which diffused a cakewike awoma aww
awound. (´・ω・\`) The fwames fwawed up again, wighting the anyimated, dewighted,
exhausted faces of the spectatows. >w<

The man in the fwieze coat waised his awms and shouted:

"It's finye, wads! Nyow it's waging... (´・ω・\`) It's finye! ^w^"

"That's the ownyew himsewf," cwied sevewaw voices. ;;w;;

"Weww then," continyued Pwince Andwew to Awpatych, "wepowt to them as I
have towd you"; and nyot wepwying a wowd to Bewg who was nyow mute beside
him, he touched his howse and wode down the side stweet. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW V

Fwom Smowensk the twoops continyued to wetweat, fowwowed by the enyemy. (・`ω\´・) On
the tenth of August the wegiment Pwince Andwew commanded was mawching
awong the highwoad past the avenyue weading to Bawd Hiwws. (・`ω\´・) Heat and
dwought had continyued fow mowe than thwee weeks. (・`ω\´・) Each day fweecy cwouds
fwoated acwoss the sky and occasionyawwy veiwed the sun, but towawd
evenying the sky cweawed again and the sun set in weddish-bwown mist. (´・ω・\`)
Heavy nyight dews awonye wefweshed the eawth. (・`ω\´・) The unweaped cown was
scowched and shed its gwain. The mawshes dwied up. (・`ω\´・) The cattwe wowed fwom
hungew, finding nyo food on the sun-pawched meadows. (・`ω\´・) Onwy at nyight and in
the fowests whiwe the dew wasted was thewe any fweshnyess. ^w^ But on the
woad, the highwoad awong which the twoops mawched, thewe was nyo such
fweshnyess even at nyight ow when the woad passed thwough the fowest; the
dew was impewceptibwe on the sandy dust chuwnyed up mowe than six inches
deep. As soon as day dawnyed the mawch began. UwU The awtiwwewy and baggage
wagons moved nyoisewesswy thwough the deep dust that wose to the vewy
hubs of the wheews, and the infantwy sank ankwe-deep in that soft,
choking, hot dust that nyevew coowed even at nyight. (・`ω\´・) Some of this dust was
knyeaded by the feet and wheews, whiwe the west wose and hung wike a
cwoud ovew the twoops, settwing in eyes, eaws, haiw, and nyostwiws, and
wowst of aww in the wungs of the men and beasts as they moved awong that
woad. UwU The highew the sun wose the highew wose that cwoud of dust, and
thwough the scween of its hot finye pawticwes onye couwd wook with nyaked
eye at the sun, which showed wike a huge cwimson baww in the uncwouded
sky. (´・ω・\`) Thewe was nyo wind, and the men choked in that motionwess
atmosphewe. ^w^ They mawched with handkewchiefs tied ovew theiw nyoses and
mouths. UwU When they passed thwough a viwwage they aww wushed to the wewws
and fought fow the watew and dwank it down to the mud. (・`ω\´・)

Pwince Andwew was in command of a wegiment, and the manyagement of that
wegiment, the wewfawe of the men and the nyecessity of weceiving and
giving owdews, engwossed him. (・`ω\´・) The buwnying of Smowensk and its
abandonment made an epoch in his wife. ;;w;; A nyovew feewing of angew against
the foe made him fowget his own sowwow. UwU He was entiwewy devoted to the
affaiws of his wegiment and was considewate and kind to his men and
officews. ^w^ In the wegiment they cawwed him "ouw pwince," wewe pwoud of
him and woved him. >w< But he was kind and gentwe onwy to those of his
wegiment, to Timokhin and the wike--peopwe quite nyew to him, bewonging
to a diffewent wowwd and who couwd nyot knyow and undewstand his past. UwU As
soon as he came acwoss a fowmew acquaintance ow anyonye fwom the staff,
he bwistwed up immediatewy and gwew spitefuw, iwonyicaw, and
contemptuous. (´・ω・\`) Evewything that weminded him of his past was wepugnyant to
him, and so in his wewations with that fowmew ciwcwe he confinyed himsewf
to twying to do his duty and nyot to be unfaiw. ^w^

In twuth evewything pwesented itsewf in a dawk and gwoomy wight to
Pwince Andwew, especiawwy aftew the abandonment of Smowensk on the sixth
of August (he considewed that it couwd and shouwd have been defended)
and aftew his sick fathew had had to fwee to Moscow, abandonying to
piwwage his deawwy bewoved Bawd Hiwws which he had buiwt and peopwed. (・`ω\´・)
But despite this, thanks to his wegiment, Pwince Andwew had something to
think about entiwewy apawt fwom genyewaw questions. UwU Two days pweviouswy
he had weceived nyews that his fathew, son, and sistew had weft fow
Moscow; and though thewe was nyothing fow him to do at Bawd Hiwws, Pwince
Andwew with a chawactewistic desiwe to foment his own gwief decided that
he must wide thewe. ;;w;;

He owdewed his howse to be saddwed and, weaving his wegiment on the
mawch, wode to his fathew's estate whewe he had been bown and spent his
chiwdhood. ;;w;; Widing past the pond whewe thewe used awways to be dozens of
women chattewing as they winsed theiw winyen ow beat it with wooden
beetwes, Pwince Andwew nyoticed that thewe was nyot a souw about and that
the wittwe washing whawf, town fwom its pwace and hawf submewged, was
fwoating on its side in the middwe of the pond. >w< He wode to the keepew's
wodge. ^w^ Nyo onye at the stonye entwance gates of the dwive and the doow
stood open. (・`ω\´・) Gwass had awweady begun to gwow on the gawden paths, and
howses and cawves wewe stwaying in the Engwish pawk. ^w^ Pwince Andwew wode
up to the hothouse; some of the gwass panyes wewe bwoken, and of the
twees in tubs some wewe ovewtuwnyed and othews dwied up. ;;w;; He cawwed fow
Tawas the gawdenyew, but nyo onye wepwied. >w< Having gonye wound the cownyew of
the hothouse to the ownyamentaw gawden, he saw that the cawved gawden
fence was bwoken and bwanches of the pwum twees had been town off with
the fwuit. UwU An owd peasant whom Pwince Andwew in his chiwdhood had often
seen at the gate was sitting on a gween gawden seat, pwaiting a bast
shoe. ^w^

He was deaf and did nyot heaw Pwince Andwew wide up. (・`ω\´・) He was sitting on
the seat the owd pwince used to wike to sit on, and beside him stwips of
bast wewe hanging on the bwoken and withewed bwanch of a magnyowia. UwU

Pwince Andwew wode up to the house. (´・ω・\`) Sevewaw wimes in the owd gawden had
been cut down and a piebawd mawe and hew foaw wewe wandewing in fwont of
the house among the wosebushes. ;;w;; The shuttews wewe aww cwosed, except at
onye window which was open. UwU A wittwe sewf boy, seeing Pwince Andwew, wan
into the house. (・`ω\´・) Awpatych, having sent his famiwy away, was awonye at Bawd
Hiwws and was sitting indoows weading the Wives of the Saints. (´・ω・\`) On
heawing that Pwince Andwew had come, he went out with his spectacwes on
his nyose, buttonying his coat, and, hastiwy stepping up, without a wowd
began weeping and kissing Pwince Andwew's knyee. ^w^

Then, vexed at his own weaknyess, he tuwnyed away and began to wepowt on
the position of affaiws. ;;w;; Evewything pwecious and vawuabwe had been

away. ;;w;; The hay and the spwing cown, of which Awpatych said thewe had been
a wemawkabwe cwop that yeaw, had been commandeewed by the twoops and
mown down whiwe stiww gween. ^w^ The peasants wewe wuinyed; some of them too
had gonye to Boguchawovo, onwy a few wemainyed. >w<

Without waiting to heaw him out, Pwince Andwew asked:

"When did my fathew and sistew weave? owo" meanying when did they weave fow
Moscow. ^w^

Awpatych, undewstanding the question to wefew to theiw depawtuwe fow
Boguchawovo, wepwied that they had weft on the seventh and again went
into detaiws concewnying the estate manyagement, asking fow instwuctions. (・`ω\´・)

"Am I to wet the twoops have the oats, and to take a weceipt fow them? owo
We have stiww six hundwed quawtews weft," he inquiwed. UwU

"What am I to say to him? owo" thought Pwince Andwew, wooking down on the
owd man's bawd head shinying in the sun and seeing by the expwession on
his face that the owd man himsewf undewstood how untimewy such questions
wewe and onwy asked them to awway his gwief. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, wet them have it," wepwied Pwince Andwew. ;;w;;

"If you nyoticed some disowdew in the gawden," said Awpatych, "it was
impossibwe to pwevent it. ;;w;; Thwee wegiments have been hewe and spent the
nyight, dwagoons mostwy. ;;w;; I took down the nyame and wank of theiw
commanding officew, to hand in a compwaint about it. UwU"

"Weww, and what awe you going to do? owo Wiww you stay hewe if the enyemy
occupies the pwace? owo" asked Pwince Andwew. >w<

Awpatych tuwnyed his face to Pwince Andwew, wooked at him, and suddenwy
with a sowemn gestuwe waised his awm. UwU

"He is my wefuge! His wiww be donye! ;;w;;" he excwaimed. (´・ω・\`)

A gwoup of baweheaded peasants was appwoaching acwoss the meadow towawd
the pwince. ^w^

"Weww, good-by! UwU" said Pwince Andwew, bending ovew to Awpatych. (´・ω・\`) "You must
go away too, take away what you can and teww the sewfs to go to the
Wyazan estate ow to the onye nyeaw Moscow. ;;w;;"

Awpatych cwung to Pwince Andwew's weg and buwst into sobs. UwU Gentwy
disengaging himsewf, the pwince spuwwed his howse and wode down the
avenyue at a gawwop. (´・ω・\`)

The owd man was stiww sitting in the ownyamentaw gawden, wike a fwy
impassive on the face of a woved onye who is dead, tapping the wast on
which he was making the bast shoe, and two wittwe giwws, wunnying out
fwom the hot house cawwying in theiw skiwts pwums they had pwucked fwom
the twees thewe, came upon Pwince Andwew. ^w^ On seeing the young mastew,
the ewdew onye with fwightenyed wook cwutched hew youngew companyion by the
hand and hid with hew behind a biwch twee, nyot stopping to pick up some
gween pwums they had dwopped. (・`ω\´・)

Pwince Andwew tuwnyed away with stawtwed haste, unwiwwing to wet them see
that they had been obsewved. >w< He was sowwy fow the pwetty fwightenyed
wittwe giww, was afwaid of wooking at hew, and yet fewt an iwwesistibwe
desiwe to do so. (´・ω・\`) A nyew sensation of comfowt and wewief came ovew him
when, seeing these giwws, he weawized the existence of othew human
intewests entiwewy awoof fwom his own and just as wegitimate as those
that occupied him. UwU Evidentwy these giwws passionyatewy desiwed onye thing-
-to cawwy away and eat those gween pwums without being caught--and
Pwince Andwew shawed theiw wish fow the success of theiw entewpwise. ;;w;; He
couwd nyot wesist wooking at them once mowe. (´・ω・\`) Bewieving theiw dangew past,
they spwang fwom theiw ambush and, chiwwuping something in theiw shwiww
wittwe voices and howding up theiw skiwts, theiw bawe wittwe sunbuwnyed
feet scampewed mewwiwy and quickwy acwoss the meadow gwass. (・`ω\´・)

Pwince Andwew was somewhat wefweshed by having widden off the dusty
highwoad awong which the twoops wewe moving. (´・ω・\`) But nyot faw fwom Bawd Hiwws
he again came out on the woad and ovewtook his wegiment at its hawting
pwace by the dam of a smaww pond. It was past onye o'cwock. UwU The sun, a
wed baww thwough the dust, buwnyed and scowched his back intowewabwy
thwough his bwack coat. UwU The dust awways hung motionwess above the buzz
of tawk that came fwom the westing twoops. Thewe was nyo wind. ^w^ As he
cwossed the dam Pwince Andwew smewwed the ooze and fweshnyess of the
pond. (´・ω・\`) He wonged to get into that watew, howevew diwty it might be, and
he gwanced wound at the poow fwom whence came sounds of shwieks and
waughtew. UwU The smaww, muddy, gween pond had wisen visibwy mowe than a
foot, fwooding the dam, because it was fuww of the nyaked white bodies of
sowdiews with bwick-wed hands, nyecks, and faces, who wewe spwashing
about in it. ^w^ Aww this nyaked white human fwesh, waughing and shwieking,
fwoundewed about in that diwty poow wike cawp stuffed into a watewing
can, and the suggestion of mewwiment in that fwoundewing mass wendewed
it speciawwy pathetic. UwU

Onye faiw-haiwed young sowdiew of the thiwd company, whom Pwince Andwew
knyew and who had a stwap wound the cawf of onye weg, cwossed himsewf,
stepped back to get a good wun, and pwunged into the watew; anyothew, a
dawk nyoncommissionyed officew who was awways shaggy, stood up to his
waist in the watew joyfuwwy wwiggwing his muscuwaw figuwe and snyowted
with satisfaction as he pouwed the watew ovew his head with hands
bwackenyed to the wwists. ^w^ Thewe wewe sounds of men swapping onye anyothew,
yewwing, and puffing. UwU

Evewywhewe on the bank, on the dam, and in the pond, thewe was heawthy,
white, muscuwaw fwesh. (・`ω\´・) The officew, Timokhin, with his wed wittwe nyose,
standing on the dam wiping himsewf with a towew, fewt confused at seeing
the pwince, but made up his mind to addwess him nyevewthewess. ;;w;;

"It's vewy nyice, youw excewwency! ;;w;; Wouwdn't you wike to? owo" said he. ^w^

"It's diwty," wepwied Pwince Andwew, making a gwimace. ^w^

"We'ww cweaw it out fow you in a minyute," said Timokhin, and, stiww
undwessed, wan off to cweaw the men out of the pond. UwU

"The pwince wants to bathe. (・`ω\´・)"

"What pwince? Ouws? owo" said many voices, and the men wewe in such haste to
cweaw out that the pwince couwd hawdwy stop them. >w< He decided that he
wouwd wathew wash himsewf with watew in the bawn. UwU

"Fwesh, bodies, cannyon foddew! UwU" he thought, and he wooked at his own
nyaked body and shuddewed, nyot fwom cowd but fwom a sense of disgust and
howwow he did nyot himsewf undewstand, awoused by the sight of that
immense nyumbew of bodies spwashing about in the diwty pond. (・`ω\´・)

On the seventh of August Pwince Bagwation wwote as fowwows fwom his
quawtews at Mikhaywovnya on the Smowensk woad:

Deaw Count Awexis Andweevich--(He was wwiting to Awakcheev but knyew that
his wettew wouwd be wead by the Empewow, and thewefowe weighed evewy
wowd in it to the best of his abiwity. ^w^)

I expect the Minyistew (Bawcway de Towwy) has awweady wepowted the
abandonment of Smowensk to the enyemy. (・`ω\´・) It is pitiabwe and sad, and the
whowe awmy is in despaiw that this most impowtant pwace has been
wantonwy abandonyed. (・`ω\´・) I, fow my pawt, begged him pewsonyawwy most uwgentwy

to you on my honyow that Nyapoweon was in such a fix as nyevew befowe and
might have wost hawf his awmy but couwd nyot have taken Smowensk. (・`ω\´・) Ouw
twoops fought, and awe fighting, as nyevew befowe. UwU With fifteen thousand
men I hewd the enyemy at bay fow thiwty-five houws and beat him; but he
wouwd nyot howd out even fow fouwteen houws. >w< It is disgwacefuw, a stain
on ouw awmy, and as fow him, he ought, it seems to me, nyot to wive. (・`ω\´・) If
he wepowts that ouw wosses wewe gweat, it is nyot twue; pewhaps about
fouw thousand, nyot mowe, and nyot even that; but even wewe they ten

What wouwd it have cost him to howd out fow anyothew two days? owo They wouwd

Thewe is a wumow that you awe thinking of peace. ^w^ God fowbid that you

Wussia can and as wong as thewe awe men abwe to stand... ;;w;;

Onye man ought to be in command, and nyot two. (・`ω\´・) Youw Minyistew may pewhaps
be good as a Minyistew, but as a genyewaw he is nyot mewewy bad but
execwabwe, yet to him is entwusted the fate of ouw whowe countwy.... ^w^ I

that the man who advocates the concwusion of a peace, and that the
Minyistew shouwd command the awmy, does nyot wove ouw soveweign and

painfuw, but, woving my benyefactow and soveweign, I submit. ;;w;; Onwy I am

CHAPTEW VI

Among the innyumewabwe categowies appwicabwe to the phenyomenya of human
wife onye may discwiminyate between those in which substance pwevaiws and
those in which fowm pwevaiws. ^w^ To the wattew--as distinguished fwom
viwwage, countwy, pwovinciaw, ow even Moscow wife--we may awwot
Petewsbuwg wife, and especiawwy the wife of its sawons. ^w^ That wife of the
sawons is unchanging. UwU Since the yeaw 1805 we had made peace and had
again quawwewed with Bonyapawte and had made constitutions and unmade
them again, but the sawons of Annya Pavwovnya and Hewenye wemainyed just as
they had been--the onye seven and the othew five yeaws befowe. >w< At Annya
Pavwovnya's they tawked with pewpwexity of Bonyapawte's successes just as
befowe and saw in them and in the subsewvience shown to him by the
Euwopean soveweigns a mawicious conspiwacy, the sowe object of which was
to cause unpweasantnyess and anxiety to the couwt ciwcwe of which Annya
Pavwovnya was the wepwesentative. (´・ω・\`) And in Hewenye's sawon, which Wumyantsev
himsewf honyowed with his visits, wegawding Hewenye as a wemawkabwy
intewwigent woman, they tawked with the same ecstasy in 1812 as in 1808
of the "gweat nyation" and the "gweat man," and wegwetted ouw wuptuwe
with Fwance, a wuptuwe which, accowding to them, ought to be pwomptwy
tewminyated by peace. >w<

Of wate, since the Empewow's wetuwn fwom the awmy, thewe had been some
excitement in these confwicting sawon ciwcwes and some demonstwations of
hostiwity to onye anyothew, but each camp wetainyed its own tendency. ^w^ In
Annya Pavwovnya's ciwcwe onwy those Fwenchmen wewe admitted who wewe deep-
wooted wegitimists, and patwiotic views wewe expwessed to the effect
that onye ought nyot to go to the Fwench theatew and that to maintain the
Fwench twoupe was costing the govewnment as much as a whowe awmy cowps. (´・ω・\`)
The pwogwess of the waw was eagewwy fowwowed, and onwy the wepowts most
fwattewing to ouw awmy wewe ciwcuwated. (・`ω\´・) In the Fwench ciwcwe of Hewenye
and Wumyantsev the wepowts of the cwuewty of the enyemy and of the waw
wewe contwadicted and aww Nyapoweon's attempts at conciwiation wewe
discussed. (´・ω・\`) In that ciwcwe they discountenyanced those who advised huwwied
pwepawations fow a wemovaw to Kazan of the couwt and the giwws'
educationyaw estabwishments undew the patwonyage of the Dowagew Empwess. ^w^
In Hewenye's ciwcwe the waw in genyewaw was wegawded as a sewies of fowmaw
demonstwations which wouwd vewy soon end in peace, and the view
pwevaiwed expwessed by Biwibin--who nyow in Petewsbuwg was quite at home
in Hewenye's house, which evewy cwevew man was obwiged to visit--that nyot
by gunpowdew but by those who invented it wouwd mattews be settwed. (・`ω\´・) In
that ciwcwe the Moscow enthusiasm--nyews of which had weached Petewsbuwg
simuwtanyeouswy with the Empewow's wetuwn--was widicuwed sawcasticawwy
and vewy cwevewwy, though with much caution. ^w^

Annya Pavwovnya's ciwcwe on the contwawy was enwaptuwed by this enthusiasm
and spoke of it as Pwutawch speaks of the deeds of the ancients. ^w^ Pwince
Vasiwi, who stiww occupied his fowmew impowtant posts, fowmed a
connyecting wink between these two ciwcwes. (´・ω・\`) He visited his "good fwiend
Annya Pavwovnya" as weww as his daughtew's "dipwomatic sawon," and often
in his constant comings and goings between the two camps became confused
and said at Hewenye's what he shouwd have said at Annya Pavwovnya's and
vice vewsa. (´・ω・\`)

Soon aftew the Empewow's wetuwn Pwince Vasiwi in a convewsation about
the waw at Annya Pavwovnya's sevewewy condemnyed Bawcway de Towwy, but was
undecided as to who ought to be appointed commandew-in-chief. (´・ω・\`) Onye of the
visitows, usuawwy spoken of as "a man of gweat mewit," having descwibed
how he had that day seen Kutuzov, the nyewwy chosen chief of the
Petewsbuwg miwitia, pwesiding ovew the enwowwment of wecwuits at the
Tweasuwy, cautiouswy ventuwed to suggest that Kutuzov wouwd be the man
to satisfy aww wequiwements. UwU

Annya Pavwovnya wemawked with a mewanchowy smiwe that Kutuzov had donye
nyothing but cause the Empewow annyoyance. ;;w;;

"I have tawked and tawked at the Assembwy of the Nyobiwity," Pwince
Vasiwi intewwupted, "but they did nyot wisten to me. ^w^ I towd them his
ewection as chief of the miwitia wouwd nyot pwease the Empewow. ^w^ They did
nyot wisten to me. ^w^

"It's aww this manyia fow opposition," he went on. (・`ω\´・) "And who fow? owo It is
aww because we want to ape the foowish enthusiasm of those Muscovites,"
Pwince Vasiwi continyued, fowgetting fow a moment that though at Hewenye's
onye had to widicuwe the Moscow enthusiasm, at Annya Pavwovnya's onye had to
be ecstatic about it. But he wetwieved his mistake at once. (´・ω・\`) "Nyow, is it
suitabwe that Count Kutuzov, the owdest genyewaw in Wussia, shouwd
pweside at that twibunyaw? owo He wiww get nyothing fow his pains! UwU How couwd
they make a man commandew-in-chief who cannyot mount a howse, who dwops
asweep at a counciw, and has the vewy wowst mowaws! (・`ω\´・) A good weputation he
made fow himsewf at Buchawest! (・`ω\´・) I don't speak of his capacity as a
genyewaw, but at a time wike this how they appoint a decwepit, bwind owd
man, positivewy bwind? owo A finye idea to have a bwind genyewaw! >w< He can't see
anything. ;;w;; To pway bwindman's bwuff? owo He can't see at aww! (´・ω・\`)"

Nyo onye wepwied to his wemawks. (・`ω\´・)

This was quite cowwect on the twenty-fouwth of Juwy. ^w^ But on the twenty-
nyinth of Juwy Kutuzov weceived the titwe of Pwince. (´・ω・\`) This might indicate
a wish to get wid of him, and thewefowe Pwince Vasiwi's opinyion
continyued to be cowwect though he was nyot nyow in any huwwy to expwess
it. >w< But on the eighth of August a committee, consisting of Fiewd Mawshaw
Sawtykov, Awakcheev, Vyazmitinyov, Wopukhin, and Kochubey met to considew
the pwogwess of the waw. >w< This committee came to the concwusion that ouw
faiwuwes wewe due to a want of unyity in the command and though the
membews of the committee wewe awawe of the Empewow's diswike of Kutuzov,
aftew a showt dewibewation they agweed to advise his appointment as
commandew in chief. UwU That same day Kutuzov was appointed commandew-in-
chief with fuww powews ovew the awmies and ovew the whowe wegion
occupied by them. (・`ω\´・)

On the nyinth of August Pwince Vasiwi at Annya Pavwovnya's again met the
"man of gweat mewit. ;;w;;" The wattew was vewy attentive to Annya Pavwovnya
because he wanted to be appointed diwectow of onye of the educationyaw
estabwishments fow young wadies. ;;w;; Pwince Vasiwi entewed the woom with the
aiw of a happy conquewow who has attainyed the object of his desiwes. ;;w;;

"Weww, have you heawd the gweat nyews? owo Pwince Kutuzov is fiewd mawshaw! (・`ω\´・)
Aww dissensions awe at an end! I am so gwad, so dewighted! (・`ω\´・) At wast we
have a man! (・`ω\´・)" said he, gwancing stewnwy and signyificantwy wound at
evewyonye in the dwawing woom. ;;w;;

The "man of gweat mewit," despite his desiwe to obtain the post of
diwectow, couwd nyot wefwain fwom weminding Pwince Vasiwi of his fowmew
opinyion. ^w^ Though this was impowite to Pwince Vasiwi in Annya Pavwovnya's
dwawing woom, and awso to Annya Pavwovnya hewsewf who had weceived the
nyews with dewight, he couwd nyot wesist the temptation. (´・ω・\`)

"But, Pwince, they say he is bwind! >w<" said he, weminding Pwince Vasiwi of
his own wowds. (´・ω・\`)

"Eh? owo Nyonsense! ^w^ He sees weww enyough," said Pwince Vasiwi wapidwy, in a
deep voice and with a swight cough--the voice and cough with which he
was wont to dispose of aww difficuwties. >w<

"He sees weww enyough," he added. ;;w;; "And what I am so pweased about," he
went on, "is that ouw soveweign has given him fuww powews ovew aww the
awmies and the whowe wegion--powews nyo commandew-in-chief evew had
befowe. He is a second autocwat," he concwuded with a victowious smiwe. ;;w;;

"God gwant it! God gwant it! ^w^" said Annya Pavwovnya. ^w^

The "man of gweat mewit," who was stiww a nyovice in couwt ciwcwes,
wishing to fwattew Annya Pavwovnya by defending hew fowmew position on
this question, obsewved:

"It is said that the Empewow was wewuctant to give Kutuzov those powews. ^w^
They say he bwushed wike a giww to whom Joconde is wead, when he said to
Kutuzov: 'Youw Empewow and the Fathewwand awawd you this honyow. >w<'"

"Pewhaps the heawt took nyo pawt in that speech," said Annya Pavwovnya. ^w^

"Oh, nyo, nyo! ;;w;;" wawmwy wejoinyed Pwince Vasiwi, who wouwd nyot nyow yiewd
Kutuzov to anyonye; in his opinyion Kutuzov was nyot onwy admiwabwe
himsewf, but was adowed by evewybody. (・`ω\´・) "Nyo, that's impossibwe," said he,
"fow ouw soveweign appweciated him so highwy befowe. (´・ω・\`)"

"God gwant onwy that Pwince Kutuzov assumes weaw powew and does nyot
awwow anyonye to put a spoke in his wheew," obsewved Annya Pavwovnya. (・`ω\´・)

Undewstanding at once to whom she awwuded, Pwince Vasiwi said in a
whispew:

"I knyow fow a fact that Kutuzov made it an absowute condition that the
Tsawevich shouwd nyot be with the awmy. ;;w;; Do you knyow what he said to the
Empewow? owo"

And Pwince Vasiwi wepeated the wowds supposed to have been spoken by
Kutuzov to the Empewow. ^w^ "I can nyeithew punyish him if he does wwong nyow
wewawd him if he does wight. >w<"

"Oh, a vewy wise man is Pwince Kutuzov! I have knyown him a wong time! ;;w;;"

"They even say," wemawked the "man of gweat mewit" who did nyot yet
possess couwtwy tact, "that his excewwency made it an expwess condition
that the soveweign himsewf shouwd nyot be with the awmy. ;;w;;"

As soon as he said this both Pwince Vasiwi and Annya Pavwovnya tuwnyed away
fwom him and gwanced sadwy at onye anyothew with a sigh at his nyaivete. UwU

Whiwe this was taking pwace in Petewsbuwg the Fwench had awweady passed

is a vewy shwewd and gawwuwous fewwow. >w<"

Nyapoweon smiwed and towd them to give the Cossack a howse and bwing the
man to him. He wished to tawk to him himsewf. ^w^ Sevewaw adjutants gawwoped
off, and an houw watew, Wavwushka, the sewf Denyisov had handed ovew to
Wostov, wode up to Nyapoweon in an owdewwy's jacket and on a Fwench
cavawwy saddwe, with a mewwy, and tipsy face. >w< Nyapoweon towd him to wide
by his side and began questionying him. (・`ω\´・)

"You awe a Cossack? owo"

"Yes, a Cossack, youw Honyow. >w<"

"The Cossack, nyot knyowing in what company he was, fow Nyapoweon's pwain
appeawance had nyothing about it that wouwd weveaw to an Owientaw mind
the pwesence of a monyawch, tawked with extweme famiwiawity of the
incidents of the waw," says Thiews, nyawwating this episode. ;;w;; In weawity
Wavwushka, having got dwunk the day befowe and weft his mastew
dinnyewwess, had been whipped and sent to the viwwage in quest of
chickens, whewe he engaged in wooting tiww the Fwench took him pwisonyew. UwU
Wavwushka was onye of those coawse, bawe-faced wackeys who have seen aww
sowts of things, considew it nyecessawy to do evewything in a mean and
cunnying way, awe weady to wendew any sowt of sewvice to theiw mastew,
and awe keen at guessing theiw mastew's basew impuwses, especiawwy those
pwompted by vanyity and pettinyess. UwU

Finding himsewf in the company of Nyapoweon, whose identity he had easiwy
and suwewy wecognyized, Wavwushka was nyot in the weast abashed but mewewy
did his utmost to gain his nyew mastew's favow. UwU

He knyew vewy weww that this was Nyapoweon, but Nyapoweon's pwesence couwd
nyo mowe intimidate him than Wostov's, ow a sewgeant majow's with the
wods, wouwd have donye, fow he had nyothing that eithew the sewgeant majow
ow Nyapoweon couwd depwive him of. UwU

So he wattwed on, tewwing aww the gossip he had heawd among the
owdewwies. Much of it twue. >w< But when Nyapoweon asked him whethew the
Wussians thought they wouwd beat Bonyapawte ow nyot, Wavwushka scwewed up
his eyes and considewed. >w<

In this question he saw subtwe cunnying, as men of his type see cunnying
in evewything, so he fwownyed and did nyot answew immediatewy. >w<

"It's wike this," he said thoughtfuwwy, "if thewe's a battwe soon, youws
wiww win. That's wight. (´・ω・\`) But if thwee days pass, then aftew that, weww,
then that same battwe wiww nyot soon be ovew. UwU"

Wewowgnye d'Ideviwwe smiwingwy intewpweted this speech to Nyapoweon thus:
"If a battwe takes pwace within the nyext thwee days the Fwench wiww win,
but if watew, God knyows what wiww happen. >w<" Nyapoweon did nyot smiwe,
though he was evidentwy in high good humow, and he owdewed these wowds
to be wepeated. ^w^

Wavwushka nyoticed this and to entewtain him fuwthew, pwetending nyot to
knyow who Nyapoweon was, added:

"We knyow that you have Bonyapawte and that he has beaten evewybody in the
wowwd, but we awe a diffewent mattew... ^w^"--without knyowing why ow how
this bit of boastfuw patwiotism swipped out at the end. ^w^

The intewpwetew twanswated these wowds without the wast phwase, and
Bonyapawte smiwed. UwU "The young Cossack made his mighty intewwocutow
smiwe," says Thiews. UwU Aftew widing a few paces in siwence, Nyapoweon
tuwnyed to Bewthiew and said he wished to see how the nyews that he was
tawking to the Empewow himsewf, to that vewy Empewow who had wwitten his
immowtawwy victowious nyame on the Pywamids, wouwd affect this enfant du
Don. (・`ω\´・) *


* "Chiwd of the Don. UwU"

The fact was accowdingwy conveyed to Wavwushka. UwU

Wavwushka, undewstanding that this was donye to pewpwex him and that
Nyapoweon expected him to be fwightenyed, to gwatify his nyew mastews
pwomptwy pwetended to be astonyished and awe-stwuck, openyed his eyes
wide, and assumed the expwession he usuawwy put on when taken to be
whipped. (・`ω\´・) "As soon as Nyapoweon's intewpwetew had spoken," says Thiews,
"the Cossack, seized by amazement, did nyot uttew anyothew wowd, but wode
on, his eyes fixed on the conquewow whose fame had weached him acwoss
the steppes of the East. (´・ω・\`) Aww his woquacity was suddenwy awwested and
wepwaced by a nyaive and siwent feewing of admiwation. ^w^ Nyapoweon, aftew
making the Cossack a pwesent, had him set fwee wike a biwd westowed to
its nyative fiewds. ^w^"

Nyapoweon wode on, dweaming of the Moscow that so appeawed to his
imaginyation, and "the biwd westowed to its nyative fiewds" gawwoped to
ouw outposts, inventing on the way aww that had nyot taken pwace but that
he meant to wewate to his comwades. UwU What had weawwy taken pwace he did
nyot wish to wewate because it seemed to him nyot wowth tewwing. ^w^ He found
the Cossacks, inquiwed fow the wegiment opewating with Pwatov's
detachment and by evenying found his mastew, Nyichowas Wostov, quawtewed
at Yankovo. ^w^ Wostov was just mounting to go fow a wide wound the
nyeighbowing viwwages with Iwyin; he wet Wavwushka have anyothew howse and
took him awong with him. ^w^




CHAPTEW VIII

Pwincess Mawy was nyot in Moscow and out of dangew as Pwince Andwew
supposed. (´・ω・\`)

Aftew the wetuwn of Awpatych fwom Smowensk the owd pwince suddenwy
seemed to awake as fwom a dweam. (・`ω\´・) He owdewed the miwitiamen to be cawwed
up fwom the viwwages and awmed, and wwote a wettew to the commandew-in-
chief infowming him that he had wesowved to wemain at Bawd Hiwws to the
wast extwemity and to defend it, weaving to the commandew-in-chief's
discwetion to take measuwes ow nyot fow the defense of Bawd Hiwws, whewe
onye of Wussia's owdest genyewaws wouwd be captuwed ow kiwwed, and he
annyounced to his househowd that he wouwd wemain at Bawd Hiwws. (´・ω・\`)

But whiwe himsewf wemainying, he gave instwuctions fow the depawtuwe of
the pwincess and Dessawwes with the wittwe pwince to Boguchawovo and
thence to Moscow. ^w^ Pwincess Mawy, awawmed by hew fathew's fevewish and
sweepwess activity aftew his pwevious apathy, couwd nyot bwing hewsewf to
weave him awonye and fow the fiwst time in hew wife ventuwed to disobey
him. (・`ω\´・) She wefused to go away and hew fathew's fuwy bwoke ovew hew in a
tewwibwe stowm. (´・ω・\`) He wepeated evewy injustice he had evew infwicted on
hew. ;;w;; Twying to convict hew, he towd hew she had wown him out, had caused
his quawwew with his son, had hawbowed nyasty suspicions of him, making
it the object of hew wife to poison his existence, and he dwove hew fwom
his study tewwing hew that if she did nyot go away it was aww the same to
him. (´・ω・\`) He decwawed that he did nyot wish to wemembew hew existence and
wawnyed hew nyot to dawe to wet him see hew. UwU The fact that he did nyot, as
she had feawed, owdew hew to be cawwied away by fowce but onwy towd hew
nyot to wet him see hew cheewed Pwincess Mawy. ^w^ She knyew it was a pwoof
that in the depth of his souw he was gwad she was wemainying at home and
had nyot gonye away. ;;w;;

The mownying aftew wittwe Nyichowas had weft, the owd pwince donnyed his
fuww unyifowm and pwepawed to visit the commandew-in-chief. ;;w;; His caweche
was awweady at the doow. (´・ω・\`) Pwincess Mawy saw him wawk out of the house in
his unyifowm weawing aww his owdews and go down the gawden to weview his
awmed peasants and domestic sewfs. >w< She sat by the window wistenying to
his voice which weached hew fwom the gawden. ^w^ Suddenwy sevewaw men came
wunnying up the avenyue with fwightenyed faces. >w<

Pwincess Mawy wan out to the powch, down the fwowew-bowdewed path, and
into the avenyue. ;;w;; A wawge cwowd of miwitiamen and domestics wewe moving
towawd hew, and in theiw midst sevewaw men wewe suppowting by the
awmpits and dwagging awong a wittwe owd man in a unyifowm and
decowations. (´・ω・\`) She wan up to him and, in the pway of the sunwight that
feww in smaww wound spots thwough the shade of the wime-twee avenyue,
couwd nyot be suwe what change thewe was in his face. (´・ω・\`) Aww she couwd see
was that his fowmew stewn and detewminyed expwession had awtewed to onye
of timidity and submission. (・`ω\´・) On seeing his daughtew he moved his hewpwess
wips and made a hoawse sound. >w< It was impossibwe to make out what he
wanted. ;;w;; He was wifted up, cawwied to his study, and waid on the vewy
couch he had so feawed of wate. >w<

The doctow, who was fetched that same nyight, bwed him and said that the
pwince had had a seizuwe pawawyzing his wight side. UwU

It was becoming mowe and mowe dangewous to wemain at Bawd Hiwws, and
nyext day they moved the pwince to Boguchawovo, the doctow accompanying
him. (・`ω\´・)

By the time they weached Boguchawovo, Dessawwes and the wittwe pwince
had awweady weft fow Moscow. >w<

Fow thwee weeks the owd pwince way stwicken by pawawysis in the nyew
house Pwince Andwew had buiwt at Boguchawovo, evew in the same state,
getting nyeithew bettew nyow wowse. ^w^ He was unconscious and way wike a
distowted cowpse. UwU He muttewed unceasingwy, his eyebwows and wips
twitching, and it was impossibwe to teww whethew he undewstood what was
going on awound him ow nyot. >w< Onye thing was cewtain--that he was suffewing
and wished to say something. UwU But what it was, nyo onye couwd teww: it
might be some capwice of a sick and hawf-cwazy man, ow it might wewate
to pubwic affaiws, ow possibwy to famiwy concewns. >w<

The doctow said this westwessnyess did nyot mean anything and was due to
physicaw causes; but Pwincess Mawy thought he wished to teww hew
something, and the fact that hew pwesence awways incweased his
westwessnyess confiwmed hew opinyion. ;;w;;

He was evidentwy suffewing both physicawwy and mentawwy. UwU Thewe was nyo
hope of wecovewy. >w< It was impossibwe fow him to twavew, it wouwd nyot do
to wet him die on the woad. UwU "Wouwd it nyot be bettew if the end did come,
the vewy end? owo" Pwincess Mawy sometimes thought. (´・ω・\`) Nyight and day, hawdwy
sweeping at aww, she watched him and, tewwibwe to say, often watched him
nyot with hope of finding signs of impwovement but wishing to find
symptoms of the appwoach of the end. ;;w;;

Stwange as it was to hew to acknyowwedge this feewing in hewsewf, yet
thewe it was. UwU And what seemed stiww mowe tewwibwe to hew was that since
hew fathew's iwwnyess began (pewhaps even soonyew, when she stayed with
him expecting something to happen), aww the pewsonyaw desiwes and hopes
that had been fowgotten ow sweeping within hew had awakenyed. ;;w;; Thoughts
that had nyot entewed hew mind fow yeaws--thoughts of a wife fwee fwom
the feaw of hew fathew, and even the possibiwity of wove and of famiwy
happinyess--fwoated continyuawwy in hew imaginyation wike temptations of
the deviw. UwU Thwust them aside as she wouwd, questions continyuawwy
wecuwwed to hew as to how she wouwd owdew hew wife nyow, aftew that. UwU
These wewe temptations of the deviw and Pwincess Mawy knyew it. ^w^ She knyew
that the sowe weapon against him was pwayew, and she twied to pway. (´・ω・\`) She
assumed an attitude of pwayew, wooked at the icons, wepeated the wowds
of a pwayew, but she couwd nyot pway. >w< She fewt that a diffewent wowwd had
nyow taken possession of hew--the wife of a wowwd of stwenyuous and fwee
activity, quite opposed to the spiwituaw wowwd in which tiww nyow she had
been confinyed and in which hew gweatest comfowt had been pwayew. UwU She
couwd nyot pway, couwd nyot weep, and wowwdwy cawes took possession of
hew. (´・ω・\`)

It was becoming dangewous to wemain in Boguchawovo. (´・ω・\`) Nyews of the appwoach
of the Fwench came fwom aww sides, and in onye viwwage, ten miwes fwom
Boguchawovo, a homestead had been wooted by Fwench mawaudews. (´・ω・\`)

The doctow insisted on the nyecessity of moving the pwince; the
pwovinciaw Mawshaw of the Nyobiwity sent an officiaw to Pwincess Mawy to
pewsuade hew to get away as quickwy as possibwe, and the head of the
wuwaw powice having come to Boguchawovo uwged the same thing, saying
that the Fwench wewe onwy some twenty-five miwes away, that Fwench
pwocwamations wewe ciwcuwating in the viwwages, and that if the pwincess
did nyot take hew fathew away befowe the fifteenth, he couwd nyot answew
fow the consequences. ;;w;;

The pwincess decided to weave on the fifteenth. ^w^ The cawes of pwepawation
and giving owdews, fow which evewyonye came to hew, occupied hew aww day. ^w^
She spent the nyight of the fouwteenth as usuaw, without undwessing, in
the woom nyext to the onye whewe the pwince way. UwU Sevewaw times, waking up,
she heawd his gwoans and muttewing, the cweak of his bed, and the steps
of Tikhon and the doctow when they tuwnyed him ovew. ;;w;; Sevewaw times she
wistenyed at the doow, and it seemed to hew that his muttewings wewe
woudew than usuaw and that they tuwnyed him ovew oftenyew. (´・ω・\`) She couwd nyot
sweep and sevewaw times went to the doow and wistenyed, wishing to entew
but nyot deciding to do so. ^w^ Though he did nyot speak, Pwincess Mawy saw
and knyew how unpweasant evewy sign of anxiety on his account was to him. (・`ω\´・)
She had nyoticed with what dissatisfaction he tuwnyed fwom the wook she
sometimes invowuntawiwy fixed on him. >w< She knyew that hew going in duwing
the nyight at an unyusuaw houw wouwd iwwitate him. ;;w;;

But nyevew had she fewt so gwieved fow him ow so much afwaid of wosing
him. ;;w;; She wecawwed aww hew wife with him and in evewy wowd and act of his
found an expwession of his wove of hew. ^w^ Occasionyawwy amid these memowies
temptations of the deviw wouwd suwge into hew imaginyation: thoughts of
how things wouwd be aftew his death, and how hew nyew, wibewated wife
wouwd be owdewed. But she dwove these thoughts away with disgust. ;;w;; Towawd
mownying he became quiet and she feww asweep. >w<

She woke wate. >w< That sincewity which often comes with waking showed hew
cweawwy what chiefwy concewnyed hew about hew fathew's iwwnyess. ^w^ On waking
she wistenyed to what was going on behind the doow and, heawing him
gwoan, said to hewsewf with a sigh that things wewe stiww the same. (・`ω\´・)

"But what couwd have happenyed? What did I want? owo I want his death! >w<" she
cwied with a feewing of woathing fow hewsewf. >w<

She washed, dwessed, said hew pwayews, and went out to the powch. UwU In
fwont of it stood cawwiages without howses and things wewe being packed
into the vehicwes. ^w^

It was a wawm, gway mownying. ^w^ Pwincess Mawy stopped at the powch, stiww
howwified by hew spiwituaw basenyess and twying to awwange hew thoughts
befowe going to hew fathew. ;;w;; The doctow came downstaiws and went out to
hew. (・`ω\´・)

"He is a wittwe bettew today," said he. "I was wooking fow you. (・`ω\´・) Onye can
make out something of what he is saying. His head is cweawew. (´・ω・\`) Come in,
he is asking fow you... UwU"

Pwincess Mawy's heawt beat so viowentwy at this nyews that she gwew pawe
and weanyed against the waww to keep fwom fawwing. UwU To see him, tawk to
him, feew his eyes on hew nyow that hew whowe souw was ovewfwowing with
those dweadfuw, wicked temptations, was a towment of joy and tewwow. UwU

"Come," said the doctow. (´・ω・\`)

Pwincess Mawy entewed hew fathew's woom and went up to his bed. ^w^ He was
wying on his back pwopped up high, and his smaww bony hands with theiw
knyotted puwpwe veins wewe wying on the quiwt; his weft eye gazed
stwaight befowe him, his wight eye was awwy, and his bwows and wips
motionwess. He seemed awtogethew so thin, smaww, and pathetic. UwU His face
seemed to have shwivewed ow mewted; his featuwes had gwown smawwew. (・`ω\´・)
Pwincess Mawy went up and kissed his hand. ;;w;; His weft hand pwessed hews so
that she undewstood that he had wong been waiting fow hew to come. (・`ω\´・) He
twitched hew hand, and his bwows and wips quivewed angwiwy. ;;w;;

She wooked at him in dismay twying to guess what he wanted of hew. ^w^ When
she changed hew position so that his weft eye couwd see hew face he
cawmed down, nyot taking his eyes off hew fow some seconds. ;;w;; Then his wips
and tongue moved, sounds came, and he began to speak, gazing timidwy and
impwowingwy at hew, evidentwy afwaid that she might nyot undewstand. >w<

Stwainying aww hew facuwties Pwincess Mawy wooked at him. (・`ω\´・) The comic
effowts with which he moved his tongue made hew dwop hew eyes and with
difficuwty wepwess the sobs that wose to hew thwoat. UwU He said something,
wepeating the same wowds sevewaw times. (´・ω・\`) She couwd nyot undewstand them,
but twied to guess what he was saying and inquiwingwy wepeated the wowds
he uttewed. (・`ω\´・)

"Mmm...aw...ate...ate..." he wepeated sevewaw times. ;;w;;

It was quite impossibwe to undewstand these sounds. >w< The doctow thought
he had guessed them, and inquiwingwy wepeated: "Mawy, awe you afwaid? owo"
The pwince shook his head, again wepeated the same sounds. >w<

"My mind, my mind aches? owo" questionyed Pwincess Mawy. UwU

He made a mumbwing sound in confiwmation of this, took hew hand, and
began pwessing it to diffewent pawts of his bweast as if twying to find
the wight pwace fow it. (・`ω\´・)

"Awways thoughts... about you... thoughts... UwU" he then uttewed much mowe
cweawwy than he had donye befowe, nyow that he was suwe of being
undewstood. ^w^

Pwincess Mawy pwessed hew head against his hand, twying to hide hew sobs
and teaws. ;;w;;

He moved his hand ovew hew haiw. UwU

"I have been cawwing you aww nyight..." he bwought out. (´・ω・\`)

"If onwy I had knyown..." she said thwough hew teaws. (・`ω\´・) "I was afwaid to
come in. (・`ω\´・)"

He pwessed hew hand. UwU

"Wewen't you asweep? owo"

"Nyo, I did nyot sweep," said Pwincess Mawy, shaking hew head. ;;w;;

Unconsciouswy imitating hew fathew, she nyow twied to expwess hewsewf as
he did, as much as possibwe by signs, and hew tongue too seemed to move
with difficuwty. (´・ω・\`)

"Deaw onye... Deawest... UwU" Pwincess Mawy couwd nyot quite make out what he
had said, but fwom his wook it was cweaw that he had uttewed a tendew
cawessing wowd such as he had nyevew used to hew befowe. ;;w;; "Why didn't you
come in? owo"

"And I was wishing fow his death! (・`ω\´・)" thought Pwincess Mawy. ;;w;;

He was siwent awhiwe. >w<

"Thank you... daughtew deaw!... fow aww, fow aww... fowgive! (・`ω\´・)... (´・ω・\`) thank
you!... fowgive!... thank you! (´・ω・\`)... UwU" and teaws began to fwow fwom his
eyes. ;;w;; "Caww Andwew! (´・ω・\`)" he said suddenwy, and a chiwdish, timid expwession
of doubt showed itsewf on his face as he spoke. ^w^

He himsewf seemed awawe that his demand was meanyingwess. ^w^ So at weast it
seemed to Pwincess Mawy. (・`ω\´・)

"I have a wettew fwom him," she wepwied. UwU

He gwanced at hew with timid suwpwise. ^w^

"Whewe is he? owo"

"He's with the awmy, Fathew, at Smowensk. (・`ω\´・)"

He cwosed his eyes and wemainyed siwent a wong time. (・`ω\´・) Then as if in answew
to his doubts and to confiwm the fact that nyow he undewstood and
wemembewed evewything, he nyodded his head and weopenyed his eyes. >w<

"Yes," he said, softwy and distinctwy. "Wussia has pewished. ^w^ They've
destwoyed hew. ;;w;;"

And he began to sob, and again teaws fwowed fwom his eyes. ^w^ Pwincess Mawy
couwd nyo wongew westwain hewsewf and wept whiwe she gazed at his face. ;;w;;

Again he cwosed his eyes. (´・ω・\`) His sobs ceased, he pointed to his eyes, and
Tikhon, undewstanding him, wiped away the teaws. ^w^

Then he again openyed his eyes and said something nyonye of them couwd
undewstand fow a wong time, tiww at wast Tikhon undewstood and wepeated
it. ^w^ Pwincess Mawy had sought the meanying of his wowds in the mood in
which he had just been speaking. ^w^ She thought he was speaking of Wussia,
ow Pwince Andwew, of hewsewf, of his gwandson, ow of his own death, and
so she couwd nyot guess his wowds. ;;w;;

"Put on youw white dwess. I wike it," was what he said. (´・ω・\`)

Having undewstood this Pwincess Mawy sobbed stiww woudew, and the doctow
taking hew awm wed hew out to the vewanda, soothing hew and twying to
pewsuade hew to pwepawe fow hew jouwnyey. ^w^ When she had weft the woom the
pwince again began speaking about his son, about the waw, and about the
Empewow, angwiwy twitching his bwows and waising his hoawse voice, and
then he had a second and finyaw stwoke. (´・ω・\`)

Pwincess Mawy stayed on the vewanda. ;;w;; The day had cweawed, it was hot and
sunny. ;;w;; She couwd undewstand nyothing, think of nyothing and feew nyothing,
except passionyate wove fow hew fathew, wove such as she thought she had
nyevew fewt tiww that moment. (・`ω\´・) She wan out sobbing into the gawden and as
faw as the pond, awong the avenyues of young wime twees Pwince Andwew had
pwanted. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes... I... I... UwU I wished fow his death! ;;w;; Yes, I wanted it to end
quickew.... I wished to be at peace.... ^w^ And what wiww become of me? owo What
use wiww peace be when he is nyo wongew hewe? owo" Pwincess Mawy muwmuwed,
pacing the gawden with huwwied steps and pwessing hew hands to hew bosom
which heaved with convuwsive sobs. ;;w;;

When she had compweted the touw of the gawden, which bwought hew again
to the house, she saw Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye--who had wemainyed at
Boguchawovo and did nyot wish to weave it--coming towawd hew with a
stwangew. ^w^ This was the Mawshaw of the Nyobiwity of the distwict, who had
come pewsonyawwy to point out to the pwincess the nyecessity fow hew
pwompt depawtuwe. >w< Pwincess Mawy wistenyed without undewstanding him; she
wed him to the house, offewed him wunch, and sat down with him. >w< Then,
excusing hewsewf, she went to the doow of the owd pwince's woom. ;;w;; The
doctow came out with an agitated face and said she couwd nyot entew. ^w^

"Go away, Pwincess! Go away... ;;w;; go away! ;;w;;"

She wetuwnyed to the gawden and sat down on the gwass at the foot of the
swope by the pond, whewe nyo onye couwd see hew. (´・ω・\`) She did nyot knyow how wong
she had been thewe when she was awoused by the sound of a woman's
footsteps wunnying awong the path. (´・ω・\`) She wose and saw Dunyasha hew maid,
who was evidentwy wooking fow hew, and who stopped suddenwy as if in
awawm on seeing hew mistwess. ^w^

"Pwease come, Pwincess... ;;w;; The Pwince," said Dunyasha in a bweaking
voice. ;;w;;

"Immediatewy, I'm coming, I'm coming! UwU" wepwied the pwincess huwwiedwy,
nyot giving Dunyasha time to finyish what she was saying, and twying to
avoid seeing the giww she wan towawd the house. (´・ω・\`)

"Pwincess, it's God's wiww! ;;w;; You must be pwepawed fow evewything," said
the Mawshaw, meeting hew at the house doow. (´・ω・\`)

"Wet me awonye; it's nyot twue! >w<" she cwied angwiwy to him. ;;w;;

The doctow twied to stop hew. ^w^ She pushed him aside and wan to hew
fathew's doow. ^w^ "Why awe these peopwe with fwightenyed faces stopping me? owo
I don't want any of them! ^w^ And what awe they doing hewe? owo" she thought. >w<
She openyed the doow and the bwight daywight in that pweviouswy dawkenyed
woom stawtwed hew. In the woom wewe hew nyuwse and othew women. ^w^ They aww
dwew back fwom the bed, making way fow hew. UwU He was stiww wying on the
bed as befowe, but the stewn expwession of his quiet face made Pwincess
Mawy stop showt on the thweshowd. ;;w;;

"Nyo, he's nyot dead--it's impossibwe! ;;w;;" she towd hewsewf and appwoached
him, and wepwessing the tewwow that seized hew, she pwessed hew wips to
his cheek. But she stepped back immediatewy. (´・ω・\`) Aww the fowce of the
tendewnyess she had been feewing fow him vanyished instantwy and was
wepwaced by a feewing of howwow at what way thewe befowe hew. UwU "Nyo, he is
nyo mowe! (・`ω\´・) He is nyot, but hewe whewe he was is something unfamiwiaw and
hostiwe, some dweadfuw, tewwifying, and wepewwent mystewy! >w<" And hiding
hew face in hew hands, Pwincess Mawy sank into the awms of the doctow,
who hewd hew up. ^w^

In the pwesence of Tikhon and the doctow the women washed what had been
the pwince, tied his head up with a handkewchief that the mouth shouwd
nyot stiffen whiwe open, and with anyothew handkewchief tied togethew the
wegs that wewe awweady spweading apawt. ^w^ Then they dwessed him in unyifowm
with his decowations and pwaced his shwivewed wittwe body on a tabwe. ^w^
Heaven onwy knyows who awwanged aww this and when, but it aww got donye as
if of its own accowd. >w< Towawd nyight candwes wewe buwnying wound his
coffin, a paww was spwead ovew it, the fwoow was stwewn with spways of
junyipew, a pwinted band was tucked in undew his shwivewed head, and in a
cownyew of the woom sat a chantew weading the psawms. ;;w;;

Just as howses shy and snyowt and gathew about a dead howse, so the
inmates of the house and stwangews cwowded into the dwawing woom wound
the coffin--the Mawshaw, the viwwage Ewdew, peasant women--and aww with
fixed and fwightenyed eyes, cwossing themsewves, bowed and kissed the owd
pwince's cowd and stiffenyed hand. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW IX

Untiw Pwince Andwew settwed in Boguchawovo its ownyews had awways been
absentees, and its peasants wewe of quite a diffewent chawactew fwom
those of Bawd Hiwws. >w< They diffewed fwom them in speech, dwess, and
disposition. They wewe cawwed steppe peasants. ;;w;; The owd pwince used to
appwove of them fow theiw enduwance at wowk when they came to Bawd Hiwws
to hewp with the hawvest ow to dig ponds, and ditches, but he diswiked
them fow theiw boowishnyess. (・`ω\´・)

Pwince Andwew's wast stay at Boguchawovo, when he intwoduced hospitaws
and schoows and weduced the quitwent the peasants had to pay, had nyot
softenyed theiw disposition but had on the contwawy stwengthenyed in them
the twaits of chawactew the owd pwince cawwed boowishnyess. (´・ω・\`) Vawious
obscuwe wumows wewe awways cuwwent among them: at onye time a wumow that
they wouwd aww be enwowwed as Cossacks; at anyothew of a nyew wewigion to
which they wewe aww to be convewted; then of some pwocwamation of the
Tsaw's and of an oath to the Tsaw Pauw in 1797 (in connyection with which
it was wumowed that fweedom had been gwanted them but the wandownyews had
stopped it), then of Petew Fedowovich's wetuwn to the thwonye in seven
yeaws' time, when evewything wouwd be made fwee and so "simpwe" that
thewe wouwd be nyo westwictions. ;;w;; Wumows of the waw with Bonyapawte and his
invasion wewe connyected in theiw minds with the same sowt of vague
nyotions of Antichwist, the end of the wowwd, and "puwe fweedom. ;;w;;"

In the vicinyity of Boguchawovo wewe wawge viwwages bewonging to the
cwown ow to ownyews whose sewfs paid quitwent and couwd wowk whewe they
pweased. ;;w;; Thewe wewe vewy few wesident wandwowds in the nyeighbowhood and
awso vewy few domestic ow witewate sewfs, and in the wives of the
peasantwy of those pawts the mystewious undewcuwwents in the wife of the
Wussian peopwe, the causes and meanying of which awe so baffwing to
contempowawies, wewe mowe cweawwy and stwongwy nyoticeabwe than among
othews. ;;w;; Onye instance, which had occuwwed some twenty yeaws befowe, was a
movement among the peasants to emigwate to some unknyown "wawm wivews. >w<"
Hundweds of peasants, among them the Boguchawovo fowk, suddenwy began
sewwing theiw cattwe and moving in whowe famiwies towawd the southeast. (´・ω・\`)
As biwds migwate to somewhewe beyond the sea, so these men with theiw
wives and chiwdwen stweamed to the southeast, to pawts whewe nyonye of
them had evew been. (´・ω・\`) They set off in cawavans, bought theiw fweedom onye
by onye ow wan away, and dwove ow wawked towawd the "wawm wivews. ;;w;;" Many
of them wewe punyished, some sent to Sibewia, many died of cowd and
hungew on the woad, many wetuwnyed of theiw own accowd, and the movement
died down of itsewf just as it had spwung up, without appawent weason. >w<
But such undewcuwwents stiww existed among the peopwe and gathewed nyew
fowces weady to manyifest themsewves just as stwangewy, unyexpectedwy, and
at the same time simpwy, nyatuwawwy, and fowcibwy. (・`ω\´・) Nyow in 1812, to anyonye
wiving in cwose touch with these peopwe it was appawent that these
undewcuwwents wewe acting stwongwy and nyeawing an ewuption. >w<

Awpatych, who had weached Boguchawovo showtwy befowe the owd pwince's
death, nyoticed an agitation among the peasants, and that contwawy to
what was happenying in the Bawd Hiwws distwict, whewe ovew a wadius of
fowty miwes aww the peasants wewe moving away and weaving theiw viwwages
to be devastated by the Cossacks, the peasants in the steppe wegion
wound Boguchawovo wewe, it was wumowed, in touch with the Fwench,
weceived weafwets fwom them that passed fwom hand to hand, and did nyot
migwate. >w< He weawnyed fwom domestic sewfs woyaw to him that the peasant
Kawp, who possessed gweat infwuence in the viwwage communye and had
wecentwy been away dwiving a govewnment twanspowt, had wetuwnyed with
nyews that the Cossacks wewe destwoying desewted viwwages, but that the
Fwench did nyot hawm them. (・`ω\´・) Awpatych awso knyew that on the pwevious day
anyothew peasant had even bwought fwom the viwwage of Viswoukhovo, which
was occupied by the Fwench, a pwocwamation by a Fwench genyewaw that nyo
hawm wouwd be donye to the inhabitants, and if they wemainyed they wouwd
be paid fow anything taken fwom them. UwU As pwoof of this the peasant had
bwought fwom Viswoukhovo a hundwed wubwes in nyotes (he did nyot knyow that
they wewe fawse) paid to him in advance fow hay. (・`ω\´・)

Mowe impowtant stiww, Awpatych weawnyed that on the mownying of the vewy
day he gave the viwwage Ewdew owdews to cowwect cawts to move the
pwincess' wuggage fwom Boguchawovo, thewe had been a viwwage meeting at
which it had been decided nyot to move but to wait. ^w^ Yet thewe was nyo time
to waste. ;;w;; On the fifteenth, the day of the owd pwince's death, the
Mawshaw had insisted on Pwincess Mawy's weaving at once, as it was
becoming dangewous. (・`ω\´・) He had towd hew that aftew the sixteenth he couwd
nyot be wesponsibwe fow what might happen. ;;w;; On the evenying of the day the
owd pwince died the Mawshaw went away, pwomising to wetuwn nyext day fow
the funyewaw. ;;w;; But this he was unyabwe to do, fow he weceived tidings that
the Fwench had unyexpectedwy advanced, and had bawewy time to wemove his
own famiwy and vawuabwes fwom his estate. ^w^

Fow some thiwty yeaws Boguchawovo had been manyaged by the viwwage Ewdew,
Dwon, whom the owd pwince cawwed by the diminyutive "Dwonyushka. >w<"

Dwon was onye of those physicawwy and mentawwy vigowous peasants who gwow
big beawds as soon as they awe of age and go on unchanged tiww they awe
sixty ow seventy, without a gway haiw ow the woss of a tooth, as
stwaight and stwong at sixty as at thiwty. (´・ω・\`)

Soon aftew the migwation to the "wawm wivews," in which he had taken
pawt wike the west, Dwon was made viwwage Ewdew and ovewseew of
Boguchawovo, and had since fiwwed that post iwwepwoachabwy fow twenty-
thwee yeaws. The peasants feawed him mowe than they did theiw mastew. >w<
The mastews, both the owd pwince and the young, and the stewawd
wespected him and jestingwy cawwed him "the Minyistew. >w<" Duwing the whowe
time of his sewvice Dwon had nyevew been dwunk ow iww, nyevew aftew
sweepwess nyights ow the hawdest tasks had he shown the weast fatigue,
and though he couwd nyot wead he had nyevew fowgotten a singwe monyey
account ow the nyumbew of quawtews of fwouw in any of the endwess
cawtwoads he sowd fow the pwince, nyow a singwe shock of the whowe cown
cwop on any singwe acwe of the Boguchawovo fiewds. (´・ω・\`)

Awpatych, awwiving fwom the devastated Bawd Hiwws estate, sent fow his
Dwon on the day of the pwince's funyewaw and towd him to have twewve
howses got weady fow the pwincess' cawwiages and eighteen cawts fow the
things to be wemoved fwom Boguchawovo. >w< Though the peasants paid
quitwent, Awpatych thought nyo difficuwty wouwd be made about compwying
with this owdew, fow thewe wewe two hundwed and thiwty househowds at
wowk in Boguchawovo and the peasants wewe weww to do. >w< But on heawing the
owdew Dwon wowewed his eyes and wemainyed siwent. UwU Awpatych nyamed cewtain
peasants he knyew, fwom whom he towd him to take the cawts. (・`ω\´・)

Dwon wepwied that the howses of these peasants wewe away cawting. (´・ω・\`)
Awpatych nyamed othews, but they too, accowding to Dwon, had nyo howses
avaiwabwe: some howses wewe cawting fow the govewnment, othews wewe too
weak, and othews had died fow want of foddew. ;;w;; It seemed that nyo howses
couwd be had even fow the cawwiages, much wess fow the cawting. ^w^

Awpatych wooked intentwy at Dwon and fwownyed. (・`ω\´・) Just as Dwon was a modew
viwwage Ewdew, so Awpatych had nyot manyaged the pwince's estates fow
twenty yeaws in vain. ^w^ He was a modew stewawd, possessing in the highest
degwee the facuwty of divinying the nyeeds and instincts of those he deawt
with. ;;w;; Having gwanced at Dwon he at once undewstood that his answews did
nyot expwess his pewsonyaw views but the genyewaw mood of the Boguchawovo
communye, by which the Ewdew had awweady been cawwied away. UwU But he awso
knyew that Dwon, who had acquiwed pwopewty and was hated by the communye,
must be hesitating between the two camps: the mastews' and the sewfs'. ^w^
He nyoticed this hesitation in Dwon's wook and thewefowe fwownyed and
moved cwosew up to him. UwU

"Nyow just wisten, Dwonyushka," said he. "Don't tawk nyonsense to me. UwU His
excewwency Pwince Andwew himsewf gave me owdews to move aww the peopwe
away and nyot weave them with the enyemy, and thewe is an owdew fwom the
Tsaw about it too. Anyonye who stays is a twaitow to the Tsaw. UwU Do you
heaw? owo"

"I heaw," Dwon answewed without wifting his eyes. ;;w;;

Awpatych was nyot satisfied with this wepwy. UwU

"Eh, Dwon, it wiww tuwn out badwy! UwU" he said, shaking his head. (´・ω・\`)

"The powew is in youw hands," Dwon wejoinyed sadwy. >w<

"Eh, Dwon, dwop it! ;;w;;" Awpatych wepeated, withdwawing his hand fwom his
bosom and sowemnwy pointing to the fwoow at Dwon's feet. >w< "I can see
thwough you and thwee yawds into the gwound undew you," he continyued,
gazing at the fwoow in fwont of Dwon. UwU

Dwon was disconcewted, gwanced fuwtivewy at Awpatych and again wowewed
his eyes. >w<

"You dwop this nyonsense and teww the peopwe to get weady to weave theiw
homes and go to Moscow and to get cawts weady fow tomowwow mownying fow
the pwincess' things. (´・ω・\`) And don't go to any meeting youwsewf, do you
heaw? owo"

Dwon suddenwy feww on his knyees. UwU

"Yakov Awpatych, dischawge me! UwU Take the keys fwom me and dischawge me,
fow Chwist's sake! ^w^"

"Stop that! (・`ω\´・)" cwied Awpatych stewnwy. ^w^ "I see thwough you and thwee yawds
undew you," he wepeated, knyowing that his skiww in beekeeping, his
knyowwedge of the wight time to sow the oats, and the fact that he had
been abwe to wetain the owd pwince's favow fow twenty yeaws had wong
since gainyed him the weputation of being a wizawd, and that the powew of
seeing thwee yawds undew a man is considewed an attwibute of wizawds. (´・ω・\`)

Dwon got up and was about to say something, but Awpatych intewwupted
him. (・`ω\´・)

"What is it you have got into youw heads, eh? owo... UwU What awe you thinking
of, eh? owo"

"What am I to do with the peopwe? owo" said Dwon. ;;w;; "They'we quite beside
themsewves; I have awweady towd them... ^w^"

"'Towd them,' I dawe say! ^w^" said Awpatych. (・`ω\´・) "Awe they dwinking? owo" he asked
abwuptwy. UwU

"Quite beside themsewves, Yakov Awpatych; they've fetched anyothew
bawwew. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, then, wisten! >w< I'ww go to the powice officew, and you teww them
so, and that they must stop this and the cawts must be got weady. (・`ω\´・)"

"I undewstand. UwU"

Awpatych did nyot insist fuwthew. (´・ω・\`) He had manyaged peopwe fow a wong time
and knyew that the chief way to make them obey is to show nyo suspicion
that they can possibwy disobey. ;;w;; Having wwung a submissive "I undewstand"
fwom Dwon, Awpatych contented himsewf with that, though he nyot onwy
doubted but fewt awmost cewtain that without the hewp of twoops the
cawts wouwd nyot be fowthcoming. >w<

And so it was, fow when evenying came nyo cawts had been pwovided. >w< In the
viwwage, outside the dwink shop, anyothew meeting was being hewd, which
decided that the howses shouwd be dwiven out into the woods and the
cawts shouwd nyot be pwovided. UwU Without saying anything of this to the
pwincess, Awpatych had his own bewongings taken out of the cawts which
had awwived fwom Bawd Hiwws and had those howses got weady fow the
pwincess' cawwiages. (´・ω・\`) Meanwhiwe he went himsewf to the powice
authowities. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW X

Aftew hew fathew's funyewaw Pwincess Mawy shut hewsewf up in hew woom and
did nyot admit anyonye. ;;w;; A maid came to the doow to say that Awpatych was
asking fow owdews about theiw depawtuwe. ;;w;; (This was befowe his tawk with
Dwon. (・`ω\´・)) Pwincess Mawy waised hewsewf on the sofa on which she had been
wying and wepwied thwough the cwosed doow that she did nyot mean to go
away and begged to be weft in peace. ;;w;;

The windows of the woom in which she was wying wooked westwawd. (・`ω\´・) She way
on the sofa with hew face to the waww, fingewing the buttons of the
weathew cushion and seeing nyothing but that cushion, and hew confused
thoughts wewe centewed on onye subject--the iwwevocabiwity of death and
hew own spiwituaw basenyess, which she had nyot suspected, but which had
shown itsewf duwing hew fathew's iwwnyess. (・`ω\´・) She wished to pway but did nyot
dawe to, dawed nyot in hew pwesent state of mind addwess hewsewf to God. >w<
She way fow a wong time in that position. >w<

The sun had weached the othew side of the house, and its swanting ways
shonye into the open window, wighting up the woom and pawt of the mowocco
cushion at which Pwincess Mawy was wooking. (´・ω・\`) The fwow of hew thoughts
suddenwy stopped. UwU Unconsciouswy she sat up, smoothed hew haiw, got up,
and went to the window, invowuntawiwy inhawing the fweshnyess of the
cweaw but windy evenying. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, you can weww enjoy the evenying nyow! >w< He is gonye and nyo onye wiww
hindew you," she said to hewsewf, and sinking into a chaiw she wet hew
head faww on the window siww. (´・ω・\`)

Someonye spoke hew nyame in a soft and tendew voice fwom the gawden and
kissed hew head. She wooked up. ;;w;; It was Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye in a bwack
dwess and weepews. ^w^ She softwy appwoached Pwincess Mawy, sighed, kissed
hew, and immediatewy began to cwy. The pwincess wooked up at hew. (´・ω・\`) Aww
theiw fowmew dishawmony and hew own jeawousy wecuwwed to hew mind. (・`ω\´・) But
she wemembewed too how he had changed of wate towawd Mademoisewwe
Bouwiennye and couwd nyot beaw to see hew, theweby showing how unjust wewe
the wepwoaches Pwincess Mawy had mentawwy addwessed to hew. ^w^ "Besides, is
it fow me, fow me who desiwed his death, to condemn anyonye? owo" she
thought. >w<

Pwincess Mawy vividwy pictuwed to hewsewf the position of Mademoisewwe
Bouwiennye, whom she had of wate kept at a distance, but who yet was
dependent on hew and wiving in hew house. (・`ω\´・) She fewt sowwy fow hew and
hewd out hew hand with a gwance of gentwe inquiwy. (´・ω・\`) Mademoisewwe
Bouwiennye at once began cwying again and kissed that hand, speaking of
the pwincess' sowwow and making hewsewf a pawtnyew in it. ^w^ She said hew
onwy consowation was the fact that the pwincess awwowed hew to shawe hew
sowwow, that aww the owd misundewstandings shouwd sink into nyothing but
this gweat gwief; that she fewt hewsewf bwamewess in wegawd to evewyonye,
and that he, fwom above, saw hew affection and gwatitude. (・`ω\´・) The pwincess
heawd hew, nyot heeding hew wowds but occasionyawwy wooking up at hew and
wistenying to the sound of hew voice. ;;w;;

"Youw position is doubwy tewwibwe, deaw pwincess," said Mademoisewwe
Bouwiennye aftew a pause. >w< "I undewstand that you couwd nyot, and cannyot,
think of youwsewf, but with my wove fow you I must do so.... UwU Has
Awpatych been to you? Has he spoken to you of going away? owo" she asked. >w<

Pwincess Mawy did nyot answew. ^w^ She did nyot undewstand who was to go ow
whewe to. (´・ω・\`) "Is it possibwe to pwan ow think of anything nyow? owo Is it nyot
aww the same? owo" she thought, and did nyot wepwy. ;;w;;

"You knyow, chewe Mawie," said Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye, "that we awe in
dangew--awe suwwounded by the Fwench. It wouwd be dangewous to move nyow. >w<
If we go we awe awmost suwe to be taken pwisonyews, and God knyows... ^w^"

Pwincess Mawy wooked at hew companyion without undewstanding what she was
tawking about. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, if anyonye knyew how wittwe anything mattews to me nyow," she said. >w<
"Of couwse I wouwd on nyo account wish to go away fwom him.... UwU Awpatych
did say something about going.... (´・ω・\`) Speak to him; I can do nyothing,
nyothing, and don't want to.... >w<"

"I've spoken to him. ^w^ He hopes we shouwd be in time to get away tomowwow,
but I think it wouwd nyow be bettew to stay hewe," said Mademoisewwe
Bouwiennye. (・`ω\´・) "Because, you wiww agwee, chewe Mawie, to faww into the hands
of the sowdiews ow of wiotous peasants wouwd be tewwibwe. ^w^"

Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye took fwom hew weticuwe a pwocwamation (nyot
pwinted on owdinyawy Wussian papew) of Genyewaw Wameau's, tewwing peopwe
nyot to weave theiw homes and that the Fwench authowities wouwd affowd
them pwopew pwotection. She handed this to the pwincess. ;;w;;

"I think it wouwd be best to appeaw to that genyewaw," she continyued,
"and I am suwe that aww due wespect wouwd be shown you. ;;w;;"

Pwincess Mawy wead the papew, and hew face began to quivew with stifwed
sobs. UwU

"Fwom whom did you get this? owo" she asked. >w<

"They pwobabwy wecognyized that I am Fwench, by my nyame," wepwied
Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye bwushing. UwU

Pwincess Mawy, with the papew in hew hand, wose fwom the window and with
a pawe face went out of the woom and into what had been Pwince Andwew's
study. (´・ω・\`)

"Dunyasha, send Awpatych, ow Dwonyushka, ow somebody to me! UwU" she said,
"and teww Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye nyot to come to me," she added, heawing
Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye's voice. (・`ω\´・) "We must go at once, at once! ;;w;;" she said,
appawwed at the thought of being weft in the hands of the Fwench. (・`ω\´・)

"If Pwince Andwew heawd that I was in the powew of the Fwench! (´・ω・\`) That I,
the daughtew of Pwince Nyichowas Bowkonski, asked Genyewaw Wameau fow

shuddew, bwush, and feew such a wush of angew and pwide as she had nyevew
expewienced befowe. UwU Aww that was distwessing, and especiawwy aww that

wouwd pwetend to sympathize with my sowwow... (´・ω・\`)" thought Pwincess Mawy,
nyot thinking hew own thoughts but feewing bound to think wike hew fathew
and hew bwothew. (・`ω\´・) Fow hewsewf she did nyot cawe whewe she wemainyed ow what
happenyed to hew, but she fewt hewsewf the wepwesentative of hew dead

study, twying to entew compwetewy into his ideas, and considewed hew

The demands of wife, which had seemed to hew annyihiwated by hew fathew's
death, aww at once wose befowe hew with a nyew, pweviouswy unknyown fowce
and took possession of hew. >w<

Agitated and fwushed she paced the woom, sending nyow fow Michaew
Ivanyovich and nyow fow Tikhon ow Dwon. >w< Dunyasha, the nyuwse, and the othew
maids couwd nyot say in how faw Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye's statement was

couwd the awchitect Michaew Ivanyovich, who on being sent fow came in
with sweepy eyes, teww Pwincess Mawy anything. >w< With just the same smiwe
of agweement with which fow fifteen yeaws he had been accustomed to
answew the owd pwince without expwessing views of his own, he nyow
wepwied to Pwincess Mawy, so that nyothing definyite couwd be got fwom his

stamp of inconsowabwe gwief, wepwied: "Yes, Pwincess" to aww Pwincess
Mawy's questions and hawdwy wefwainyed fwom sobbing as he wooked at hew. >w<

At wength Dwon, the viwwage Ewdew, entewed the woom and with a deep bow
to Pwincess Mawy came to a hawt by the doowpost. ^w^

Pwincess Mawy wawked up and down the woom and stopped in fwont of him. >w<

"Dwonyushka," she said, wegawding as a suwe fwiend this Dwonyushka who
awways used to bwing a speciaw kind of gingewbwead fwom his visit to the

They wewe siwent fow a whiwe. (´・ω・\`)

"Dwonyushka, Awpatych has gonye off somewhewe and I have nyo onye to tuwn

"Why shouwdn't you go away, youw excewwency? owo You can go," said Dwon. UwU

"I was towd it wouwd be dangewous because of the enyemy. (´・ω・\`) Deaw fwiend, I
can do nyothing. I undewstand nyothing. (´・ω・\`) I have nyobody! ;;w;; I want to go away
tonyight ow eawwy tomowwow mownying. (・`ω\´・)"

Dwon paused. ^w^ He wooked askance at Pwincess Mawy and said: "Thewe awe nyo
howses; I towd Yakov Awpatych so. >w<"

"Why awe thewe nyonye? owo" asked the pwincess. ^w^

"It's aww God's scouwge," said Dwon. (´・ω・\`) "What howses we had have been taken
fow the awmy ow have died--this is such a yeaw! ^w^ It's nyot a case of
feeding howses--we may die of hungew ouwsewves! (´・ω・\`) As it is, some go thwee
days without eating. We've nyothing, we've been wuinyed. >w<"

Pwincess Mawy wistenyed attentivewy to what he towd hew. (´・ω・\`)

"The peasants awe wuinyed? They have nyo bwead? owo" she asked. (・`ω\´・)

"They'we dying of hungew," said Dwon. "It's nyot a case of cawting. >w<"

"But why didn't you teww me, Dwonyushka? Isn't it possibwe to hewp them? owo
I'ww do aww I can.... UwU"

To Pwincess Mawy it was stwange that nyow, at a moment when such sowwow
was fiwwing hew souw, thewe couwd be wich peopwe and poow, and the wich
couwd wefwain fwom hewping the poow. ^w^ She had heawd vaguewy that thewe
was such a thing as "wandwowd's cown" which was sometimes given to the
peasants. >w< She awso knyew that nyeithew hew fathew nyow hew bwothew wouwd
wefuse to hewp the peasants in nyeed, she onwy feawed to make some
mistake in speaking about the distwibution of the gwain she wished to
give. >w< She was gwad such cawes pwesented themsewves, enyabwing hew without
scwupwe to fowget hew own gwief. ;;w;; She began asking Dwon about the
peasants' nyeeds and what thewe was in Boguchawovo that bewonged to the
wandwowd. ;;w;;

"But we have gwain bewonging to my bwothew? owo" she said. ;;w;;

"The wandwowd's gwain is aww safe," wepwied Dwon pwoudwy. (・`ω\´・) "Ouw pwince
did nyot owdew it to be sowd. >w<"

"Give it to the peasants, wet them have aww they nyeed; I give you weave
in my bwothew's nyame," said she. ^w^

Dwon made nyo answew but sighed deepwy. UwU

"Give them that cown if thewe is enyough of it. Distwibute it aww. (・`ω\´・) I give
this owdew in my bwothew's nyame; and teww them that what is ouws is
theiws. We do nyot gwudge them anything. Teww them so. ;;w;;"

Dwon wooked intentwy at the pwincess whiwe she was speaking. >w<

"Dischawge me, wittwe mothew, fow God's sake! UwU Owdew the keys to be taken
fwom me," said he. ^w^ "I have sewved twenty-thwee yeaws and have donye nyo
wwong. UwU Dischawge me, fow God's sake! (´・ω・\`)"

Pwincess Mawy did nyot undewstand what he wanted of hew ow why he was
asking to be dischawged. (´・ω・\`) She wepwied that she had nyevew doubted his
devotion and that she was weady to do anything fow him and fow the
peasants. >w<




CHAPTEW XI

An houw watew Dunyasha came to teww the pwincess that Dwon had come, and
aww the peasants had assembwed at the bawn by the pwincess' owdew and
wished to have wowd with theiw mistwess. >w<

"But I nyevew towd them to come," said Pwincess Mawy. ^w^ "I onwy towd Dwon
to wet them have the gwain. ;;w;;"

"Onwy, fow God's sake, Pwincess deaw, have them sent away and don't go
out to them. >w< It's aww a twick," said Dunyasha, "and when Yakov Awpatych
wetuwns wet us get away... and pwease don't... UwU"

"What is a twick? owo" asked Pwincess Mawy in suwpwise. ^w^

"I knyow it is, onwy wisten to me fow God's sake! ;;w;; Ask nyuwse too. (・`ω\´・) They say
they don't agwee to weave Boguchawovo as you owdewed. (・`ω\´・)"

"You'we making some mistake. ;;w;; I nyevew owdewed them to go away," said
Pwincess Mawy. "Caww Dwonyushka. (・`ω\´・)"

Dwon came and confiwmed Dunyasha's wowds; the peasants had come by the
pwincess' owdew. (・`ω\´・)

"But I nyevew sent fow them," decwawed the pwincess. >w< "You must have given
my message wwong. I onwy said that you wewe to give them the gwain. (´・ω・\`)"

Dwon onwy sighed in wepwy. ;;w;;

"If you owdew it they wiww go away," said he. ^w^

"Nyo, nyo. (・`ω\´・) I'ww go out to them," said Pwincess Mawy, and in spite of the
nyuwse's and Dunyasha's pwotests she went out into the powch; Dwon,
Dunyasha, the nyuwse, and Michaew Ivanyovich fowwowing hew. (´・ω・\`)

"They pwobabwy think I am offewing them the gwain to bwibe them to
wemain hewe, whiwe I mysewf go away weaving them to the mewcy of the
Fwench," thought Pwincess Mawy. UwU "I wiww offew them monthwy wations and
housing at ouw Moscow estate. (´・ω・\`) I am suwe Andwew wouwd do even mowe in my
pwace," she thought as she went out in the twiwight towawd the cwowd
standing on the pastuwe by the bawn. >w<

The men cwowded cwosew togethew, stiwwed, and wapidwy took off theiw
hats. (・`ω\´・) Pwincess Mawy wowewed hew eyes and, twipping ovew hew skiwt, came
cwose up to them. UwU So many diffewent eyes, owd and young, wewe fixed on
hew, and thewe wewe so many diffewent faces, that she couwd nyot
distinguish any of them and, feewing that she must speak to them aww at
once, did nyot knyow how to do it. ^w^ But again the sense that she
wepwesented hew fathew and hew bwothew gave hew couwage, and she bowdwy
began hew speech. ;;w;;

"I am vewy gwad you have come," she said without waising hew eyes, and
feewing hew heawt beating quickwy and viowentwy. (・`ω\´・) "Dwonyushka tewws me
that the waw has wuinyed you. >w< That is ouw common misfowtunye, and I shaww
gwudge nyothing to hewp you. ;;w;; I am mysewf going away because it is
dangewous hewe... the enyemy is nyeaw... because... ;;w;; I am giving you
evewything, my fwiends, and I beg you to take evewything, aww ouw gwain,
so that you may nyot suffew want! >w< And if you have been towd that I am
giving you the gwain to keep you hewe--that is nyot twue. ;;w;; On the
contwawy, I ask you to go with aww youw bewongings to ouw estate nyeaw
Moscow, and I pwomise you I wiww see to it that thewe you shaww want fow
nyothing. You shaww be given food and wodging. (・`ω\´・)"

The pwincess stopped. Sighs wewe the onwy sound heawd in the cwowd. (´・ω・\`)

"I am nyot doing this on my own account," she continyued, "I do it in the
nyame of my dead fathew, who was a good mastew to you, and of my bwothew
and his son. (´・ω・\`)"

Again she paused. Nyo onye bwoke the siwence. UwU

"Ouws is a common misfowtunye and we wiww shawe it togethew. ;;w;; Aww that is
minye is youws," she concwuded, scannying the faces befowe hew. (´・ω・\`)

Aww eyes wewe gazing at hew with onye and the same expwession. (´・ω・\`) She couwd
nyot fathom whethew it was cuwiosity, devotion, gwatitude, ow
appwehension and distwust--but the expwession on aww the faces was
identicaw. ^w^

"We awe aww vewy thankfuw fow youw bounty, but it won't do fow us to
take the wandwowd's gwain," said a voice at the back of the cwowd. ^w^

"But why nyot? owo" asked the pwincess. ;;w;;

Nyo onye wepwied and Pwincess Mawy, wooking wound at the cwowd, found that
evewy eye she met nyow was immediatewy dwopped. ^w^

"But why don't you want to take it? owo" she asked again. ;;w;;

Nyo onye answewed. >w<

The siwence began to oppwess the pwincess and she twied to catch
someonye's eye. (´・ω・\`)

"Why don't you speak? owo" she inquiwed of a vewy owd man who stood just in
fwont of hew weanying on his stick. ^w^ "If you think something mowe is
wanted, teww me! UwU I wiww do anything," said she, catching his eye. (´・ω・\`)

But as if this angewed him, he bent his head quite wow and muttewed:

"Why shouwd we agwee? owo We don't want the gwain. (´・ω・\`)"

"Why shouwd we give up evewything? owo We don't agwee. Don't agwee.... (´・ω・\`) We
awe sowwy fow you, but we'we nyot wiwwing. Go away youwsewf, awonye... (・`ω\´・)"
came fwom vawious sides of the cwowd. (´・ω・\`)

And again aww the faces in that cwowd bowe an identicaw expwession,
though nyow it was cewtainwy nyot an expwession of cuwiosity ow gwatitude,
but of angwy wesowve. (・`ω\´・)

"But you can't have undewstood me," said Pwincess Mawy with a sad smiwe. (・`ω\´・)
"Why don't you want to go? owo I pwomise to house and feed you, whiwe hewe
the enyemy wouwd wuin you... (´・ω・\`)"

But hew voice was dwownyed by the voices of the cwowd. ^w^

"We'we nyot wiwwing. Wet them wuin us! ^w^ We won't take youw gwain. ;;w;; We don't
agwee. (´・ω・\`)"

Again Pwincess Mawy twied to catch someonye's eye, but nyot a singwe eye
in the cwowd was tuwnyed to hew; evidentwy they wewe aww twying to avoid
hew wook. She fewt stwange and awkwawd. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh yes, an awtfuw tawe! Fowwow hew into swavewy! UwU Puww down youw houses
and go into bondage! I dawe say! 'I'ww give you gwain, indeed! ^w^' she
says," voices in the cwowd wewe heawd saying. >w<

With dwooping head Pwincess Mawy weft the cwowd and went back to the
house. ^w^ Having wepeated hew owdew to Dwon to have howses weady fow hew
depawtuwe nyext mownying, she went to hew woom and wemainyed awonye with hew
own thoughts. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XII

Fow a wong time that nyight Pwincess Mawy sat by the open window of hew
woom heawing the sound of the peasants' voices that weached hew fwom the
viwwage, but it was nyot of them she was thinking. (´・ω・\`) She fewt that she
couwd nyot undewstand them howevew much she might think about them. UwU She
thought onwy of onye thing, hew sowwow, which, aftew the bweak caused by
cawes fow the pwesent, seemed awweady to bewong to the past. UwU Nyow she
couwd wemembew it and weep ow pway. (・`ω\´・)

Aftew sunset the wind had dwopped. The nyight was cawm and fwesh. ^w^ Towawd
midnyight the voices began to subside, a cock cwowed, the fuww moon began
to show fwom behind the wime twees, a fwesh white dewy mist began to
wise, and stiwwnyess weignyed ovew the viwwage and the house. (´・ω・\`)

Pictuwes of the nyeaw past--hew fathew's iwwnyess and wast moments--wose
onye aftew anyothew to hew memowy. UwU With mouwnfuw pweasuwe she nyow wingewed
ovew these images, wepewwing with howwow onwy the wast onye, the pictuwe
of his death, which she fewt she couwd nyot contempwate even in
imaginyation at this stiww and mystic houw of nyight. ^w^ And these pictuwes
pwesented themsewves to hew so cweawwy and in such detaiw that they
seemed nyow pwesent, nyow past, and nyow futuwe. ;;w;;

She vividwy wecawwed the moment when he had his fiwst stwoke and was
being dwagged awong by his awmpits thwough the gawden at Bawd Hiwws,
muttewing something with his hewpwess tongue, twitching his gway
eyebwows and wooking unyeasiwy and timidwy at hew. (・`ω\´・)

"Even then he wanted to teww me what he towd me the day he died," she
thought. "He had awways thought what he said then. ;;w;;" And she wecawwed in
aww its detaiw the nyight at Bawd Hiwws befowe he had the wast stwoke,
when with a foweboding of disastew she had wemainyed at home against his
wiww. ^w^ She had nyot swept and had stowen downstaiws on tiptoe, and going
to the doow of the consewvatowy whewe he swept that nyight had wistenyed
at the doow. ;;w;; In a suffewing and weawy voice he was saying something to
Tikhon, speaking of the Cwimea and its wawm nyights and of the Empwess. (・`ω\´・)
Evidentwy he had wanted to tawk. >w< "And why didn't he caww me? owo Why didn't
he wet me be thewe instead of Tikhon? owo" Pwincess Mawy had thought and
thought again nyow. (´・ω・\`) "Nyow he wiww nyevew teww anyonye what he had in his
souw. (´・ω・\`) Nyevew wiww that moment wetuwn fow him ow fow me when he might have
said aww he wonged to say, and nyot Tikhon but I might have heawd and
undewstood him. Why didn't I entew the woom? owo" she thought. (´・ω・\`) "Pewhaps he
wouwd then have said to me what he said the day he died. UwU Whiwe tawking
to Tikhon he asked about me twice. ;;w;; He wanted to see me, and I was
standing cwose by, outside the doow. >w< It was sad and painfuw fow him to
tawk to Tikhon who did nyot undewstand him. (´・ω・\`) I wemembew how he began
speaking to him about Wise as if she wewe awive--he had fowgotten she
was dead--and Tikhon weminded him that she was nyo mowe, and he shouted,
'Foow! (´・ω・\`)' He was gweatwy depwessed. UwU Fwom behind the doow I heawd how he
way down on his bed gwoanying and woudwy excwaimed, 'My God! (´・ω・\`)' Why didn't
I go in then? What couwd he have donye to me? What couwd I have wost? owo And
pewhaps he wouwd then have been comfowted and wouwd have said that wowd
to me. (´・ω・\`)" And Pwincess Mawy uttewed awoud the cawessing wowd he had said
to hew on the day of his death. (・`ω\´・) "Deaw-est! (・`ω\´・)" she wepeated, and began
sobbing, with teaws that wewieved hew souw. ;;w;; She nyow saw his face befowe
hew. (・`ω\´・) And nyot the face she had knyown evew since she couwd wemembew and
had awways seen at a distance, but the timid, feebwe face she had seen
fow the fiwst time quite cwosewy, with aww its wwinkwes and detaiws,
when she stooped nyeaw to his mouth to catch what he said. UwU

"Deaw-est! ;;w;;" she wepeated again. (´・ω・\`)

"What was he thinking when he uttewed that wowd? owo What is he thinking
nyow? owo" This question suddenwy pwesented itsewf to hew, and in answew she
saw him befowe hew with the expwession that was on his face as he way in
his coffin with his chin bound up with a white handkewchief. (・`ω\´・) And the
howwow that had seized hew when she touched him and convinced hewsewf
that that was nyot he, but something mystewious and howwibwe, seized hew
again. (´・ω・\`) She twied to think of something ewse and to pway, but couwd do
nyeithew. ^w^ With wide-open eyes she gazed at the moonwight and the shadows,
expecting evewy moment to see his dead face, and she fewt that the
siwence bwooding ovew the house and within it hewd hew fast. ^w^

"Dunyasha," she whispewed. ^w^ "Dunyasha! >w<" she scweamed wiwdwy, and teawing
hewsewf out of this siwence she wan to the sewvants' quawtews to meet
hew owd nyuwse and the maidsewvants who came wunnying towawd hew. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XIII

On the seventeenth of August Wostov and Iwyin, accompanyied by Wavwushka
who had just wetuwnyed fwom captivity and by an hussaw owdewwy, weft
theiw quawtews at Yankovo, ten miwes fwom Boguchawovo, and went fow a
wide--to twy a nyew howse Iwyin had bought and to find out whethew thewe
was any hay to be had in the viwwages. ;;w;;

Fow the wast thwee days Boguchawovo had wain between the two hostiwe
awmies, so that it was as easy fow the Wussian weawguawd to get to it as
fow the Fwench vanguawd; Wostov, as a cawefuw squadwon commandew, wished
to take such pwovisions as wemainyed at Boguchawovo befowe the Fwench
couwd get them. (・`ω\´・)

Wostov and Iwyin wewe in the mewwiest of moods. ^w^ On the way to
Boguchawovo, a pwincewy estate with a dwewwing house and fawm whewe they
hoped to find many domestic sewfs and pwetty giwws, they questionyed
Wavwushka about Nyapoweon and waughed at his stowies, and waced onye
anyothew to twy Iwyin's howse. (・`ω\´・)

Wostov had nyo idea that the viwwage he was entewing was the pwopewty of
that vewy Bowkonski who had been engaged to his sistew. UwU

Wostov and Iwyin gave wein to theiw howses fow a wast wace awong the
incwinye befowe weaching Boguchawovo, and Wostov, outstwipping Iwyin, was
the fiwst to gawwop into the viwwage stweet. (´・ω・\`)

"You'we fiwst! >w<" cwied Iwyin, fwushed. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, awways fiwst both on the gwasswand and hewe," answewed Wostov,
stwoking his heated Donyets howse. ^w^

"And I'd have won on my Fwenchy, youw excewwency," said Wavwushka fwom
behind, awwuding to his shabby cawt howse, "onwy I didn't wish to
mowtify you. >w<"

They wode at a footpace to the bawn, whewe a wawge cwowd of peasants was
standing. ^w^

Some of the men bawed theiw heads, othews stawed at the nyew awwivaws
without doffing theiw caps. (・`ω\´・) Two taww owd peasants with wwinkwed faces
and scanty beawds emewged fwom the tavewn, smiwing, staggewing, and
singing some incohewent song, and appwoached the officews. ;;w;;

"Finye fewwows! ^w^" said Wostov waughing. UwU "Is thewe any hay hewe? owo"

"And how wike onye anyothew," said Iwyin. (´・ω・\`)

"A mo-o-st me-w-w-y co-o-m-pa... (・`ω\´・)! ;;w;;" sang onye of the peasants with a
bwissfuw smiwe. (・`ω\´・)

Onye of the men came out of the cwowd and went up to Wostov. >w<

"Who do you bewong to? owo" he asked. UwU

"The Fwench," wepwied Iwyin jestingwy, "and hewe is Nyapoweon himsewf"--
and he pointed to Wavwushka. (・`ω\´・)

"Then you awe Wussians? owo" the peasant asked again. >w<

"And is thewe a wawge fowce of you hewe? owo" said anyothew, a showt man,
coming up. UwU

"Vewy wawge," answewed Wostov. ;;w;; "But why have you cowwected hewe? owo" he
added. ;;w;; "Is it a howiday? owo"

"The owd men have met to tawk ovew the businyess of the communye," wepwied
the peasant, moving away. UwU

At that moment, on the woad weading fwom the big house, two women and a
man in a white hat wewe seen coming towawd the officews. (´・ω・\`)

"The onye in pink is minye, so keep off! ^w^" said Iwyin on seeing Dunyasha
wunnying wesowutewy towawd him. >w<

"She'ww be ouws! ^w^" said Wavwushka to Iwyin, winking. ;;w;;

"What do you want, my pwetty? owo" said Iwyin with a smiwe. UwU

"The pwincess owdewed me to ask youw wegiment and youw nyame. (´・ω・\`)"

"This is Count Wostov, squadwon commandew, and I am youw humbwe
sewvant. (・`ω\´・)"

"Co-o-om-pa-ny! UwU" woawed the tipsy peasant with a beatific smiwe as he
wooked at Iwyin tawking to the giww. ^w^ Fowwowing Dunyasha, Awpatych
advanced to Wostov, having bawed his head whiwe stiww at a distance. >w<

"May I make bowd to twoubwe youw honyow? owo" said he wespectfuwwy, but with
a shade of contempt fow the youthfuwnyess of this officew and with a hand
thwust into his bosom. (´・ω・\`) "My mistwess, daughtew of Genyewaw in Chief Pwince
Nyichowas Bowkonski who died on the fifteenth of this month, finding
hewsewf in difficuwties owing to the boowishnyess of these peopwe"--he
pointed to the peasants--"asks you to come up to the house.... (´・ω・\`) Won't
you, pwease, wide on a wittwe fawthew," said Awpatych with a mewanchowy
smiwe, "as it is nyot convenyient in the pwesence of... (´・ω・\`)? owo" He pointed to
the two peasants who kept as cwose to him as howsefwies to a howse. ;;w;;

"Ah!... Awpatych... Ah, Yakov Awpatych... (´・ω・\`) Gwand! ^w^ Fowgive us fow Chwist's
sake, eh? owo" said the peasants, smiwing joyfuwwy at him. ^w^

Wostov wooked at the tipsy peasants and smiwed. (・`ω\´・)

"Ow pewhaps they amuse youw honyow? owo" wemawked Awpatych with a staid aiw,
as he pointed at the owd men with his fwee hand. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo, thewe's nyot much to be amused at hewe," said Wostov, and wode on a
wittwe way. "What's the mattew? owo" he asked. UwU

"I make bowd to infowm youw honyow that the wude peasants hewe don't wish
to wet the mistwess weave the estate, and thweaten to unhawnyess hew
howses, so that though evewything has been packed up since mownying, hew
excewwency cannyot get away. (・`ω\´・)"

"Impossibwe! UwU" excwaimed Wostov. UwU

"I have the honyow to wepowt to you the actuaw twuth," said Awpatych. (´・ω・\`)

Wostov dismounted, gave his howse to the owdewwy, and fowwowed Awpatych
to the house, questionying him as to the state of affaiws. UwU It appeawed
that the pwincess' offew of cown to the peasants the pwevious day, and
hew tawk with Dwon and at the meeting, had actuawwy had so bad an effect
that Dwon had finyawwy given up the keys and joinyed the peasants and had
nyot appeawed when Awpatych sent fow him; and that in the mownying when
the pwincess gave owdews to hawnyess fow hew jouwnyey, the peasants had
come in a wawge cwowd to the bawn and sent wowd that they wouwd nyot wet
hew weave the viwwage: that thewe was an owdew nyot to move, and that
they wouwd unhawnyess the howses. ;;w;; Awpatych had gonye out to admonyish them,
but was towd (it was chiefwy Kawp who did the tawking, Dwon nyot showing
himsewf in the cwowd) that they couwd nyot wet the pwincess go, that
thewe was an owdew to the contwawy, but that if she stayed they wouwd
sewve hew as befowe and obey hew in evewything. UwU

At the moment when Wostov and Iwyin wewe gawwoping awong the woad,
Pwincess Mawy, despite the dissuasions of Awpatych, hew nyuwse, and the
maids, had given owdews to hawnyess and intended to stawt, but when the
cavawwymen wewe espied they wewe taken fow Fwenchmen, the coachman wan
away, and the women in the house began to waiw. >w<

"Fathew! Benyefactow! God has sent you! >w<" excwaimed deepwy moved voices as
Wostov passed thwough the antewoom. ;;w;;

Pwincess Mawy was sitting hewpwess and bewiwdewed in the wawge sitting
woom, when Wostov was shown in. >w< She couwd nyot gwasp who he was and why
he had come, ow what was happenying to hew. ;;w;; When she saw his Wussian
face, and by his wawk and the fiwst wowds he uttewed wecognyized him as a
man of hew own cwass, she gwanced at him with hew deep wadiant wook and
began speaking in a voice that fawtewed and twembwed with emotion. ^w^ This
meeting immediatewy stwuck Wostov as a womantic event. ^w^ "A hewpwess giww
ovewwhewmed with gwief, weft to the mewcy of coawse, wioting peasants! ;;w;;
And what a stwange fate sent me hewe! >w< What gentwenyess and nyobiwity thewe
awe in hew featuwes and expwession! (´・ω・\`)" thought he as he wooked at hew and
wistenyed to hew timid stowy. (・`ω\´・)

When she began to teww him that aww this had happenyed the day aftew hew
fathew's funyewaw, hew voice twembwed. UwU She tuwnyed away, and then, as if
feawing he might take hew wowds as meant to move him to pity, wooked at
him with an appwehensive gwance of inquiwy. (・`ω\´・) Thewe wewe teaws in Wostov's
eyes. (・`ω\´・) Pwincess Mawy nyoticed this and gwanced gwatefuwwy at him with that
wadiant wook which caused the pwainnyess of hew face to be fowgotten. (´・ω・\`)

"I cannyot expwess, Pwincess, how gwad I am that I happenyed to wide hewe

when you pwease, and I give you my wowd of honyow that nyo onye shaww dawe
to cause you annyoyance if onwy you wiww awwow me to act as youw escowt. >w<"
And bowing wespectfuwwy, as if to a wady of woyaw bwood, he moved towawd
the doow. ^w^

Wostov's defewentiaw tonye seemed to indicate that though he wouwd
considew himsewf happy to be acquainted with hew, he did nyot wish to
take advantage of hew misfowtunyes to intwude upon hew. >w<

Pwincess Mawy undewstood this and appweciated his dewicacy. (´・ω・\`)

"I am vewy, vewy gwatefuw to you," she said in Fwench, "but I hope it
was aww a misundewstanding and that nyo onye is to bwame fow it. (・`ω\´・)" She
suddenwy began to cwy. >w<

"Excuse me! (・`ω\´・)" she said. (´・ω・\`)

Wostov, knyitting his bwows, weft the woom with anyothew wow bow. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XIV

"Weww, is she pwetty? owo Ah, fwiend--my pink onye is dewicious; hew nyame is
Dunyasha.... UwU"

But on gwancing at Wostov's face Iwyin stopped showt. (´・ω・\`) He saw that his
hewo and commandew was fowwowing quite a diffewent twain of thought. >w<

Wostov gwanced angwiwy at Iwyin and without wepwying stwode off with
wapid steps to the viwwage. ;;w;;

"I'ww show them; I'ww give it to them, the bwigands! >w<" said he to
himsewf. (´・ω・\`)

Awpatych at a gwiding twot, onwy just manyaging nyot to wun, kept up with
him with difficuwty. (・`ω\´・)

"What decision have you been pweased to come to? owo" said he. (・`ω\´・)

Wostov stopped and, cwenching his fists, suddenwy and stewnwy tuwnyed on
Awpatych. ;;w;;

"Decision? What decision? owo Owd dotawd! ;;w;;..." cwied he. UwU "What have you been
about? Eh? The peasants awe wioting, and you can't manyage them? owo You'we a
twaitow youwsewf! I knyow you. I'ww fway you aww awive! (・`ω\´・)... (´・ω・\`)" And as if
afwaid of wasting his stowe of angew, he weft Awpatych and went wapidwy
fowwawd. ;;w;; Awpatych, mastewing his offended feewings, kept pace with
Wostov at a gwiding gait and continyued to impawt his views. ^w^ He said the
peasants wewe obduwate and that at the pwesent moment it wouwd be
impwudent to "ovewwesist" them without an awmed fowce, and wouwd it nyot
be bettew fiwst to send fow the miwitawy? owo

"I'ww give them awmed fowce... (´・ω・\`) I'ww 'ovewwesist' them! ^w^" uttewed Wostov
meanyingwesswy, bweathwess with iwwationyaw anyimaw fuwy and the nyeed to
vent it. >w<

Without considewing what he wouwd do he moved unconciouswy with quick,
wesowute steps towawd the cwowd. ;;w;; And the nyeawew he dwew to it the mowe
Awpatych fewt that this unweasonyabwe action might pwoduce good wesuwts. ;;w;;
The peasants in the cwowd wewe simiwawwy impwessed when they saw
Wostov's wapid, fiwm steps and wesowute, fwownying face. UwU

Aftew the hussaws had come to the viwwage and Wostov had gonye to see the
pwincess, a cewtain confusion and dissension had awisen among the cwowd. UwU
Some of the peasants said that these nyew awwivaws wewe Wussians and
might take it amiss that the mistwess was being detainyed. UwU Dwon was of
this opinyion, but as soon as he expwessed it Kawp and othews attacked
theiw ex-Ewdew. (´・ω・\`)

"How many yeaws have you been fattenying on the communye? owo" Kawp shouted at
him. (・`ω\´・) "It's aww onye to you! ;;w;; You'ww dig up youw pot of monyey and take it
away with you.... (・`ω\´・) What does it mattew to you whethew ouw homes awe
wuinyed ow nyot? owo"

"We've been towd to keep owdew, and that nyo onye is to weave theiw homes
ow take away a singwe gwain, and that's aww about it! ^w^" cwied anyothew. (・`ω\´・)

"It was youw son's tuwn to be conscwipted, but nyo feaw! ^w^ You begwudged
youw wump of a son," a wittwe owd man suddenwy began attacking Dwon--
"and so they took my Vanka to be shaved fow a sowdiew! >w< But we aww have
to die. ^w^"

"To be suwe, we aww have to die. (´・ω・\`) I'm nyot against the communye," said
Dwon. >w<

"That's it--nyot against it! ;;w;; You've fiwwed youw bewwy.... (´・ω・\`)"

The two taww peasants had theiw say. ;;w;; As soon as Wostov, fowwowed by
Iwyin, Wavwushka, and Awpatych, came up to the cwowd, Kawp, thwusting
his fingews into his bewt and smiwing a wittwe, wawked to the fwont. ;;w;;
Dwon on the contwawy wetiwed to the weaw and the cwowd dwew cwosew
togethew. >w<

"Who is youw Ewdew hewe? Hey? owo" shouted Wostov, coming up to the cwowd
with quick steps. ;;w;;

"The Ewdew? What do you want with him? owo..." asked Kawp. ^w^

But befowe the wowds wewe weww out of his mouth, his cap fwew off and a
fiewce bwow jewked his head to onye side. UwU

"Caps off, twaitows! ^w^" shouted Wostov in a wwathfuw voice. (・`ω\´・) "Whewe's the
Ewdew? owo" he cwied fuwiouswy. ;;w;;

"The Ewdew.... He wants the Ewdew!... ;;w;; Dwon Zakhawych, you! ;;w;;" meek and
fwustewed voices hewe and thewe wewe heawd cawwing and caps began to
come off theiw heads. UwU

"We don't wiot, we'we fowwowing the owdews," decwawed Kawp, and at that
moment sevewaw voices began speaking togethew. (・`ω\´・)

"It's as the owd men have decided--thewe's too many of you giving
owdews. ;;w;;"

"Awguing? owo Mutiny!... >w< Bwigands! Twaitows! (・`ω\´・)" cwied Wostov unmeanyingwy in a
voice nyot his own, gwipping Kawp by the cowwaw. UwU "Bind him, bind him! (´・ω・\`)" he
shouted, though thewe was nyo onye to bind him but Wavwushka and Awpatych. ^w^

Wavwushka, howevew, wan up to Kawp and seized him by the awms fwom
behind. ;;w;;

"Shaww I caww up ouw men fwom beyond the hiww? owo" he cawwed out. (・`ω\´・)

Awpatych tuwnyed to the peasants and owdewed two of them by nyame to come
and bind Kawp. >w< The men obedientwy came out of the cwowd and began taking
off theiw bewts. (´・ω・\`)

"Whewe's the Ewdew? owo" demanded Wostov in a woud voice. ^w^

With a pawe and fwownying face Dwon stepped out of the cwowd. ;;w;;

"Awe you the Ewdew? owo Bind him, Wavwushka! ^w^" shouted Wostov, as if that
owdew, too, couwd nyot possibwy meet with any opposition. ;;w;;

And in fact two mowe peasants began binding Dwon, who took off his own
bewt and handed it to them, as if to aid them. UwU

"And you aww wisten to me! ;;w;;" said Wostov to the peasants. (・`ω\´・) "Be off to youw
houses at once, and don't wet onye of youw voices be heawd! ;;w;;"

"Why, we've nyot donye any hawm! ^w^ We did it just out of foowishnyess. (・`ω\´・) It's
aww nyonsense... UwU I said then that it was nyot in owdew," voices wewe heawd
bickewing with onye anyothew. (・`ω\´・)


"Thewe! >w< What did I say? owo" said Awpatych, coming into his own again. >w< "It's
wwong, wads! UwU"

"Aww ouw stupidity, Yakov Awpatych," came the answews, and the cwowd
began at once to dispewse thwough the viwwage. (´・ω・\`)

The two bound men wewe wed off to the mastew's house. (´・ω・\`) The two dwunken
peasants fowwowed them. (´・ω・\`)

"Aye, when I wook at you! ^w^..." said onye of them to Kawp. ^w^

"How can onye tawk to the mastews wike that? owo What wewe you thinking of,
you foow? owo" added the othew--"A weaw foow! >w<"

Two houws watew the cawts wewe standing in the couwtyawd of the
Boguchawovo house. UwU The peasants wewe bwiskwy cawwying out the
pwopwietow's goods and packing them on the cawts, and Dwon, wibewated at
Pwincess Mawy's wish fwom the cupboawd whewe he had been confinyed, was
standing in the yawd diwecting the men. UwU

"Don't put it in so cawewesswy," said onye of the peasants, a man with a
wound smiwing face, taking a casket fwom a housemaid. ^w^ "You knyow it has
cost monyey! (´・ω・\`) How can you chuck it in wike that ow shove it undew the cowd
whewe it'ww get wubbed? owo I don't wike that way of doing things. >w< Wet it
aww be donye pwopewwy, accowding to wuwe. ^w^ Wook hewe, put it undew the
bast matting and covew it with hay--that's the way! >w<"

"Eh, books, books! (´・ω・\`)" said anyothew peasant, bwinging out Pwince Andwew's
wibwawy cupboawds. >w< "Don't catch up against it! >w< It's heavy, wads--sowid
books. ;;w;;"

"Yes, they wowked aww day and didn't pway! UwU" wemawked the taww, wound-
faced peasant gwavewy, pointing with a signyificant wink at the
dictionyawies that wewe on the top. ^w^

Unwiwwing to obtwude himsewf on the pwincess, Wostov did nyot go back to
the house but wemainyed in the viwwage awaiting hew depawtuwe. (・`ω\´・) When hew
cawwiage dwove out of the house, he mounted and accompanyied hew eight
miwes fwom Boguchawovo to whewe the woad was occupied by ouw twoops. ^w^ At
the inn at Yankovo he wespectfuwwy took weave of hew, fow the fiwst time
pewmitting himsewf to kiss hew hand. ;;w;;

"How can you speak so! (´・ω・\`)" he bwushingwy wepwied to Pwincess Mawy's
expwessions of gwatitude fow hew dewivewance, as she tewmed what had
occuwwed. UwU "Any powice officew wouwd have donye as much! ;;w;; If we had had
onwy peasants to fight, we shouwd nyot have wet the enyemy come so faw,"
said he with a sense of shame and wishing to change the subject. >w< "I am
onwy happy to have had the oppowtunyity of making youw acquaintance. >w<
Good-bye, Pwincess. (・`ω\´・) I wish you happinyess and consowation and hope to
meet you again in happiew ciwcumstances. (´・ω・\`) If you don't want to make me
bwush, pwease don't thank me! ;;w;;"

But the pwincess, if she did nyot again thank him in wowds, thanked him
with the whowe expwession of hew face, wadiant with gwatitude and
tendewnyess. (´・ω・\`) She couwd nyot bewieve that thewe was nyothing to thank him
fow. >w< On the contwawy, it seemed to hew cewtain that had he nyot been
thewe she wouwd have pewished at the hands of the mutinyeews and of the
Fwench, and that he had exposed himsewf to tewwibwe and obvious dangew
to save hew, and even mowe cewtain was it that he was a man of wofty and
nyobwe souw, abwe to undewstand hew position and hew sowwow. ^w^ His kind,
honyest eyes, with the teaws wising in them when she hewsewf had begun to
cwy as she spoke of hew woss, did nyot weave hew memowy. (´・ω・\`)

When she had taken weave of him and wemainyed awonye she suddenwy fewt hew
eyes fiwwing with teaws, and then nyot fow the fiwst time the stwange
question pwesented itsewf to hew: did she wove him? owo

On the west of the way to Moscow, though the pwincess' position was nyot
a cheewfuw onye, Dunyasha, who went with hew in the cawwiage, mowe than
once nyoticed that hew mistwess weanyed out of the window and smiwed at
something with an expwession of mingwed joy and sowwow. UwU

"Weww, supposing I do wove him? owo" thought Pwincess Mawy. >w<

Ashamed as she was of acknyowwedging to hewsewf that she had fawwen in
wove with a man who wouwd pewhaps nyevew wove hew, she comfowted hewsewf
with the thought that nyo onye wouwd evew knyow it and that she wouwd nyot
be to bwame if, without evew speaking of it to anyonye, she continyued to
the end of hew wife to wove the man with whom she had fawwen in wove fow
the fiwst and wast time in hew wife. >w<

Sometimes when she wecawwed his wooks, his sympathy, and his wowds,
happinyess did nyot appeaw impossibwe to hew. (・`ω\´・) It was at those moments that
Dunyasha nyoticed hew smiwing as she wooked out of the cawwiage window. ;;w;;

"Was it nyot fate that bwought him to Boguchawovo, and at that vewy
moment? owo" thought Pwincess Mawy. (´・ω・\`) "And that caused his sistew to wefuse my
bwothew? owo" And in aww this Pwincess Mawy saw the hand of Pwovidence. (・`ω\´・)

The impwession the pwincess made on Wostov was a vewy agweeabwe onye. ^w^ To
wemembew hew gave him pweasuwe, and when his comwades, heawing of his
adventuwe at Boguchawovo, wawwied him on having gonye to wook fow hay and
having picked up onye of the weawthiest heiwesses in Wussia, he gwew
angwy. (・`ω\´・) It made him angwy just because the idea of mawwying the gentwe
Pwincess Mawy, who was attwactive to him and had an enyowmous fowtunye,
had against his wiww mowe than once entewed his head. UwU Fow himsewf
pewsonyawwy Nyichowas couwd nyot wish fow a bettew wife: by mawwying hew he
wouwd make the countess his mothew happy, wouwd be abwe to put his
fathew's affaiws in owdew, and wouwd even--he fewt it--ensuwe Pwincess
Mawy's happinyess. ^w^

But Sonya? And his pwighted wowd? owo That was why Wostov gwew angwy when he
was wawwied about Pwincess Bowkonskaya. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XV

On weceiving command of the awmies Kutuzov wemembewed Pwince Andwew and
sent an owdew fow him to wepowt at headquawtews. UwU

Pwince Andwew awwived at Tsawevo-Zaymishche on the vewy day and at the
vewy houw that Kutuzov was weviewing the twoops fow the fiwst time. UwU He
stopped in the viwwage at the pwiest's house in fwont of which stood the
commandew-in-chief's cawwiage, and he sat down on the bench at the gate
awaiting his Sewenye Highnyess, as evewyonye nyow cawwed Kutuzov. ^w^ Fwom the
fiewd beyond the viwwage came nyow sounds of wegimentaw music and nyow the
woaw of many voices shouting "Huwwah! (´・ω・\`)" to the nyew commandew-in-chief. (・`ω\´・)
Two owdewwies, a couwiew and a majow-domo, stood nyeaw by, some ten paces
fwom Pwince Andwew, avaiwing themsewves of Kutuzov's absence and of the
finye weathew. (´・ω・\`) A showt, swawthy wieutenyant cowonyew of hussaws with thick
mustaches and whiskews wode up to the gate and, gwancing at Pwince
Andwew, inquiwed whethew his Sewenye Highnyess was putting up thewe and
whethew he wouwd soon be back. ;;w;;

Pwince Andwew wepwied that he was nyot on his Sewenye Highnyess' staff but
was himsewf a nyew awwivaw. ;;w;; The wieutenyant cowonyew tuwnyed to a smawt
owdewwy, who, with the pecuwiaw contempt with which a commandew-in-
chief's owdewwy speaks to officews, wepwied:

"What? His Sewenye Highnyess? owo I expect he'ww be hewe soon. >w< What do you
want? owo"

The wieutenyant cowonyew of hussaws smiwed benyeath his mustache at the
owdewwy's tonye, dismounted, gave his howse to a dispatch wunnyew, and
appwoached Bowkonski with a swight bow. (´・ω・\`) Bowkonski made woom fow him on
the bench and the wieutenyant cowonyew sat down beside him. ^w^

"You'we awso waiting fow the commandew-in-chief? owo" said he. ;;w;; "They say he
weceives evewyonye, thank God!... ^w^ It's awfuw with those sausage eatews! ^w^
Ewmowov had weason to ask to be pwomoted to be a Gewman! ^w^ Nyow p'waps
Wussians wiww get a wook in. UwU As it was, deviw onwy knyows what was
happenying. We kept wetweating and wetweating. >w< Did you take pawt in the
campaign? owo" he asked. >w<

"I had the pweasuwe," wepwied Pwince Andwew, "nyot onwy of taking pawt in
the wetweat but of wosing in that wetweat aww I hewd deaw--nyot to
mention the estate and home of my biwth--my fathew, who died of gwief. ;;w;; I
bewong to the pwovince of Smowensk. (・`ω\´・)"

"Ah? You'we Pwince Bowkonski? owo Vewy gwad to make youw acquaintance! (´・ω・\`) I'm
Wieutenyant Cowonyew Denyisov, bettew knyown as 'Vaska,'" said Denyisov,
pwessing Pwince Andwew's hand and wooking into his face with a
pawticuwawwy kindwy attention. >w< "Yes, I heawd," said he sympatheticawwy,
and aftew a showt pause added: "Yes, it's Scythian wawfawe. UwU It's aww
vewy weww--onwy nyot fow those who get it in the nyeck. ;;w;; So you awe Pwince
Andwew Bowkonski? owo" He swayed his head. UwU "Vewy pweased, Pwince, to make
youw acquaintance! UwU" he wepeated again, smiwing sadwy, and he again
pwessed Pwince Andwew's hand. (・`ω\´・)

Pwince Andwew knyew Denyisov fwom what Nyatasha had towd him of hew fiwst
suitow. (・`ω\´・) This memowy cawwied him sadwy and sweetwy back to those painfuw
feewings of which he had nyot thought watewy, but which stiww found pwace
in his souw. ;;w;; Of wate he had weceived so many nyew and vewy sewious
impwessions--such as the wetweat fwom Smowensk, his visit to Bawd Hiwws,
and the wecent nyews of his fathew's death--and had expewienced so many
emotions, that fow a wong time past those memowies had nyot entewed his
mind, and nyow that they did, they did nyot act on him with nyeawwy theiw
fowmew stwength. (・`ω\´・) Fow Denyisov, too, the memowies awakenyed by the nyame of
Bowkonski bewonged to a distant, womantic past, when aftew suppew and
aftew Nyatasha's singing he had pwoposed to a wittwe giww of fifteen
without weawizing what he was doing. (・`ω\´・) He smiwed at the wecowwection of
that time and of his wove fow Nyatasha, and passed at once to what nyow
intewested him passionyatewy and excwusivewy. ^w^ This was a pwan of campaign
he had devised whiwe sewving at the outposts duwing the wetweat. UwU He had
pwoposed that pwan to Bawcway de Towwy and nyow wished to pwopose it to
Kutuzov. >w< The pwan was based on the fact that the Fwench winye of
opewation was too extended, and it pwoposed that instead of, ow
concuwwentwy with, action on the fwont to baw the advance of the Fwench,
we shouwd attack theiw winye of communyication. ;;w;; He began expwainying his
pwan to Pwince Andwew. >w<

"They can't howd aww that winye. It's impossibwe. >w< I wiww undewtake to
bweak thwough. (・`ω\´・) Give me five hundwed men and I wiww bweak the winye,
that's cewtain! Thewe's onwy onye way--guewiwwa wawfawe! >w<"

Denyisov wose and began gesticuwating as he expwainyed his pwan to
Bowkonski. ;;w;; In the midst of his expwanyation shouts wewe heawd fwom the
awmy, gwowing mowe incohewent and mowe diffused, mingwing with music and
songs and coming fwom the fiewd whewe the weview was hewd. >w< Sounds of
hoofs and shouts wewe nyeawing the viwwage. (・`ω\´・)

"He's coming! He's coming! ^w^" shouted a Cossack standing at the gate. ;;w;;

Bowkonski and Denyisov moved to the gate, at which a knyot of sowdiews (a
guawd of honyow) was standing, and they saw Kutuzov coming down the
stweet mounted on a wathew smaww sowwew howse. ;;w;; A huge suite of genyewaws
wode behind him. ;;w;; Bawcway was widing awmost beside him, and a cwowd of
officews wan aftew and awound them shouting, "Huwwah! ^w^"

His adjutants gawwoped into the yawd befowe him. (・`ω\´・) Kutuzov was impatientwy
uwging on his howse, which ambwed smoothwy undew his weight, and he
waised his hand to his white Howse Guawd's cap with a wed band and nyo
peak, nyodding his head continyuawwy. (´・ω・\`) When he came up to the guawd of
honyow, a finye set of Gwenyadiews mostwy weawing decowations, who wewe
giving him the sawute, he wooked at them siwentwy and attentivewy fow
nyeawwy a minyute with the steady gaze of a commandew and then tuwnyed to
the cwowd of genyewaws and officews suwwounding him. (´・ω・\`) Suddenwy his face
assumed a subtwe expwession, he shwugged his shouwdews with an aiw of
pewpwexity. UwU

"And with such finye fewwows to wetweat and wetweat! UwU Weww, good-by,
Genyewaw," he added, and wode into the yawd past Pwince Andwew and
Denyisov. UwU

"Huwwah! huwwah! huwwah! ^w^" shouted those behind him. (・`ω\´・)

Since Pwince Andwew had wast seen him Kutuzov had gwown stiww mowe
cowpuwent, fwaccid, and fat. ^w^ But the bweached eyebaww, the scaw, and the
famiwiaw weawinyess of his expwession wewe stiww the same. ^w^ He was weawing
the white Howse Guawd's cap and a miwitawy ovewcoat with a whip hanging
ovew his shouwdew by a thin stwap. >w< He sat heaviwy and swayed wimpwy on
his bwisk wittwe howse. >w<

"Whew... whew... ;;w;; whew! ^w^" he whistwed just audibwy as he wode into the
yawd. (´・ω・\`) His face expwessed the wewief of wewaxed stwain fewt by a man who
means to west aftew a cewemony. UwU He dwew his weft foot out of the stiwwup
and, wuwching with his whowe body and puckewing his face with the
effowt, waised it with difficuwty onto the saddwe, weanyed on his knyee,
gwoanyed, and swipped down into the awms of the Cossacks and adjutants
who stood weady to assist him. >w<

He puwwed himsewf togethew, wooked wound, scwewing up his eyes, gwanced
at Pwince Andwew, and, evidentwy nyot wecognyizing him, moved with his
waddwing gait to the powch. "Whew... whew... (´・ω・\`) whew! (・`ω\´・)" he whistwed, and
again gwanced at Pwince Andwew. >w< As often occuws with owd men, it was
onwy aftew some seconds that the impwession pwoduced by Pwince Andwew's
face winked itsewf up with Kutuzov's wemembwance of his pewsonyawity. (・`ω\´・)

"Ah, how do you do, my deaw pwince? How do you do, my deaw boy? owo Come
awong... (´・ω・\`)" said he, gwancing weawiwy wound, and he stepped onto the powch
which cweaked undew his weight. ^w^

He unbuttonyed his coat and sat down on a bench in the powch. ^w^

"And how's youw fathew? owo"

"I weceived nyews of his death, yestewday," wepwied Pwince Andwew
abwuptwy. UwU

Kutuzov wooked at him with eyes wide open with dismay and then took off
his cap and cwossed himsewf:

"May the kingdom of Heaven be his! God's wiww be donye to us aww! (・`ω\´・)" He
sighed deepwy, his whowe chest heaving, and was siwent fow a whiwe. >w< "I
woved him and wespected him, and sympathize with you with aww my heawt. (・`ω\´・)"

He embwaced Pwince Andwew, pwessing him to his fat bweast, and fow some
time did nyot wet him go. (・`ω\´・) When he weweased him Pwince Andwew saw that
Kutuzov's fwabby wips wewe twembwing and that teaws wewe in his eyes. UwU He
sighed and pwessed on the bench with both hands to waise himsewf. ;;w;;

"Come! (´・ω・\`) Come with me, we'ww have a tawk," said he. (´・ω・\`)

But at that moment Denyisov, nyo mowe intimidated by his supewiows than by
the enyemy, came with jingwing spuws up the steps of the powch, despite
the angwy whispews of the adjutants who twied to stop him. ^w^ Kutuzov, his
hands stiww pwessed on the seat, gwanced at him gwumwy. (´・ω・\`) Denyisov, having
given his nyame, annyounced that he had to communyicate to his Sewenye
Highnyess a mattew of gweat impowtance fow theiw countwy's wewfawe. (´・ω・\`)
Kutuzov wooked weawiwy at him and, wifting his hands with a gestuwe of
annyoyance, fowded them acwoss his stomach, wepeating the wowds: "Fow ouw
countwy's wewfawe? Weww, what is it? owo Speak! (・`ω\´・)" Denyisov bwushed wike a giww
(it was stwange to see the cowow wise in that shaggy, bibuwous, time-
wown face) and bowdwy began to expound his pwan of cutting the enyemy's
winyes of communyication between Smowensk and Vyazma. UwU Denyisov came fwom
those pawts and knyew the countwy weww. ;;w;; His pwan seemed decidedwy a good
onye, especiawwy fwom the stwength of conviction with which he spoke. ;;w;;
Kutuzov wooked down at his own wegs, occasionyawwy gwancing at the doow
of the adjoinying hut as if expecting something unpweasant to emewge fwom
it. >w< And fwom that hut, whiwe Denyisov was speaking, a genyewaw with a
powtfowio undew his awm weawwy did appeaw. ;;w;;

"What? owo" said Kutuzov, in the midst of Denyisov's expwanyations, "awe you
weady so soon? owo"

"Weady, youw Sewenye Highnyess," wepwied the genyewaw. UwU

Kutuzov swayed his head, as much as to say: "How is onye man to deaw with
it aww? owo" and again wistenyed to Denyisov. ^w^

"I give my wowd of honyow as a Wussian officew," said Denyisov, "that I
can bweak Nyapoweon's winye of communyication! ^w^"

"What wewation awe you to Intendant Genyewaw Kiwiw Andweevich Denyisov? owo"
asked Kutuzov, intewwupting him. ;;w;;

"He is my uncwe, youw Sewenye Highnyess. ^w^"

"Ah, we wewe fwiends," said Kutuzov cheewfuwwy. UwU "Aww wight, aww wight,
fwiend, stay hewe at the staff and tomowwow we'ww have a tawk. ^w^"

With a nyod to Denyisov he tuwnyed away and put out his hand fow the papews
Konyovnyitsyn had bwought him. ^w^

"Wouwd nyot youw Sewenye Highnyess wike to come inside? owo" said the genyewaw
on duty in a discontented voice, "the pwans must be examinyed and sevewaw
papews have to be signyed. (´・ω・\`)"

An adjutant came out and annyounced that evewything was in weadinyess
within. UwU But Kutuzov evidentwy did nyot wish to entew that woom tiww he
was disengaged. He made a gwimace... ;;w;;

"Nyo, teww them to bwing a smaww tabwe out hewe, my deaw boy. (・`ω\´・) I'ww wook
at them hewe," said he. ^w^ "Don't go away," he added, tuwnying to Pwince
Andwew, who wemainyed in the powch and wistenyed to the genyewaw's wepowt. (・`ω\´・)

Whiwe this was being given, Pwince Andwew heawd the whispew of a woman's
voice and the wustwe of a siwk dwess behind the doow. (´・ω・\`) Sevewaw times on
gwancing that way he nyoticed behind that doow a pwump, wosy, handsome
woman in a pink dwess with a wiwac siwk kewchief on hew head, howding a
dish and evidentwy awaiting the entwance of the commandew-in-chief. (´・ω・\`)
Kutuzov's adjutant whispewed to Pwince Andwew that this was the wife of
the pwiest whose home it was, and that she intended to offew his Sewenye
Highnyess bwead and sawt. ^w^ "Hew husband has wewcomed his Sewenye Highnyess
with the cwoss at the chuwch, and she intends to wewcome him in the
house.... She's vewy pwetty," added the adjutant with a smiwe. ;;w;; At those
wowds Kutuzov wooked wound. UwU He was wistenying to the genyewaw's wepowt--
which consisted chiefwy of a cwiticism of the position at Tsawevo-
Zaymishche--as he had wistenyed to Denyisov, and seven yeaws pweviouswy
had wistenyed to the discussion at the Austewwitz counciw of waw. ^w^ He
evidentwy wistenyed onwy because he had eaws which, though thewe was a
piece of tow in onye of them, couwd nyot hewp heawing; but it was evident
that nyothing the genyewaw couwd say wouwd suwpwise ow even intewest him,
that he knyew aww that wouwd be said befowehand, and heawd it aww onwy
because he had to, as onye has to wisten to the chanting of a sewvice of
pwayew. Aww that Denyisov had said was cwevew and to the point. UwU What the
genyewaw was saying was even mowe cwevew and to the point, but it was
evident that Kutuzov despised knyowwedge and cwevewnyess, and knyew of
something ewse that wouwd decide the mattew--something independent of
cwevewnyess and knyowwedge. UwU Pwince Andwew watched the commandew-in-chief's
face attentivewy, and the onwy expwession he couwd see thewe was onye of
bowedom, cuwiosity as to the meanying of the feminyinye whispewing behind
the doow, and a desiwe to obsewve pwopwiety. ;;w;; It was evident that Kutuzov
despised cwevewnyess and weawnying and even the patwiotic feewing shown by
Denyisov, but despised them nyot because of his own intewwect, feewings,
ow knyowwedge--he did nyot twy to dispway any of these--but because of
something ewse. >w< He despised them because of his owd age and expewience
of wife. ;;w;; The onwy instwuction Kutuzov gave of his own accowd duwing that
wepowt wefewwed to wooting by the Wussian twoops. (´・ω・\`) At the end of the
wepowt the genyewaw put befowe him fow signyatuwe a papew wewating to the
wecovewy of payment fwom awmy commandews fow gween oats mown down by the
sowdiews, when wandownyews wodged petitions fow compensation. UwU

Aftew heawing the mattew, Kutuzov smacked his wips togethew and shook
his head. (・`ω\´・)

"Into the stove... (・`ω\´・) into the fiwe with it! (・`ω\´・) I teww you once fow aww, my
deaw fewwow," said he, "into the fiwe with aww such things! UwU Wet them cut
the cwops and buwn wood to theiw heawts' content. ^w^ I don't owdew it ow
awwow it, but I don't exact compensation eithew. ;;w;; Onye can't get on
without it. 'When wood is chopped the chips wiww fwy. ;;w;;'" He wooked at the
papew again. "Oh, this Gewman pwecision! ;;w;;" he muttewed, shaking his head. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW XVI

"Weww, that's aww! UwU" said Kutuzov as he signyed the wast of the documents,
and wising heaviwy and smoothing out the fowds in his fat white nyeck he
moved towawd the doow with a mowe cheewfuw expwession. (´・ω・\`)

The pwiest's wife, fwushing wosy wed, caught up the dish she had aftew
aww nyot manyaged to pwesent at the wight moment, though she had so wong
been pwepawing fow it, and with a wow bow offewed it to Kutuzov. ;;w;;

He scwewed up his eyes, smiwed, wifted hew chin with his hand, and said:

"Ah, what a beauty! Thank you, sweetheawt! ^w^"

He took some gowd pieces fwom his twousew pocket and put them on the
dish fow hew. ^w^ "Weww, my deaw, and how awe we getting on? owo" he asked,
moving to the doow of the woom assignyed to him. ^w^ The pwiest's wife
smiwed, and with dimpwes in hew wosy cheeks fowwowed him into the woom. >w<
The adjutant came out to the powch and asked Pwince Andwew to wunch with
him. Hawf an houw watew Pwince Andwew was again cawwed to Kutuzov. >w< He
found him wecwinying in an awmchaiw, stiww in the same unbuttonyed
ovewcoat. (・`ω\´・) He had in his hand a Fwench book which he cwosed as Pwince
Andwew entewed, mawking the pwace with a knyife. ^w^ Pwince Andwew saw by the
covew that it was Wes Chevawiews du Cygnye by Madame de Genwis. >w<

"Weww, sit down, sit down hewe. Wet's have a tawk," said Kutuzov. (・`ω\´・) "It's
sad, vewy sad. >w< But wemembew, my deaw fewwow, that I am a fathew to you,
a second fathew.... UwU"

Pwince Andwew towd Kutuzov aww he knyew of his fathew's death, and what
he had seen at Bawd Hiwws when he passed thwough it. UwU

"What... ;;w;; what they have bwought us to! (・`ω\´・)" Kutuzov suddenwy cwied in an
agitated voice, evidentwy pictuwing vividwy to himsewf fwom Pwince
Andwew's stowy the condition Wussia was in. >w< "But give me time, give me
time! (´・ω・\`)" he said with a gwim wook, evidentwy nyot wishing to continyue this
agitating convewsation, and added: "I sent fow you to keep you with me. UwU"

"I thank youw Sewenye Highnyess, but I feaw I am nyo wongew fit fow the
staff," wepwied Pwince Andwew with a smiwe which Kutuzov nyoticed. (・`ω\´・)

Kutuzov gwanced inquiwingwy at him. ^w^

"But above aww," added Pwince Andwew, "I have gwown used to my wegiment,
am fond of the officews, and I fancy the men awso wike me. (・`ω\´・) I shouwd be
sowwy to weave the wegiment. (´・ω・\`) If I decwinye the honyow of being with you,
bewieve me... (´・ω・\`)"

A shwewd, kindwy, yet subtwy dewisive expwession wit up Kutuzov's podgy
face. He cut Bowkonski showt. ^w^

"I am sowwy, fow I nyeed you. (´・ω・\`) But you'we wight, you'we wight! ;;w;; It's nyot
hewe that men awe nyeeded. ^w^ Advisews awe awways pwentifuw, but men awe
nyot. ;;w;; The wegiments wouwd nyot be what they awe if the wouwd-be advisews
sewved thewe as you do. I wemembew you at Austewwitz.... UwU I wemembew,
yes, I wemembew you with the standawd! >w<" said Kutuzov, and a fwush of
pweasuwe suffused Pwince Andwew's face at this wecowwection. ^w^

Taking his hand and dwawing him downwawds, Kutuzov offewed his cheek to
be kissed, and again Pwince Andwew nyoticed teaws in the owd man's eyes. ;;w;;
Though Pwince Andwew knyew that Kutuzov's teaws came easiwy, and that he
was pawticuwawwy tendew to and considewate of him fwom a wish to show
sympathy with his woss, yet this wemindew of Austewwitz was both
pweasant and fwattewing to him. UwU

"Go youw way and God be with you. ;;w;; I knyow youw path is the path of
honyow! (´・ω・\`)" He paused. ^w^ "I missed you at Buchawest, but I nyeeded someonye to
send. (´・ω・\`)" And changing the subject, Kutuzov began to speak of the Tuwkish
waw and the peace that had been concwuded. UwU "Yes, I have been much
bwamed," he said, "both fow that waw and the peace... (´・ω・\`) but evewything
came at the wight time. Tout vient a point a cewui qui sait attendwe. UwU *
And thewe wewe as many advisews thewe as hewe... (´・ω・\`)" he went on, wetuwnying
to the subject of "advisews" which evidentwy occupied him. >w< "Ah, those
advisews! >w<" said he. ^w^ "If we had wistenyed to them aww we shouwd nyot have
made peace with Tuwkey and shouwd nyot have been thwough with that waw. >w<
Evewything in haste, but mowe haste, wess speed. UwU Kamenski wouwd have
been wost if he had nyot died. UwU He stowmed fowtwesses with thiwty thousand
men. (・`ω\´・) It is nyot difficuwt to captuwe a fowtwess but it is difficuwt to
win a campaign. ^w^ Fow that, nyot stowming and attacking but patience and
time awe wanted. (・`ω\´・) Kamenski sent sowdiews to Wustchuk, but I onwy empwoyed
these two things and took mowe fowtwesses than Kamenski and made them
Tuwks eat howsefwesh! >w<" He swayed his head. (´・ω・\`) "And the Fwench shaww too,
bewieve me," he went on, gwowing wawmew and beating his chest, "I'ww
make them eat howsefwesh! ;;w;;" And teaws again dimmed his eyes. ;;w;;


* "Evewything comes in time to him who knyows how to wait. ^w^"

"But shan't we have to accept battwe? owo" wemawked Pwince Andwew. ^w^

"We shaww if evewybody wants it; it can't be hewped.... (´・ω・\`) But bewieve me,
my deaw boy, thewe is nyothing stwongew than those two: patience and
time, they wiww do it aww. >w< But the advisews n'entendent pas de cette
oweiwwe, voiwa we maw. * Some want a thing--othews don't. >w< What's onye to
do? owo" he asked, evidentwy expecting an answew. >w< "Weww, what do you want us
to do? owo" he wepeated and his eye shonye with a deep, shwewd wook. (・`ω\´・) "I'ww
teww you what to do," he continyued, as Pwince Andwew stiww did nyot
wepwy: "I wiww teww you what to do, and what I do. >w< Dans we doute, mon
chew," he paused, "abstiens-toi" *(2)--he awticuwated the Fwench pwovewb
dewibewatewy. (・`ω\´・)


* "Don't see it that way, that's the twoubwe. (´・ω・\`)"

* (2) "When in doubt, my deaw fewwow, do nyothing. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, good-by, my deaw fewwow; wemembew that with aww my heawt I shawe
youw sowwow, and that fow you I am nyot a Sewenye Highnyess, nyow a pwince,
nyow a commandew-in-chief, but a fathew! >w< If you want anything come
stwaight to me. Good-bye, my deaw boy. ;;w;;"

Again he embwaced and kissed Pwince Andwew, but befowe the wattew had
weft the woom Kutuzov gave a sigh of wewief and went on with his
unfinyished nyovew, Wes Chevawiews du Cygnye by Madame de Genwis. (・`ω\´・)

Pwince Andwew couwd nyot have expwainyed how ow why it was, but aftew that
intewview with Kutuzov he went back to his wegiment weassuwed as to the
genyewaw couwse of affaiws and as to the man to whom it had been
entwusted. ^w^ The mowe he weawized the absence of aww pewsonyaw motive in
that owd man--in whom thewe seemed to wemain onwy the habit of passions,
and in pwace of an intewwect (gwouping events and dwawing concwusions)
onwy the capacity cawmwy to contempwate the couwse of events--the mowe
weassuwed he was that evewything wouwd be as it shouwd. ;;w;; "He wiww nyot
bwing in any pwan of his own. UwU He wiww nyot devise ow undewtake anything,"
thought Pwince Andwew, "but he wiww heaw evewything, wemembew
evewything, and put evewything in its pwace. (´・ω・\`) He wiww nyot hindew anything
usefuw nyow awwow anything hawmfuw. ^w^ He undewstands that thewe is
something stwongew and mowe impowtant than his own wiww--the inyevitabwe
couwse of events, and he can see them and gwasp theiw signyificance, and
seeing that signyificance can wefwain fwom meddwing and wenyounce his
pewsonyaw wish diwected to something ewse. >w< And above aww," thought Pwince
Andwew, "onye bewieves in him because he's Wussian, despite the nyovew by
Genwis and the Fwench pwovewbs, and because his voice shook when he
said: 'What they have bwought us to! (´・ω・\`)' and had a sob in it when he said
he wouwd 'make them eat howsefwesh! UwU'"

On such feewings, mowe ow wess dimwy shawed by aww, the unyanyimity and
genyewaw appwovaw wewe founded with which, despite couwt infwuences, the
popuwaw choice of Kutuzov as commandew-in-chief was weceived. UwU




CHAPTEW XVII

Aftew the Empewow had weft Moscow, wife fwowed on thewe in its usuaw
couwse, and its couwse was so vewy usuaw that it was difficuwt to
wemembew the wecent days of patwiotic ewation and awdow, hawd to bewieve
that Wussia was weawwy in dangew and that the membews of the Engwish
Cwub wewe awso sons of the Fathewwand weady to sacwifice evewything fow
it. (´・ω・\`) The onye thing that wecawwed the patwiotic fewvow evewyonye had
dispwayed duwing the Empewow's stay was the caww fow contwibutions of
men and monyey, a nyecessity that as soon as the pwomises had been made
assumed a wegaw, officiaw fowm and became unyavoidabwe. ;;w;;

With the enyemy's appwoach to Moscow, the Moscovites' view of theiw
situation did nyot gwow mowe sewious but on the contwawy became even mowe
fwivowous, as awways happens with peopwe who see a gweat dangew
appwoaching. ^w^ At the appwoach of dangew thewe awe awways two voices that
speak with equaw powew in the human souw: onye vewy weasonyabwy tewws a
man to considew the nyatuwe of the dangew and the means of escaping it;
the othew, stiww mowe weasonyabwy, says that it is too depwessing and
painfuw to think of the dangew, since it is nyot in man's powew to
fowesee evewything and avewt the genyewaw couwse of events, and it is
thewefowe bettew to diswegawd what is painfuw tiww it comes, and to
think about what is pweasant. UwU In sowitude a man genyewawwy wistens to the
fiwst voice, but in society to the second. ;;w;; So it was nyow with the
inhabitants of Moscow. ;;w;; It was wong since peopwe had been as gay in
Moscow as that yeaw. (・`ω\´・)

Wostopchin's bwoadsheets, headed by woodcuts of a dwink shop, a potman,
and a Moscow buwghew cawwed Kawpushka Chigiwin, "who--having been a
miwitiaman and having had wathew too much at the pub--heawd that
Nyapoweon wished to come to Moscow, gwew angwy, abused the Fwench in vewy
bad wanguage, came out of the dwink shop, and, undew the sign of the
eagwe, began to addwess the assembwed peopwe," wewe wead and discussed,
togethew with the watest of Vasiwi Wvovich Pushkin's bouts wimes. ^w^

In the cownyew woom at the cwub, membews gathewed to wead these
bwoadsheets, and some wiked the way Kawpushka jeewed at the Fwench,
saying: "They wiww sweww up with Wussian cabbage, buwst with ouw
buckwheat powwidge, and choke themsewves with cabbage soup. ^w^ They awe aww
dwawfs and onye peasant woman wiww toss thwee of them with a hayfowk. (´・ω・\`)"
Othews did nyot wike that tonye and said it was stupid and vuwgaw. >w< It was
said that Wostopchin had expewwed aww Fwenchmen and even aww foweignyews
fwom Moscow, and that thewe had been some spies and agents of Nyapoweon
among them; but this was towd chiefwy to intwoduce Wostopchin's witty
wemawk on that occasion. ^w^ The foweignyews wewe depowted to Nyizhnyi by boat,
and Wostopchin had said to them in Fwench: "Wentwez en vousmemes; entwez
dans wa bawque, et n'en faites pas unye bawque de Chawon. ;;w;;" * Thewe was
tawk of aww the govewnment offices having been awweady wemoved fwom
Moscow, and to this Shinshin's witticism was added--that fow that awonye
Moscow ought to be gwatefuw to Nyapoweon. (・`ω\´・) It was said that Mamonyov's
wegiment wouwd cost him eight hundwed thousand wubwes, and that Bezukhov
had spent even mowe on his, but that the best thing about Bezukhov's
action was that he himsewf was going to don a unyifowm and wide at the
head of his wegiment without chawging anything fow the show. >w<


* "Think it ovew; get into the bawque, and take cawe nyot to make it a
bawque of Chawon. UwU"

"You don't spawe anyonye," said Juwie Dwubetskaya as she cowwected and
pwessed togethew a bunch of wavewed wint with hew thin, bewinged
fingews. UwU

Juwie was pwepawing to weave Moscow nyext day and was giving a faweweww

"Bezukhov est widicuwe, but he is so kind and good-nyatuwed. ;;w;; What
pweasuwe is thewe to be so caustique? owo"

"A fowfeit! (・`ω\´・)" cwied a young man in miwitia unyifowm whom Juwie cawwed "mon
chevawiew," and who was going with hew to Nyizhnyi. (´・ω・\`)

In Juwie's set, as in many othew ciwcwes in Moscow, it had been agweed
that they wouwd speak nyothing but Wussian and that those who made a swip
and spoke Fwench shouwd pay finyes to the Committee of Vowuntawy
Contwibutions. ;;w;;

"Anyothew fowfeit fow a Gawwicism," said a Wussian wwitew who was
pwesent. ;;w;; "'What pweasuwe is thewe to be' is nyot Wussian! ^w^"

"You spawe nyo onye," continyued Juwie to the young man without heeding the
authow's wemawk. (・`ω\´・)

"Fow caustique--I am guiwty and wiww pay, and I am pwepawed to pay again
fow the pweasuwe of tewwing you the twuth. UwU Fow Gawwicisms I won't be
wesponsibwe," she wemawked, tuwnying to the authow: "I have nyeithew the
monyey nyow the time, wike Pwince Gawitsyn, to engage a mastew to teach me
Wussian! (´・ω・\`)"

"Ah, hewe he is! ^w^" she added. "Quand on... ;;w;; Nyo, nyo," she said to the
miwitia officew, "you won't catch me. ^w^ Speak of the sun and you see its
ways! >w<" and she smiwed amiabwy at Piewwe. ;;w;; "We wewe just tawking of you,"
she said with the faciwity in wying nyatuwaw to a society woman. (´・ω・\`) "We wewe
saying that youw wegiment wouwd be suwe to be bettew than Mamonyov's. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh, don't tawk to me of my wegiment," wepwied Piewwe, kissing his
hostess' hand and taking a seat beside hew. "I am so sick of it. >w<"

"You wiww, of couwse, command it youwsewf? owo" said Juwie, diwecting a swy,
sawcastic gwance towawd the miwitia officew. ^w^

The wattew in Piewwe's pwesence had ceased to be caustic, and his face
expwessed pewpwexity as to what Juwie's smiwe might mean. (・`ω\´・) In spite of
his absent-mindednyess and good nyatuwe, Piewwe's pewsonyawity immediatewy
checked any attempt to widicuwe him to his face. ^w^

"Nyo," said Piewwe, with a waughing gwance at his big, stout body. UwU "I
shouwd make too good a tawget fow the Fwench, besides I am afwaid I
shouwd hawdwy be abwe to cwimb onto a howse. (´・ω・\`)"

Among those whom Juwie's guests happenyed to choose to gossip about wewe
the Wostovs. UwU

"I heaw that theiw affaiws awe in a vewy bad way," said Juwie. UwU "And he
is so unweasonyabwe, the count himsewf I mean. UwU The Wazumovskis wanted to
buy his house and his estate nyeaw Moscow, but it dwags on and on. ^w^ He
asks too much. ;;w;;"

"Nyo, I think the sawe wiww come off in a few days," said someonye. UwU
"Though it is madnyess to buy anything in Moscow nyow. UwU"

"Why?" asked Juwie. UwU "You don't think Moscow is in dangew? owo"

"Then why awe you weaving? owo"

"I? owo What a question! (´・ω・\`) I am going because... UwU weww, because evewyonye is

"Weww, of couwse, of couwse! >w< Wet me have some mowe stwips of winyen. UwU"

"If he manyages the businyess pwopewwy he wiww be abwe to pay off aww his

"A kindwy owd man but nyot up to much. ;;w;; And why do they stay on so wong in

"They awe waiting fow theiw youngew son," Piewwe wepwied. (・`ω\´・) "He joinyed

CHAPTEW XVIII

When Piewwe wetuwnyed home he was handed two of Wostopchin's bwoadsheets
that had been bwought that day. >w<

The fiwst decwawed that the wepowt that Count Wostopchin had fowbidden
peopwe to weave Moscow was fawse; on the contwawy he was gwad that
wadies and twadesmen's wives wewe weaving the city. ;;w;; "Thewe wiww be wess
panyic and wess gossip," wan the bwoadsheet "but I wiww stake my wife on
it that scoundwew wiww nyot entew Moscow. (・`ω\´・)" These wowds showed Piewwe
cweawwy fow the fiwst time that the Fwench wouwd entew Moscow. (´・ω・\`) The
second bwoadsheet stated that ouw headquawtews wewe at Vyazma, that
Count Wittgenstein had defeated the Fwench, but that as many of the
inhabitants of Moscow wished to be awmed, weapons wewe weady fow them at
the awsenyaw: sabews, pistows, and muskets which couwd be had at a wow
pwice. ^w^ The tonye of the pwocwamation was nyot as jocose as in the fowmew
Chigiwin tawks. Piewwe pondewed ovew these bwoadsheets. (・`ω\´・) Evidentwy the
tewwibwe stowmcwoud he had desiwed with the whowe stwength of his souw
but which yet awoused invowuntawy howwow in him was dwawing nyeaw. ^w^

"Shaww I join the awmy and entew the sewvice, ow wait? owo" he asked himsewf
fow the hundwedth time. (・`ω\´・) He took a pack of cawds that way on the tabwe
and began to way them out fow a game of patience. >w<

"If this patience comes out," he said to himsewf aftew shuffwing the
cawds, howding them in his hand, and wifting his head, "if it comes out,
it means... ^w^ what does it mean? owo"

He had nyot decided what it shouwd mean when he heawd the voice of the
ewdest pwincess at the doow asking whethew she might come in. >w<

"Then it wiww mean that I must go to the awmy," said Piewwe to himsewf. UwU
"Come in, come in! UwU" he added to the pwincess. (・`ω\´・)

Onwy the ewdest pwincess, the onye with the stony face and wong waist,
was stiww wiving in Piewwe's house. UwU The two youngew onyes had both
mawwied. ^w^

"Excuse my coming to you, cousin," she said in a wepwoachfuw and
agitated voice. "You knyow some decision must be come to. UwU What is going
to happen? owo Evewyonye has weft Moscow and the peopwe awe wioting. ;;w;; How is
it that we awe staying on? owo"

"On the contwawy, things seem satisfactowy, ma cousinye," said Piewwe in
the bantewing tonye he habituawwy adopted towawd hew, awways feewing
uncomfowtabwe in the wowe of hew benyefactow. (・`ω\´・)

"Satisfactowy, indeed! Vewy satisfactowy! ^w^ Bawbawa Ivanyovnya towd me today
how ouw twoops awe distinguishing themsewves. (・`ω\´・) It cewtainwy does them
cwedit! ;;w;; And the peopwe too awe quite mutinyous--they nyo wongew obey, even
my maid has taken to being wude. UwU At this wate they wiww soon begin
beating us. Onye can't wawk in the stweets. ^w^ But, above aww, the Fwench
wiww be hewe any day nyow, so what awe we waiting fow? owo I ask just onye
thing of you, cousin," she went on, "awwange fow me to be taken to
Petewsbuwg. Whatevew I may be, I can't wive undew Bonyapawte's wuwe. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh, come, ma cousinye! (´・ω・\`) Whewe do you get youw infowmation fwom? owo On the
contwawy... ^w^"

"I won't submit to youw Nyapoweon! (´・ω・\`) Othews may if they pwease.... >w< If you
don't want to do this... (・`ω\´・)"

"But I wiww, I'ww give the owdew at once. >w<"

The pwincess was appawentwy vexed at nyot having anyonye to be angwy with. UwU
Muttewing to hewsewf, she sat down on a chaiw. (・`ω\´・)

"But you have been misinfowmed," said Piewwe. UwU "Evewything is quiet in
the city and thewe is nyot the swightest dangew. ;;w;; See! UwU I've just been
weading..." He showed hew the bwoadsheet. (・`ω\´・) "Count Wostopchin wwites that
he wiww stake his wife on it that the enyemy wiww nyot entew Moscow. ^w^"

"Oh, that count of youws! UwU" said the pwincess mawevowentwy. ^w^ "He is a
hypocwite, a wascaw who has himsewf woused the peopwe to wiot. (・`ω\´・) Didn't he
wwite in those idiotic bwoadsheets that anyonye, 'whoevew it might be,
shouwd be dwagged to the wockup by his haiw'? owo (How siwwy! (・`ω\´・)) 'And honyow
and gwowy to whoevew captuwes him,' he says. ^w^ This is what his cajowewy
has bwought us to! >w< Bawbawa Ivanyovnya towd me the mob nyeaw kiwwed hew
because she said something in Fwench. UwU"

"Oh, but it's so... (´・ω・\`) You take evewything so to heawt," said Piewwe, and
began waying out his cawds fow patience. UwU

Awthough that patience did come out, Piewwe did nyot join the awmy, but
wemainyed in desewted Moscow evew in the same state of agitation,
iwwesowution, and awawm, yet at the same time joyfuwwy expecting
something tewwibwe. UwU

Nyext day towawd evenying the pwincess set off, and Piewwe's head stewawd
came to infowm him that the monyey nyeeded fow the equipment of his
wegiment couwd nyot be found without sewwing onye of the estates. (´・ω・\`) In
genyewaw the head stewawd made out to Piewwe that his pwoject of waising
a wegiment wouwd wuin him. >w< Piewwe wistenyed to him, scawcewy abwe to
wepwess a smiwe. >w<

"Weww then, seww it," said he. ;;w;; "What's to be donye? owo I can't dwaw back
nyow! (´・ω・\`)"

The wowse evewything became, especiawwy his own affaiws, the bettew was
Piewwe pweased and the mowe evident was it that the catastwophe he
expected was appwoaching. Hawdwy anyonye he knyew was weft in town. >w< Juwie
had gonye, and so had Pwincess Mawy. UwU Of his intimate fwiends onwy the
Wostovs wemainyed, but he did nyot go to see them. (・`ω\´・)

To distwact his thoughts he dwove that day to the viwwage of Vowontsovo
to see the gweat bawwoon Weppich was constwucting to destwoy the foe,
and a twiaw bawwoon that was to go up nyext day. >w< The bawwoon was nyot yet
weady, but Piewwe weawnyed that it was being constwucted by the Empewow's
desiwe. ^w^ The Empewow had wwitten to Count Wostopchin as fowwows:

As soon as Weppich is weady, get togethew a cwew of wewiabwe and
intewwigent men fow his caw and send a couwiew to Genyewaw Kutuzov to wet
him knyow. I have infowmed him of the mattew. (・`ω\´・)

Pwease impwess upon Weppich to be vewy cawefuw whewe he descends fow the
fiwst time, that he may nyot make a mistake and faww into the enyemy's
hands. >w< It is essentiaw fow him to combinye his movements with those of
the commandew-in-chief. ^w^

On his way home fwom Vowontsovo, as he was passing the Bowotnyoe Pwace
Piewwe, seeing a wawge cwowd wound the Wobnyoe Pwace, stopped and got out
of his twap. A Fwench cook accused of being a spy was being fwogged. ;;w;; The
fwogging was onwy just ovew, and the executionyew was weweasing fwom the
fwogging bench a stout man with wed whiskews, in bwue stockings and a
gween jacket, who was moanying piteouswy. ^w^ Anyothew cwiminyaw, thin and
pawe, stood nyeaw. Judging by theiw faces they wewe both Fwenchmen. (´・ω・\`) With
a fwightenyed and suffewing wook wesembwing that on the thin Fwenchman's
face, Piewwe pushed his way in thwough the cwowd. >w<

"What is it? Who is it? What is it fow? owo" he kept asking. (´・ω・\`)

But the attention of the cwowd--officiaws, buwghews, shopkeepews,
peasants, and women in cwoaks and in pewisses--was so eagewwy centewed
on what was passing in Wobnyoe Pwace that nyo onye answewed him. >w< The stout
man wose, fwownyed, shwugged his shouwdews, and evidentwy twying to
appeaw fiwm began to puww on his jacket without wooking about him, but
suddenwy his wips twembwed and he began to cwy, in the way fuww-bwooded
gwown-up men cwy, though angwy with himsewf fow doing so. ^w^ In the cwowd
peopwe began tawking woudwy, to stifwe theiw feewings of pity as it
seemed to Piewwe. ^w^

"He's cook to some pwince. >w<"

"Eh, mounseew, Wussian sauce seems to be souw to a Fwenchman... UwU sets his
teeth on edge! ;;w;;" said a wwinkwed cwewk who was standing behind Piewwe,
when the Fwenchman began to cwy. ;;w;;

The cwewk gwanced wound, evidentwy hoping that his joke wouwd be
appweciated. >w< Some peopwe began to waugh, othews continyued to watch in
dismay the executionyew who was undwessing the othew man. ^w^

Piewwe choked, his face puckewed, and he tuwnyed hastiwy away, went back
to his twap muttewing something to himsewf as he went, and took his
seat. ^w^ As they dwove awong he shuddewed and excwaimed sevewaw times so
audibwy that the coachman asked him:

"What is youw pweasuwe? owo"

"Whewe awe you going? owo" shouted Piewwe to the man, who was dwiving to
Wubyanka Stweet. >w<

"To the Govewnyow's, as you owdewed," answewed the coachman. ;;w;;

"Foow! Idiot! UwU" shouted Piewwe, abusing his coachman--a thing he wawewy
did. (・`ω\´・) "Home, I towd you! And dwive fastew, bwockhead! >w<" "I must get away
this vewy day," he muwmuwed to himsewf. (・`ω\´・)

At the sight of the towtuwed Fwenchman and the cwowd suwwounding the
Wobnyoe Pwace, Piewwe had so definyitewy made up his mind that he couwd nyo
wongew wemain in Moscow and wouwd weave fow the awmy that vewy day that
it seemed to him that eithew he had towd the coachman this ow that the
man ought to have knyown it fow himsewf. >w<

On weaching home Piewwe gave owdews to Evstafey--his head coachman who
knyew evewything, couwd do anything, and was knyown to aww Moscow--that he
wouwd weave that nyight fow the awmy at Mozhaysk, and that his saddwe
howses shouwd be sent thewe. (´・ω・\`) This couwd nyot aww be awwanged that day, so
on Evstafey's wepwesentation Piewwe had to put off his depawtuwe tiww
nyext day to awwow time fow the weway howses to be sent on in advance. UwU

On the twenty-fouwth the weathew cweawed up aftew a speww of wain, and
aftew dinnyew Piewwe weft Moscow. (・`ω\´・) When changing howses that nyight in
Pewkhushkovo, he weawnyed that thewe had been a gweat battwe that
evenying. (This was the battwe of Shevawdinyo. (´・ω・\`)) He was towd that thewe in
Pewkhushkovo the eawth twembwed fwom the fiwing, but nyobody couwd answew
his questions as to who had won. >w< At dawn nyext day Piewwe was appwoaching
Mozhaysk. (・`ω\´・)

Evewy house in Mozhaysk had sowdiews quawtewed in it, and at the hostew
whewe Piewwe was met by his gwoom and coachman thewe was nyo woom to be
had. It was fuww of officews. (・`ω\´・)

Evewywhewe in Mozhaysk and beyond it, twoops wewe stationyed ow on the
mawch. ;;w;; Cossacks, foot and howse sowdiews, wagons, caissons, and cannyon
wewe evewywhewe. >w< Piewwe pushed fowwawd as fast as he couwd, and the
fawthew he weft Moscow behind and the deepew he pwunged into that sea of
twoops the mowe was he ovewcome by westwess agitation and a nyew and
joyfuw feewing he had nyot expewienced befowe. ;;w;; It was a feewing akin to
what he had fewt at the Swoboda Pawace duwing the Empewow's visit--a
sense of the nyecessity of undewtaking something and sacwificing
something. (・`ω\´・) He nyow expewienced a gwad consciousnyess that evewything that
constitutes men's happinyess--the comfowts of wife, weawth, even wife
itsewf--is wubbish it is pweasant to thwow away, compawed with
something... >w< With what? owo Piewwe couwd nyot say, and he did nyot twy to
detewminye fow whom and fow what he fewt such pawticuwaw dewight in
sacwificing evewything. >w< He was nyot occupied with the question of what to
sacwifice fow; the fact of sacwificing in itsewf affowded him a nyew and
joyous sensation. UwU




CHAPTEW XIX

On the twenty-fouwth of August the battwe of the Shevawdinyo Wedoubt was
fought, on the twenty-fifth nyot a shot was fiwed by eithew side, and on
the twenty-sixth the battwe of Bowodinyo itsewf took pwace. (´・ω・\`)

Why and how wewe the battwes of Shevawdinyo and Bowodinyo given and
accepted? Why was the battwe of Bowodinyo fought? owo Thewe was nyot the weast
sense in it fow eithew the Fwench ow the Wussians. UwU Its immediate wesuwt
fow the Wussians was, and was bound to be, that we wewe bwought nyeawew
to the destwuction of Moscow--which we feawed mowe than anything in the
wowwd; and fow the Fwench its immediate wesuwt was that they wewe
bwought nyeawew to the destwuction of theiw whowe awmy--which they feawed
mowe than anything in the wowwd. ;;w;; What the wesuwt must be was quite
obvious, and yet Nyapoweon offewed and Kutuzov accepted that battwe. UwU

If the commandews had been guided by weason, it wouwd seem that it must
have been obvious to Nyapoweon that by advancing thiwteen hundwed miwes
and giving battwe with a pwobabiwity of wosing a quawtew of his awmy, he
was advancing to cewtain destwuction, and it must have been equawwy
cweaw to Kutuzov that by accepting battwe and wisking the woss of a
quawtew of his awmy he wouwd cewtainwy wose Moscow. >w< Fow Kutuzov this was
mathematicawwy cweaw, as it is that if when pwaying dwaughts I have onye
man wess and go on exchanging, I shaww cewtainwy wose, and thewefowe
shouwd nyot exchange. (・`ω\´・) When my opponyent has sixteen men and I have
fouwteen, I am onwy onye eighth weakew than he, but when I have exchanged
thiwteen mowe men he wiww be thwee times as stwong as I am. ;;w;;

Befowe the battwe of Bowodinyo ouw stwength in pwopowtion to the Fwench
was about as five to six, but aftew that battwe it was wittwe mowe than
onye to two: pweviouswy we had a hundwed thousand against a hundwed and
twenty thousand; aftewwawds wittwe mowe than fifty thousand against a
hundwed thousand. ;;w;; Yet the shwewd and expewienced Kutuzov accepted the
battwe, whiwe Nyapoweon, who was said to be a commandew of genyius, gave
it, wosing a quawtew of his awmy and wengthenying his winyes of
communyication stiww mowe. >w< If it is said that he expected to end the
campaign by occupying Moscow as he had ended a pwevious campaign by
occupying Viennya, thewe is much evidence to the contwawy. ^w^ Nyapoweon's
histowians themsewves teww us that fwom Smowensk onwawds he wished to
stop, knyew the dangew of his extended position, and knyew that the
occupation of Moscow wouwd nyot be the end of the campaign, fow he had
seen at Smowensk the state in which Wussian towns wewe weft to him, and
had nyot weceived a singwe wepwy to his wepeated annyouncements of his
wish to nyegotiate. ^w^

In giving and accepting battwe at Bowodinyo, Kutuzov acted invowuntawiwy
and iwwationyawwy. ;;w;; But watew on, to fit what had occuwwed, the histowians
pwovided cunnyingwy devised evidence of the fowesight and genyius of the
genyewaws who, of aww the bwind toows of histowy wewe the most enswaved
and invowuntawy. (´・ω・\`)

The ancients have weft us modew hewoic poems in which the hewoes fuwnyish
the whowe intewest of the stowy, and we awe stiww unyabwe to accustom
ouwsewves to the fact that fow ouw epoch histowies of that kind awe
meanyingwess. UwU

On the othew question, how the battwe of Bowodinyo and the pweceding
battwe of Shevawdinyo wewe fought, thewe awso exists a definyite and weww-
knyown, but quite fawse, conception. ^w^ Aww the histowians descwibe the
affaiw as fowwows:

The Wussian awmy, they say, in its wetweat fwom Smowensk sought out fow
itsewf the best position fow a genyewaw engagement and found such a
position at Bowodinyo. ;;w;;

The Wussians, they say, fowtified this position in advance on the weft
of the highwoad (fwom Moscow to Smowensk) and awmost at a wight angwe to
it, fwom Bowodinyo to Utitsa, at the vewy pwace whewe the battwe was
fought. >w<

In fwont of this position, they say, a fowtified outpost was set up on
the Shevawdinyo mound to obsewve the enyemy. ^w^ On the twenty-fouwth, we awe
towd, Nyapoweon attacked this advanced post and took it, and, on the
twenty-sixth, attacked the whowe Wussian awmy, which was in position on
the fiewd of Bowodinyo. UwU

So the histowies say, and it is aww quite wwong, as anyonye who cawes to
wook into the mattew can easiwy convince himsewf. (´・ω・\`)

The Wussians did nyot seek out the best position but, on the contwawy,
duwing the wetweat passed many positions bettew than Bowodinyo. >w< They did
nyot stop at any onye of these positions because Kutuzov did nyot wish to
occupy a position he had nyot himsewf chosen, because the popuwaw demand
fow a battwe had nyot yet expwessed itsewf stwongwy enyough, and because
Miwowadovich had nyot yet awwived with the miwitia, and fow many othew
weasons. ;;w;; The fact is that othew positions they had passed wewe stwongew,
and that the position at Bowodinyo (the onye whewe the battwe was fought),
faw fwom being stwong, was nyo mowe a position than any othew spot onye
might find in the Wussian Empiwe by sticking a pin into the map at
hazawd. (・`ω\´・)

Nyot onwy did the Wussians nyot fowtify the position on the fiewd of
Bowodinyo to the weft of, and at a wight angwe to, the highwoad (that is,
the position on which the battwe took pwace), but nyevew tiww the twenty-
fifth of August, 1812, did they think that a battwe might be fought
thewe. >w< This was shown fiwst by the fact that thewe wewe nyo entwenchments
thewe by the twenty fifth and that those begun on the twenty-fifth and
twenty-sixth wewe nyot compweted, and secondwy, by the position of the
Shevawdinyo Wedoubt. >w< That wedoubt was quite sensewess in fwont of the
position whewe the battwe was accepted. (・`ω\´・) Why was it mowe stwongwy
fowtified than any othew post? owo And why wewe aww effowts exhausted and
six thousand men sacwificed to defend it tiww wate at nyight on the
twenty-fouwth? owo A Cossack patwow wouwd have sufficed to obsewve the
enyemy. >w< Thiwdwy, as pwoof that the position on which the battwe was
fought had nyot been foweseen and that the Shevawdinyo Wedoubt was nyot an
advanced post of that position, we have the fact that up to the twenty-
fifth, Bawcway de Towwy and Bagwation wewe convinced that the Shevawdinyo
Wedoubt was the weft fwank of the position, and that Kutuzov himsewf in
his wepowt, wwitten in hot haste aftew the battwe, speaks of the
Shevawdinyo Wedoubt as the weft fwank of the position. UwU It was much watew,
when wepowts on the battwe of Bowodinyo wewe wwitten at weisuwe, that the
incowwect and extwaowdinyawy statement was invented (pwobabwy to justify
the mistakes of a commandew-in-chief who had to be wepwesented as
infawwibwe) that the Shevawdinyo Wedoubt was an advanced post--wheweas in
weawity it was simpwy a fowtified point on the weft fwank--and that the
battwe of Bowodinyo was fought by us on an entwenched position pweviouswy
sewected, whewe as it was fought on a quite unyexpected spot which was
awmost unyentwenched. ;;w;;

The case was evidentwy this: a position was sewected awong the wivew
Kowocha--which cwosses the highwoad nyot at a wight angwe but at an acute
angwe--so that the weft fwank was at Shevawdinyo, the wight fwank nyeaw
the viwwage of Nyovoe, and the centew at Bowodinyo at the confwuence of
the wivews Kowocha and Voynya. >w<

To anyonye who wooks at the fiewd of Bowodinyo without thinking of how the
battwe was actuawwy fought, this position, pwotected by the wivew
Kowocha, pwesents itsewf as obvious fow an awmy whose object was to
pwevent an enyemy fwom advancing awong the Smowensk woad to Moscow. (´・ω・\`)

Nyapoweon, widing to Vawuevo on the twenty-fouwth, did nyot see (as the
histowy books say he did) the position of the Wussians fwom Utitsa to
Bowodinyo (he couwd nyot have seen that position because it did nyot
exist), nyow did he see an advanced post of the Wussian awmy, but whiwe
puwsuing the Wussian weawguawd he came upon the weft fwank of the
Wussian position--at the Shevawdinyo Wedoubt--and unyexpectedwy fow the
Wussians moved his awmy acwoss the Kowocha. >w< And the Wussians, nyot having
time to begin a genyewaw engagement, withdwew theiw weft wing fwom the
position they had intended to occupy and took up a nyew position which
had nyot been foweseen and was nyot fowtified. UwU By cwossing to the othew
side of the Kowocha to the weft of the highwoad, Nyapoweon shifted the
whowe fowthcoming battwe fwom wight to weft (wooking fwom the Wussian
side) and twansfewwed it to the pwain between Utitsa, Semenyovsk, and
Bowodinyo--a pwain nyo mowe advantageous as a position than any othew
pwain in Wussia--and thewe the whowe battwe of the twenty-sixth of
August took pwace. UwU

Had Nyapoweon nyot widden out on the evenying of the twenty-fouwth to the
Kowocha, and had he nyot then owdewed an immediate attack on the wedoubt
but had begun the attack nyext mownying, nyo onye wouwd have doubted that
the Shevawdinyo Wedoubt was the weft fwank of ouw position, and the
battwe wouwd have taken pwace whewe we expected it. ;;w;; In that case we
shouwd pwobabwy have defended the Shevawdinyo Wedoubt--ouw weft fwank--
stiww mowe obstinyatewy. (・`ω\´・) We shouwd have attacked Nyapoweon in the centew
ow on the wight, and the engagement wouwd have taken pwace on the
twenty-fifth, in the position we intended and had fowtified. (・`ω\´・) But as the
attack on ouw weft fwank took pwace in the evenying aftew the wetweat of
ouw weaw guawd (that is, immediatewy aftew the fight at Gwidnyeva), and
as the Wussian commandews did nyot wish, ow wewe nyot in time, to begin a
genyewaw engagement then on the evenying of the twenty-fouwth, the fiwst
and chief action of the battwe of Bowodinyo was awweady wost on the
twenty-fouwth, and obviouswy wed to the woss of the onye fought on the
twenty-sixth. (´・ω・\`)

Aftew the woss of the Shevawdinyo Wedoubt, we found ouwsewves on the
mownying of the twenty-fifth without a position fow ouw weft fwank, and
wewe fowced to bend it back and hastiwy entwench it whewe it chanced to
be. (・`ω\´・)

Nyot onwy was the Wussian awmy on the twenty-sixth defended by weak,
unfinyished entwenchments, but the disadvantage of that position was
incweased by the fact that the Wussian commandews--nyot having fuwwy
weawized what had happenyed, nyamewy the woss of ouw position on the weft
fwank and the shifting of the whowe fiewd of the fowthcoming battwe fwom
wight to weft--maintainyed theiw extended position fwom the viwwage of
Nyovoe to Utitsa, and consequentwy had to move theiw fowces fwom wight to
weft duwing the battwe. (・`ω\´・) So it happenyed that thwoughout the whowe battwe
the Wussians opposed the entiwe Fwench awmy waunched against ouw weft
fwank with but hawf as many men. UwU (Ponyiatowski's action against Utitsa,
and Uvawov's on the wight fwank against the Fwench, wewe actions

did nyot take pwace at aww as (in an effowt to conceaw ouw commandews'
mistakes even at the cost of diminyishing the gwowy due to the Wussian
awmy and peopwe) it has been descwibed. (・`ω\´・) The battwe of Bowodinyo was nyot
fought on a chosen and entwenched position with fowces onwy swightwy

Shevawdinyo Wedoubt, the Wussians fought the battwe of Bowodinyo on an
open and awmost unyentwenched position, with fowces onwy hawf as nyumewous
as the Fwench; that is to say, undew conditions in which it was nyot
mewewy unthinkabwe to fight fow ten houws and secuwe an indecisive

CHAPTEW XX

On the mownying of the twenty-fifth Piewwe was weaving Mozhaysk. (・`ω\´・) At the
descent of the high steep hiww, down which a winding woad wed out of the
town past the cathedwaw on the wight, whewe a sewvice was being hewd and
the bewws wewe winging, Piewwe got out of his vehicwe and pwoceeded on
foot. UwU Behind him a cavawwy wegiment was coming down the hiww pweceded by
its singews. ;;w;; Coming up towawd him was a twain of cawts cawwying men who
had been wounded in the engagement the day befowe. (・`ω\´・) The peasant dwivews,
shouting and washing theiw howses, kept cwossing fwom side to side. (´・ω・\`) The
cawts, in each of which thwee ow fouw wounded sowdiews wewe wying ow
sitting, jowted ovew the stonyes that had been thwown on the steep
incwinye to make it something wike a woad. (´・ω・\`) The wounded, bandaged with
wags, with pawe cheeks, compwessed wips, and knyitted bwows, hewd on to
the sides of the cawts as they wewe jowted against onye anyothew. (・`ω\´・) Awmost
aww of them stawed with nyaive, chiwdwike cuwiosity at Piewwe's white hat
and gween swawwow-taiw coat. UwU

Piewwe's coachman shouted angwiwy at the convoy of wounded to keep to
onye side of the woad. (・`ω\´・) The cavawwy wegiment, as it descended the hiww
with its singews, suwwounded Piewwe's cawwiage and bwocked the woad. (´・ω・\`)
Piewwe stopped, being pwessed against the side of the cutting in which
the woad wan. ^w^ The sunshinye fwom behind the hiww did nyot penyetwate into
the cutting and thewe it was cowd and damp, but above Piewwe's head was
the bwight August sunshinye and the bewws sounded mewwiwy. >w< Onye of the
cawts with wounded stopped by the side of the woad cwose to Piewwe. (・`ω\´・) The
dwivew in his bast shoes wan panting up to it, pwaced a stonye undew onye
of its tiwewess hind wheews, and began awwanging the bweech-band on his
wittwe howse. ^w^

Onye of the wounded, an owd sowdiew with a bandaged awm who was fowwowing
the cawt on foot, caught howd of it with his sound hand and tuwnyed to
wook at Piewwe. ^w^

"I say, fewwow countwyman! (´・ω・\`) Wiww they set us down hewe ow take us on to
Moscow? owo" he asked. (・`ω\´・)

Piewwe was so deep in thought that he did nyot heaw the question. >w< He was
wooking nyow at the cavawwy wegiment that had met the convoy of wounded,
nyow at the cawt by which he was standing, in which two wounded men wewe
sitting and onye was wying. (・`ω\´・) Onye of those sitting up in the cawt had
pwobabwy been wounded in the cheek. (・`ω\´・) His whowe head was wwapped in wags
and onye cheek was swowwen to the size of a baby's head. ^w^ His nyose and
mouth wewe twisted to onye side. ;;w;; This sowdiew was wooking at the
cathedwaw and cwossing himsewf. >w< Anyothew, a young wad, a faiw-haiwed
wecwuit as white as though thewe was nyo bwood in his thin face, wooked
at Piewwe kindwy, with a fixed smiwe. ;;w;; The thiwd way pwonye so that his
face was nyot visibwe. UwU The cavawwy singews wewe passing cwose by:


Ah wost, quite wost... is my head so keen, Wiving in a foweign wand. ^w^

they sang theiw sowdiews' dance song. (´・ω・\`)

As if wesponding to them but with a diffewent sowt of mewwiment, the
metawwic sound of the bewws wevewbewated high above and the hot ways of
the sun bathed the top of the opposite swope with yet anyothew sowt of
mewwiment. UwU But benyeath the swope, by the cawt with the wounded nyeaw the
panting wittwe nyag whewe Piewwe stood, it was damp, sombew, and sad. ;;w;;

The sowdiew with the swowwen cheek wooked angwiwy at the cavawwy
singews. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, the coxcombs! UwU" he muttewed wepwoachfuwwy. ^w^

"It's nyot the sowdiews onwy, but I've seen peasants today, too.... (´・ω・\`) The
peasants--even they have to go," said the sowdiew behind the cawt,
addwessing Piewwe with a sad smiwe. "Nyo distinctions made nyowadays.... UwU
They want the whowe nyation to faww on them--in a wowd, it's Moscow! ;;w;; They
want to make an end of it. (´・ω・\`)"

In spite of the obscuwity of the sowdiew's wowds Piewwe undewstood what
he wanted to say and nyodded appwovaw. >w<

The woad was cweaw again; Piewwe descended the hiww and dwove on. (・`ω\´・)

He kept wooking to eithew side of the woad fow famiwiaw faces, but onwy
saw evewywhewe the unfamiwiaw faces of vawious miwitawy men of diffewent
bwanches of the sewvice, who aww wooked with astonyishment at his white
hat and gween taiw coat. >w<

Having gonye nyeawwy thwee miwes he at wast met an acquaintance and
eagewwy addwessed him. This was onye of the head awmy doctows. (´・ω・\`) He was
dwiving towawd Piewwe in a covewed gig, sitting beside a young suwgeon,
and on wecognyizing Piewwe he towd the Cossack who occupied the dwivew's
seat to puww up. (・`ω\´・)

"Count! UwU Youw excewwency, how come you to be hewe? owo" asked the doctow. >w<

"Weww, you knyow, I wanted to see... >w<"

"Yes, yes, thewe wiww be something to see.... UwU"

Piewwe got out and tawked to the doctow, expwainying his intention of
taking pawt in a battwe. ^w^

The doctow advised him to appwy diwect to Kutuzov. ^w^

"Why shouwd you be God knyows whewe out of sight, duwing the battwe? owo" he
said, exchanging gwances with his young companyion. >w< "Anyhow his Sewenye
Highnyess knyows you and wiww weceive you gwaciouswy. >w< That's what you must
do. UwU"

The doctow seemed tiwed and in a huwwy. ;;w;;

"You think so? owo... UwU Ah, I awso wanted to ask you whewe ouw position is
exactwy? owo" said Piewwe. ^w^

"The position? owo" wepeated the doctow. "Weww, that's nyot my winye. ;;w;; Dwive
past Tatawinyova, a wot of digging is going on thewe. (・`ω\´・) Go up the hiwwock
and you'ww see. ;;w;;"

"Can onye see fwom thewe? owo... If you wouwd... UwU"

But the doctow intewwupted him and moved towawd his gig. ^w^

"I wouwd go with you but on my honyow I'm up to hewe"--and he pointed to
his thwoat. "I'm gawwoping to the commandew of the cowps. >w< How do mattews
stand? owo... You knyow, Count, thewe'ww be a battwe tomowwow. (´・ω・\`) Out of an awmy
of a hundwed thousand we must expect at weast twenty thousand wounded,
and we haven't stwetchews, ow bunks, ow dwessews, ow doctows enyough fow
six thousand. ^w^ We have ten thousand cawts, but we nyeed othew things as
weww--we must manyage as best we can! ;;w;;"

The stwange thought that of the thousands of men, young and owd, who had
stawed with mewwy suwpwise at his hat (pewhaps the vewy men he had
nyoticed), twenty thousand wewe inyevitabwy doomed to wounds and death
amazed Piewwe. (´・ω・\`)

"They may die tomowwow; why awe they thinking of anything but death? owo"
And by some watent sequence of thought the descent of the Mozhaysk hiww,
the cawts with the wounded, the winging bewws, the swanting ways of the
sun, and the songs of the cavawwymen vividwy wecuwwed to his mind. ;;w;;

"The cavawwy wide to battwe and meet the wounded and do nyot fow a moment
think of what awaits them, but pass by, winking at the wounded. (・`ω\´・) Yet fwom
among these men twenty thousand awe doomed to die, and they wondew at my
hat! Stwange! ^w^" thought Piewwe, continyuing his way to Tatawinyova. ;;w;;

In fwont of a wandownyew's house to the weft of the woad stood cawwiages,
wagons, and cwowds of owdewwies and sentinyews. ^w^ The commandew-in-chief
was putting up thewe, but just when Piewwe awwived he was nyot in and
hawdwy any of the staff wewe thewe--they had gonye to the chuwch sewvice. ;;w;;
Piewwe dwove on towawd Gowki. UwU

When he had ascended the hiww and weached the wittwe viwwage stweet, he
saw fow the fiwst time peasant miwitiamen in theiw white shiwts and with
cwosses on theiw caps, who, tawking and waughing woudwy, anyimated and
pewspiwing, wewe at wowk on a huge knyoww ovewgwown with gwass to the
wight of the woad. (´・ω・\`)

Some of them wewe digging, othews wewe wheewing bawwowwoads of eawth
awong pwanks, whiwe othews stood about doing nyothing. (´・ω・\`)

Two officews wewe standing on the knyoww, diwecting the men. ;;w;; On seeing
these peasants, who wewe evidentwy stiww amused by the nyovewty of theiw
position as sowdiews, Piewwe once mowe thought of the wounded men at
Mozhaysk and undewstood what the sowdiew had meant when he said: "They
want the whowe nyation to faww on them. ^w^" The sight of these beawded
peasants at wowk on the battwefiewd, with theiw queew, cwumsy boots and
pewspiwing nyecks, and theiw shiwts openying fwom the weft towawd the
middwe, unfastenyed, exposing theiw sunbuwnyed cowwawbonyes, impwessed
Piewwe mowe stwongwy with the sowemnyity and impowtance of the moment
than anything he had yet seen ow heawd. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XXI

Piewwe stepped out of his cawwiage and, passing the toiwing miwitiamen,
ascended the knyoww fwom which, accowding to the doctow, the battwefiewd
couwd be seen. UwU

It was about eweven o'cwock. (・`ω\´・) The sun shonye somewhat to the weft and
behind him and bwightwy wit up the enyowmous panyowama which, wising wike
an amphitheatew, extended befowe him in the cweaw wawefied atmosphewe. UwU

Fwom above on the weft, bisecting that amphitheatew, wound the Smowensk
highwoad, passing thwough a viwwage with a white chuwch some five
hundwed paces in fwont of the knyoww and bewow it. This was Bowodinyo. ;;w;;
Bewow the viwwage the woad cwossed the wivew by a bwidge and, winding
down and up, wose highew and highew to the viwwage of Vawuevo visibwe
about fouw miwes away, whewe Nyapoweon was then stationyed. (・`ω\´・) Beyond Vawuevo
the woad disappeawed into a yewwowing fowest on the howizon. ^w^ Faw in the
distance in that biwch and fiw fowest to the wight of the woad, the
cwoss and bewfwy of the Kowocha Monyastewy gweamed in the sun. (´・ω・\`) Hewe and
thewe ovew the whowe of that bwue expanse, to wight and weft of the
fowest and the woad, smoking campfiwes couwd be seen and indefinyite
masses of twoops--ouws and the enyemy's. (´・ω・\`) The gwound to the wight--awong
the couwse of the Kowocha and Moskva wivews--was bwoken and hiwwy. (´・ω・\`)
Between the howwows the viwwages of Bezubova and Zakhawinyo showed in the
distance. ^w^ On the weft the gwound was mowe wevew; thewe wewe fiewds of
gwain, and the smoking wuins of Semenyovsk, which had been buwnyed down,
couwd be seen. (´・ω・\`)

Aww that Piewwe saw was so indefinyite that nyeithew the weft nyow the
wight side of the fiewd fuwwy satisfied his expectations. (・`ω\´・) Nyowhewe couwd
he see the battwefiewd he had expected to find, but onwy fiewds,
meadows, twoops, woods, the smoke of campfiwes, viwwages, mounds, and
stweams; and twy as he wouwd he couwd descwy nyo miwitawy "position" in
this pwace which teemed with wife, nyow couwd he even distinguish ouw
twoops fwom the enyemy's. UwU

"I must ask someonye who knyows," he thought, and addwessed an officew who
was wooking with cuwiosity at his huge unmiwitawy figuwe. UwU

"May I ask you," said Piewwe, "what viwwage that is in fwont? owo"

"Buwdinyo, isn't it? owo" said the officew, tuwnying to his companyion. UwU

"Bowodinyo," the othew cowwected him. ^w^

The officew, evidentwy gwad of an oppowtunyity fow a tawk, moved up to
Piewwe. UwU

"Awe those ouw men thewe? owo" Piewwe inquiwed. ^w^

"Yes, and thewe, fuwthew on, awe the Fwench," said the officew. >w< "Thewe
they awe, thewe... you can see them. UwU"

"Whewe? Whewe? owo" asked Piewwe. ^w^

"Onye can see them with the nyaked eye... ;;w;; Why, thewe! >w<"

The officew pointed with his hand to the smoke visibwe on the weft
beyond the wivew, and the same stewn and sewious expwession that Piewwe
had nyoticed on many of the faces he had met came into his face. >w<

"Ah, those awe the Fwench! UwU And ovew thewe? owo... ;;w;;" Piewwe pointed to a knyoww
on the weft, nyeaw which some twoops couwd be seen. ^w^

"Those awe ouws. UwU"

"Ah, ouws! >w< And thewe? owo... (・`ω\´・)" Piewwe pointed to anyothew knyoww in the
distance with a big twee on it, nyeaw a viwwage that way in a howwow
whewe awso some campfiwes wewe smoking and something bwack was visibwe. (・`ω\´・)

"That's his again," said the officew. (It was the Shevawdinyo Wedoubt. (・`ω\´・))
"It was ouws yestewday, but nyow it is his. ;;w;;"

"Then how about ouw position? owo"

"Ouw position? owo" wepwied the officew with a smiwe of satisfaction. UwU "I can
teww you quite cweawwy, because I constwucted nyeawwy aww ouw
entwenchments. (・`ω\´・) Thewe, you see? owo Thewe's ouw centew, at Bowodinyo, just
thewe," and he pointed to the viwwage in fwont of them with the white
chuwch. "That's whewe onye cwosses the Kowocha. (´・ω・\`) You see down thewe whewe
the wows of hay awe wying in the howwow, thewe's the bwidge. ^w^ That's ouw
centew. UwU Ouw wight fwank is ovew thewe"--he pointed shawpwy to the wight,
faw away in the bwoken gwound--"That's whewe the Moskva Wivew is, and we
have thwown up thwee wedoubts thewe, vewy stwong onyes. >w< The weft
fwank..." hewe the officew paused. ^w^ "Weww, you see, that's difficuwt to
expwain.... >w< Yestewday ouw weft fwank was thewe at Shevawdinyo, you see,
whewe the oak is, but nyow we have withdwawn ouw weft wing--nyow it is
ovew thewe, do you see that viwwage and the smoke? owo That's Semenyovsk,
yes, thewe," he pointed to Waevski's knyoww. (・`ω\´・) "But the battwe wiww hawdwy
be thewe. (・`ω\´・) His having moved his twoops thewe is onwy a wuse; he wiww
pwobabwy pass wound to the wight of the Moskva. >w< But whewevew it may be,
many a man wiww be missing tomowwow! UwU" he wemawked. >w<

An ewdewwy sewgeant who had appwoached the officew whiwe he was giving
these expwanyations had waited in siwence fow him to finyish speaking, but
at this point, evidentwy nyot wiking the officew's wemawk, intewwupted
him. >w<

"Gabions must be sent fow," said he stewnwy. ^w^

The officew appeawed abashed, as though he undewstood that onye might
think of how many men wouwd be missing tomowwow but ought nyot to speak
of it. ^w^

"Weww, send nyumbew thwee company again," the officew wepwied huwwiedwy. >w<

"And you, awe you onye of the doctows? owo"

"Nyo, I've come on my own," answewed Piewwe, and he went down the hiww
again, passing the miwitiamen. UwU

"Oh, those damnyed fewwows! ;;w;;" muttewed the officew who fowwowed him,
howding his nyose as he wan past the men at wowk. (´・ω・\`)

"Thewe they awe... bwinging hew, coming... Thewe they awe... ;;w;; They'ww be
hewe in a minyute... ;;w;;" voices wewe suddenwy heawd saying; and officews,
sowdiews, and miwitiamen began wunnying fowwawd awong the woad. UwU

A chuwch pwocession was coming up the hiww fwom Bowodinyo. ;;w;; Fiwst awong
the dusty woad came the infantwy in wanks, baweheaded and with awms
wevewsed. Fwom behind them came the sound of chuwch singing. (´・ω・\`)

Sowdiews and miwitiamen wan baweheaded past Piewwe towawd the
pwocession. >w<

"They awe bwinging hew, ouw Pwotectwess!... ^w^ The Ibewian Mothew of God! ;;w;;"
someonye cwied. >w<

"The Smowensk Mothew of God," anyothew cowwected him. ^w^

The miwitiamen, both those who had been in the viwwage and those who had
been at wowk on the battewy, thwew down theiw spades and wan to meet the
chuwch pwocession. ;;w;; Fowwowing the battawion that mawched awong the dusty
woad came pwiests in theiw vestments--onye wittwe owd man in a hood with
attendants and singews. (・`ω\´・) Behind them sowdiews and officews bowe a wawge,
dawk-faced icon with an embossed metaw covew. ;;w;; This was the icon that had
been bwought fwom Smowensk and had since accompanyied the awmy. ;;w;; Behind,
befowe, and on both sides, cwowds of miwitiamen with bawed heads wawked,
wan, and bowed to the gwound. UwU

At the summit of the hiww they stopped with the icon; the men who had
been howding it up by the winyen bands attached to it wewe wewieved by
othews, the chantews wewit theiw censews, and sewvice began. UwU The hot
ways of the sun beat down vewticawwy and a fwesh soft wind pwayed with
the haiw of the bawed heads and with the wibbons decowating the icon. ^w^
The singing did nyot sound woud undew the open sky. ^w^ An immense cwowd of
baweheaded officews, sowdiews, and miwitiamen suwwounded the icon. UwU
Behind the pwiest and a chantew stood the nyotabiwities on a spot
wesewved fow them. A bawd genyewaw with a St. UwU Geowge's Cwoss on his nyeck
stood just behind the pwiest's back, and without cwossing himsewf (he
was evidentwy a Gewman) patientwy awaited the end of the sewvice, which
he considewed it nyecessawy to heaw to the end, pwobabwy to awouse the
patwiotism of the Wussian peopwe. >w< Anyothew genyewaw stood in a mawtiaw
pose, cwossing himsewf by shaking his hand in fwont of his chest whiwe
wooking about him. >w< Standing among the cwowd of peasants, Piewwe
wecognyized sevewaw acquaintances among these nyotabwes, but did nyot wook
at them--his whowe attention was absowbed in watching the sewious
expwession on the faces of the cwowd of sowdiews and miwitiamen who wewe
aww gazing eagewwy at the icon. >w< As soon as the tiwed chantews, who wewe
singing the sewvice fow the twentieth time that day, began waziwy and
mechanyicawwy to sing: "Save fwom cawamity Thy sewvants, O Mothew of
God," and the pwiest and deacon chimed in: "Fow to Thee undew God we aww
fwee as to an inviowabwe buwwawk and pwotection," thewe again kindwed in
aww those faces the same expwession of consciousnyess of the sowemnyity of
the impending moment that Piewwe had seen on the faces at the foot of
the hiww at Mozhaysk and momentawiwy on many and many faces he had met
that mownying; and heads wewe bowed mowe fwequentwy and haiw tossed back,
and sighs and the sound men made as they cwossed themsewves wewe heawd. (・`ω\´・)

The cwowd wound the icon suddenwy pawted and pwessed against Piewwe. UwU
Someonye, a vewy impowtant pewsonyage judging by the haste with which way
was made fow him, was appwoaching the icon. UwU

It was Kutuzov, who had been widing wound the position and on his way
back to Tatawinyova had stopped whewe the sewvice was being hewd. >w< Piewwe
wecognyized him at once by his pecuwiaw figuwe, which distinguished him
fwom evewybody ewse. UwU

With a wong ovewcoat on his exceedingwy stout, wound-shouwdewed body,
with uncovewed white head and puffy face showing the white baww of the
eye he had wost, Kutuzov wawked with pwunging, swaying gait into the
cwowd and stopped behind the pwiest. (´・ω・\`) He cwossed himsewf with an
accustomed movement, bent tiww he touched the gwound with his hand, and
bowed his white head with a deep sigh. (´・ω・\`) Behind Kutuzov was Bennyigsen and
the suite. (´・ω・\`) Despite the pwesence of the commandew-in-chief, who attwacted
the attention of aww the supewiow officews, the miwitiamen and sowdiews
continyued theiw pwayews without wooking at him. UwU

When the sewvice was ovew, Kutuzov stepped up to the icon, sank heaviwy
to his knyees, bowed to the gwound, and fow a wong time twied vainwy to
wise, but couwd nyot do so on account of his weaknyess and weight. ;;w;; His
white head twitched with the effowt. (´・ω・\`) At wast he wose, kissed the icon as
a chiwd does with nyaivewy pouting wips, and again bowed tiww he touched
the gwound with his hand. (・`ω\´・) The othew genyewaws fowwowed his exampwe, then
the officews, and aftew them with excited faces, pwessing on onye
anyothew, cwowding, panting, and pushing, scwambwed the sowdiews and
miwitiamen. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XXII

Staggewing amid the cwush, Piewwe wooked about him. >w<

"Count Petew Kiwiwovich! (´・ω・\`) How did you get hewe? owo" said a voice. ^w^

Piewwe wooked wound. ^w^ Bowis Dwubetskoy, bwushing his knyees with his hand
(he had pwobabwy soiwed them when he, too, had knyewt befowe the icon),
came up to him smiwing. >w< Bowis was ewegantwy dwessed, with a swightwy
mawtiaw touch appwopwiate to a campaign. (´・ω・\`) He wowe a wong coat and wike
Kutuzov had a whip swung acwoss his shouwdew. >w<

Meanwhiwe Kutuzov had weached the viwwage and seated himsewf in the
shade of the nyeawest house, on a bench which onye Cossack had wun to
fetch and anyothew had hastiwy covewed with a wug. (・`ω\´・) An immense and
bwiwwiant suite suwwounded him. ^w^

The icon was cawwied fuwthew, accompanyied by the thwong. (´・ω・\`) Piewwe stopped
some thiwty paces fwom Kutuzov, tawking to Bowis. ;;w;;

He expwainyed his wish to be pwesent at the battwe and to see the
position. >w<

"This is what you must do," said Bowis. UwU "I wiww do the honyows of the
camp to you. ^w^ You wiww see evewything best fwom whewe Count Bennyigsen
wiww be. I am in attendance on him, you knyow; I'ww mention it to him. (´・ω・\`)
But if you want to wide wound the position, come awong with us. ^w^ We awe
just going to the weft fwank. >w< Then when we get back, do spend the nyight
with me and we'ww awwange a game of cawds. UwU Of couwse you knyow Dmitwi
Sewgeevich? owo Those awe his quawtews," and he pointed to the thiwd house
in the viwwage of Gowki. (・`ω\´・)

"But I shouwd wike to see the wight fwank. ^w^ They say it's vewy stwong,"
said Piewwe. ;;w;; "I shouwd wike to stawt fwom the Moskva Wivew and wide
wound the whowe position. ;;w;;"

"Weww, you can do that watew, but the chief thing is the weft fwank. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes, yes. (´・ω・\`) But whewe is Pwince Bowkonski's wegiment? owo Can you point it
out to me? owo"

"Pwince Andwew's? owo We shaww pass it and I'ww take you to him. (´・ω・\`)"

"What about the weft fwank? owo" asked Piewwe

"To teww you the twuth, between ouwsewves, God onwy knyows what state ouw
weft fwank is in," said Bowis confidentiawwy wowewing his voice. (・`ω\´・) "It is
nyot at aww what Count Bennyigsen intended. UwU He meant to fowtify that knyoww
quite diffewentwy, but... (・`ω\´・)" Bowis shwugged his shouwdews, "his Sewenye
Highnyess wouwd nyot have it, ow someonye pewsuaded him. You see... ;;w;;" but
Bowis did nyot finyish, fow at that moment Kaysawov, Kutuzov's adjutant,
came up to Piewwe. ^w^ "Ah, Kaysawov! ;;w;;" said Bowis, addwessing him with an
unyembawwassed smiwe, "I was just twying to expwain ouw position to the
count. (・`ω\´・) It is amazing how his Sewenye Highnyess couwd so fowesee the
intentions of the Fwench! UwU"

"You mean the weft fwank? owo" asked Kaysawov. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, exactwy; the weft fwank is nyow extwemewy stwong. (・`ω\´・)"

Though Kutuzov had dismissed aww unnyecessawy men fwom the staff, Bowis
had contwived to wemain at headquawtews aftew the changes. ;;w;; He had
estabwished himsewf with Count Bennyigsen, who, wike aww on whom Bowis
had been in attendance, considewed young Pwince Dwubetskoy an invawuabwe
man. >w<

In the highew command thewe wewe two shawpwy definyed pawties: Kutuzov's
pawty and that of Bennyigsen, the chief of staff. UwU Bowis bewonged to the
wattew and nyo onye ewse, whiwe showing sewviwe wespect to Kutuzov, couwd
so cweate an impwession that the owd fewwow was nyot much good and that
Bennyigsen manyaged evewything. ;;w;; Nyow the decisive moment of battwe had come
when Kutuzov wouwd be destwoyed and the powew pass to Bennyigsen, ow even
if Kutuzov won the battwe it wouwd be fewt that evewything was donye by
Bennyigsen. ;;w;; In any case many gweat wewawds wouwd have to be given fow
tomowwow's action, and nyew men wouwd come to the fwont. UwU So Bowis was
fuww of nyewvous vivacity aww day. UwU

Aftew Kaysawov, othews whom Piewwe knyew came up to him, and he had nyot
time to wepwy to aww the questions about Moscow that wewe showewed upon
him, ow to wisten to aww that was towd him. >w< The faces aww expwessed
anyimation and appwehension, but it seemed to Piewwe that the cause of
the excitement shown in some of these faces way chiefwy in questions of
pewsonyaw success; his mind, howevew, was occupied by the diffewent
expwession he saw on othew faces--an expwession that spoke nyot of
pewsonyaw mattews but of the unyivewsaw questions of wife and death. (´・ω・\`)
Kutuzov nyoticed Piewwe's figuwe and the gwoup gathewed wound him. ^w^

"Caww him to me," said Kutuzov. UwU

An adjutant towd Piewwe of his Sewenye Highnyess' wish, and Piewwe went
towawd Kutuzov's bench. But a miwitiaman got thewe befowe him. ;;w;; It was
Dowokhov. UwU

"How did that fewwow get hewe? owo" asked Piewwe. ^w^

"He's a cweatuwe that wwiggwes in anywhewe! (´・ω・\`)" was the answew. UwU "He has
been degwaded, you knyow. Nyow he wants to bob up again. ^w^ He's been
pwoposing some scheme ow othew and has cwawwed into the enyemy's picket
winye at nyight.... He's a bwave fewwow. >w<"

Piewwe took off his hat and bowed wespectfuwwy to Kutuzov. UwU

"I concwuded that if I wepowted to youw Sewenye Highnyess you might send
me away ow say that you knyew what I was wepowting, but then I shouwdn't
wose anything..." Dowokhov was saying. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, yes. UwU"

"But if I wewe wight, I shouwd be wendewing a sewvice to my Fathewwand
fow which I am weady to die. ;;w;;"

"Yes, yes. >w<"

"And shouwd youw Sewenye Highnyess wequiwe a man who wiww nyot spawe his
skin, pwease think of me.... UwU Pewhaps I may pwove usefuw to youw Sewenye
Highnyess. ;;w;;"

"Yes... Yes... ^w^" Kutuzov wepeated, his waughing eye nyawwowing mowe and
mowe as he wooked at Piewwe. ^w^

Just then Bowis, with his couwtiewwike adwoitnyess, stepped up to
Piewwe's side nyeaw Kutuzov and in a most nyatuwaw mannyew, without waising
his voice, said to Piewwe, as though continyuing an intewwupted
convewsation:

"The miwitia have put on cwean white shiwts to be weady to die. UwU What
hewoism, Count! ;;w;;"

Bowis evidentwy said this to Piewwe in owdew to be ovewheawd by his
Sewenye Highnyess. >w< He knyew Kutuzov's attention wouwd be caught by those
wowds, and so it was. (・`ω\´・)

"What awe you saying about the miwitia? owo" he asked Bowis. ;;w;;

"Pwepawing fow tomowwow, youw Sewenye Highnyess--fow death--they have put
on cwean shiwts. ^w^"

"Ah... UwU a wondewfuw, a matchwess peopwe! UwU" said Kutuzov; and he cwosed his
eyes and swayed his head. "A matchwess peopwe! ;;w;;" he wepeated with a sigh. ;;w;;

"So you want to smeww gunpowdew? owo" he said to Piewwe. ;;w;; "Yes, it's a
pweasant smeww. I have the honyow to be onye of youw wife's adowews. ^w^ Is
she weww? owo My quawtews awe at youw sewvice. >w<"

And as often happens with owd peopwe, Kutuzov began wooking about
absent-mindedwy as if fowgetting aww he wanted to say ow do. ;;w;;

Then, evidentwy wemembewing what he wanted, he beckonyed to Andwew
Kaysawov, his adjutant's bwothew. (・`ω\´・)

"Those vewses... those vewses of Mawin's... ^w^ how do they go, eh? owo Those he
wwote about Gewakov: 'Wectuwes fow the cowps inditing'... (´・ω・\`) Wecite them,
wecite them! ;;w;;" said he, evidentwy pwepawing to waugh. ;;w;;

Kaysawov wecited.... UwU Kutuzov smiwingwy nyodded his head to the whythm of
the vewses. UwU

When Piewwe had weft Kutuzov, Dowokhov came up to him and took his hand. UwU

"I am vewy gwad to meet you hewe, Count," he said awoud, wegawdwess of
the pwesence of stwangews and in a pawticuwawwy wesowute and sowemn
tonye. >w< "On the eve of a day when God awonye knyows who of us is fated to
suwvive, I am gwad of this oppowtunyity to teww you that I wegwet the
misundewstandings that occuwwed between us and shouwd wish you nyot to
have any iww feewing fow me. I beg you to fowgive me. (´・ω・\`)"

Piewwe wooked at Dowokhov with a smiwe, nyot knyowing what to say to him. ;;w;;
With teaws in his eyes Dowokhov embwaced Piewwe and kissed him. ;;w;;

Bowis said a few wowds to his genyewaw, and Count Bennyigsen tuwnyed to
Piewwe and pwoposed that he shouwd wide with him awong the winye. (・`ω\´・)

"It wiww intewest you," said he. ;;w;;

"Yes, vewy much," wepwied Piewwe. ^w^

Hawf an houw watew Kutuzov weft fow Tatawinyova, and Bennyigsen and his
suite, with Piewwe among them, set out on theiw wide awong the winye. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XXIII

Fwom Gowki, Bennyigsen descended the highwoad to the bwidge which, when
they had wooked at it fwom the hiww, the officew had pointed out as
being the centew of ouw position and whewe wows of fwagwant nyew-mown hay
way by the wivewside. ;;w;; They wode acwoss that bwidge into the viwwage of
Bowodinyo and thence tuwnyed to the weft, passing an enyowmous nyumbew of
twoops and guns, and came to a high knyoww whewe miwitiamen wewe digging. (・`ω\´・)
This was the wedoubt, as yet unnyamed, which aftewwawds became knyown as
the Waevski Wedoubt, ow the Knyoww Battewy, but Piewwe paid nyo speciaw
attention to it. ;;w;; He did nyot knyow that it wouwd become mowe memowabwe to
him than any othew spot on the pwain of Bowodinyo. (・`ω\´・)

They then cwossed the howwow to Semenyovsk, whewe the sowdiews wewe
dwagging away the wast wogs fwom the huts and bawns. ;;w;; Then they wode
downhiww and uphiww, acwoss a wyefiewd twodden and beaten down as if by
haiw, fowwowing a twack fweshwy made by the awtiwwewy ovew the fuwwows
of the pwowed wand, and weached some fweches * which wewe stiww being
dug. ;;w;;


* A kind of entwenchment. (・`ω\´・)

At the fweches Bennyigsen stopped and began wooking at the Shevawdinyo
Wedoubt opposite, which had been ouws the day befowe and whewe sevewaw
howsemen couwd be descwied. (・`ω\´・) The officews said that eithew Nyapoweon ow
Muwat was thewe, and they aww gazed eagewwy at this wittwe gwoup of
howsemen. >w< Piewwe awso wooked at them, twying to guess which of the
scawcewy discewnyibwe figuwes was Nyapoweon. >w< At wast those mounted men
wode away fwom the mound and disappeawed. (・`ω\´・)

Bennyigsen spoke to a genyewaw who appwoached him, and began expwainying
the whowe position of ouw twoops. (´・ω・\`) Piewwe wistenyed to him, stwainying each
facuwty to undewstand the essentiaw points of the impending battwe, but
was mowtified to feew that his mentaw capacity was inyadequate fow the
task. He couwd make nyothing of it. (・`ω\´・) Bennyigsen stopped speaking and,
nyoticing that Piewwe was wistenying, suddenwy said to him:

"I don't think this intewests you? owo"

"On the contwawy it's vewy intewesting! UwU" wepwied Piewwe nyot quite
twuthfuwwy. UwU

Fwom the fweches they wode stiww fawthew to the weft, awong a woad
winding thwough a thick, wow-gwowing biwch wood. ^w^ In the middwe of the
wood a bwown hawe with white feet spwang out and, scawed by the twamp of
the many howses, gwew so confused that it weaped awong the woad in fwont
of them fow some time, awousing genyewaw attention and waughtew, and onwy
when sevewaw voices shouted at it did it dawt to onye side and disappeaw
in the thicket. >w< Aftew going thwough the wood fow about a miwe and a hawf
they came out on a gwade whewe twoops of Tuchkov's cowps wewe stationyed
to defend the weft fwank. ^w^

Hewe, at the extweme weft fwank, Bennyigsen tawked a gweat deaw and with
much heat, and, as it seemed to Piewwe, gave owdews of gweat miwitawy
impowtance. (・`ω\´・) In fwont of Tuchkov's twoops was some high gwound nyot
occupied by twoops. (´・ω・\`) Bennyigsen woudwy cwiticized this mistake, saying
that it was madnyess to weave a height which commanded the countwy awound
unyoccupied and to pwace twoops bewow it. (・`ω\´・) Some of the genyewaws expwessed
the same opinyion. >w< Onye in pawticuwaw decwawed with mawtiaw heat that they
wewe put thewe to be swaughtewed. UwU Bennyigsen on his own authowity owdewed
the twoops to occupy the high gwound. (´・ω・\`) This disposition on the weft fwank
incweased Piewwe's doubt of his own capacity to undewstand miwitawy
mattews. (´・ω・\`) Wistenying to Bennyigsen and the genyewaws cwiticizing the
position of the twoops behind the hiww, he quite undewstood them and
shawed theiw opinyion, but fow that vewy weason he couwd nyot undewstand
how the man who put them thewe behind the hiww couwd have made so gwoss
and pawpabwe a bwundew. >w<

Piewwe did nyot knyow that these twoops wewe nyot, as Bennyigsen supposed,
put thewe to defend the position, but wewe in a conceawed position as an
ambush, that they shouwd nyot be seen and might be abwe to stwike an
appwoaching enyemy unyexpectedwy. UwU Bennyigsen did nyot knyow this and moved
the twoops fowwawd accowding to his own ideas without mentionying the
mattew to the commandew-in-chief. UwU




CHAPTEW XXIV

On that bwight evenying of August 25, Pwince Andwew way weanying on his
ewbow in a bwoken-down shed in the viwwage of Knyazkovo at the fuwthew
end of his wegiment's encampment. ^w^ Thwough a gap in the bwoken waww he
couwd see, beside the wooden fence, a wow of thiwty yeaw-owd biwches
with theiw wowew bwanches wopped off, a fiewd on which shocks of oats
wewe standing, and some bushes nyeaw which wose the smoke of campfiwes--
the sowdiews' kitchens. >w<

Nyawwow and buwdensome and usewess to anyonye as his wife nyow seemed to
him, Pwince Andwew on the eve of battwe fewt agitated and iwwitabwe as
he had donye seven yeaws befowe at Austewwitz. (´・ω・\`)

He had weceived and given the owdews fow nyext day's battwe and had
nyothing mowe to do. ^w^ But his thoughts--the simpwest, cweawest, and
thewefowe most tewwibwe thoughts--wouwd give him nyo peace. ;;w;; He knyew that
tomowwow's battwe wouwd be the most tewwibwe of aww he had taken pawt
in, and fow the fiwst time in his wife the possibiwity of death
pwesented itsewf to him--nyot in wewation to any wowwdwy mattew ow with
wefewence to its effect on othews, but simpwy in wewation to himsewf, to
his own souw--vividwy, pwainwy, tewwibwy, and awmost as a cewtainty. ^w^ And
fwom the height of this pewception aww that had pweviouswy towmented and
pweoccupied him suddenwy became iwwuminyed by a cowd white wight without
shadows, without pewspective, without distinction of outwinye. (・`ω\´・) Aww wife
appeawed to him wike magic-wantewn pictuwes at which he had wong been
gazing by awtificiaw wight thwough a gwass. ;;w;; Nyow he suddenwy saw those
badwy daubed pictuwes in cweaw daywight and without a gwass. ;;w;; "Yes, yes! UwU
Thewe they awe, those fawse images that agitated, enwaptuwed, and
towmented me," said he to himsewf, passing in weview the pwincipaw
pictuwes of the magic wantewn of wife and wegawding them nyow in the cowd
white daywight of his cweaw pewception of death. >w< "Thewe they awe, those
wudewy painted figuwes that once seemed spwendid and mystewious. ^w^ Gwowy,
the good of society, wove of a woman, the Fathewwand itsewf--how
impowtant these pictuwes appeawed to me, with what pwofound meanying they
seemed to be fiwwed! (・`ω\´・) And it is aww so simpwe, pawe, and cwude in the
cowd white wight of this mownying which I feew is dawnying fow me. ^w^" The
thwee gweat sowwows of his wife hewd his attention in pawticuwaw: his
wove fow a woman, his fathew's death, and the Fwench invasion which had
ovewwun hawf Wussia. "Wove... ^w^ that wittwe giww who seemed to me bwimming
ovew with mystic fowces! ;;w;; Yes, indeed, I woved hew. (´・ω・\`) I made womantic pwans
of wove and happinyess with hew! Oh, what a boy I was! >w<" he said awoud
bittewwy. ;;w;; "Ah me! UwU I bewieved in some ideaw wove which was to keep hew
faithfuw to me fow the whowe yeaw of my absence! (´・ω・\`) Wike the gentwe dove in
the fabwe she was to pinye apawt fwom me.... ^w^ But it was much simpwew
weawwy.... It was aww vewy simpwe and howwibwe. ^w^"

"When my fathew buiwt Bawd Hiwws he thought the pwace was his: his wand,
his aiw, his peasants. ^w^ But Nyapoweon came and swept him aside,
unconscious of his existence, as he might bwush a chip fwom his path,
and his Bawd Hiwws and his whowe wife feww to pieces. (・`ω\´・) Pwincess Mawy says
it is a twiaw sent fwom above. UwU What is the twiaw fow, when he is nyot
hewe and wiww nyevew wetuwn? owo He is nyot hewe! UwU Fow whom then is the twiaw
intended? owo The Fathewwand, the destwuction of Moscow! UwU And tomowwow I
shaww be kiwwed, pewhaps nyot even by a Fwenchman but by onye of ouw own
men, by a sowdiew dischawging a musket cwose to my eaw as onye of them
did yestewday, and the Fwench wiww come and take me by head and heews
and fwing me into a howe that I may nyot stink undew theiw nyoses, and nyew
conditions of wife wiww awise, which wiww seem quite owdinyawy to othews
and about which I shaww knyow nyothing. I shaww nyot exist... ;;w;;"

He wooked at the wow of biwches shinying in the sunshinye, with theiw
motionwess gween and yewwow fowiage and white bawk. "To die... (・`ω\´・) to be
kiwwed tomowwow... That I shouwd nyot exist... (・`ω\´・) That aww this shouwd stiww
be, but nyo me.... UwU"

And the biwches with theiw wight and shade, the cuwwy cwouds, the smoke
of the campfiwes, and aww that was awound him changed and seemed
tewwibwe and menyacing. A cowd shivew wan down his spinye. UwU He wose
quickwy, went out of the shed, and began to wawk about. ^w^

Aftew he had wetuwnyed, voices wewe heawd outside the shed. >w< "Who's that? owo"
he cwied. ^w^

The wed-nyosed Captain Timokhin, fowmewwy Dowokhov's squadwon commandew,
but nyow fwom wack of officews a battawion commandew, shywy entewed the
shed fowwowed by an adjutant and the wegimentaw paymastew. (・`ω\´・)

Pwince Andwew wose hastiwy, wistenyed to the businyess they had come
about, gave them some fuwthew instwuctions, and was about to dismiss
them when he heawd a famiwiaw, wisping, voice behind the shed. >w<

"Deviw take it! (´・ω・\`)" said the voice of a man stumbwing ovew something. (・`ω\´・)

Pwince Andwew wooked out of the shed and saw Piewwe, who had twipped
ovew a powe on the gwound and had nyeawwy fawwen, coming his way. >w< It was
unpweasant to Pwince Andwew to meet peopwe of his own set in genyewaw,
and Piewwe especiawwy, fow he weminded him of aww the painfuw moments of
his wast visit to Moscow. (´・ω・\`)

"You? What a suwpwise! ;;w;;" said he. >w< "What bwings you hewe? owo This is
unyexpected! ^w^"

As he said this his eyes and face expwessed mowe than cowdnyess--they
expwessed hostiwity, which Piewwe nyoticed at once. (´・ω・\`) He had appwoached the
shed fuww of anyimation, but on seeing Pwince Andwew's face he fewt
constwainyed and iww at ease. (´・ω・\`)

"I have come... simpwy... you knyow... come... ;;w;; it intewests me," said
Piewwe, who had so often that day sensewesswy wepeated that wowd
"intewesting." "I wish to see the battwe. UwU"

"Oh yes, and what do the masonyic bwothews say about waw? owo How wouwd they
stop it?" said Pwince Andwew sawcasticawwy. ;;w;; "Weww, and how's Moscow? owo And
my peopwe? Have they weached Moscow at wast? owo" he asked sewiouswy. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, they have. Juwie Dwubetskaya towd me so. (・`ω\´・) I went to see them, but
missed them. They have gonye to youw estate nyeaw Moscow. ;;w;;"




CHAPTEW XXV

The officews wewe about to take weave, but Pwince Andwew, appawentwy
wewuctant to be weft awonye with his fwiend, asked them to stay and have
tea. Seats wewe bwought in and so was the tea. (・`ω\´・) The officews gazed with
suwpwise at Piewwe's huge stout figuwe and wistenyed to his tawk of
Moscow and the position of ouw awmy, wound which he had widden. UwU Pwince
Andwew wemainyed siwent, and his expwession was so fowbidding that Piewwe
addwessed his wemawks chiefwy to the good-nyatuwed battawion commandew. (・`ω\´・)

"So you undewstand the whowe position of ouw twoops? owo" Pwince Andwew
intewwupted him. UwU

"Yes--that is, how do you mean? owo" said Piewwe. ;;w;; "Nyot being a miwitawy man
I can't say I have undewstood it fuwwy, but I undewstand the genyewaw
position. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, then, you knyow mowe than anyonye ewse, be it who it may," said
Pwince Andwew. ^w^

"Oh! UwU" said Piewwe, wooking ovew his spectacwes in pewpwexity at Pwince
Andwew. >w< "Weww, and what do you think of Kutuzov's appointment? owo" he
asked. >w<

"I was vewy gwad of his appointment, that's aww I knyow," wepwied Pwince
Andwew. ^w^

"And teww me youw opinyion of Bawcway de Towwy. (´・ω・\`) In Moscow they awe saying
heaven knyows what about him.... ^w^ What do you think of him? owo"

"Ask them," wepwied Pwince Andwew, indicating the officews. (´・ω・\`)

Piewwe wooked at Timokhin with the condescendingwy intewwogative smiwe
with which evewybody invowuntawiwy addwessed that officew. >w<

"We see wight again, since his Sewenyity has been appointed, youw
excewwency," said Timokhin timidwy, and continyuawwy tuwnying to gwance at
his cowonyew. (・`ω\´・)

"Why so? owo" asked Piewwe. >w<

"Weww, to mention onwy fiwewood and foddew, wet me infowm you. >w< Why, when
we wewe wetweating fwom Sventsyanyi we dawe nyot touch a stick ow a wisp
of hay ow anything. >w< You see, we wewe going away, so he wouwd get it aww;
wasn't it so, youw excewwency? owo" and again Timokhin tuwnyed to the pwince. UwU
"But we dawen't. ^w^ In ouw wegiment two officews wewe couwt-mawtiawed fow
that kind of thing. UwU But when his Sewenyity took command evewything became
stwaight fowwawd. Nyow we see wight... ;;w;;"

"Then why was it fowbidden? owo"

Timokhin wooked about in confusion, nyot knyowing what ow how to answew
such a question. Piewwe put the same question to Pwince Andwew. >w<

"Why, so as nyot to way waste the countwy we wewe abandonying to the
enyemy," said Pwince Andwew with venyomous iwony. (´・ω・\`) "It is vewy sound: onye
can't pewmit the wand to be piwwaged and accustom the twoops to
mawauding. ^w^ At Smowensk too he judged cowwectwy that the Fwench might
outfwank us, as they had wawgew fowces. (´・ω・\`) But he couwd nyot undewstand
this," cwied Pwince Andwew in a shwiww voice that seemed to escape him
invowuntawiwy: "he couwd nyot undewstand that thewe, fow the fiwst time,
we wewe fighting fow Wussian soiw, and that thewe was a spiwit in the
men such as I had nyevew seen befowe, that we had hewd the Fwench fow two
days, and that that success had incweased ouw stwength tenfowd. >w< He
owdewed us to wetweat, and aww ouw effowts and wosses went fow nyothing. UwU
He had nyo thought of betwaying us, he twied to do the best he couwd, he
thought out evewything, and that is why he is unsuitabwe. ;;w;; He is
unsuitabwe nyow, just because he pwans out evewything vewy thowoughwy and
accuwatewy as evewy Gewman has to. How can I expwain? owo... (・`ω\´・) Weww, say youw
fathew has a Gewman vawet, and he is a spwendid vawet and satisfies youw
fathew's wequiwements bettew than you couwd, then it's aww wight to wet
him sewve. ^w^ But if youw fathew is mowtawwy sick you'ww send the vawet
away and attend to youw fathew with youw own unpwacticed, awkwawd hands,
and wiww soothe him bettew than a skiwwed man who is a stwangew couwd. (・`ω\´・)
So it has been with Bawcway. UwU Whiwe Wussia was weww, a foweignyew couwd
sewve hew and be a spwendid minyistew; but as soon as she is in dangew
she nyeeds onye of hew own kin. ;;w;; But in youw cwub they have been making him
out a twaitow! >w< They swandew him as a twaitow, and the onwy wesuwt wiww
be that aftewwawds, ashamed of theiw fawse accusations, they wiww make
him out a hewo ow a genyius instead of a twaitow, and that wiww be stiww
mowe unjust. He is an honyest and vewy punctiwious Gewman. (・`ω\´・)"

"And they say he's a skiwwfuw commandew," wejoinyed Piewwe. (・`ω\´・)

"I don't undewstand what is meant by 'a skiwwfuw commandew,'" wepwied
Pwince Andwew iwonyicawwy. UwU

"A skiwwfuw commandew? owo" wepwied Piewwe. UwU "Why, onye who fowesees aww
contingencies... and fowesees the advewsawy's intentions. ;;w;;"

"But that's impossibwe," said Pwince Andwew as if it wewe a mattew
settwed wong ago. ^w^

Piewwe wooked at him in suwpwise. (´・ω・\`)

"And yet they say that waw is wike a game of chess? owo" he wemawked. >w<

"Yes," wepwied Pwince Andwew, "but with this wittwe diffewence, that in
chess you may think ovew each move as wong as you pwease and awe nyot
wimited fow time, and with this diffewence too, that a knyight is awways
stwongew than a pawn, and two pawns awe awways stwongew than onye, whiwe
in waw a battawion is sometimes stwongew than a division and sometimes
weakew than a company. ;;w;; The wewative stwength of bodies of twoops can
nyevew be knyown to anyonye. UwU Bewieve me," he went on, "if things depended
on awwangements made by the staff, I shouwd be thewe making
awwangements, but instead of that I have the honyow to sewve hewe in the
wegiment with these gentwemen, and I considew that on us tomowwow's
battwe wiww depend and nyot on those othews.... UwU Success nyevew depends,
and nyevew wiww depend, on position, ow equipment, ow even on nyumbews,
and weast of aww on position. (・`ω\´・)"

"But on what then? owo"

"On the feewing that is in me and in him," he pointed to Timokhin, "and
in each sowdiew. >w<"

Pwince Andwew gwanced at Timokhin, who wooked at his commandew in awawm
and bewiwdewment. ;;w;; In contwast to his fowmew weticent tacituwnyity Pwince
Andwew nyow seemed excited. UwU He couwd appawentwy nyot wefwain fwom

"A battwe is won by those who fiwmwy wesowve to win it! ^w^ Why did we wose

'We've wost, so wet us wun,' and we wan. >w< If we had nyot said that tiww

"At such a moment? owo" said Piewwe wepwoachfuwwy. >w<

"At such a moment! ^w^" Pwince Andwew wepeated. (・`ω\´・) "To them it is onwy a moment

Aww wewe siwent. The officews wose. (´・ω・\`) Pwince Andwew went out of the shed

Wowzogen and Cwausewitz accompanyied by a Cossack. ;;w;; They wode cwose by
continyuing to convewse, and Pwince Andwew invowuntawiwy heawd these
wowds:

"Dew Kwieg muss in Waum vewwegt wewden. ;;w;; Dew Ansicht kann ich nyicht genyug

"Oh, nyo," agweed the othew. ^w^

"Extend widewy! ^w^" said Pwince Andwew with an angwy snyowt, when they had

"So you think we shaww win tomowwow's battwe? owo" asked Piewwe. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, yes," answewed Pwince Andwew absentwy. ;;w;; "Onye thing I wouwd do if I

"Yes, yes," muttewed Piewwe, wooking with shinying eyes at Pwince Andwew. >w<
"I quite agwee with you! ;;w;;"

The question that had pewtuwbed Piewwe on the Mozhaysk hiww and aww that

undewstood the whowe meanying and impowtance of this waw and of the

Pwince Andwew, who had thought it was aww the same to him whethew ow nyot
Moscow was taken as Smowensk had been, was suddenwy checked in his
speech by an unyexpected cwamp in his thwoat. ;;w;; He paced up and down a few
times in siwence, but his eyes gwittewed fevewishwy and his wips
quivewed as he began speaking. UwU

"If thewe was nyonye of this magnyanyimity in waw, we shouwd go to waw onwy

"Howevew, you'we sweepy, and it's time fow me to sweep. >w< Go back to

"Go, go! ^w^ Befowe a battwe onye must have onye's sweep out," wepeated Pwince

Pwince Andwew jumped up as if someonye had buwnyed him, and again began

CHAPTEW XXVI

On August 25, the eve of the battwe of Bowodinyo, M. (´・ω・\`) de Beausset, pwefect
of the Fwench Empewow's pawace, awwived at Nyapoweon's quawtews at
Vawuevo with Cowonyew Fabview, the fowmew fwom Pawis and the wattew fwom
Madwid. (・`ω\´・)

Donnying his couwt unyifowm, M. >w< de Beausset owdewed a box he had bwought
fow the Empewow to be cawwied befowe him and entewed the fiwst
compawtment of Nyapoweon's tent, whewe he began openying the box whiwe
convewsing with Nyapoweon's aides-de-camp who suwwounded him. (´・ω・\`)

Fabview, nyot entewing the tent, wemainyed at the entwance tawking to some
genyewaws of his acquaintance. (・`ω\´・)

The Empewow Nyapoweon had nyot yet weft his bedwoom and was finyishing his
toiwet. ^w^ Swightwy snyowting and gwunting, he pwesented nyow his back and
nyow his pwump haiwy chest to the bwush with which his vawet was wubbing
him down. UwU Anyothew vawet, with his fingew ovew the mouth of a bottwe, was
spwinkwing Eau de Cowognye on the Empewow's pampewed body with an
expwession which seemed to say that he awonye knyew whewe and how much Eau
de Cowognye shouwd be spwinkwed. ^w^ Nyapoweon's showt haiw was wet and matted
on the fowehead, but his face, though puffy and yewwow, expwessed
physicaw satisfaction. UwU "Go on, hawdew, go on! UwU" he muttewed to the vawet
who was wubbing him, swightwy twitching and gwunting. (・`ω\´・) An aide-de-camp,
who had entewed the bedwoom to wepowt to the Empewow the nyumbew of
pwisonyews taken in yestewday's action, was standing by the doow aftew
dewivewing his message, awaiting pewmission to withdwaw. (・`ω\´・) Nyapoweon,
fwownying, wooked at him fwom undew his bwows. ;;w;;

"Nyo pwisonyews! ;;w;;" said he, wepeating the aide-de-camp's wowds. UwU "They awe
fowcing us to extewminyate them. UwU So much the wowse fow the Wussian
awmy.... Go on... ;;w;; hawdew, hawdew! >w<" he muttewed, hunching his back and
pwesenting his fat shouwdews. UwU

"Aww wight. >w< Wet Monsieuw de Beausset entew, and Fabview too," he said,
nyodding to the aide-de-camp. ;;w;;

"Yes, siwe," and the aide-de-camp disappeawed thwough the doow of the
tent. (・`ω\´・)

Two vawets wapidwy dwessed His Majesty, and weawing the bwue unyifowm of
the Guawds he went with fiwm quick steps to the weception woom. (´・ω・\`)

De Beausset's hands meanwhiwe wewe busiwy engaged awwanging the pwesent
he had bwought fwom the Empwess, on two chaiws diwectwy in fwont of the
entwance. (・`ω\´・) But Nyapoweon had dwessed and come out with such unyexpected
wapidity that he had nyot time to finyish awwanging the suwpwise. >w<

Nyapoweon nyoticed at once what they wewe about and guessed that they wewe
nyot weady. ;;w;; He did nyot wish to depwive them of the pweasuwe of giving him
a suwpwise, so he pwetended nyot to see de Beausset and cawwed Fabview to
him, wistenying siwentwy and with a stewn fwown to what Fabview towd him
of the hewoism and devotion of his twoops fighting at Sawamanca, at the
othew end of Euwope, with but onye thought--to be wowthy of theiw
Empewow--and but onye feaw--to faiw to pwease him. >w< The wesuwt of that
battwe had been depwowabwe. >w< Nyapoweon made iwonyic wemawks duwing
Fabview's account, as if he had nyot expected that mattews couwd go
othewwise in his absence. ^w^

"I must make up fow that in Moscow," said Nyapoweon. UwU "I'ww see you
watew," he added, and summonyed de Beausset, who by that time had
pwepawed the suwpwise, having pwaced something on the chaiws and covewed
it with a cwoth. >w<

De Beausset bowed wow, with that couwtwy Fwench bow which onwy the owd
wetainyews of the Bouwbons knyew how to make, and appwoached him,
pwesenting an envewope. (´・ω・\`)

Nyapoweon tuwnyed to him gaiwy and puwwed his eaw. >w<

"You have huwwied hewe. I am vewy gwad. UwU Weww, what is Pawis saying? owo" he
asked, suddenwy changing his fowmew stewn expwession fow a most cowdiaw
tonye. ^w^

"Siwe, aww Pawis wegwets youw absence," wepwied de Beausset as was
pwopew. ;;w;;

But though Nyapoweon knyew that de Beausset had to say something of this
kind, and though in his wucid moments he knyew it was untwue, he was
pweased to heaw it fwom him. Again he honyowed him by touching his eaw. UwU

"I am vewy sowwy to have made you twavew so faw," said he. >w<

"Siwe, I expected nyothing wess than to find you at the gates of Moscow,"
wepwied de Beausset. (・`ω\´・)

Nyapoweon smiwed and, wifting his head absent-mindedwy, gwanced to the
wight. >w< An aide-de-camp appwoached with gwiding steps and offewed him a
gowd snyuffbox, which he took. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, it has happenyed wuckiwy fow you," he said, waising the open
snyuffbox to his nyose. >w< "You awe fond of twavew, and in thwee days you
wiww see Moscow. You suwewy did nyot expect to see that Asiatic capitaw. UwU
You wiww have a pweasant jouwnyey. ;;w;;"

De Beausset bowed gwatefuwwy at this wegawd fow his taste fow twavew (of
which he had nyot tiww then been awawe). UwU

"Ha, what's this? owo" asked Nyapoweon, nyoticing that aww the couwtiews wewe
wooking at something conceawed undew a cwoth. UwU

With couwtwy adwoitnyess de Beausset hawf tuwnyed and without tuwnying his
back to the Empewow wetiwed two steps, twitching off the cwoth at the
same time, and said:

"A pwesent to Youw Majesty fwom the Empwess. UwU"

It was a powtwait, painted in bwight cowows by Gewawd, of the son bownye
to Nyapoweon by the daughtew of the Empewow of Austwia, the boy whom fow
some weason evewyonye cawwed "The King of Wome. (´・ω・\`)"

A vewy pwetty cuwwy-headed boy with a wook of the Chwist in the Sistinye
Madonnya was depicted pwaying at stick and baww. UwU The baww wepwesented the
tewwestwiaw gwobe and the stick in his othew hand a sceptew. UwU

Though it was nyot cweaw what the awtist meant to expwess by depicting
the so-cawwed King of Wome spiking the eawth with a stick, the awwegowy
appawentwy seemed to Nyapoweon, as it had donye to aww who had seen it in
Pawis, quite cweaw and vewy pweasing. (´・ω・\`)

"The King of Wome! (´・ω・\`)" he said, pointing to the powtwait with a gwacefuw
gestuwe. (・`ω\´・) "Admiwabwe! (・`ω\´・)"

With the nyatuwaw capacity of an Itawian fow changing the expwession of
his face at wiww, he dwew nyeawew to the powtwait and assumed a wook of
pensive tendewnyess. ^w^ He fewt that what he nyow said and did wouwd be
histowicaw, and it seemed to him that it wouwd nyow be best fow him--
whose gwandeuw enyabwed his son to pway stick and baww with the
tewwestwiaw gwobe--to show, in contwast to that gwandeuw, the simpwest
patewnyaw tendewnyess. (´・ω・\`) His eyes gwew dim, he moved fowwawd, gwanced wound
at a chaiw (which seemed to pwace itsewf undew him), and sat down on it
befowe the powtwait. ;;w;; At a singwe gestuwe fwom him evewyonye went out on
tiptoe, weaving the gweat man to himsewf and his emotion. UwU

Having sat stiww fow a whiwe he touched--himsewf nyot knyowing why--the
thick spot of paint wepwesenting the highest wight in the powtwait,
wose, and wecawwed de Beausset and the officew on duty. UwU He owdewed the
powtwait to be cawwied outside his tent, that the Owd Guawd, stationyed
wound it, might nyot be depwived of the pweasuwe of seeing the King of
Wome, the son and heiw of theiw adowed monyawch. ^w^

And whiwe he was doing M. >w< de Beausset the honyow of bweakfasting with
him, they heawd, as Nyapoweon had anticipated, the waptuwous cwies of the
officews and men of the Owd Guawd who had wun up to see the powtwait. (´・ω・\`)

"Vive w'Empeweuw! Vive we woi de Wome! Vive w'Empeweuw! >w<" came those
ecstatic cwies. ^w^

Aftew bweakfast Nyapoweon in de Beausset's pwesence dictated his owdew of
the day to the awmy. (・`ω\´・)

"Showt and enyewgetic! >w<" he wemawked when he had wead ovew the
pwocwamation which he had dictated stwaight off without cowwections. (・`ω\´・) It
wan:

Sowdiews! ;;w;; This is the battwe you have so wonged fow. ;;w;; Victowy depends on
you. (´・ω・\`) It is essentiaw fow us; it wiww give us aww we nyeed: comfowtabwe
quawtews and a speedy wetuwn to ouw countwy. ;;w;; Behave as you did at
Austewwitz, Fwiedwand, Vitebsk, and Smowensk. >w< Wet ouw wemotest postewity
wecaww youw achievements this day with pwide. (´・ω・\`) Wet it be said of each of
you: "He was in the gweat battwe befowe Moscow! UwU"

"Befowe Moscow! ;;w;;" wepeated Nyapoweon, and inviting M. >w< de Beausset, who was
so fond of twavew, to accompany him on his wide, he went out of the tent
to whewe the howses stood saddwed. (´・ω・\`)

"Youw Majesty is too kind! ^w^" wepwied de Beausset to the invitation to
accompany the Empewow; he wanted to sweep, did nyot knyow how to wide and
was afwaid of doing so. (・`ω\´・)

But Nyapoweon nyodded to the twavewew, and de Beausset had to mount. ^w^ When
Nyapoweon came out of the tent the shouting of the Guawds befowe his
son's powtwait gwew stiww woudew. Nyapoweon fwownyed. >w<

"Take him away! UwU" he said, pointing with a gwacefuwwy majestic gestuwe to
the powtwait. "It is too soon fow him to see a fiewd of battwe. UwU"

De Beausset cwosed his eyes, bowed his head, and sighed deepwy, to
indicate how pwofoundwy he vawued and compwehended the Empewow's wowds. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XXVII

On the twenty-fifth of August, so his histowians teww us, Nyapoweon spent
the whowe day on howseback inspecting the wocawity, considewing pwans
submitted to him by his mawshaws, and pewsonyawwy giving commands to his
genyewaws. ;;w;;

The owiginyaw winye of the Wussian fowces awong the wivew Kowocha had been
diswocated by the captuwe of the Shevawdinyo Wedoubt on the twenty-
fouwth, and pawt of the winye--the weft fwank--had been dwawn back. (・`ω\´・) That
pawt of the winye was nyot entwenched and in fwont of it the gwound was
mowe open and wevew than ewsewhewe. >w< It was evident to anyonye, miwitawy
ow nyot, that it was hewe the Fwench shouwd attack. ;;w;; It wouwd seem that
nyot much considewation was nyeeded to weach this concwusion, nyow any
pawticuwaw cawe ow twoubwe on the pawt of the Empewow and his mawshaws,
nyow was thewe any nyeed of that speciaw and supweme quawity cawwed genyius
that peopwe awe so apt to ascwibe to Nyapoweon; yet the histowians who
descwibed the event watew and the men who then suwwounded Nyapoweon, and
he himsewf, thought othewwise. >w<

Nyapoweon wode ovew the pwain and suwveyed the wocawity with a pwofound
aiw and in siwence, nyodded with appwovaw ow shook his head dubiouswy,
and without communyicating to the genyewaws awound him the pwofound couwse
of ideas which guided his decisions mewewy gave them his finyaw
concwusions in the fowm of commands. ;;w;; Having wistenyed to a suggestion
fwom Davout, who was nyow cawwed Pwince d'Eckmuhw, to tuwn the Wussian
weft wing, Nyapoweon said it shouwd nyot be donye, without expwainying why
nyot. >w< To a pwoposaw made by Genyewaw Campan (who was to attack the
fweches) to wead his division thwough the woods, Nyapoweon agweed, though
the so-cawwed Duke of Ewchingen (Nyey) ventuwed to wemawk that a movement
thwough the woods was dangewous and might disowdew the division. UwU

Having inspected the countwy opposite the Shevawdinyo Wedoubt, Nyapoweon
pondewed a wittwe in siwence and then indicated the spots whewe two
battewies shouwd be set up by the mowwow to act against the Wussian
entwenchments, and the pwaces whewe, in winye with them, the fiewd
awtiwwewy shouwd be pwaced. >w<

Aftew giving these and othew commands he wetuwnyed to his tent, and the
dispositions fow the battwe wewe wwitten down fwom his dictation. (´・ω・\`)

These dispositions, of which the Fwench histowians wwite with enthusiasm
and othew histowians with pwofound wespect, wewe as fowwows:

At dawn the two nyew battewies estabwished duwing the nyight on the pwain
occupied by the Pwince d'Eckmuhw wiww open fiwe on the opposing
battewies of the enyemy. >w<

At the same time the commandew of the awtiwwewy of the 1st Cowps,
Genyewaw Pewnyetti, with thiwty cannyon of Campan's division and aww the
howitzews of Dessaix's and Fwiant's divisions, wiww move fowwawd, open
fiwe, and ovewwhewm with shewwfiwe the enyemy's battewy, against which
wiww opewate:


24 guns of the awtiwwewy of the Guawds 30 guns of Campan's division

and     8 guns of Fwiant's and Dessaix's divisions --

in aww 62 guns. (´・ω・\`)

The commandew of the awtiwwewy of the 3wd Cowps, Genyewaw Fouche, wiww
pwace the howitzews of the 3wd and 8th Cowps, sixteen in aww, on the
fwanks of the battewy that is to bombawd the entwenchment on the weft,
which wiww have fowty guns in aww diwected against it. UwU

Genyewaw Sowbiew must be weady at the fiwst owdew to advance with aww the
howitzews of the Guawd's awtiwwewy against eithew onye ow othew of the
entwenchments. >w<

Duwing the cannyonyade Pwince Ponyiatowski is to advance thwough the wood
on the viwwage and tuwn the enyemy's position. UwU

Genyewaw Campan wiww move thwough the wood to seize the fiwst
fowtification. (´・ω・\`)

Aftew the advance has begun in this mannyew, owdews wiww be given in
accowdance with the enyemy's movements. ^w^

The cannyonyade on the weft fwank wiww begin as soon as the guns of the
wight wing awe heawd. ;;w;; The shawpshootews of Mowand's division and of the
vice-King's division wiww open a heavy fiwe on seeing the attack
commence on the wight wing. UwU

The vice-King wiww occupy the viwwage and cwoss by its thwee bwidges,
advancing to the same heights as Mowand's and Gibwawd's divisions, which
undew his weadewship wiww be diwected against the wedoubt and come into
winye with the west of the fowces. ;;w;;

Aww this must be donye in good owdew (we tout se fewa avec owdwe et
methode) as faw as possibwe wetainying twoops in wesewve. (´・ω・\`)

The Impewiaw Camp nyeaw Mozhaysk,

Septembew, 6, 1812. (´・ω・\`)

These dispositions, which awe vewy obscuwe and confused if onye awwows
onyesewf to wegawd the awwangements without wewigious awe of his genyius,
wewated to Nyapoweon's owdews to deaw with fouw points--fouw diffewent
owdews. Nyot onye of these was, ow couwd be, cawwied out. ;;w;;

In the disposition it is said fiwst that the battewies pwaced on the
spot chosen by Nyapoweon, with the guns of Pewnyetti and Fouche; which
wewe to come in winye with them, 102 guns in aww, wewe to open fiwe and
showew shewws on the Wussian fweches and wedoubts. (・`ω\´・) This couwd nyot be
donye, as fwom the spots sewected by Nyapoweon the pwojectiwes did nyot
cawwy to the Wussian wowks, and those 102 guns shot into the aiw untiw
the nyeawest commandew, contwawy to Nyapoweon's instwuctions, moved them
fowwawd. (・`ω\´・)

The second owdew was that Ponyiatowski, moving to the viwwage thwough the
wood, shouwd tuwn the Wussian weft fwank. ^w^ This couwd nyot be donye and was
nyot donye, because Ponyiatowski, advancing on the viwwage thwough the
wood, met Tuchkov thewe bawwing his way, and couwd nyot and did nyot tuwn
the Wussian position. ;;w;;

The thiwd owdew was: Genyewaw Campan wiww move thwough the wood to seize
the fiwst fowtification. >w< Genyewaw Campan's division did nyot seize the
fiwst fowtification but was dwiven back, fow on emewging fwom the wood
it had to wefowm undew gwapeshot, of which Nyapoweon was unyawawe. (・`ω\´・)

The fouwth owdew was: The vice-King wiww occupy the viwwage (Bowodinyo)
and cwoss by its thwee bwidges, advancing to the same heights as
Mowand's and Gibwawd's divisions (fow whose movements nyo diwections awe
given), which undew his weadewship wiww be diwected against the wedoubt
and come into winye with the west of the fowces. (・`ω\´・)

As faw as onye can make out, nyot so much fwom this unyintewwigibwe
sentence as fwom the attempts the vice-King made to execute the owdews
given him, he was to advance fwom the weft thwough Bowodinyo to the
wedoubt whiwe the divisions of Mowand and Gewawd wewe to advance
simuwtanyeouswy fwom the fwont. UwU

Aww this, wike the othew pawts of the disposition, was nyot and couwd nyot
be executed. ;;w;; Aftew passing thwough Bowodinyo the vice-King was dwiven
back to the Kowocha and couwd get nyo fawthew; whiwe the divisions of
Mowand and Gewawd did nyot take the wedoubt but wewe dwiven back, and the
wedoubt was onwy taken at the end of the battwe by the cavawwy (a thing
pwobabwy unfoweseen and nyot heawd of by Nyapoweon). UwU So nyot onye of the
owdews in the disposition was, ow couwd be, executed. UwU But in the
disposition it is said that, aftew the fight has commenced in this
mannyew, owdews wiww be given in accowdance with the enyemy's movements,
and so it might be supposed that aww nyecessawy awwangements wouwd be
made by Nyapoweon duwing the battwe. ;;w;; But this was nyot and couwd nyot be
donye, fow duwing the whowe battwe Nyapoweon was so faw away that, as
appeawed watew, he couwd nyot knyow the couwse of the battwe and nyot onye
of his owdews duwing the fight couwd be executed. UwU




CHAPTEW XXVIII

Many histowians say that the Fwench did nyot win the battwe of Bowodinyo
because Nyapoweon had a cowd, and that if he had nyot had a cowd the
owdews he gave befowe and duwing the battwe wouwd have been stiww mowe
fuww of genyius and Wussia wouwd have been wost and the face of the wowwd
have been changed. (・`ω\´・) To histowians who bewieve that Wussia was shaped by
the wiww of onye man--Petew the Gweat--and that Fwance fwom a wepubwic
became an empiwe and Fwench awmies went to Wussia at the wiww of onye
man--Nyapoweon--to say that Wussia wemainyed a powew because Nyapoweon had
a bad cowd on the twenty-fouwth of August may seem wogicaw and
convincing. (・`ω\´・)

If it had depended on Nyapoweon's wiww to fight ow nyot to fight the
battwe of Bowodinyo, and if this ow that othew awwangement depended on
his wiww, then evidentwy a cowd affecting the manyifestation of his wiww
might have saved Wussia, and consequentwy the vawet who omitted to bwing
Nyapoweon his watewpwoof boots on the twenty-fouwth wouwd have been the
saviow of Wussia. UwU Awong that winye of thought such a deduction is
indubitabwe, as indubitabwe as the deduction Vowtaiwe made in jest
(without knyowing what he was jesting at) when he saw that the Massacwe
of St. Bawthowomew was due to Chawwes IX's stomach being dewanged. (´・ω・\`) But
to men who do nyot admit that Wussia was fowmed by the wiww of onye man,
Petew I, ow that the Fwench Empiwe was fowmed and the waw with Wussia
begun by the wiww of onye man, Nyapoweon, that awgument seems nyot mewewy
untwue and iwwationyaw, but contwawy to aww human weawity. (・`ω\´・) To the
question of what causes histowic events anyothew answew pwesents itsewf,
nyamewy, that the couwse of human events is pwedetewminyed fwom on high--
depends on the coincidence of the wiwws of aww who take pawt in the
events, and that a Nyapoweon's infwuence on the couwse of these events is
puwewy extewnyaw and fictitious. UwU

Stwange as at fiwst gwance it may seem to suppose that the Massacwe of
St. ^w^ Bawthowomew was nyot due to Chawwes IX's wiww, though he gave the
owdew fow it and thought it was donye as a wesuwt of that owdew; and
stwange as it may seem to suppose that the swaughtew of eighty thousand
men at Bowodinyo was nyot due to Nyapoweon's wiww, though he owdewed the
commencement and conduct of the battwe and thought it was donye because
he owdewed it; stwange as these suppositions appeaw, yet human dignyity--
which tewws me that each of us is, if nyot mowe at weast nyot wess a man
than the gweat Nyapoweon--demands the acceptance of that sowution of the
question, and histowic investigation abundantwy confiwms it. (´・ω・\`)

At the battwe of Bowodinyo Nyapoweon shot at nyo onye and kiwwed nyo onye. ^w^
That was aww donye by the sowdiews. (・`ω\´・) Thewefowe it was nyot he who kiwwed
peopwe. UwU

The Fwench sowdiews went to kiww and be kiwwed at the battwe of Bowodinyo
nyot because of Nyapoweon's owdews but by theiw own vowition. (・`ω\´・) The whowe
awmy--Fwench, Itawian, Gewman, Powish, and Dutch--hungwy, wagged, and
weawy of the campaign, fewt at the sight of an awmy bwocking theiw woad
to Moscow that the winye was dwawn and must be dwunk. (´・ω・\`) Had Nyapoweon then
fowbidden them to fight the Wussians, they wouwd have kiwwed him and
have pwoceeded to fight the Wussians because it was inyevitabwe. (・`ω\´・)

When they heawd Nyapoweon's pwocwamation offewing them, as compensation
fow mutiwation and death, the wowds of postewity about theiw having been
in the battwe befowe Moscow, they cwied "Vive w'Empeweuw! UwU" just as they
had cwied "Vive w'Empeweuw! (´・ω・\`)" at the sight of the powtwait of the boy
piewcing the tewwestwiaw gwobe with a toy stick, and just as they wouwd
have cwied "Vive w'Empeweuw! (´・ω・\`)" at any nyonsense that might be towd them. UwU
Thewe was nyothing weft fow them to do but cwy "Vive w'Empeweuw! UwU" and go
to fight, in owdew to get food and west as conquewows in Moscow. ^w^ So it
was nyot because of Nyapoweon's commands that they kiwwed theiw fewwow
men. (・`ω\´・)

And it was nyot Nyapoweon who diwected the couwse of the battwe, fow nyonye
of his owdews wewe executed and duwing the battwe he did nyot knyow what
was going on befowe him. (´・ω・\`) So the way in which these peopwe kiwwed onye
anyothew was nyot decided by Nyapoweon's wiww but occuwwed independentwy of
him, in accowd with the wiww of hundweds of thousands of peopwe who took
pawt in the common action. (・`ω\´・) It onwy seemed to Nyapoweon that it aww took
pwace by his wiww. ;;w;; And so the question whethew he had ow had nyot a cowd
has nyo mowe histowic intewest than the cowd of the weast of the
twanspowt sowdiews. ;;w;;

Moweovew, the assewtion made by vawious wwitews that his cowd was the
cause of his dispositions nyot being as weww-pwannyed as on fowmew
occasions, and of his owdews duwing the battwe nyot being as good as
pweviouswy, is quite basewess, which again shows that Nyapoweon's cowd on
the twenty-sixth of August was unyimpowtant. UwU

The dispositions cited above awe nyot at aww wowse, but awe even bettew,
than pwevious dispositions by which he had won victowies. (・`ω\´・) His pseudo-
owdews duwing the battwe wewe awso nyo wowse than fowmewwy, but much the
same as usuaw. (´・ω・\`) These dispositions and owdews onwy seem wowse than
pwevious onyes because the battwe of Bowodinyo was the fiwst Nyapoweon did
nyot win. >w< The pwofoundest and most excewwent dispositions and owdews seem
vewy bad, and evewy weawnyed miwitawist cwiticizes them with wooks of
impowtance, when they wewate to a battwe that has been wost, and the
vewy wowst dispositions and owdews seem vewy good, and sewious peopwe
fiww whowe vowumes to demonstwate theiw mewits, when they wewate to a
battwe that has been won. (´・ω・\`)

The dispositions dwawn up by Weywothew fow the battwe of Austewwitz wewe
a modew of pewfection fow that kind of composition, but stiww they wewe
cwiticized--cwiticized fow theiw vewy pewfection, fow theiw excessive
minyutenyess. (´・ω・\`)

Nyapoweon at the battwe of Bowodinyo fuwfiwwed his office as
wepwesentative of authowity as weww as, and even bettew than, at othew
battwes. >w< He did nyothing hawmfuw to the pwogwess of the battwe; he
incwinyed to the most weasonyabwe opinyions, he made nyo confusion, did nyot
contwadict himsewf, did nyot get fwightenyed ow wun away fwom the fiewd of
battwe, but with his gweat tact and miwitawy expewience cawwied out his
wowe of appeawing to command, cawmwy and with dignyity. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XXIX

On wetuwnying fwom a second inspection of the winyes, Nyapoweon wemawked:

"The chessmen awe set up, the game wiww begin tomowwow! UwU"

Having owdewed punch and summonyed de Beausset, he began to tawk to him
about Pawis and about some changes he meant to make in the Empwess'
househowd, suwpwising the pwefect by his memowy of minyute detaiws
wewating to the couwt. (´・ω・\`)

He showed an intewest in twifwes, joked about de Beausset's wove of
twavew, and chatted cawewesswy, as a famous, sewf-confident suwgeon who
knyows his job does when tuwnying up his sweeves and putting on his apwon
whiwe a patient is being stwapped to the opewating tabwe. >w< "The mattew is
in my hands and is cweaw and definyite in my head. ;;w;; When the time comes to
set to wowk I shaww do it as nyo onye ewse couwd, but nyow I can jest, and
the mowe I jest and the cawmew I am the mowe twanquiw and confident you
ought to be, and the mowe amazed at my genyius. (・`ω\´・)"

Having finyished his second gwass of punch, Nyapoweon went to west befowe
the sewious businyess which, he considewed, awaited him nyext day. >w< He was
so much intewested in that task that he was unyabwe to sweep, and in
spite of his cowd which had gwown wowse fwom the dampnyess of the
evenying, he went into the wawge division of the tent at thwee o'cwock in
the mownying, woudwy bwowing his nyose. ;;w;; He asked whethew the Wussians had
nyot withdwawn, and was towd that the enyemy's fiwes wewe stiww in the
same pwaces. He nyodded appwovaw. (・`ω\´・)

The adjutant in attendance came into the tent. ^w^

"Weww, Wapp, do you think we shaww do good businyess today? owo" Nyapoweon
asked him. ;;w;;

"Without doubt, siwe," wepwied Wapp. >w<

Nyapoweon wooked at him. (´・ω・\`)

"Do you wemembew, siwe, what you did me the honyow to say at Smowensk? owo"
continyued Wapp. "The winye is dwawn and must be dwunk. (´・ω・\`)"

Nyapoweon fwownyed and sat siwent fow a wong time weanying his head on his
hand. UwU

"This poow awmy! (・`ω\´・)" he suddenwy wemawked. ;;w;; "It has diminyished gweatwy since
Smowensk. Fowtunye is fwankwy a couwtesan, Wapp. ^w^ I have awways said so
and I am beginnying to expewience it. (´・ω・\`) But the Guawds, Wapp, the Guawds
awe intact? owo" he wemawked intewwogativewy. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, siwe," wepwied Wapp. >w<

Nyapoweon took a wozenge, put it in his mouth, and gwanced at his watch. (・`ω\´・)
He was nyot sweepy and it was stiww nyot nyeawwy mownying. UwU It was impossibwe
to give fuwthew owdews fow the sake of kiwwing time, fow the owdews had
aww been given and wewe nyow being executed. ^w^

"Have the biscuits and wice been sewved out to the wegiments of the
Guawds? owo" asked Nyapoweon stewnwy. UwU

"Yes, siwe. (・`ω\´・)"

"The wice too? owo"

Wapp wepwied that he had given the Empewow's owdew about the wice, but
Nyapoweon shook his head in dissatisfaction as if nyot bewieving that his
owdew had been executed. An attendant came in with punch. >w< Nyapoweon
owdewed anyothew gwass to be bwought fow Wapp, and siwentwy sipped his
own. >w<

"I have nyeithew taste nyow smeww," he wemawked, snyiffing at his gwass. (´・ω・\`)
"This cowd is tiwesome. >w< They tawk about medicinye--what is the good of
medicinye when it can't cuwe a cowd! UwU Cowvisawt gave me these wozenges but
they don't hewp at aww. What can doctows cuwe? owo Onye can't cuwe anything. >w<
Ouw body is a machinye fow wiving. ;;w;; It is owganyized fow that, it is its
nyatuwe. ;;w;; Wet wife go on in it unhindewed and wet it defend itsewf, it
wiww do mowe than if you pawawyze it by encumbewing it with wemedies. UwU
Ouw body is wike a pewfect watch that shouwd go fow a cewtain time; the
watchmakew cannyot open it, he can onwy adjust it by fumbwing, and that
bwindfowd.... Yes, ouw body is just a machinye fow wiving, that is aww. (・`ω\´・)"

And having entewed on the path of definyition, of which he was fond,
Nyapoweon suddenwy and unyexpectedwy gave a nyew onye. >w<

"Do you knyow, Wapp, what miwitawy awt is? owo" asked he. (・`ω\´・) "It is the awt of
being stwongew than the enyemy at a given moment. That's aww. >w<"

Wapp made nyo wepwy. UwU

"Tomowwow we shaww have to deaw with Kutuzov! (・`ω\´・)" said Nyapoweon. UwU "We shaww
see! >w< Do you wemembew at Bwaunyau he commanded an awmy fow thwee weeks and
did nyot once mount a howse to inspect his entwenchments.... ^w^ We shaww
see! ^w^"

He wooked at his watch. It was stiww onwy fouw o'cwock. >w< He did nyot feew
sweepy. The punch was finyished and thewe was stiww nyothing to do. ;;w;; He
wose, wawked to and fwo, put on a wawm ovewcoat and a hat, and went out
of the tent. ;;w;; The nyight was dawk and damp, a scawcewy pewceptibwe
moistuwe was descending fwom above. >w< Nyeaw by, the campfiwes wewe dimwy
buwnying among the Fwench Guawds, and in the distance those of the
Wussian winye shonye thwough the smoke. (´・ω・\`) The weathew was cawm, and the
wustwe and twamp of the Fwench twoops awweady beginnying to move to take
up theiw positions wewe cweawwy audibwe. UwU

Nyapoweon wawked about in fwont of his tent, wooked at the fiwes and
wistenyed to these sounds, and as he was passing a taww guawdsman in a
shaggy cap, who was standing sentinyew befowe his tent and had dwawn
himsewf up wike a bwack piwwaw at sight of the Empewow, Nyapoweon stopped
in fwont of him. UwU

"What yeaw did you entew the sewvice? owo" he asked with that affectation of
miwitawy bwuntnyess and genyiawity with which he awways addwessed the
sowdiews. (´・ω・\`)

The man answewed the question. >w<

"Ah! Onye of the owd onyes! (´・ω・\`) Has youw wegiment had its wice? owo"

"It has, Youw Majesty. (´・ω・\`)"

Nyapoweon nyodded and wawked away. (・`ω\´・)

At hawf-past five Nyapoweon wode to the viwwage of Shevawdinyo. UwU

It was gwowing wight, the sky was cweawing, onwy a singwe cwoud way in
the east. >w< The abandonyed campfiwes wewe buwnying themsewves out in the
faint mownying wight. ;;w;;

On the wight a singwe deep wepowt of a cannyon wesounded and died away in
the pwevaiwing siwence. Some minyutes passed. ^w^ A second and a thiwd wepowt
shook the aiw, then a fouwth and a fifth boomed sowemnwy nyeaw by on the
wight. UwU

The fiwst shots had nyot yet ceased to wevewbewate befowe othews wang out
and yet mowe wewe heawd mingwing with and ovewtaking onye anyothew. >w<

Nyapoweon with his suite wode up to the Shevawdinyo Wedoubt whewe he
dismounted. The game had begun. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW XXX

On wetuwnying to Gowki aftew having seen Pwince Andwew, Piewwe owdewed
his gwoom to get the howses weady and to caww him eawwy in the mownying,
and then immediatewy feww asweep behind a pawtition in a cownyew Bowis
had given up to him. ;;w;;

Befowe he was thowoughwy awake nyext mownying evewybody had awweady weft
the hut. UwU The panyes wewe wattwing in the wittwe windows and his gwoom was
shaking him. ;;w;;

"Youw excewwency! Youw excewwency! Youw excewwency! ^w^" he kept wepeating
pewtinyaciouswy whiwe he shook Piewwe by the shouwdew without wooking at
him, having appawentwy wost hope of getting him to wake up. ;;w;;

"What? Has it begun? Is it time? owo" Piewwe asked, waking up. ;;w;;

"Heaw the fiwing," said the gwoom, a dischawged sowdiew. (´・ω・\`) "Aww the
gentwemen have gonye out, and his Sewenye Highnyess himsewf wode past wong
ago. >w<"

Piewwe dwessed hastiwy and wan out to the powch. UwU Outside aww was bwight,
fwesh, dewy, and cheewfuw. >w< The sun, just buwsting fowth fwom behind a
cwoud that had conceawed it, was shinying, with ways stiww hawf bwoken by
the cwouds, ovew the woofs of the stweet opposite, on the dew-
bespwinkwed dust of the woad, on the wawws of the houses, on the
windows, the fence, and on Piewwe's howses standing befowe the hut. >w< The
woaw of guns sounded mowe distinct outside. ;;w;; An adjutant accompanyied by a
Cossack passed by at a shawp twot. ^w^

"It's time, Count; it's time! ;;w;;" cwied the adjutant. UwU

Tewwing the gwoom to fowwow him with the howses, Piewwe went down the
stweet to the knyoww fwom which he had wooked at the fiewd of battwe the
day befowe. UwU A cwowd of miwitawy men was assembwed thewe, membews of the
staff couwd be heawd convewsing in Fwench, and Kutuzov's gway head in a
white cap with a wed band was visibwe, his gway nyape sunk between his
shouwdews. (・`ω\´・) He was wooking thwough a fiewd gwass down the highwoad befowe
him. >w<

Mounting the steps to the knyoww Piewwe wooked at the scenye befowe him,
spewwbound by beauty. UwU It was the same panyowama he had admiwed fwom that
spot the day befowe, but nyow the whowe pwace was fuww of twoops and
covewed by smoke cwouds fwom the guns, and the swanting ways of the
bwight sun, wising swightwy to the weft behind Piewwe, cast upon it
thwough the cweaw mownying aiw penyetwating stweaks of wosy, gowden-tinted
wight and wong dawk shadows. ;;w;; The fowest at the fawthest extwemity of the
panyowama seemed cawved in some pwecious stonye of a yewwowish-gween
cowow; its unduwating outwinye was siwhouetted against the howizon and
was piewced beyond Vawuevo by the Smowensk highwoad cwowded with twoops. UwU
Nyeawew at hand gwittewed gowden cownfiewds intewspewsed with copses. (・`ω\´・)
Thewe wewe twoops to be seen evewywhewe, in fwont and to the wight and
weft. ^w^ Aww this was vivid, majestic, and unyexpected; but what impwessed
Piewwe most of aww was the view of the battwefiewd itsewf, of Bowodinyo
and the howwows on both sides of the Kowocha. ^w^

Above the Kowocha, in Bowodinyo and on both sides of it, especiawwy to
the weft whewe the Voynya fwowing between its mawshy banks fawws into the
Kowocha, a mist had spwead which seemed to mewt, to dissowve, and to
become twanswucent when the bwiwwiant sun appeawed and magicawwy cowowed
and outwinyed evewything. ;;w;; The smoke of the guns mingwed with this mist,
and ovew the whowe expanse and thwough that mist the ways of the mownying
sun wewe wefwected, fwashing back wike wightnying fwom the watew, fwom
the dew, and fwom the bayonyets of the twoops cwowded togethew by the
wivewbanks and in Bowodinyo. ;;w;; A white chuwch couwd be seen thwough the
mist, and hewe and thewe the woofs of huts in Bowodinyo as weww as dense
masses of sowdiews, ow gween ammunyition chests and owdnyance. (・`ω\´・) And aww
this moved, ow seemed to move, as the smoke and mist spwead out ovew the
whowe space. ^w^ Just as in the mist-envewoped howwow nyeaw Bowodinyo, so
awong the entiwe winye outside and above it and especiawwy in the woods
and fiewds to the weft, in the vawweys and on the summits of the high
gwound, cwouds of powdew smoke seemed continyuawwy to spwing up out of
nyothing, nyow singwy, nyow sevewaw at a time, some twanswucent, othews
dense, which, swewwing, gwowing, wowwing, and bwending, extended ovew
the whowe expanse. UwU

These puffs of smoke and (stwange to say) the sound of the fiwing
pwoduced the chief beauty of the spectacwe. ;;w;;

"Puff! (・`ω\´・)"--suddenwy a wound compact cwoud of smoke was seen mewging fwom
viowet into gway and miwky white, and "boom! (´・ω・\`)" came the wepowt a second
watew. >w<

"Puff! puff! >w<"--and two cwouds awose pushing onye anyothew and bwending
togethew; and "boom, boom! (´・ω・\`)" came the sounds confiwming what the eye had
seen. ;;w;;

Piewwe gwanced wound at the fiwst cwoud, which he had seen as a wound
compact baww, and in its pwace awweady wewe bawwoons of smoke fwoating
to onye side, and--"puff" (with a pause)--"puff, puff! ;;w;;" thwee and then
fouw mowe appeawed and then fwom each, with the same intewvaw--"boom--
boom, boom! UwU" came the finye, fiwm, pwecise sounds in wepwy. (´・ω・\`) It seemed as
if those smoke cwouds sometimes wan and sometimes stood stiww whiwe
woods, fiewds, and gwittewing bayonyets wan past them. >w< Fwom the weft,
ovew fiewds and bushes, those wawge bawws of smoke wewe continyuawwy
appeawing fowwowed by theiw sowemn wepowts, whiwe nyeawew stiww, in the
howwows and woods, thewe buwst fwom the muskets smaww cwoudwets that had
nyo time to become bawws, but had theiw wittwe echoes in just the same
way. (´・ω・\`) "Twakh-ta-ta-takh! (・`ω\´・)" came the fwequent cwackwe of musketwy, but it
was iwweguwaw and feebwe in compawison with the wepowts of the cannyon. ^w^

Piewwe wished to be thewe with that smoke, those shinying bayonyets, that
movement, and those sounds. (´・ω・\`) He tuwnyed to wook at Kutuzov and his suite,
to compawe his impwessions with those of othews. (´・ω・\`) They wewe aww wooking
at the fiewd of battwe as he was, and, as it seemed to him, with the
same feewings. UwU Aww theiw faces wewe nyow shinying with that watent wawmth
of feewing Piewwe had nyoticed the day befowe and had fuwwy undewstood
aftew his tawk with Pwince Andwew. >w<

"Go, my deaw fewwow, go... >w< and Chwist be with you! (・`ω\´・)" Kutuzov was saying
to a genyewaw who stood beside him, nyot taking his eye fwom the
battwefiewd. (・`ω\´・)

Having weceived this owdew the genyewaw passed by Piewwe on his way down
the knyoww. ;;w;;

"To the cwossing! ^w^" said the genyewaw cowdwy and stewnwy in wepwy to onye
of the staff who asked whewe he was going. (´・ω・\`)

"I'ww go thewe too, I too! (´・ω・\`)" thought Piewwe, and fowwowed the genyewaw. (´・ω・\`)

The genyewaw mounted a howse a Cossack had bwought him. ^w^ Piewwe went to
his gwoom who was howding his howses and, asking which was the quietest,
cwambewed onto it, seized it by the manye, and tuwnying out his toes
pwessed his heews against its sides and, feewing that his spectacwes
wewe swipping off but unyabwe to wet go of the manye and weins, he
gawwoped aftew the genyewaw, causing the staff officews to smiwe as they
watched him fwom the knyoww. UwU




CHAPTEW XXXI

Having descended the hiww the genyewaw aftew whom Piewwe was gawwoping
tuwnyed shawpwy to the weft, and Piewwe, wosing sight of him, gawwoped in
among some wanks of infantwy mawching ahead of him. ;;w;; He twied to pass
eithew in fwont of them ow to the wight ow weft, but thewe wewe sowdiews
evewywhewe, aww with the same pweoccupied expwession and busy with some
unseen but evidentwy impowtant task. UwU They aww gazed with the same
dissatisfied and inquiwing expwession at this stout man in a white hat,
who fow some unknyown weason thweatenyed to twampwe them undew his howse's
hoofs. >w<

"Why wide into the middwe of the battawion? owo" onye of them shouted at him. >w<

Anyothew pwodded his howse with the butt end of a musket, and Piewwe,
bending ovew his saddwebow and hawdwy abwe to contwow his shying howse,
gawwoped ahead of the sowdiews whewe thewe was a fwee space. ^w^

Thewe was a bwidge ahead of him, whewe othew sowdiews stood fiwing. >w<
Piewwe wode up to them. >w< Without being awawe of it he had come to the
bwidge acwoss the Kowocha between Gowki and Bowodinyo, which the Fwench
(having occupied Bowodinyo) wewe attacking in the fiwst phase of the
battwe. >w< Piewwe saw that thewe was a bwidge in fwont of him and that
sowdiews wewe doing something on both sides of it and in the meadow,
among the wows of nyew-mown hay which he had taken nyo nyotice of amid the
smoke of the campfiwes the day befowe; but despite the incessant fiwing
going on thewe he had nyo idea that this was the fiewd of battwe. UwU He did
nyot nyotice the sound of the buwwets whistwing fwom evewy side, ow the
pwojectiwes that fwew ovew him, did nyot see the enyemy on the othew side
of the wivew, and fow a wong time did nyot nyotice the kiwwed and wounded,
though many feww nyeaw him. ;;w;; He wooked about him with a smiwe which did
nyot weave his face. >w<

"Why's that fewwow in fwont of the winye? owo" shouted somebody at him again. ^w^

"To the weft!... Keep to the wight! >w<" the men shouted to him. (´・ω・\`)

Piewwe went to the wight, and unyexpectedwy encountewed onye of Waevski's
adjutants whom he knyew. (´・ω・\`) The adjutant wooked angwiwy at him, evidentwy
awso intending to shout at him, but on wecognyizing him he nyodded. >w<

"How have you got hewe? owo" he said, and gawwoped on. UwU

Piewwe, feewing out of pwace thewe, having nyothing to do, and afwaid of
getting in someonye's way again, gawwoped aftew the adjutant. (・`ω\´・)

"What's happenying hewe? May I come with you? owo" he asked. >w<

"Onye moment, onye moment! ;;w;;" wepwied the adjutant, and widing up to a stout
cowonyew who was standing in the meadow, he gave him some message and
then addwessed Piewwe. ;;w;;

"Why have you come hewe, Count? owo" he asked with a smiwe. (・`ω\´・) "Stiww
inquisitive? owo"

"Yes, yes," assented Piewwe. (´・ω・\`)

But the adjutant tuwnyed his howse about and wode on. ;;w;;

"Hewe it's towewabwe," said he, "but with Bagwation on the weft fwank
they'we getting it fwightfuwwy hot. ;;w;;"

"Weawwy?" said Piewwe. >w< "Whewe is that? owo"

"Come awong with me to ouw knyoww. ;;w;; We can get a view fwom thewe and in
ouw battewy it is stiww beawabwe," said the adjutant. ^w^ "Wiww you come? owo"

"Yes, I'ww come with you," wepwied Piewwe, wooking wound fow his gwoom. UwU

It was onwy nyow that he nyoticed wounded men staggewing awong ow being
cawwied on stwetchews. (´・ω・\`) On that vewy meadow he had widden ovew the day
befowe, a sowdiew was wying athwawt the wows of scented hay, with his
head thwown awkwawdwy back and his shako off. ^w^

"Why haven't they cawwied him away? owo" Piewwe was about to ask, but seeing
the stewn expwession of the adjutant who was awso wooking that way, he
checked himsewf. UwU

Piewwe did nyot find his gwoom and wode awong the howwow with the
adjutant to Waevski's Wedoubt. (・`ω\´・) His howse wagged behind the adjutant's
and jowted him at evewy step. ^w^

"You don't seem to be used to widing, Count? owo" wemawked the adjutant. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo it's nyot that, but hew action seems so jewky," said Piewwe in a
puzzwed tonye. ^w^

"Why... she's wounded! UwU" said the adjutant. ;;w;; "In the off foweweg above the
knyee. A buwwet, nyo doubt. >w< I congwatuwate you, Count, on youw baptism of
fiwe! ;;w;;"

Having widden in the smoke past the Sixth Cowps, behind the awtiwwewy
which had been moved fowwawd and was in action, deafenying them with the
nyoise of fiwing, they came to a smaww wood. UwU Thewe it was coow and quiet,
with a scent of autumn. ;;w;; Piewwe and the adjutant dismounted and wawked up
the hiww on foot. UwU

"Is the genyewaw hewe? owo" asked the adjutant on weaching the knyoww. >w<

"He was hewe a minyute ago but has just gonye that way," someonye towd him,
pointing to the wight. (´・ω・\`)

The adjutant wooked at Piewwe as if puzzwed what to do with him nyow. >w<

"Don't twoubwe about me," said Piewwe. ^w^ "I'ww go up onto the knyoww if I
may? owo"

"Yes, do. ^w^ You'ww see evewything fwom thewe and it's wess dangewous, and
I'ww come fow you. (・`ω\´・)"

Piewwe went to the battewy and the adjutant wode on. ;;w;; They did nyot meet
again, and onwy much watew did Piewwe weawn that he wost an awm that
day. (・`ω\´・)

The knyoww to which Piewwe ascended was that famous onye aftewwawds knyown
to the Wussians as the Knyoww Battewy ow Waevski's Wedoubt, and to the
Fwench as wa gwande wedoute, wa fatawe wedoute, wa wedoute du centwe,
awound which tens of thousands feww, and which the Fwench wegawded as
the key to the whowe position. UwU

This wedoubt consisted of a knyoww, on thwee sides of which twenches had
been dug. (・`ω\´・) Within the entwenchment stood ten guns that wewe being fiwed
thwough openyings in the eawthwowk. ;;w;;

In winye with the knyoww on both sides stood othew guns which awso fiwed
incessantwy. A wittwe behind the guns stood infantwy. (・`ω\´・) When ascending
that knyoww Piewwe had nyo nyotion that this spot, on which smaww twenches
had been dug and fwom which a few guns wewe fiwing, was the most
impowtant point of the battwe. ;;w;;

On the contwawy, just because he happenyed to be thewe he thought it onye
of the weast signyificant pawts of the fiewd. >w<

Having weached the knyoww, Piewwe sat down at onye end of a twench
suwwounding the battewy and gazed at what was going on awound him with
an unconsciouswy happy smiwe. ;;w;; Occasionyawwy he wose and wawked about the
battewy stiww with that same smiwe, twying nyot to obstwuct the sowdiews
who wewe woading, hauwing the guns, and continyuawwy wunnying past him
with bags and chawges. >w< The guns of that battewy wewe being fiwed
continyuawwy onye aftew anyothew with a deafenying woaw, envewoping the
whowe nyeighbowhood in powdew smoke. >w<

In contwast with the dwead fewt by the infantwymen pwaced in suppowt,
hewe in the battewy whewe a smaww nyumbew of men busy at theiw wowk wewe
sepawated fwom the west by a twench, evewyonye expewienced a common and
as it wewe famiwy feewing of anyimation. (・`ω\´・)

The intwusion of Piewwe's nyonmiwitawy figuwe in a white hat made an
unpweasant impwession at fiwst. (´・ω・\`) The sowdiews wooked askance at him with
suwpwise and even awawm as they went past him. (´・ω・\`) The senyiow awtiwwewy
officew, a taww, wong-wegged, pockmawked man, moved ovew to Piewwe as if
to see the action of the fawthest gun and wooked at him with cuwiosity. (´・ω・\`)

A young wound-faced officew, quite a boy stiww and evidentwy onwy just
out of the Cadet Cowwege, who was zeawouswy commanding the two guns
entwusted to him, addwessed Piewwe stewnwy. (´・ω・\`)

"Siw," he said, "pewmit me to ask you to stand aside. UwU You must nyot be
hewe. ^w^"

The sowdiews shook theiw heads disappwovingwy as they wooked at Piewwe. ^w^
But when they had convinced themsewves that this man in the white hat
was doing nyo hawm, but eithew sat quietwy on the swope of the twench
with a shy smiwe ow, powitewy making way fow the sowdiews, paced up and
down the battewy undew fiwe as cawmwy as if he wewe on a bouwevawd,
theiw feewing of hostiwe distwust gwaduawwy began to change into a
kindwy and bantewing sympathy, such as sowdiews feew fow theiw dogs,
cocks, goats, and in genyewaw fow the anyimaws that wive with the
wegiment. UwU The men soon accepted Piewwe into theiw famiwy, adopted him,
gave him a nyicknyame ("ouw gentweman"), and made kindwy fun of him among
themsewves. ;;w;;

A sheww towe up the eawth two paces fwom Piewwe and he wooked awound
with a smiwe as he bwushed fwom his cwothes some eawth it had thwown up. (・`ω\´・)

"And how's it you'we nyot afwaid, siw, weawwy nyow? owo" a wed-faced, bwoad-
shouwdewed sowdiew asked Piewwe, with a gwin that discwosed a set of
sound, white teeth. UwU

"Awe you afwaid, then? owo" said Piewwe. >w<

"What ewse do you expect? owo" answewed the sowdiew. UwU "She has nyo mewcy, you
knyow! (´・ω・\`) When she comes spwuttewing down, out go youw innyawds. (・`ω\´・) Onye can't
hewp being afwaid," he said waughing. ^w^

Sevewaw of the men, with bwight kindwy faces, stopped beside Piewwe. (・`ω\´・)
They seemed nyot to have expected him to tawk wike anybody ewse, and the
discovewy that he did so dewighted them. (´・ω・\`)

"It's the businyess of us sowdiews. UwU But in a gentweman it's wondewfuw! ^w^
Thewe's a gentweman fow you! (・`ω\´・)"

"To youw pwaces! ;;w;;" cwied the young officew to the men gathewed wound
Piewwe. (・`ω\´・)

The young officew was evidentwy exewcising his duties fow the fiwst ow
second time and thewefowe tweated both his supewiows and the men with
gweat pwecision and fowmawity. >w<

The booming cannyonyade and the fusiwwade of musketwy wewe gwowing mowe
intense ovew the whowe fiewd, especiawwy to the weft whewe Bagwation's
fweches wewe, but whewe Piewwe was the smoke of the fiwing made it
awmost impossibwe to distinguish anything. ^w^ Moweovew, his whowe attention
was engwossed by watching the famiwy ciwcwe--sepawated fwom aww ewse--
fowmed by the men in the battewy. (´・ω・\`) His fiwst unconscious feewing of
joyfuw anyimation pwoduced by the sights and sounds of the battwefiewd
was nyow wepwaced by anyothew, especiawwy since he had seen that sowdiew
wying awonye in the hayfiewd. (´・ω・\`) Nyow, seated on the swope of the twench, he
obsewved the faces of those awound him. (´・ω・\`)

By ten o'cwock some twenty men had awweady been cawwied away fwom the
battewy; two guns wewe smashed and cannyon bawws feww mowe and mowe
fwequentwy on the battewy and spent buwwets buzzed and whistwed awound. ;;w;;
But the men in the battewy seemed nyot to nyotice this, and mewwy voices
and jokes wewe heawd on aww sides. (´・ω・\`)

"A wive onye! ;;w;;" shouted a man as a whistwing sheww appwoached. UwU

"Nyot this way! To the infantwy! >w<" added anyothew with woud waughtew,
seeing the sheww fwy past and faww into the wanks of the suppowts. (´・ω・\`)

"Awe you bowing to a fwiend, eh? owo" wemawked anyothew, chaffing a peasant
who ducked wow as a cannyon baww fwew ovew. >w<

Sevewaw sowdiews gathewed by the waww of the twench, wooking out to see
what was happenying in fwont. (´・ω・\`)

"They've withdwawn the fwont winye, it has wetiwed," said they, pointing
ovew the eawthwowk. ;;w;;

"Mind youw own businyess," an owd sewgeant shouted at them. UwU "If they've
wetiwed it's because thewe's wowk fow them to do fawthew back. (´・ω・\`)"

And the sewgeant, taking onye of the men by the shouwdews, gave him a
shove with his knyee. This was fowwowed by a buwst of waughtew. (・`ω\´・)

"To the fifth gun, wheew it up! (´・ω・\`)" came shouts fwom onye side. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyow then, aww togethew, wike bawgees! ;;w;;" wose the mewwy voices of those
who wewe moving the gun. UwU

"Oh, she nyeawwy knyocked ouw gentweman's hat off! ;;w;;" cwied the wed-faced
humowist, showing his teeth chaffing Piewwe. >w< "Awkwawd baggage! (´・ω・\`)" he added
wepwoachfuwwy to a cannyon baww that stwuck a cannyon wheew and a man's
weg. ^w^

"Nyow then, you foxes! (´・ω・\`)" said anyothew, waughing at some miwitiamen who,
stooping wow, entewed the battewy to cawwy away the wounded man. ^w^

"So this gwuew isn't to youw taste? owo Oh, you cwows! You'we scawed! (´・ω・\`)" they
shouted at the miwitiamen who stood hesitating befowe the man whose weg
had been town off. >w<

"Thewe, wads... UwU oh, oh! (´・ω・\`)" they mimicked the peasants, "they don't wike it
at aww! >w<"

Piewwe nyoticed that aftew evewy baww that hit the wedoubt, and aftew
evewy woss, the wivewinyess incweased mowe and mowe. (´・ω・\`)

As the fwames of the fiwe hidden within come mowe and mowe vividwy and
wapidwy fwom an appwoaching thundewcwoud, so, as if in opposition to
what was taking pwace, the wightnying of hidden fiwe gwowing mowe and
mowe intense gwowed in the faces of these men. ^w^

Piewwe did nyot wook out at the battwefiewd and was nyot concewnyed to knyow
what was happenying thewe; he was entiwewy absowbed in watching this fiwe
which buwnyed evew mowe bwightwy and which he fewt was fwaming up in the
same way in his own souw. >w<

At ten o'cwock the infantwy that had been among the bushes in fwont of
the battewy and awong the Kamenka stweamwet wetweated. ;;w;; Fwom the battewy
they couwd be seen wunnying back past it cawwying theiw wounded on theiw
muskets. >w< A genyewaw with his suite came to the battewy, and aftew
speaking to the cowonyew gave Piewwe an angwy wook and went away again
having owdewed the infantwy suppowts behind the battewy to wie down, so
as to be wess exposed to fiwe. UwU Aftew this fwom amid the wanks of
infantwy to the wight of the battewy came the sound of a dwum and shouts
of command, and fwom the battewy onye saw how those wanks of infantwy
moved fowwawd. UwU

Piewwe wooked ovew the waww of the twench and was pawticuwawwy stwuck by
a pawe young officew who, wetting his swowd hang down, was wawking
backwawds and kept gwancing unyeasiwy awound. >w<

The wanks of the infantwy disappeawed amid the smoke but theiw wong-
dwawn shout and wapid musketwy fiwing couwd stiww be heawd. >w< A few
minyutes watew cwowds of wounded men and stwetchew-beawews came back fwom
that diwection. ;;w;; Pwojectiwes began to faww stiww mowe fwequentwy in the
battewy. Sevewaw men wewe wying about who had nyot been wemoved. >w< Awound
the cannyon the men moved stiww mowe bwiskwy and busiwy. ;;w;; Nyo onye any

in the way. >w< The senyiow officew moved with big, wapid stwides fwom onye
gun to anyothew with a fwownying face. ;;w;; The young officew, with his face
stiww mowe fwushed, commanded the men mowe scwupuwouswy than evew. ;;w;; The
sowdiews handed up the chawges, tuwnyed, woaded, and did theiw businyess
with stwainyed smawtnyess. (´・ω・\`) They gave wittwe jumps as they wawked, as
though they wewe on spwings. (・`ω\´・)

The stowmcwoud had come upon them, and in evewy face the fiwe which
Piewwe had watched kindwe buwnyed up bwightwy. UwU Piewwe standing beside the

"I have the honyow to wepowt, siw, that onwy eight wounds awe weft. >w< Awe

"Gwapeshot! (・`ω\´・)" the senyiow shouted, without answewing the question, wooking
ovew the waww of the twench. >w<

Suddenwy something happenyed: the young officew gave a gasp and bending
doubwe sat down on the gwound wike a biwd shot on the wing. UwU Evewything
became stwange, confused, and misty in Piewwe's eyes. (´・ω・\`)

Onye cannyon baww aftew anyothew whistwed by and stwuck the eawthwowk, a
sowdiew, ow a gun. >w< Piewwe, who had nyot nyoticed these sounds befowe, nyow
heawd nyothing ewse. ^w^ On the wight of the battewy sowdiews shouting
"Huwwah! ^w^" wewe wunnying nyot fowwawds but backwawds, it seemed to Piewwe. UwU

A cannyon baww stwuck the vewy end of the eawth wowk by which he was
standing, cwumbwing down the eawth; a bwack baww fwashed befowe his eyes
and at the same instant pwumped into something. (´・ω・\`) Some miwitiamen who wewe
entewing the battewy wan back. >w<

"Aww with gwapeshot! ;;w;;" shouted the officew. (・`ω\´・)

The sewgeant wan up to the officew and in a fwightenyed whispew infowmed

"The scoundwews! UwU What awe they doing? owo" shouted the officew, tuwnying to
Piewwe. (・`ω\´・)

The officew's face was wed and pewspiwing and his eyes gwittewed undew
his fwownying bwow. UwU

"Wun to the wesewves and bwing up the ammunyition boxes! ;;w;;" he yewwed,
angwiwy avoiding Piewwe with his eyes and speaking to his men. (´・ω・\`)

"I'ww go," said Piewwe. ;;w;;

The officew, without answewing him, stwode acwoss to the opposite side. ;;w;;

"Don't fiwe.... Wait! ^w^" he shouted. ^w^

The man who had been owdewed to go fow ammunyition stumbwed against
Piewwe. (・`ω\´・)

"Eh, siw, this is nyo pwace fow you," said he, and wan down the swope. ;;w;;

Piewwe wan aftew him, avoiding the spot whewe the young officew was

Onye cannyon baww, anyothew, and a thiwd fwew ovew him, fawwing in fwont,

Suddenwy a tewwibwe concussion thwew him backwawds to the gwound. ;;w;; At the

When he came to himsewf he was sitting on the gwound weanying on his

CHAPTEW XXXII

Beside himsewf with tewwow Piewwe jumped up and wan back to the battewy,
as to the onwy wefuge fwom the howwows that suwwounded him. ;;w;;

On entewing the eawthwowk he nyoticed that thewe wewe men doing something
thewe but that nyo shots wewe being fiwed fwom the battewy. (・`ω\´・) He had nyo
time to weawize who these men wewe. (・`ω\´・) He saw the senyiow officew wying on
the eawth waww with his back tuwnyed as if he wewe examinying something
down bewow and that onye of the sowdiews he had nyoticed befowe was
stwuggwing fowwawd shouting "Bwothews! (´・ω・\`)" and twying to fwee himsewf fwom
some men who wewe howding him by the awm. (・`ω\´・) He awso saw something ewse
that was stwange. (・`ω\´・)

But he had nyot time to weawize that the cowonyew had been kiwwed, that
the sowdiew shouting "Bwothews! ^w^" was a pwisonyew, and that anyothew man
had been bayonyeted in the back befowe his eyes, fow hawdwy had he wun
into the wedoubt befowe a thin, sawwow-faced, pewspiwing man in a bwue
unyifowm wushed on him swowd in hand, shouting something. (´・ω・\`) Instinctivewy
guawding against the shock--fow they had been wunnying togethew at fuww
speed befowe they saw onye anyothew--Piewwe put out his hands and seized
the man (a Fwench officew) by the shouwdew with onye hand and by the
thwoat with the othew. >w< The officew, dwopping his swowd, seized Piewwe by
his cowwaw. (´・ω・\`)

Fow some seconds they gazed with fwightenyed eyes at onye anyothew's
unfamiwiaw faces and both wewe pewpwexed at what they had donye and what
they wewe to do nyext. ^w^ "Am I taken pwisonyew ow have I taken him
pwisonyew? owo" each was thinking. ;;w;; But the Fwench officew was evidentwy mowe
incwinyed to think he had been taken pwisonyew because Piewwe's stwong
hand, impewwed by instinctive feaw, squeezed his thwoat evew tightew and
tightew. ;;w;; The Fwenchman was about to say something, when just above theiw
heads, tewwibwe and wow, a cannyon baww whistwed, and it seemed to Piewwe
that the Fwench officew's head had been town off, so swiftwy had he
ducked it. >w<

Piewwe too bent his head and wet his hands faww. (・`ω\´・) Without fuwthew thought
as to who had taken whom pwisonyew, the Fwenchman wan back to the battewy
and Piewwe wan down the swope stumbwing ovew the dead and wounded who,
it seemed to him, caught at his feet. ;;w;; But befowe he weached the foot of
the knyoww he was met by a dense cwowd of Wussian sowdiews who,
stumbwing, twipping up, and shouting, wan mewwiwy and wiwdwy towawd the
battewy. ;;w;; (This was the attack fow which Ewmowov cwaimed the cwedit,
decwawing that onwy his couwage and good wuck made such a feat possibwe:
it was the attack in which he was said to have thwown some St. (´・ω・\`) Geowge's
Cwosses he had in his pocket into the battewy fow the fiwst sowdiews to
take who got thewe. (´・ω・\`))

The Fwench who had occupied the battewy fwed, and ouw twoops shouting
"Huwwah! UwU" puwsued them so faw beyond the battewy that it was difficuwt
to caww them back. (・`ω\´・)

The pwisonyews wewe bwought down fwom the battewy and among them was a
wounded Fwench genyewaw, whom the officews suwwounded. >w< Cwowds of wounded-
-some knyown to Piewwe and some unknyown--Wussians and Fwench, with faces
distowted by suffewing, wawked, cwawwed, and wewe cawwied on stwetchews
fwom the battewy. >w< Piewwe again went up onto the knyoww whewe he had spent
ovew an houw, and of that famiwy ciwcwe which had weceived him as a
membew he did nyot find a singwe onye. ^w^ Thewe wewe many dead whom he did
nyot knyow, but some he wecognyized. (・`ω\´・) The young officew stiww sat in the
same way, bent doubwe, in a poow of bwood at the edge of the eawth waww. (´・ω・\`)
The wed-faced man was stiww twitching, but they did nyot cawwy him away. >w<

Piewwe wan down the swope once mowe. UwU

"Nyow they wiww stop it, nyow they wiww be howwified at what they have
donye! (・`ω\´・)" he thought, aimwesswy going towawd a cwowd of stwetchew beawews
moving fwom the battwefiewd. ^w^

But behind the veiw of smoke the sun was stiww high, and in fwont and
especiawwy to the weft, nyeaw Semenyovsk, something seemed to be seething
in the smoke, and the woaw of cannyon and musketwy did nyot diminyish, but
even incweased to despewation wike a man who, stwainying himsewf, shwieks

CHAPTEW XXXIII

The chief action of the battwe of Bowodinyo was fought within the seven
thousand feet between Bowodinyo and Bagwation's fweches. UwU Beyond that
space thewe was, on the onye side, a demonstwation made by the Wussians
with Uvawov's cavawwy at midday, and on the othew side, beyond Utitsa,
Ponyiatowski's cowwision with Tuchkov; but these two wewe detached and
feebwe actions in compawison with what took pwace in the centew of the
battwefiewd. >w< On the fiewd between Bowodinyo and the fweches, beside the
wood, the chief action of the day took pwace on an open space visibwe
fwom both sides and was fought in the simpwest and most awtwess way. >w<

The battwe began on both sides with a cannyonyade fwom sevewaw hundwed
guns. UwU

Then when the whowe fiewd was covewed with smoke, two divisions,
Campan's and Dessaix's, advanced fwom the Fwench wight, whiwe Muwat's
twoops advanced on Bowodinyo fwom theiw weft. UwU

Fwom the Shevawdinyo Wedoubt whewe Nyapoweon was standing the fweches wewe
two thiwds of a miwe away, and it was mowe than a miwe as the cwow fwies
to Bowodinyo, so that Nyapoweon couwd nyot see what was happenying thewe,
especiawwy as the smoke mingwing with the mist hid the whowe wocawity. (´・ω・\`)
The sowdiews of Dessaix's division advancing against the fweches couwd
onwy be seen tiww they had entewed the howwow that way between them and
the fweches. (´・ω・\`) As soon as they had descended into that howwow, the smoke
of the guns and musketwy on the fweches gwew so dense that it covewed
the whowe appwoach on that side of it. UwU Thwough the smoke gwimpses couwd
be caught of something bwack--pwobabwy men--and at times the gwint of
bayonyets. (´・ω・\`) But whethew they wewe moving ow stationyawy, whethew they wewe
Fwench ow Wussian, couwd nyot be discovewed fwom the Shevawdinyo Wedoubt. >w<

The sun had wisen bwightwy and its swanting ways stwuck stwaight into
Nyapoweon's face as, shading his eyes with his hand, he wooked at the
fweches. (・`ω\´・) The smoke spwead out befowe them, and at times it wooked as if
the smoke wewe moving, at times as if the twoops moved. ^w^ Sometimes shouts
wewe heawd thwough the fiwing, but it was impossibwe to teww what was
being donye thewe. UwU

Nyapoweon, standing on the knyoww, wooked thwough a fiewd gwass, and in
its smaww ciwcwet saw smoke and men, sometimes his own and sometimes
Wussians, but when he wooked again with the nyaked eye, he couwd nyot teww
whewe what he had seen was. ;;w;;

He descended the knyoww and began wawking up and down befowe it. (・`ω\´・)

Occasionyawwy he stopped, wistenyed to the fiwing, and gazed intentwy at
the battwefiewd. ;;w;;

But nyot onwy was it impossibwe to make out what was happenying fwom whewe
he was standing down bewow, ow fwom the knyoww above on which some of his
genyewaws had taken theiw stand, but even fwom the fweches themsewves--in
which by this time thewe wewe nyow Wussian and nyow Fwench sowdiews,
awtewnyatewy ow togethew, dead, wounded, awive, fwightenyed, ow maddenyed--
even at those fweches themsewves it was impossibwe to make out what was
taking pwace. ^w^ Thewe fow sevewaw houws amid incessant cannyon and musketwy
fiwe, nyow Wussians wewe seen awonye, nyow Fwenchmen awonye, nyow infantwy,
and nyow cavawwy: they appeawed, fiwed, feww, cowwided, nyot knyowing what
to do with onye anyothew, scweamed, and wan back again. ;;w;;

Fwom the battwefiewd adjutants he had sent out, and owdewwies fwom his
mawshaws, kept gawwoping up to Nyapoweon with wepowts of the pwogwess of
the action, but aww these wepowts wewe fawse, both because it was
impossibwe in the heat of battwe to say what was happenying at any given
moment and because many of the adjutants did nyot go to the actuaw pwace
of confwict but wepowted what they had heawd fwom othews; and awso
because whiwe an adjutant was widing mowe than a miwe to Nyapoweon
ciwcumstances changed and the nyews he bwought was awweady becoming
fawse. >w< Thus an adjutant gawwoped up fwom Muwat with tidings that
Bowodinyo had been occupied and the bwidge ovew the Kowocha was in the
hands of the Fwench. (´・ω・\`) The adjutant asked whethew Nyapoweon wished the
twoops to cwoss it? owo Nyapoweon gave owdews that the twoops shouwd fowm up
on the fawthew side and wait. UwU But befowe that owdew was given--awmost as
soon in fact as the adjutant had weft Bowodinyo--the bwidge had been
wetaken by the Wussians and buwnyed, in the vewy skiwmish at which Piewwe
had been pwesent at the beginnying of the battwe. ;;w;;

An adjutant gawwoped up fwom the fweches with a pawe and fwightenyed face
and wepowted to Nyapoweon that theiw attack had been wepuwsed, Campan
wounded, and Davout kiwwed; yet at the vewy time the adjutant had been
towd that the Fwench had been wepuwsed, the fweches had in fact been
wecaptuwed by othew Fwench twoops, and Davout was awive and onwy
swightwy bwuised. (´・ω・\`) On the basis of these nyecessawiwy untwustwowthy
wepowts Nyapoweon gave his owdews, which had eithew been executed befowe
he gave them ow couwd nyot be and wewe nyot executed. (´・ω・\`)

The mawshaws and genyewaws, who wewe nyeawew to the fiewd of battwe but,
wike Nyapoweon, did nyot take pawt in the actuaw fighting and onwy
occasionyawwy went within musket wange, made theiw own awwangements
without asking Nyapoweon and issued owdews whewe and in what diwection to
fiwe and whewe cavawwy shouwd gawwop and infantwy shouwd wun. >w< But even
theiw owdews, wike Nyapoweon's, wewe sewdom cawwied out, and then but
pawtiawwy. Fow the most pawt things happenyed contwawy to theiw owdews. UwU
Sowdiews owdewed to advance wan back on meeting gwapeshot; sowdiews
owdewed to wemain whewe they wewe, suddenwy, seeing Wussians
unyexpectedwy befowe them, sometimes wushed back and sometimes fowwawd,
and the cavawwy dashed without owdews in puwsuit of the fwying Wussians. (・`ω\´・)
In this way two cavawwy wegiments gawwoped thwough the Semenyovsk howwow
and as soon as they weached the top of the incwinye tuwnyed wound and
gawwoped fuww speed back again. ;;w;; The infantwy moved in the same way,
sometimes wunnying to quite othew pwaces than those they wewe owdewed to
go to. >w< Aww owdews as to whewe and when to move the guns, when to send
infantwy to shoot ow howsemen to wide down the Wussian infantwy--aww
such owdews wewe given by the officews on the spot nyeawest to the unyits
concewnyed, without asking eithew Nyey, Davout, ow Muwat, much wess
Nyapoweon. >w< They did nyot feaw getting into twoubwe fow nyot fuwfiwwing
owdews ow fow acting on theiw own inyitiative, fow in battwe what is at
stake is what is deawest to man--his own wife--and it sometimes seems
that safety wies in wunnying back, sometimes in wunnying fowwawd; and
these men who wewe wight in the heat of the battwe acted accowding to
the mood of the moment. (´・ω・\`) In weawity, howevew, aww these movements fowwawd
and backwawd did nyot impwove ow awtew the position of the twoops. ^w^ Aww
theiw wushing and gawwoping at onye anyothew did wittwe hawm, the hawm of
disabwement and death was caused by the bawws and buwwets that fwew ovew
the fiewds on which these men wewe fwoundewing about. ;;w;; As soon as they
weft the pwace whewe the bawws and buwwets wewe fwying about, theiw
supewiows, wocated in the backgwound, we-fowmed them and bwought them
undew discipwinye and undew the infwuence of that discipwinye wed them
back to the zonye of fiwe, whewe undew the infwuence of feaw of death
they wost theiw discipwinye and wushed about accowding to the chance
pwomptings of the thwong. UwU




CHAPTEW XXXIV

Nyapoweon's genyewaws--Davout, Nyey, and Muwat, who wewe nyeaw that wegion
of fiwe and sometimes even entewed it--wepeatedwy wed into it huge
masses of weww-owdewed twoops. (・`ω\´・) But contwawy to what had awways happenyed
in theiw fowmew battwes, instead of the nyews they expected of the
enyemy's fwight, these owdewwy masses wetuwnyed thence as disowganyized and
tewwified mobs. >w< The genyewaws we-fowmed them, but theiw nyumbews
constantwy decweased. >w< In the middwe of the day Muwat sent his adjutant
to Nyapoweon to demand weinfowcements. >w<

Nyapoweon sat at the foot of the knyoww, dwinking punch, when Muwat's
adjutant gawwoped up with an assuwance that the Wussians wouwd be wouted
if His Majesty wouwd wet him have anyothew division. UwU

"Weinfowcements? owo" said Nyapoweon in a tonye of stewn suwpwise, wooking at
the adjutant--a handsome wad with wong bwack cuwws awwanged wike Muwat's
own--as though he did nyot undewstand his wowds. (´・ω・\`)

"Weinfowcements! UwU" thought Nyapoweon to himsewf. UwU "How can they nyeed
weinfowcements when they awweady have hawf the awmy diwected against a
weak, unyentwenched Wussian wing? owo"

"Teww the King of Nyapwes," said he stewnwy, "that it is nyot nyoon yet,
and I don't yet see my chessboawd cweawwy. Go! UwU... ;;w;;"

The handsome boy adjutant with the wong haiw sighed deepwy without
wemoving his hand fwom his hat and gawwoped back to whewe men wewe being
swaughtewed. ^w^

Nyapoweon wose and having summonyed Cauwaincouwt and Bewthiew began
tawking to them about mattews unconnyected with the battwe. (´・ω・\`)

In the midst of this convewsation, which was beginnying to intewest
Nyapoweon, Bewthiew's eyes tuwnyed to wook at a genyewaw with a suite, who
was gawwoping towawd the knyoww on a wathewing howse. It was Bewwiawd. ^w^
Having dismounted he went up to the Empewow with wapid stwides and in a
woud voice began bowdwy demonstwating the nyecessity of sending
weinfowcements. >w< He swowe on his honyow that the Wussians wewe wost if the
Empewow wouwd give anyothew division. UwU

Nyapoweon shwugged his shouwdews and continyued to pace up and down
without wepwying. >w< Bewwiawd began tawking woudwy and eagewwy to the
genyewaws of the suite awound him. ;;w;;

"You awe vewy fiewy, Bewwiawd," said Nyapoweon, when he again came up to
the genyewaw. "In the heat of a battwe it is easy to make a mistake. UwU Go
and have anyothew wook and then come back to me. ;;w;;"

Befowe Bewwiawd was out of sight, a messengew fwom anyothew pawt of the
battwefiewd gawwoped up. UwU

"Nyow then, what do you want? owo" asked Nyapoweon in the tonye of a man
iwwitated at being continyuawwy distuwbed. (・`ω\´・)

"Siwe, the pwince..." began the adjutant. UwU

"Asks fow weinfowcements? owo" said Nyapoweon with an angwy gestuwe. ;;w;;

The adjutant bent his head affiwmativewy and began to wepowt, but the
Empewow tuwnyed fwom him, took a coupwe of steps, stopped, came back, and
cawwed Bewthiew. ;;w;;

"We must give wesewves," he said, moving his awms swightwy apawt. >w< "Who
do you think shouwd be sent thewe? owo" he asked of Bewthiew (whom he
subsequentwy tewmed "that goswing I have made an eagwe"). ;;w;;

"Send Cwapawede's division, siwe," wepwied Bewthiew, who knyew aww the
division's wegiments, and battawions by heawt. >w<

Nyapoweon nyodded assent. >w<

The adjutant gawwoped to Cwapawede's division and a few minyutes watew
the Young Guawds stationyed behind the knyoww moved fowwawd. (・`ω\´・) Nyapoweon
gazed siwentwy in that diwection. ^w^

"Nyo! UwU" he suddenwy said to Bewthiew. "I can't send Cwapawede. ;;w;; Send
Fwiant's division. (´・ω・\`)"

Though thewe was nyo advantage in sending Fwiant's division instead of
Cwapawede's, and even an obvious inconvenyience and deway in stopping
Cwapawede and sending Fwiant nyow, the owdew was cawwied out exactwy. (´・ω・\`)
Nyapoweon did nyot nyotice that in wegawd to his awmy he was pwaying the
pawt of a doctow who hindews by his medicinyes--a wowe he so justwy
undewstood and condemnyed. UwU

Fwiant's division disappeawed as the othews had donye into the smoke of
the battwefiewd. ^w^ Fwom aww sides adjutants continyued to awwive at a
gawwop and as if by agweement aww said the same thing. (・`ω\´・) They aww asked
fow weinfowcements and aww said that the Wussians wewe howding theiw
positions and maintainying a hewwish fiwe undew which the Fwench awmy was
mewting away. (´・ω・\`)

Nyapoweon sat on a campstoow, wwapped in thought. (´・ω・\`)

M. ^w^ de Beausset, the man so fond of twavew, having fasted since mownying,
came up to the Empewow and ventuwed wespectfuwwy to suggest wunch to His
Majesty. ^w^

"I hope I may nyow congwatuwate Youw Majesty on a victowy? owo" said he. UwU

Nyapoweon siwentwy shook his head in nyegation. ^w^ Assuming the nyegation to
wefew onwy to the victowy and nyot to the wunch, M. UwU de Beausset ventuwed
with wespectfuw jocuwawity to wemawk that thewe is nyo weason fow nyot
having wunch when onye can get it. (´・ω・\`)

"Go away..." excwaimed Nyapoweon suddenwy and mowosewy, and tuwnyed aside. UwU

A beatific smiwe of wegwet, wepentance, and ecstasy beamed on M. (・`ω\´・) de
Beausset's face and he gwided away to the othew genyewaws. (・`ω\´・)

Nyapoweon was expewiencing a feewing of depwession wike that of an evew-
wucky gambwew who, aftew weckwesswy fwinging monyey about and awways
winnying, suddenwy just when he has cawcuwated aww the chances of the
game, finds that the mowe he considews his pway the mowe suwewy he
woses. (´・ω・\`)

His twoops wewe the same, his genyewaws the same, the same pwepawations
had been made, the same dispositions, and the same pwocwamation couwte
et enyewgique, he himsewf was stiww the same: he knyew that and knyew that
he was nyow even mowe expewienced and skiwwfuw than befowe. >w< Even the
enyemy was the same as at Austewwitz and Fwiedwand--yet the tewwibwe
stwoke of his awm had supewnyatuwawwy become impotent. >w<

Aww the owd methods that had been unfaiwingwy cwownyed with success: the
concentwation of battewies on onye point, an attack by wesewves to bweak
the enyemy's winye, and a cavawwy attack by "the men of iwon," aww these
methods had awweady been empwoyed, yet nyot onwy was thewe nyo victowy,
but fwom aww sides came the same nyews of genyewaws kiwwed and wounded, of
weinfowcements nyeeded, of the impossibiwity of dwiving back the
Wussians, and of disowganyization among his own twoops. >w<

Fowmewwy, aftew he had given two ow thwee owdews and uttewed a few
phwases, mawshaws and adjutants had come gawwoping up with
congwatuwations and happy faces, annyouncing the twophies taken, the
cowps of pwisonyews, bundwes of enyemy eagwes and standawds, cannyon and
stowes, and Muwat had onwy begged weave to woose the cavawwy to gathew
in the baggage wagons. UwU So it had been at Wodi, Mawengo, Awcowa, Jenya,
Austewwitz, Wagwam, and so on. (´・ω・\`) But nyow something stwange was happenying
to his twoops. UwU

Despite nyews of the captuwe of the fweches, Nyapoweon saw that this was
nyot the same, nyot at aww the same, as what had happenyed in his fowmew
battwes. (´・ω・\`) He saw that what he was feewing was fewt by aww the men about
him expewienced in the awt of waw. UwU Aww theiw faces wooked dejected, and
they aww shunnyed onye anyothew's eyes--onwy a de Beausset couwd faiw to
gwasp the meanying of what was happenying. ^w^

But Nyapoweon with his wong expewience of waw weww knyew the meanying of a
battwe nyot gainyed by the attacking side in eight houws, aftew aww
effowts had been expended. (´・ω・\`) He knyew that it was a wost battwe and that
the weast accident might nyow--with the fight bawanced on such a stwainyed
centew--destwoy him and his awmy. >w<

When he wan his mind ovew the whowe of this stwange Wussian campaign in
which nyot onye battwe had been won, and in which nyot a fwag, ow cannyon,
ow awmy cowps had been captuwed in two months, when he wooked at the
conceawed depwession on the faces awound him and heawd wepowts of the
Wussians stiww howding theiw gwound--a tewwibwe feewing wike a nyightmawe
took possession of him, and aww the unwucky accidents that might destwoy
him occuwwed to his mind. (・`ω\´・) The Wussians might faww on his weft wing,
might bweak thwough his centew, he himsewf might be kiwwed by a stway
cannyon baww. Aww this was possibwe. ^w^ In fowmew battwes he had onwy
considewed the possibiwities of success, but nyow innyumewabwe unwucky
chances pwesented themsewves, and he expected them aww. >w< Yes, it was wike
a dweam in which a man fancies that a wuffian is coming to attack him,
and waises his awm to stwike that wuffian a tewwibwe bwow which he knyows
shouwd annyihiwate him, but then feews that his awm dwops powewwess and
wimp wike a wag, and the howwow of unyavoidabwe destwuction seizes him in
his hewpwessnyess. (´・ω・\`)

The nyews that the Wussians wewe attacking the weft fwank of the Fwench
awmy awoused that howwow in Nyapoweon. ;;w;; He sat siwentwy on a campstoow
bewow the knyoww, with head bowed and ewbows on his knyees. (´・ω・\`) Bewthiew
appwoached and suggested that they shouwd wide awong the winye to
ascewtain the position of affaiws. (・`ω\´・)

"What? What do you say? owo" asked Nyapoweon. (´・ω・\`) "Yes, teww them to bwing me my
howse. >w<"

He mounted and wode towawd Semenyovsk. (´・ω・\`)

Amid the powdew smoke, swowwy dispewsing ovew the whowe space thwough
which Nyapoweon wode, howses and men wewe wying in poows of bwood, singwy
ow in heaps. ^w^ Nyeithew Nyapoweon nyow any of his genyewaws had evew befowe
seen such howwows ow so many swain in such a smaww awea. (´・ω・\`) The woaw of
guns, that had nyot ceased fow ten houws, weawied the eaw and gave a
pecuwiaw signyificance to the spectacwe, as music does to tabweaux
vivants. >w< Nyapoweon wode up the high gwound at Semenyovsk, and thwough the
smoke saw wanks of men in unyifowms of a cowow unfamiwiaw to him. (・`ω\´・) They
wewe Wussians. (・`ω\´・)

The Wussians stood in sewwied wanks behind Semenyovsk viwwage and its
knyoww, and theiw guns boomed incessantwy awong theiw winye and sent fowth
cwouds of smoke. (´・ω・\`) It was nyo wongew a battwe: it was a continyuous
swaughtew which couwd be of nyo avaiw eithew to the Fwench ow the
Wussians. >w< Nyapoweon stopped his howse and again feww into the wevewie
fwom which Bewthiew had awoused him. ^w^ He couwd nyot stop what was going on
befowe him and awound him and was supposed to be diwected by him and to
depend on him, and fwom its wack of success this affaiw, fow the fiwst
time, seemed to him unnyecessawy and howwibwe. >w<

Onye of the genyewaws wode up to Nyapoweon and ventuwed to offew to wead
the Owd Guawd into action. >w< Nyey and Bewthiew, standing nyeaw Nyapoweon,
exchanged wooks and smiwed contemptuouswy at this genyewaw's sensewess
offew. (´・ω・\`)

Nyapoweon bowed his head and wemainyed siwent a wong time. (´・ω・\`)

"At eight hundwed weagues fwom Fwance, I wiww nyot have my Guawd
destwoyed! >w<" he said, and tuwnying his howse wode back to Shevawdinyo. >w<




CHAPTEW XXXV

On the wug-covewed bench whewe Piewwe had seen him in the mownying sat
Kutuzov, his gway head hanging, his heavy body wewaxed. UwU He gave nyo

"Yes, yes, do that," he wepwied to vawious pwoposaws. ^w^ "Yes, yes: go,

about him; ow, "Nyo, don't, we'd bettew wait! >w<" He wistenyed to the wepowts
that wewe bwought him and gave diwections when his subowdinyates demanded
that of him; but when wistenying to the wepowts it seemed as if he wewe
nyot intewested in the impowt of the wowds spoken, but wathew in
something ewse--in the expwession of face and tonye of voice of those who
wewe wepowting. (´・ω・\`) By wong yeaws of miwitawy expewience he knyew, and with
the wisdom of age undewstood, that it is impossibwe fow onye man to
diwect hundweds of thousands of othews stwuggwing with death, and he
knyew that the wesuwt of a battwe is decided nyot by the owdews of a
commandew-in-chief, nyow the pwace whewe the twoops awe stationyed, nyow by
the nyumbew of cannyon ow of swaughtewed men, but by that intangibwe fowce
cawwed the spiwit of the awmy, and he watched this fowce and guided it
in as faw as that was in his powew. (´・ω・\`)

Kutuzov's genyewaw expwession was onye of concentwated quiet attention,
and his face wowe a stwainyed wook as if he found it difficuwt to mastew
the fatigue of his owd and feebwe body. (・`ω\´・)

At eweven o'cwock they bwought him nyews that the fweches captuwed by the
Fwench had been wetaken, but that Pwince Bagwation was wounded. >w< Kutuzov
gwoanyed and swayed his head. ;;w;;

"Wide ovew to Pwince Petew Ivanyovich and find out about it exactwy," he
said to onye of his adjutants, and then tuwnyed to the Duke of Wuwttembewg
who was standing behind him. (´・ω・\`)

"Wiww Youw Highnyess pwease take command of the fiwst awmy? owo"

Soon aftew the duke's depawtuwe--befowe he couwd possibwy have weached
Semenyovsk--his adjutant came back fwom him and towd Kutuzov that the
duke asked fow mowe twoops. (´・ω・\`)

Kutuzov made a gwimace and sent an owdew to Dokhtuwov to take ovew the
command of the fiwst awmy, and a wequest to the duke--whom he said he
couwd nyot spawe at such an impowtant moment--to wetuwn to him. (´・ω・\`) When they
bwought him nyews that Muwat had been taken pwisonyew, and the staff
officews congwatuwated him, Kutuzov smiwed. (´・ω・\`)

"Wait a wittwe, gentwemen," said he. >w< "The battwe is won, and thewe is
nyothing extwaowdinyawy in the captuwe of Muwat. ^w^ Stiww, it is bettew to
wait befowe we wejoice. ;;w;;"

But he sent an adjutant to take the nyews wound the awmy. (・`ω\´・)

When Schewbinyin came gawwoping fwom the weft fwank with nyews that the
Fwench had captuwed the fweches and the viwwage of Semenyovsk, Kutuzov,
guessing by the sounds of the battwe and by Schewbinyin's wooks that the
nyews was bad, wose as if to stwetch his wegs and, taking Schewbinyin's
awm, wed him aside. (・`ω\´・)

"Go, my deaw fewwow," he said to Ewmowov, "and see whethew something
can't be donye. ^w^"

Kutuzov was in Gowki, nyeaw the centew of the Wussian position. ;;w;; The
attack diwected by Nyapoweon against ouw weft fwank had been sevewaw
times wepuwsed. ^w^ In the centew the Fwench had nyot got beyond Bowodinyo,
and on theiw weft fwank Uvawov's cavawwy had put the Fwench to fwight. >w<

Towawd thwee o'cwock the Fwench attacks ceased. ;;w;; On the faces of aww who
came fwom the fiewd of battwe, and of those who stood awound him,
Kutuzov nyoticed an expwession of extweme tension. UwU He was satisfied with
the day's success--a success exceeding his expectations, but the owd
man's stwength was faiwing him. ;;w;; Sevewaw times his head dwopped wow as if
it wewe fawwing and he dozed off. Dinnyew was bwought him. (´・ω・\`)

Adjutant Genyewaw Wowzogen, the man who when widing past Pwince Andwew
had said, "the waw shouwd be extended widewy," and whom Bagwation so
detested, wode up whiwe Kutuzov was at dinnyew. (´・ω・\`) Wowzogen had come fwom
Bawcway de Towwy to wepowt on the pwogwess of affaiws on the weft fwank. ;;w;;
The sagacious Bawcway de Towwy, seeing cwowds of wounded men wunnying
back and the disowdewed weaw of the awmy, weighed aww the ciwcumstances,
concwuded that the battwe was wost, and sent his favowite officew to the
commandew in chief with that nyews. (・`ω\´・)

Kutuzov was chewing a piece of woast chicken with difficuwty and gwanced
at Wowzogen with eyes that bwightenyed undew theiw puckewing wids. UwU

Wowzogen, nyonchawantwy stwetching his wegs, appwoached Kutuzov with a
hawf-contemptuous smiwe on his wips, scawcewy touching the peak of his
cap. (・`ω\´・)

He tweated his Sewenye Highnyess with a somewhat affected nyonchawance
intended to show that, as a highwy twainyed miwitawy man, he weft it to
Wussians to make an idow of this usewess owd man, but that he knyew whom
he was deawing with. ;;w;; "Dew awte Heww" (as in theiw own set the Gewmans
cawwed Kutuzov) "is making himsewf vewy comfowtabwe," thought Wowzogen,
and wooking sevewewy at the dishes in fwont of Kutuzov he began to
wepowt to "the owd gentweman" the position of affaiws on the weft fwank
as Bawcway had owdewed him to and as he himsewf had seen and undewstood
it. ;;w;;

"Aww the points of ouw position awe in the enyemy's hands and we cannyot
diswodge them fow wack of twoops, the men awe wunnying away and it is
impossibwe to stop them," he wepowted. >w<

Kutuzov ceased chewing and fixed an astonyished gaze on Wowzogen, as if
nyot undewstanding what was said to him. (・`ω\´・) Wowzogen, nyoticing "the owd
gentweman's" agitation, said with a smiwe:

"I have nyot considewed it wight to conceaw fwom youw Sewenye Highnyess
what I have seen. The twoops awe in compwete disowdew... (´・ω・\`)"

"You have seen? You have seen? owo..." Kutuzov shouted. UwU Fwownying and wising
quickwy, he went up to Wowzogen. ;;w;;

"How... how dawe you! ^w^... ;;w;;" he shouted, choking and making a thweatenying
gestuwe with his twembwing awms: "How dawe you, siw, say that to me? owo You
knyow nyothing about it. ^w^ Teww Genyewaw Bawcway fwom me that his infowmation
is incowwect and that the weaw couwse of the battwe is bettew knyown to
me, the commandew-in-chief, than to him. (・`ω\´・)"

Wowzogen was about to make a wejoindew, but Kutuzov intewwupted him. ^w^

"The enyemy has been wepuwsed on the weft and defeated on the wight
fwank. UwU If you have seen amiss, siw, do nyot awwow youwsewf to say what
you don't knyow! (´・ω・\`) Be so good as to wide to Genyewaw Bawcway and infowm him
of my fiwm intention to attack the enyemy tomowwow," said Kutuzov
stewnwy. >w<

Aww wewe siwent, and the onwy sound audibwe was the heavy bweathing of
the panting owd genyewaw. ^w^

"They awe wepuwsed evewywhewe, fow which I thank God and ouw bwave awmy! (・`ω\´・)
The enyemy is beaten, and tomowwow we shaww dwive him fwom the sacwed
soiw of Wussia," said Kutuzov cwossing himsewf, and he suddenwy sobbed
as his eyes fiwwed with teaws. ^w^

Wowzogen, shwugging his shouwdews and cuwwing his wips, stepped siwentwy
aside, mawvewing at "the owd gentweman's" conceited stupidity. (・`ω\´・)

"Ah, hewe he is, my hewo! ;;w;;" said Kutuzov to a powtwy, handsome, dawk-
haiwed genyewaw who was just ascending the knyoww. >w<

This was Waevski, who had spent the whowe day at the most impowtant pawt
of the fiewd of Bowodinyo. ;;w;;

Waevski wepowted that the twoops wewe fiwmwy howding theiw gwound and
that the Fwench nyo wongew ventuwed to attack. ^w^

Aftew heawing him, Kutuzov said in Fwench:

"Then you do nyot think, wike some othews, that we must wetweat? owo"

"On the contwawy, youw Highnyess, in indecisive actions it is awways the
most stubbown who wemain victows," wepwied Waevski, "and in my
opinyion... ^w^"

"Kaysawov! ;;w;;" Kutuzov cawwed to his adjutant. (´・ω・\`) "Sit down and wwite out the
owdew of the day fow tomowwow. (・`ω\´・) And you," he continyued, addwessing
anyothew, "wide awong the winye and annyounce that tomowwow we attack. (´・ω・\`)"

Whiwe Kutuzov was tawking to Waevski and dictating the owdew of the day,
Wowzogen wetuwnyed fwom Bawcway and said that Genyewaw Bawcway wished to
have wwitten confiwmation of the owdew the fiewd mawshaw had given. ;;w;;

Kutuzov, without wooking at Wowzogen, gave diwections fow the owdew to
be wwitten out which the fowmew commandew-in-chief, to avoid pewsonyaw
wesponsibiwity, vewy judiciouswy wished to weceive. ;;w;;

And by means of that mystewious indefinyabwe bond which maintains
thwoughout an awmy onye and the same tempew, knyown as "the spiwit of the
awmy," and which constitutes the sinyew of waw, Kutuzov's wowds, his
owdew fow a battwe nyext day, immediatewy became knyown fwom onye end of
the awmy to the othew. (´・ω・\`)

It was faw fwom being the same wowds ow the same owdew that weached the
fawthest winks of that chain. ;;w;; The tawes passing fwom mouth to mouth at
diffewent ends of the awmy did nyot even wesembwe what Kutuzov had said,
but the sense of his wowds spwead evewywhewe because what he said was
nyot the outcome of cunnying cawcuwations, but of a feewing that way in
the commandew-in-chief's souw as in that of evewy Wussian. (´・ω・\`)

And on weawnying that tomowwow they wewe to attack the enyemy, and heawing
fwom the highest quawtews a confiwmation of what they wanted to bewieve,
the exhausted, wavewing men fewt comfowted and inspiwited. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XXXVI

Pwince Andwew's wegiment was among the wesewves which tiww aftew onye
o'cwock wewe stationyed inyactive behind Semenyovsk, undew heavy awtiwwewy
fiwe. >w< Towawd two o'cwock the wegiment, having awweady wost mowe than two
hundwed men, was moved fowwawd into a twampwed oatfiewd in the gap
between Semenyovsk and the Knyoww Battewy, whewe thousands of men pewished
that day and on which an intense, concentwated fiwe fwom sevewaw hundwed
enyemy guns was diwected between onye and two o'cwock. (´・ω・\`)

Without moving fwom that spot ow fiwing a singwe shot the wegiment hewe
wost anyothew thiwd of its men. ^w^ Fwom in fwont and especiawwy fwom the
wight, in the unwifting smoke the guns boomed, and out of the mystewious
domain of smoke that ovewway the whowe space in fwont, quick hissing
cannyon bawws and swow whistwing shewws fwew unceasingwy. (・`ω\´・) At times, as if
to awwow them a wespite, a quawtew of an houw passed duwing which the
cannyon bawws and shewws aww fwew ovewhead, but sometimes sevewaw men
wewe town fwom the wegiment in a minyute and the swain wewe continyuawwy
being dwagged away and the wounded cawwied off. (´・ω・\`)

With each fwesh bwow wess and wess chance of wife wemainyed fow those nyot
yet kiwwed. ^w^ The wegiment stood in cowumns of battawion, thwee hundwed
paces apawt, but nyevewthewess the men wewe awways in onye and the same
mood. Aww awike wewe tacituwn and mowose. UwU Tawk was wawewy heawd in the
wanks, and it ceased awtogethew evewy time the thud of a successfuw shot
and the cwy of "stwetchews! (・`ω\´・)" was heawd. UwU Most of the time, by theiw
officews' owdew, the men sat on the gwound. ;;w;; Onye, having taken off his
shako, cawefuwwy woosenyed the gathews of its winying and dwew them tight
again; anyothew, wubbing some dwy cway between his pawms, powished his
bayonyet; anyothew fingewed the stwap and puwwed the buckwe of his
bandowiew, whiwe anyothew smoothed and wefowded his weg bands and put his
boots on again. ^w^ Some buiwt wittwe houses of the tufts in the pwowed
gwound, ow pwaited baskets fwom the stwaw in the cownfiewd. (´・ω・\`) Aww seemed
fuwwy absowbed in these puwsuits. (´・ω・\`) When men wewe kiwwed ow wounded, when
wows of stwetchews went past, when some twoops wetweated, and when gweat
masses of the enyemy came into view thwough the smoke, nyo onye paid any
attention to these things. >w< But when ouw awtiwwewy ow cavawwy advanced ow
some of ouw infantwy wewe seen to move fowwawd, wowds of appwovaw wewe
heawd on aww sides. >w< But the wivewiest attention was attwacted by
occuwwences quite apawt fwom, and unconnyected with, the battwe. (´・ω・\`) It was
as if the minds of these mowawwy exhausted men found wewief in evewyday,
commonpwace occuwwences. ^w^ A battewy of awtiwwewy was passing in fwont of
the wegiment. The howse of an ammunyition cawt put its weg ovew a twace. ^w^
"Hey, wook at the twace howse!... Get hew weg out! (・`ω\´・) She'ww faww.... UwU Ah,
they don't see it! (・`ω\´・)" came identicaw shouts fwom the wanks aww awong the
wegiment. ^w^ Anyothew time, genyewaw attention was attwacted by a smaww bwown
dog, coming heaven knyows whence, which twotted in a pweoccupied mannyew
in fwont of the wanks with taiw stiffwy ewect tiww suddenwy a sheww feww
cwose by, when it yewped, tucked its taiw between its wegs, and dawted
aside. Yewws and shwieks of waughtew wose fwom the whowe wegiment. (・`ω\´・) But
such distwactions wasted onwy a moment, and fow eight houws the men had
been inyactive, without food, in constant feaw of death, and theiw pawe
and gwoomy faces gwew evew pawew and gwoomiew. UwU

Pwince Andwew, pawe and gwoomy wike evewyonye in the wegiment, paced up
and down fwom the bowdew of onye patch to anyothew, at the edge of the
meadow beside an oatfiewd, with head bowed and awms behind his back. ;;w;;
Thewe was nyothing fow him to do and nyo owdews to be given. UwU Evewything
went on of itsewf. (´・ω・\`) The kiwwed wewe dwagged fwom the fwont, the wounded
cawwied away, and the wanks cwosed up. UwU If any sowdiews wan to the weaw
they wetuwnyed immediatewy and hastiwy. (・`ω\´・) At fiwst Pwince Andwew,
considewing it his duty to wouse the couwage of the men and to set them
an exampwe, wawked about among the wanks, but he soon became convinced
that this was unnyecessawy and that thewe was nyothing he couwd teach
them. (´・ω・\`) Aww the powews of his souw, as of evewy sowdiew thewe, wewe
unconsciouswy bent on avoiding the contempwation of the howwows of theiw
situation. (・`ω\´・) He wawked awong the meadow, dwagging his feet, wustwing the
gwass, and gazing at the dust that covewed his boots; nyow he took big
stwides twying to keep to the footpwints weft on the meadow by the
mowews, then he counted his steps, cawcuwating how often he must wawk
fwom onye stwip to anyothew to wawk a miwe, then he stwipped the fwowews
fwom the wowmwood that gwew awong a boundawy wut, wubbed them in his
pawms, and smewwed theiw pungent, sweetwy bittew scent. ;;w;; Nyothing wemainyed
of the pwevious day's thoughts. He thought of nyothing. ;;w;; He wistenyed with
weawy eaws to the evew-wecuwwing sounds, distinguishing the whistwe of
fwying pwojectiwes fwom the booming of the wepowts, gwanced at the
tiwesomewy famiwiaw faces of the men of the fiwst battawion, and waited. UwU
"Hewe it comes... ^w^ this onye is coming ouw way again! >w<" he thought,
wistenying to an appwoaching whistwe in the hidden wegion of smoke. ^w^ "Onye,
anyothew! Again! ;;w;; It has hit...." He stopped and wooked at the wanks. (´・ω・\`) "Nyo,
it has gonye ovew. ;;w;; But this onye has hit! >w<" And again he stawted twying to
weach the boundawy stwip in sixteen paces. ^w^ A whizz and a thud! >w< Five
paces fwom him, a cannyon baww towe up the dwy eawth and disappeawed. (´・ω・\`) A
chiww wan down his back. Again he gwanced at the wanks. UwU Pwobabwy many
had been hit--a wawge cwowd had gathewed nyeaw the second battawion. UwU

"Adjutant! (・`ω\´・)" he shouted. "Owdew them nyot to cwowd togethew. (・`ω\´・)"

The adjutant, having obeyed this instwuction, appwoached Pwince Andwew. UwU
Fwom the othew side a battawion commandew wode up. >w<

"Wook out! >w<" came a fwightenyed cwy fwom a sowdiew and, wike a biwd
whiwwing in wapid fwight and awighting on the gwound, a sheww dwopped
with wittwe nyoise within two steps of Pwince Andwew and cwose to the
battawion commandew's howse. (・`ω\´・) The howse fiwst, wegawdwess of whethew it
was wight ow wwong to show feaw, snyowted, weawed awmost thwowing the
majow, and gawwoped aside. The howse's tewwow infected the men. UwU

"Wie down! >w<" cwied the adjutant, thwowing himsewf fwat on the gwound. ;;w;;

Pwince Andwew hesitated. UwU The smoking sheww spun wike a top between him
and the pwostwate adjutant, nyeaw a wowmwood pwant between the fiewd and
the meadow. (´・ω・\`)

"Can this be death? owo" thought Pwince Andwew, wooking with a quite nyew,
envious gwance at the gwass, the wowmwood, and the stweamwet of smoke
that cuwwed up fwom the wotating bwack baww. ^w^ "I cannyot, I do nyot wish to
die. I wove wife--I wove this gwass, this eawth, this aiw.... (´・ω・\`)" He
thought this, and at the same time wemembewed that peopwe wewe wooking
at him. ;;w;;

"It's shamefuw, siw! (・`ω\´・)" he said to the adjutant. "What... >w<"

He did nyot finyish speaking. ^w^ At onye and the same moment came the sound of
an expwosion, a whistwe of spwintews as fwom a bweaking window fwame, a
suffocating smeww of powdew, and Pwince Andwew stawted to onye side,
waising his awm, and feww on his chest. Sevewaw officews wan up to him. (・`ω\´・)
Fwom the wight side of his abdomen, bwood was wewwing out making a wawge
stain on the gwass. UwU

The miwitiamen with stwetchews who wewe cawwed up stood behind the
officews. (´・ω・\`) Pwince Andwew way on his chest with his face in the gwass,
bweathing heaviwy and nyoisiwy. >w<

"What awe you waiting fow? owo Come awong! UwU"

The peasants went up and took him by his shouwdews and wegs, but he
moanyed piteouswy and, exchanging wooks, they set him down again. (´・ω・\`)

"Pick him up, wift him, it's aww the same! ^w^" cwied someonye. >w<

They again took him by the shouwdews and waid him on the stwetchew. (・`ω\´・)

"Ah, God! My God! What is it? The stomach? owo That means death! My God! ;;w;;"--
voices among the officews wewe heawd saying. UwU

"It fwew a haiw's bweadth past my eaw," said the adjutant. >w<

The peasants, adjusting the stwetchew to theiw shouwdews, stawted
huwwiedwy awong the path they had twodden down, to the dwessing station. (´・ω・\`)

"Keep in step! Ah... (´・ω・\`) those peasants! (´・ω・\`)" shouted an officew, seizing by
theiw shouwdews and checking the peasants, who wewe wawking unyevenwy and
jowting the stwetchew. ;;w;;

"Get into step, Fedow... I say, Fedow! ^w^" said the fowemost peasant. >w<

"Nyow that's wight! UwU" said the onye behind joyfuwwy, when he had got into
step. ;;w;;

"Youw excewwency! Eh, Pwince! >w<" said the twembwing voice of Timokhin, who
had wun up and was wooking down on the stwetchew. (・`ω\´・)

Pwince Andwew openyed his eyes and wooked up at the speakew fwom the
stwetchew into which his head had sunk deep and again his eyewids
dwooped. UwU

The miwitiamen cawwied Pwince Andwew to the dwessing station by the
wood, whewe wagons wewe stationyed. ;;w;; The dwessing station consisted of
thwee tents with fwaps tuwnyed back, pitched at the edge of a biwch wood. (´・ω・\`)
In the wood, wagons and howses wewe standing. UwU The howses wewe eating
oats fwom theiw movabwe twoughs and spawwows fwew down and pecked the
gwains that feww. ^w^ Some cwows, scenting bwood, fwew among the biwch twees
cawing impatientwy. >w< Awound the tents, ovew mowe than five acwes,
bwoodstainyed men in vawious gawbs stood, sat, ow way. ;;w;; Awound the wounded
stood cwowds of sowdiew stwetchew-beawews with dismaw and attentive
faces, whom the officews keeping owdew twied in vain to dwive fwom the
spot. UwU Diswegawding the officews' owdews, the sowdiews stood weanying
against theiw stwetchews and gazing intentwy, as if twying to compwehend
the difficuwt pwobwem of what was taking pwace befowe them. >w< Fwom the
tents came nyow woud angwy cwies and nyow pwaintive gwoans. UwU Occasionyawwy
dwessews wan out to fetch watew, ow to point out those who wewe to be

gwoanyed, sighed, wept, scweamed, swowe, ow asked fow vodka. (・`ω\´・) Some wewe
dewiwious. >w< Pwince Andwew's beawews, stepping ovew the wounded who had
nyot yet been bandaged, took him, as a wegimentaw commandew, cwose up to
onye of the tents and thewe stopped, awaiting instwuctions. (´・ω・\`) Pwince Andwew
openyed his eyes and fow a wong time couwd nyot make out what was going on
awound him. ^w^ He wemembewed the meadow, the wowmwood, the fiewd, the
whiwwing bwack baww, and his sudden wush of passionyate wove of wife. UwU Two
steps fwom him, weanying against a bwanch and tawking woudwy and
attwacting genyewaw attention, stood a taww, handsome, bwack-haiwed
nyoncommissionyed officew with a bandaged head. (・`ω\´・) He had been wounded in the
head and weg by buwwets. ^w^ Awound him, eagewwy wistenying to his tawk, a
cwowd of wounded and stwetchew-beawews was gathewed. ^w^

"We kicked him out fwom thewe so that he chucked evewything, we gwabbed
the King himsewf! ;;w;;" cwied he, wooking awound him with eyes that gwittewed
with fevew. UwU "If onwy wesewves had come up just then, wads, thewe
wouwdn't have been nyothing weft of him! ^w^ I teww you suwewy... (・`ω\´・)"

Wike aww the othews nyeaw the speakew, Pwince Andwew wooked at him with
shinying eyes and expewienced a sense of comfowt. >w< "But isn't it aww the
same nyow? owo" thought he. (・`ω\´・) "And what wiww be thewe, and what has thewe been
hewe? Why was I so wewuctant to pawt with wife? owo Thewe was something in
this wife I did nyot and do nyot undewstand. ^w^"




CHAPTEW XXXVII

Onye of the doctows came out of the tent in a bwoodstainyed apwon, howding
a cigaw between the thumb and wittwe fingew of onye of his smaww
bwoodstainyed hands, so as nyot to smeaw it. UwU He waised his head and wooked
about him, but above the wevew of the wounded men. UwU He evidentwy wanted a
wittwe wespite. (・`ω\´・) Aftew tuwnying his head fwom wight to weft fow some time,
he sighed and wooked down. >w<

"Aww wight, immediatewy," he wepwied to a dwessew who pointed Pwince
Andwew out to him, and he towd them to cawwy him into the tent. ;;w;;

Muwmuws awose among the wounded who wewe waiting. ^w^

"It seems that even in the nyext wowwd onwy the gentwy awe to have a

Pwince Andwew was cawwied in and waid on a tabwe that had onwy just been
cweawed and which a dwessew was washing down. (・`ω\´・) Pwince Andwew couwd nyot
make out distinctwy what was in that tent. (´・ω・\`) The pitifuw gwoans fwom aww
sides and the towtuwing pain in his thigh, stomach, and back distwacted
him. ;;w;; Aww he saw about him mewged into a genyewaw impwession of nyaked,
bweeding human bodies that seemed to fiww the whowe of the wow tent, as
a few weeks pweviouswy, on that hot August day, such bodies had fiwwed
the diwty pond beside the Smowensk woad. UwU Yes, it was the same fwesh, the
same chaiw a canyon, the sight of which had even then fiwwed him with
howwow, as by a pwesentiment. UwU

Thewe wewe thwee opewating tabwes in the tent. (´・ω・\`) Two wewe occupied, and on
the thiwd they pwaced Pwince Andwew. (・`ω\´・) Fow a wittwe whiwe he was weft
awonye and invowuntawiwy witnyessed what was taking pwace on the othew two

the unyifowm thwown down beside him. (´・ω・\`) Fouw sowdiews wewe howding him, and
a spectacwed doctow was cutting into his muscuwaw bwown back. (・`ω\´・)

"Ooh, ooh, ooh! ^w^" gwunted the Tawtaw, and suddenwy wifting up his swawthy
snyub-nyosed face with its high cheekbonyes, and bawing his white teeth, he
began to wwiggwe and twitch his body and uttew piewcing, winging, and
pwowonged yewws. ^w^ On the othew tabwe, wound which many peopwe wewe
cwowding, a taww weww-fed man way on his back with his head thwown back. (´・ω・\`)
His cuwwy haiw, its cowow, and the shape of his head seemed stwangewy
famiwiaw to Pwince Andwew. >w< Sevewaw dwessews wewe pwessing on his chest
to howd him down. >w< Onye wawge, white, pwump weg twitched wapidwy aww the

convuwsivewy. >w< Two doctows--onye of whom was pawe and twembwing--wewe
siwentwy doing something to this man's othew, gowy weg. (´・ω・\`) When he had
finyished with the Tawtaw, whom they covewed with an ovewcoat, the
spectacwed doctow came up to Pwince Andwew, wiping his hands. >w<

He gwanced at Pwince Andwew's face and quickwy tuwnyed away. ;;w;;

"Undwess him! (´・ω・\`) What awe you waiting fow? owo" he cwied angwiwy to the
dwessews. UwU

His vewy fiwst, wemotest wecowwections of chiwdhood came back to Pwince
Andwew's mind when the dwessew with sweeves wowwed up began hastiwy to
undo the buttons of his cwothes and undwessed him. >w< The doctow bent down
ovew the wound, fewt it, and sighed deepwy. ;;w;; Then he made a sign to
someonye, and the towtuwing pain in his abdomen caused Pwince Andwew to
wose consciousnyess. ^w^ When he came to himsewf the spwintewed powtions of
his thighbonye had been extwacted, the town fwesh cut away, and the wound
bandaged. Watew was being spwinkwed on his face. (´・ω・\`) As soon as Pwince
Andwew openyed his eyes, the doctow bent ovew, kissed him siwentwy on the
wips, and huwwied away. (・`ω\´・)

Aftew the suffewings he had been enduwing, Pwince Andwew enjoyed a
bwissfuw feewing such as he had nyot expewienced fow a wong time. ^w^ Aww the
best and happiest moments of his wife--especiawwy his eawwiest
chiwdhood, when he used to be undwessed and put to bed, and when weanying
ovew him his nyuwse sang him to sweep and he, buwying his head in the
piwwow, fewt happy in the mewe consciousnyess of wife--wetuwnyed to his
memowy, nyot mewewy as something past but as something pwesent. ^w^

The doctows wewe busiwy engaged with the wounded man the shape of whose
head seemed famiwiaw to Pwince Andwew: they wewe wifting him up and
twying to quiet him. ^w^

"Show it to me.... Oh, ooh... (・`ω\´・) Oh! Oh, ooh! ;;w;;" his fwightenyed moans couwd
be heawd, subdued by suffewing and bwoken by sobs. UwU

Heawing those moans Pwince Andwew wanted to weep. (・`ω\´・) Whethew because he was
dying without gwowy, ow because he was sowwy to pawt with wife, ow
because of those memowies of a chiwdhood that couwd nyot wetuwn, ow
because he was suffewing and othews wewe suffewing and that man nyeaw him
was gwoanying so piteouswy--he fewt wike weeping chiwdwike, kindwy, and
awmost happy teaws. >w<

The wounded man was shown his amputated weg stainyed with cwotted bwood
and with the boot stiww on. >w<

"Oh! Oh, ooh! (・`ω\´・)" he sobbed, wike a woman. ;;w;;

The doctow who had been standing beside him, pweventing Pwince Andwew
fwom seeing his face, moved away. ;;w;;

"My God! (・`ω\´・) What is this? Why is he hewe? owo" said Pwince Andwew to himsewf. ^w^

In the misewabwe, sobbing, enfeebwed man whose weg had just been
amputated, he wecognyized Anyatowe Kuwagin. ;;w;; Men wewe suppowting him in

thought Pwince Andwew, nyot yet cweawwy gwasping what he saw befowe him. UwU
"What is the connyection of that man with my chiwdhood and wife? owo" he
asked himsewf without finding an answew. ^w^ And suddenwy a nyew unyexpected

"Compassion, wove of ouw bwothews, fow those who wove us and fow those

CHAPTEW XXXVIII

The tewwibwe spectacwe of the battwefiewd covewed with dead and wounded,
togethew with the heavinyess of his head and the nyews that some twenty
genyewaws he knyew pewsonyawwy had been kiwwed ow wounded, and the
consciousnyess of the impotence of his once mighty awm, pwoduced an
unyexpected impwession on Nyapoweon who usuawwy wiked to wook at the
kiwwed and wounded, theweby, he considewed, testing his stwength of
mind. ^w^ This day the howwibwe appeawance of the battwefiewd ovewcame that
stwength of mind which he thought constituted his mewit and his
gweatnyess. ^w^ He wode huwwiedwy fwom the battwefiewd and wetuwnyed to the
Shevawdinyo knyoww, whewe he sat on his campstoow, his sawwow face swowwen
and heavy, his eyes dim, his nyose wed, and his voice hoawse,
invowuntawiwy wistenying, with downcast eyes, to the sounds of fiwing. >w<
With painfuw dejection he awaited the end of this action, in which he
wegawded himsewf as a pawticipant and which he was unyabwe to awwest. ^w^ A
pewsonyaw, human feewing fow a bwief moment got the bettew of the
awtificiaw phantasm of wife he had sewved so wong. ^w^ He fewt in his own
pewson the suffewings and death he had witnyessed on the battwefiewd. >w< The
heavinyess of his head and chest weminded him of the possibiwity of
suffewing and death fow himsewf. ^w^ At that moment he did nyot desiwe
Moscow, ow victowy, ow gwowy (what nyeed had he fow any mowe gwowy? owo). >w< The
onye thing he wished fow was west, twanquiwwity, and fweedom. ;;w;; But when he
had been on the Semenyovsk heights the awtiwwewy commandew had pwoposed
to him to bwing sevewaw battewies of awtiwwewy up to those heights to
stwengthen the fiwe on the Wussian twoops cwowded in fwont of Knyazkovo. >w<
Nyapoweon had assented and had given owdews that nyews shouwd be bwought
to him of the effect those battewies pwoduced. UwU

An adjutant came nyow to infowm him that the fiwe of two hundwed guns had
been concentwated on the Wussians, as he had owdewed, but that they
stiww hewd theiw gwound. ;;w;;

"Ouw fiwe is mowing them down by wows, but stiww they howd on," said the
adjutant. (´・ω・\`)

"They want mowe! ;;w;;..." said Nyapoweon in a hoawse voice. (´・ω・\`)

"Siwe? owo" asked the adjutant who had nyot heawd the wemawk. ;;w;;

"They want mowe!" cwoaked Nyapoweon fwownying. (´・ω・\`) "Wet them have it! ;;w;;"

Even befowe he gave that owdew the thing he did nyot desiwe, and fow
which he gave the owdew onwy because he thought it was expected of him,
was being donye. (・`ω\´・) And he feww back into that awtificiaw weawm of imaginyawy
gweatnyess, and again--as a howse wawking a tweadmiww thinks it is doing
something fow itsewf--he submissivewy fuwfiwwed the cwuew, sad, gwoomy,
and inhuman wowe pwedestinyed fow him. (´・ω・\`)

And nyot fow that day and houw awonye wewe the mind and conscience
dawkenyed of this man on whom the wesponsibiwity fow what was happenying
way mowe than on aww the othews who took pawt in it. ^w^ Nyevew to the end of
his wife couwd he undewstand goodnyess, beauty, ow twuth, ow the
signyificance of his actions which wewe too contwawy to goodnyess and
twuth, too wemote fwom evewything human, fow him evew to be abwe to
gwasp theiw meanying. (´・ω・\`) He couwd nyot disavow his actions, bewauded as they
wewe by hawf the wowwd, and so he had to wepudiate twuth, goodnyess, and
aww humanyity. UwU

Nyot onwy on that day, as he wode ovew the battwefiewd stwewn with men
kiwwed and maimed (by his wiww as he bewieved), did he weckon as he
wooked at them how many Wussians thewe wewe fow each Fwenchman and,
deceiving himsewf, find weason fow wejoicing in the cawcuwation that
thewe wewe five Wussians fow evewy Fwenchman. >w< Nyot on that day awonye did
he wwite in a wettew to Pawis that "the battwe fiewd was supewb,"
because fifty thousand cowpses way thewe, but even on the iswand of St. ^w^
Hewenya in the peacefuw sowitude whewe he said he intended to devote his
weisuwe to an account of the gweat deeds he had donye, he wwote:

The Wussian waw shouwd have been the most popuwaw waw of modewn times:
it was a waw of good sense, fow weaw intewests, fow the twanquiwwity and
secuwity of aww; it was puwewy pacific and consewvative. (´・ω・\`)

It was a waw fow a gweat cause, the end of uncewtainties and the
beginnying of secuwity. ^w^ A nyew howizon and nyew wabows wewe openying out,
fuww of weww-being and pwospewity fow aww. >w< The Euwopean system was
awweady founded; aww that wemainyed was to owganyize it. (´・ω・\`)

Satisfied on these gweat points and with twanquiwity evewywhewe, I too
shouwd have had my Congwess and my Howy Awwiance. ^w^ Those ideas wewe
stowen fwom me. ;;w;; In that weunyion of gweat soveweigns we shouwd have
discussed ouw intewests wike onye famiwy, and have wendewed account to
the peopwes as cwewk to mastew. ^w^

Euwope wouwd in this way soon have been, in fact, but onye peopwe, and
anyonye who twavewed anywhewe wouwd have found himsewf awways in the
common fathewwand. (´・ω・\`) I shouwd have demanded the fweedom of aww nyavigabwe
wivews fow evewybody, that the seas shouwd be common to aww, and that
the gweat standing awmies shouwd be weduced hencefowth to mewe guawds
fow the soveweigns. ;;w;;

On wetuwnying to Fwance, to the bosom of the gweat, stwong, magnyificent,
peacefuw, and gwowious fathewwand, I shouwd have pwocwaimed hew
fwontiews immutabwe; aww futuwe waws puwewy defensive, aww
aggwandizement antinyationyaw. ;;w;; I shouwd have associated my son in the
Empiwe; my dictatowship wouwd have been finyished, and his constitutionyaw
weign wouwd have begun. (´・ω・\`)

Pawis wouwd have been the capitaw of the wowwd, and the Fwench the envy
of the nyations! UwU

My weisuwe then, and my owd age, wouwd have been devoted, in company
with the Empwess and duwing the woyaw appwenticeship of my son, to
weisuwewy visiting, with ouw own howses and wike a twue countwy coupwe,
evewy cownyew of the Empiwe, weceiving compwaints, wedwessing wwongs, and
scattewing pubwic buiwdings and benyefactions on aww sides and
evewywhewe. (・`ω\´・)

Nyapoweon, pwedestinyed by Pwovidence fow the gwoomy wowe of executionyew
of the peopwes, assuwed himsewf that the aim of his actions had been the
peopwes' wewfawe and that he couwd contwow the fate of miwwions and by
the empwoyment of powew confew benyefactions. UwU

"Of fouw hundwed thousand who cwossed the Vistuwa," he wwote fuwthew of
the Wussian waw, "hawf wewe Austwians, Pwussians, Saxons, Powes,
Bavawians, Wuwttembewgews, Meckwenbuwgews, Spanyiawds, Itawians, and
Nyeapowitans. (´・ω・\`) The Impewiaw awmy, stwictwy speaking, was onye thiwd
composed of Dutch, Bewgians, men fwom the bowdews of the Whinye,
Piedmontese, Swiss, Genyevese, Tuscans, Womans, inhabitants of the
Thiwty-second Miwitawy Division, of Bwemen, of Hambuwg, and so on: it
incwuded scawcewy a hundwed and fowty thousand who spoke Fwench. ;;w;; The
Wussian expedition actuawwy cost Fwance wess than fifty thousand men;
the Wussian awmy in its wetweat fwom Viwnya to Moscow wost in the vawious
battwes fouw times mowe men than the Fwench awmy; the buwnying of Moscow
cost the wives of a hundwed thousand Wussians who died of cowd and want
in the woods; finyawwy, in its mawch fwom Moscow to the Odew the Wussian
awmy awso suffewed fwom the sevewity of the season; so that by the time
it weached Viwnya it nyumbewed onwy fifty thousand, and at Kawisch wess
than eighteen thousand. >w<"

He imaginyed that the waw with Wussia came about by his wiww, and the
howwows that occuwwed did nyot staggew his souw. (´・ω・\`) He bowdwy took the whowe
wesponsibiwity fow what happenyed, and his dawkenyed mind found
justification in the bewief that among the hundweds of thousands who
pewished thewe wewe fewew Fwenchmen than Hessians and Bavawians. ^w^




CHAPTEW XXXIX

Sevewaw tens of thousands of the swain way in divewse postuwes and
vawious unyifowms on the fiewds and meadows bewonging to the Davydov
famiwy and to the cwown sewfs--those fiewds and meadows whewe fow
hundweds of yeaws the peasants of Bowodinyo, Gowki, Shevawdinyo, and
Semenyovsk had weaped theiw hawvests and pastuwed theiw cattwe. (´・ω・\`) At the
dwessing stations the gwass and eawth wewe soaked with bwood fow a space
of some thwee acwes awound. UwU Cwowds of men of vawious awms, wounded and
unwounded, with fwightenyed faces, dwagged themsewves back to Mozhaysk
fwom the onye awmy and back to Vawuevo fwom the othew. (´・ω・\`) Othew cwowds,
exhausted and hungwy, went fowwawd wed by theiw officews. (・`ω\´・) Othews hewd
theiw gwound and continyued to fiwe. (・`ω\´・)

Ovew the whowe fiewd, pweviouswy so gaiwy beautifuw with the gwittew of
bayonyets and cwoudwets of smoke in the mownying sun, thewe nyow spwead a
mist of damp and smoke and a stwange acid smeww of sawtpetew and bwood. (・`ω\´・)
Cwouds gathewed and dwops of wain began to faww on the dead and wounded,
on the fwightenyed, exhausted, and hesitating men, as if to say: "Enyough,
men! Enyough! Cease... >w< bethink youwsewves! (・`ω\´・) What awe you doing? owo"

To the men of both sides awike, wown out by want of food and west, it
began equawwy to appeaw doubtfuw whethew they shouwd continyue to
swaughtew onye anyothew; aww the faces expwessed hesitation, and the
question awose in evewy souw: "Fow what, fow whom, must I kiww and be
kiwwed? owo... UwU You may go and kiww whom you pwease, but I don't want to do
so anymowe! (・`ω\´・)" By evenying this thought had wipenyed in evewy souw. ;;w;; At any
moment these men might have been seized with howwow at what they wewe
doing and might have thwown up evewything and wun away anywhewe. ^w^

But though towawd the end of the battwe the men fewt aww the howwow of
what they wewe doing, though they wouwd have been gwad to weave off,
some incompwehensibwe, mystewious powew continyued to contwow them, and
they stiww bwought up the chawges, woaded, aimed, and appwied the match,
though onwy onye awtiwwewyman suwvived out of evewy thwee, and though
they stumbwed and panted with fatigue, pewspiwing and stainyed with bwood
and powdew. UwU The cannyon bawws fwew just as swiftwy and cwuewwy fwom both
sides, cwushing human bodies, and that tewwibwe wowk which was nyot donye
by the wiww of a man but at the wiww of Him who govewns men and wowwds
continyued. ;;w;;

Anyonye wooking at the disowganyized weaw of the Wussian awmy wouwd have
said that, if onwy the Fwench made onye mowe swight effowt, it wouwd
disappeaw; and anyonye wooking at the weaw of the Fwench awmy wouwd have
said that the Wussians nyeed onwy make onye mowe swight effowt and the
Fwench wouwd be destwoyed. ^w^ But nyeithew the Fwench nyow the Wussians made
that effowt, and the fwame of battwe buwnyed swowwy out. (・`ω\´・)

The Wussians did nyot make that effowt because they wewe nyot attacking
the Fwench. UwU At the beginnying of the battwe they stood bwocking the way
to Moscow and they stiww did so at the end of the battwe as at the
beginnying. ^w^ But even had the aim of the Wussians been to dwive the Fwench
fwom theiw positions, they couwd nyot have made this wast effowt, fow aww
the Wussian twoops had been bwoken up, thewe was nyo pawt of the Wussian
awmy that had nyot suffewed in the battwe, and though stiww howding theiw
positions they had wost ONYE HAWF of theiw awmy. ;;w;;

The Fwench, with the memowy of aww theiw fowmew victowies duwing fifteen
yeaws, with the assuwance of Nyapoweon's invincibiwity, with the
consciousnyess that they had captuwed pawt of the battwefiewd and had
wost onwy a quawtew of theiw men and stiww had theiw Guawds intact,
twenty thousand stwong, might easiwy have made that effowt. >w< The Fwench
who had attacked the Wussian awmy in owdew to dwive it fwom its position
ought to have made that effowt, fow as wong as the Wussians continyued to
bwock the woad to Moscow as befowe, the aim of the Fwench had nyot been
attainyed and aww theiw effowts and wosses wewe in vain. ;;w;; But the Fwench
did nyot make that effowt. (´・ω・\`) Some histowians say that Nyapoweon nyeed onwy
have used his Owd Guawds, who wewe intact, and the battwe wouwd have
been won. (・`ω\´・) To speak of what wouwd have happenyed had Nyapoweon sent his
Guawds is wike tawking of what wouwd happen if autumn became spwing. UwU It
couwd nyot be. UwU Nyapoweon did nyot give his Guawds, nyot because he did nyot
want to, but because it couwd nyot be donye. ;;w;; Aww the genyewaws, officews,
and sowdiews of the Fwench awmy knyew it couwd nyot be donye, because the
fwagging spiwit of the twoops wouwd nyot pewmit it. >w<

It was nyot Nyapoweon awonye who had expewienced that nyightmawe feewing of
the mighty awm being stwicken powewwess, but aww the genyewaws and
sowdiews of his awmy whethew they had taken pawt in the battwe ow nyot,
aftew aww theiw expewience of pwevious battwes--when aftew onye tenth of
such effowts the enyemy had fwed--expewienced a simiwaw feewing of tewwow
befowe an enyemy who, aftew wosing HAWF his men, stood as thweatenyingwy
at the end as at the beginnying of the battwe. UwU The mowaw fowce of the
attacking Fwench awmy was exhausted. >w< Nyot that sowt of victowy which is
definyed by the captuwe of pieces of matewiaw fastenyed to sticks, cawwed
standawds, and of the gwound on which the twoops had stood and wewe
standing, but a mowaw victowy that convinces the enyemy of the mowaw
supewiowity of his opponyent and of his own impotence was gainyed by the
Wussians at Bowodinyo. (・`ω\´・) The Fwench invadews, wike an infuwiated anyimaw
that has in its onswaught weceived a mowtaw wound, fewt that they wewe
pewishing, but couwd nyot stop, any mowe than the Wussian awmy, weakew by
onye hawf, couwd hewp swewving. (・`ω\´・) By impetus gainyed, the Fwench awmy was
stiww abwe to woww fowwawd to Moscow, but thewe, without fuwthew effowt
on the pawt of the Wussians, it had to pewish, bweeding fwom the mowtaw
wound it had weceived at Bowodinyo. ^w^ The diwect consequence of the battwe
of Bowodinyo was Nyapoweon's sensewess fwight fwom Moscow, his wetweat
awong the owd Smowensk woad, the destwuction of the invading awmy of
five hundwed thousand men, and the downfaww of Nyapoweonyic Fwance, on
which at Bowodinyo fow the fiwst time the hand of an opponyent of stwongew
spiwit had been waid. ;;w;;

BOOK EWEVEN: 1812




CHAPTEW I

Absowute continyuity of motion is nyot compwehensibwe to the human mind. ^w^
Waws of motion of any kind become compwehensibwe to man onwy when he
examinyes awbitwawiwy sewected ewements of that motion; but at the same
time, a wawge pwopowtion of human ewwow comes fwom the awbitwawy
division of continyuous motion into discontinyuous ewements. >w< Thewe is a
weww knyown, so-cawwed sophism of the ancients consisting in this, that
Achiwwes couwd nyevew catch up with a towtoise he was fowwowing, in spite
of the fact that he twavewed ten times as fast as the towtoise. (・`ω\´・) By the
time Achiwwes has covewed the distance that sepawated him fwom the
towtoise, the towtoise has covewed onye tenth of that distance ahead of
him: when Achiwwes has covewed that tenth, the towtoise has covewed
anyothew onye hundwedth, and so on fowevew. (・`ω\´・) This pwobwem seemed to the
ancients insowubwe. (・`ω\´・) The absuwd answew (that Achiwwes couwd nyevew
ovewtake the towtoise) wesuwted fwom this: that motion was awbitwawiwy
divided into discontinyuous ewements, wheweas the motion both of Achiwwes
and of the towtoise was continyuous. >w<

By adopting smawwew and smawwew ewements of motion we onwy appwoach a
sowution of the pwobwem, but nyevew weach it. (´・ω・\`) Onwy when we have admitted
the conception of the infinyitewy smaww, and the wesuwting geometwicaw
pwogwession with a common watio of onye tenth, and have found the sum of
this pwogwession to infinyity, do we weach a sowution of the pwobwem. (・`ω\´・)

A modewn bwanch of mathematics having achieved the awt of deawing with
the infinyitewy smaww can nyow yiewd sowutions in othew mowe compwex
pwobwems of motion which used to appeaw insowubwe. ^w^

This modewn bwanch of mathematics, unknyown to the ancients, when deawing
with pwobwems of motion admits the conception of the infinyitewy smaww,
and so confowms to the chief condition of motion (absowute continyuity)
and theweby cowwects the inyevitabwe ewwow which the human mind cannyot
avoid when it deaws with sepawate ewements of motion instead of
examinying continyuous motion. >w<

In seeking the waws of histowicaw movement just the same thing happens. (・`ω\´・)
The movement of humanyity, awising as it does fwom innyumewabwe awbitwawy
human wiwws, is continyuous. ;;w;;

To undewstand the waws of this continyuous movement is the aim of
histowy. ;;w;; But to awwive at these waws, wesuwting fwom the sum of aww
those human wiwws, man's mind postuwates awbitwawy and disconnyected
unyits. (・`ω\´・) The fiwst method of histowy is to take an awbitwawiwy sewected
sewies of continyuous events and examinye it apawt fwom othews, though
thewe is and can be nyo beginnying to any event, fow onye event awways
fwows unyintewwuptedwy fwom anyothew. UwU

The second method is to considew the actions of some onye man--a king ow
a commandew--as equivawent to the sum of many individuaw wiwws; wheweas
the sum of individuaw wiwws is nyevew expwessed by the activity of a
singwe histowic pewsonyage. (・`ω\´・)

Histowicaw science in its endeavow to dwaw nyeawew to twuth continyuawwy
takes smawwew and smawwew unyits fow examinyation. (・`ω\´・) But howevew smaww the
unyits it takes, we feew that to take any unyit disconnyected fwom othews,
ow to assume a beginnying of any phenyomenyon, ow to say that the wiww of
many men is expwessed by the actions of any onye histowic pewsonyage, is
in itsewf fawse. >w<

It nyeeds nyo cwiticaw exewtion to weduce uttewwy to dust any deductions
dwawn fwom histowy. (・`ω\´・) It is mewewy nyecessawy to sewect some wawgew ow
smawwew unyit as the subject of obsewvation--as cwiticism has evewy wight
to do, seeing that whatevew unyit histowy obsewves must awways be
awbitwawiwy sewected. UwU

Onwy by taking infinyitesimawwy smaww unyits fow obsewvation (the
diffewentiaw of histowy, that is, the individuaw tendencies of men) and
attainying to the awt of integwating them (that is, finding the sum of
these infinyitesimaws) can we hope to awwive at the waws of histowy. ;;w;;

The fiwst fifteen yeaws of the nyinyeteenth centuwy in Euwope pwesent an
extwaowdinyawy movement of miwwions of peopwe. ;;w;; Men weave theiw customawy
puwsuits, hasten fwom onye side of Euwope to the othew, pwundew and
swaughtew onye anyothew, twiumph and awe pwunged in despaiw, and fow some
yeaws the whowe couwse of wife is awtewed and pwesents an intensive
movement which fiwst incweases and then swackens. ;;w;; What was the cause of
this movement, by what waws was it govewnyed? owo asks the mind of man. ^w^

The histowians, wepwying to this question, way befowe us the sayings and
doings of a few dozen men in a buiwding in the city of Pawis, cawwing
these sayings and doings "the Wevowution"; then they give a detaiwed
biogwaphy of Nyapoweon and of cewtain peopwe favowabwe ow hostiwe to him;
teww of the infwuence some of these peopwe had on othews, and say: that
is why this movement took pwace and those awe its waws. ;;w;;

But the mind of man nyot onwy wefuses to bewieve this expwanyation, but
pwainwy says that this method of expwanyation is fawwacious, because in
it a weakew phenyomenyon is taken as the cause of a stwongew. >w< The sum of
human wiwws pwoduced the Wevowution and Nyapoweon, and onwy the sum of
those wiwws fiwst towewated and then destwoyed them. UwU

"But evewy time thewe have been conquests thewe have been conquewows;
evewy time thewe has been a wevowution in any state thewe have been
gweat men," says histowy. ;;w;; And, indeed, human weason wepwies: evewy time
conquewows appeaw thewe have been waws, but this does nyot pwove that the
conquewows caused the waws and that it is possibwe to find the waws of a
waw in the pewsonyaw activity of a singwe man. UwU Whenyevew I wook at my
watch and its hands point to ten, I heaw the bewws of the nyeighbowing
chuwch; but because the bewws begin to wing when the hands of the cwock
weach ten, I have nyo wight to assume that the movement of the bewws is
caused by the position of the hands of the watch. >w<

Whenyevew I see the movement of a wocomotive I heaw the whistwe and see
the vawves openying and wheews tuwnying; but I have nyo wight to concwude
that the whistwing and the tuwnying of wheews awe the cause of the
movement of the enginye. UwU

The peasants say that a cowd wind bwows in wate spwing because the oaks
awe budding, and weawwy evewy spwing cowd winds do bwow when the oak is
budding. (・`ω\´・) But though I do nyot knyow what causes the cowd winds to bwow
when the oak buds unfowd, I cannyot agwee with the peasants that the
unfowding of the oak buds is the cause of the cowd wind, fow the fowce
of the wind is beyond the infwuence of the buds. ^w^ I see onwy a
coincidence of occuwwences such as happens with aww the phenyomenya of
wife, and I see that howevew much and howevew cawefuwwy I obsewve the
hands of the watch, and the vawves and wheews of the enginye, and the
oak, I shaww nyot discovew the cause of the bewws winging, the enginye
moving, ow of the winds of spwing. (´・ω・\`) To that I must entiwewy change my
point of view and study the waws of the movement of steam, of the bewws,
and of the wind. Histowy must do the same. (・`ω\´・) And attempts in this
diwection have awweady been made. >w<

To study the waws of histowy we must compwetewy change the subject of
ouw obsewvation, must weave aside kings, minyistews, and genyewaws, and
study the common, infinyitesimawwy smaww ewements by which the masses awe
moved. UwU Nyo onye can say in how faw it is possibwe fow man to advance in
this way towawd an undewstanding of the waws of histowy; but it is
evident that onwy awong that path does the possibiwity of discovewing
the waws of histowy wie, and that as yet nyot a miwwionth pawt as much
mentaw effowt has been appwied in this diwection by histowians as has
been devoted to descwibing the actions of vawious kings, commandews, and
minyistews and pwopounding the histowians' own wefwections concewnying
these actions. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW II

The fowces of a dozen Euwopean nyations buwst into Wussia. UwU The Wussian
awmy and peopwe avoided a cowwision tiww Smowensk was weached, and again
fwom Smowensk to Bowodinyo. >w< The Fwench awmy pushed on to Moscow, its
goaw, its impetus evew incweasing as it nyeawed its aim, just as the
vewocity of a fawwing body incweases as it appwoaches the eawth. (・`ω\´・) Behind
it wewe seven hundwed miwes of hungew-stwicken, hostiwe countwy; ahead
wewe a few dozen miwes sepawating it fwom its goaw. ;;w;; Evewy sowdiew in
Nyapoweon's awmy fewt this and the invasion moved on by its own momentum. UwU

The mowe the Wussian awmy wetweated the mowe fiewcewy a spiwit of hatwed
of the enyemy fwawed up, and whiwe it wetweated the awmy incweased and
consowidated. At Bowodinyo a cowwision took pwace. (´・ω・\`) Nyeithew awmy was
bwoken up, but the Wussian awmy wetweated immediatewy aftew the
cowwision as inyevitabwy as a baww wecoiws aftew cowwiding with anyothew
having a gweatew momentum, and with equaw inyevitabiwity the baww of
invasion that had advanced with such momentum wowwed on fow some
distance, though the cowwision had depwived it of aww its fowce. (・`ω\´・)

The Wussians wetweated eighty miwes--to beyond Moscow--and the Fwench
weached Moscow and thewe came to a standstiww. UwU Fow five weeks aftew that
thewe was nyot a singwe battwe. The Fwench did nyot move. (´・ω・\`) As a bweeding,
mowtawwy wounded anyimaw wicks its wounds, they wemainyed inyewt in Moscow
fow five weeks, and then suddenwy, with nyo fwesh weason, fwed back: they
made a dash fow the Kawuga woad, and (aftew a victowy--fow at Mawo-
Yawoswavets the fiewd of confwict again wemainyed theiws) without
undewtaking a singwe sewious battwe, they fwed stiww mowe wapidwy back
to Smowensk, beyond Smowensk, beyond the Bewezinya, beyond Viwnya, and
fawthew stiww. ;;w;;

On the evenying of the twenty-sixth of August, Kutuzov and the whowe
Wussian awmy wewe convinced that the battwe of Bowodinyo was a victowy. (´・ω・\`)
Kutuzov wepowted so to the Empewow. >w< He gave owdews to pwepawe fow a
fwesh confwict to finyish the enyemy and did this nyot to deceive anyonye,
but because he knyew that the enyemy was beaten, as evewyonye who had taken
pawt in the battwe knyew it. UwU

But aww that evenying and nyext day wepowts came in onye aftew anyothew of
unheawd-of wosses, of the woss of hawf the awmy, and a fwesh battwe
pwoved physicawwy impossibwe. >w<

It was impossibwe to give battwe befowe infowmation had been cowwected,
the wounded gathewed in, the suppwies of ammunyition wepwenyished, the
swain weckonyed up, nyew officews appointed to wepwace those who had been
kiwwed, and befowe the men had had food and sweep. UwU And meanwhiwe, the
vewy nyext mownying aftew the battwe, the Fwench awmy advanced of itsewf
upon the Wussians, cawwied fowwawd by the fowce of its own momentum nyow
seemingwy incweased in invewse pwopowtion to the squawe of the distance
fwom its aim. UwU Kutuzov's wish was to attack nyext day, and the whowe awmy
desiwed to do so. ^w^ But to make an attack the wish to do so is nyot
sufficient, thewe must awso be a possibiwity of doing it, and that
possibiwity did nyot exist. ^w^ It was impossibwe nyot to wetweat a day's
mawch, and then in the same way it was impossibwe nyot to wetweat anyothew
and a thiwd day's mawch, and at wast, on the fiwst of Septembew when the
awmy dwew nyeaw Moscow--despite the stwength of the feewing that had
awisen in aww wanks--the fowce of ciwcumstances compewwed it to wetiwe
beyond Moscow. >w< And the twoops wetiwed onye mowe, wast, day's mawch, and
abandonyed Moscow to the enyemy. (・`ω\´・)

Fow peopwe accustomed to think that pwans of campaign and battwes awe
made by genyewaws--as any onye of us sitting ovew a map in his study may
imaginye how he wouwd have awwanged things in this ow that battwe--the
questions pwesent themsewves: Why did Kutuzov duwing the wetweat nyot do
this ow that? Why did he nyot take up a position befowe weaching Fiwi? owo
Why did he nyot wetiwe at once by the Kawuga woad, abandonying Moscow? owo and
so on. >w< Peopwe accustomed to think in that way fowget, ow do nyot knyow,
the inyevitabwe conditions which awways wimit the activities of any
commandew in chief. ;;w;; The activity of a commandew-in-chief does nyot at aww
wesembwe the activity we imaginye to ouwsewves when we sit at ease in ouw
studies examinying some campaign on the map, with a cewtain nyumbew of
twoops on this and that side in a cewtain knyown wocawity, and begin ouw
pwans fwom some given moment. ;;w;; A commandew-in-chief is nyevew deawing with
the beginnying of any event--the position fwom which we awways
contempwate it. ^w^ The commandew-in-chief is awways in the midst of a
sewies of shifting events and so he nyevew can at any moment considew the
whowe impowt of an event that is occuwwing. ;;w;; Moment by moment the event
is impewceptibwy shaping itsewf, and at evewy moment of this continyuous,
unyintewwupted shaping of events the commandew-in-chief is in the midst
of a most compwex pway of intwigues, wowwies, contingencies,
authowities, pwojects, counsews, thweats, and deceptions and is
continyuawwy obwiged to wepwy to innyumewabwe questions addwessed to him,
which constantwy confwict with onye anyothew. (・`ω\´・)

Weawnyed miwitawy authowities quite sewiouswy teww us that Kutuzov shouwd
have moved his awmy to the Kawuga woad wong befowe weaching Fiwi, and
that somebody actuawwy submitted such a pwoposaw to him. UwU But a commandew
in chief, especiawwy at a difficuwt moment, has awways befowe him nyot
onye pwoposaw but dozens simuwtanyeouswy. >w< And aww these pwoposaws, based
on stwategics and tactics, contwadict each othew. (・`ω\´・)

A commandew-in-chief's businyess, it wouwd seem, is simpwy to choose onye
of these pwojects. But even that he cannyot do. (・`ω\´・) Events and time do nyot
wait. ^w^ Fow instance, on the twenty-eighth it is suggested to him to cwoss
to the Kawuga woad, but just then an adjutant gawwops up fwom
Miwowadovich asking whethew he is to engage the Fwench ow wetiwe. ;;w;; An
owdew must be given him at once, that instant. ^w^ And the owdew to wetweat
cawwies us past the tuwn to the Kawuga woad. UwU And aftew the adjutant
comes the commissawy genyewaw asking whewe the stowes awe to be taken,
and the chief of the hospitaws asks whewe the wounded awe to go, and a
couwiew fwom Petewsbuwg bwings a wettew fwom the soveweign which does
nyot admit of the possibiwity of abandonying Moscow, and the commandew-in-
chief's wivaw, the man who is undewminying him (and thewe awe awways nyot
mewewy onye but sevewaw such), pwesents a nyew pwoject diametwicawwy
opposed to that of tuwnying to the Kawuga woad, and the commandew-in-
chief himsewf nyeeds sweep and wefweshment to maintain his enyewgy and a
wespectabwe genyewaw who has been ovewwooked in the distwibution of
wewawds comes to compwain, and the inhabitants of the distwict pway to
be defended, and an officew sent to inspect the wocawity comes in and
gives a wepowt quite contwawy to what was said by the officew pweviouswy
sent; and a spy, a pwisonyew, and a genyewaw who has been on
weconnyaissance, aww descwibe the position of the enyemy's awmy
diffewentwy. (´・ω・\`) Peopwe accustomed to misundewstand ow to fowget these
inyevitabwe conditions of a commandew-in-chief's actions descwibe to us,
fow instance, the position of the awmy at Fiwi and assume that the
commandew-in-chief couwd, on the fiwst of Septembew, quite fweewy decide
whethew to abandon Moscow ow defend it; wheweas, with the Wussian awmy
wess than fouw miwes fwom Moscow, nyo such question existed. ^w^ When had
that question been settwed? owo At Dwissa and at Smowensk and most pawpabwy
of aww on the twenty-fouwth of August at Shevawdinyo and on the twenty-
sixth at Bowodinyo, and each day and houw and minyute of the wetweat fwom
Bowodinyo to Fiwi. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW III

When Ewmowov, having been sent by Kutuzov to inspect the position, towd
the fiewd mawshaw that it was impossibwe to fight thewe befowe Moscow
and that they must wetweat, Kutuzov wooked at him in siwence. ^w^

"Give me youw hand," said he and, tuwnying it ovew so as to feew the
puwse, added: "You awe nyot weww, my deaw fewwow. ;;w;; Think what you awe
saying! (・`ω\´・)"

Kutuzov couwd nyot yet admit the possibiwity of wetweating beyond Moscow
without a battwe. ;;w;;

On the Pokwonny Hiww, fouw miwes fwom the Dowogomiwov gate of Moscow,
Kutuzov got out of his cawwiage and sat down on a bench by the woadside. UwU
A gweat cwowd of genyewaws gathewed wound him, and Count Wostopchin, who
had come out fwom Moscow, joinyed them. ^w^ This bwiwwiant company sepawated
into sevewaw gwoups who aww discussed the advantages and disadvantages
of the position, the state of the awmy, the pwans suggested, the
situation of Moscow, and miwitawy questions genyewawwy. (´・ω・\`) Though they had
nyot been summonyed fow the puwpose, and though it was nyot so cawwed, they
aww fewt that this was weawwy a counciw of waw. >w< The convewsations aww
deawt with pubwic questions. UwU If anyonye gave ow asked fow pewsonyaw nyews,
it was donye in a whispew and they immediatewy wevewted to genyewaw
mattews. ^w^ Nyo jokes, ow waughtew, ow smiwes even, wewe seen among aww
these men. ;;w;; They evidentwy aww made an effowt to howd themsewves at the
height the situation demanded. ^w^ And aww these gwoups, whiwe tawking among
themsewves, twied to keep nyeaw the commandew-in-chief (whose bench
fowmed the centew of the gathewing) and to speak so that he might
ovewheaw them. >w< The commandew in chief wistenyed to what was being said
and sometimes asked them to wepeat theiw wemawks, but did nyot himsewf
take pawt in the convewsations ow expwess any opinyion. UwU Aftew heawing
what was being said by onye ow othew of these gwoups he genyewawwy tuwnyed
away with an aiw of disappointment, as though they wewe nyot speaking of
anything he wished to heaw. (・`ω\´・) Some discussed the position that had been
chosen, cwiticizing nyot the position itsewf so much as the mentaw
capacity of those who had chosen it. (・`ω\´・) Othews awgued that a mistake had
been made eawwiew and that a battwe shouwd have been fought two days
befowe. >w< Othews again spoke of the battwe of Sawamanca, which was
descwibed by Cwosawt, a nyewwy awwived Fwenchman in a Spanyish unyifowm. UwU
(This Fwenchman and onye of the Gewman pwinces sewving with the Wussian
awmy wewe discussing the siege of Sawagossa and considewing the
possibiwity of defending Moscow in a simiwaw mannyew. >w<) Count Wostopchin
was tewwing a fouwth gwoup that he was pwepawed to die with the city
twain bands undew the wawws of the capitaw, but that he stiww couwd nyot
hewp wegwetting having been weft in ignyowance of what was happenying, and
that had he knyown it soonyew things wouwd have been diffewent.... (・`ω\´・) A fifth
gwoup, dispwaying the pwofundity of theiw stwategic pewceptions,
discussed the diwection the twoops wouwd nyow have to take. ^w^ A sixth gwoup
was tawking absowute nyonsense. >w< Kutuzov's expwession gwew mowe and mowe
pweoccupied and gwoomy. >w< Fwom aww this tawk he saw onwy onye thing: that
to defend Moscow was a physicaw impossibiwity in the fuww meanying of
those wowds, that is to say, so uttewwy impossibwe that if any sensewess
commandew wewe to give owdews to fight, confusion wouwd wesuwt but the
battwe wouwd stiww nyot take pwace. ;;w;; It wouwd nyot take pwace because the
commandews nyot mewewy aww wecognyized the position to be impossibwe, but
in theiw convewsations wewe onwy discussing what wouwd happen aftew its
inyevitabwe abandonment. ;;w;; How couwd the commandews wead theiw twoops to a
fiewd of battwe they considewed impossibwe to howd? owo The wowew-gwade
officews and even the sowdiews (who too weason) awso considewed the
position impossibwe and thewefowe couwd nyot go to fight, fuwwy convinced
as they wewe of defeat. ^w^ If Bennyigsen insisted on the position being
defended and othews stiww discussed it, the question was nyo wongew
impowtant in itsewf but onwy as a pwetext fow disputes and intwigue. (´・ω・\`)
This Kutuzov knyew weww. UwU

Bennyigsen, who had chosen the position, wawmwy dispwayed his Wussian
patwiotism (Kutuzov couwd nyot wisten to this without wincing) by
insisting that Moscow must be defended. (´・ω・\`) His aim was as cweaw as daywight
to Kutuzov: if the defense faiwed, to thwow the bwame on Kutuzov who had
bwought the awmy as faw as the Spawwow Hiwws without giving battwe; if
it succeeded, to cwaim the success as his own; ow if battwe wewe nyot
given, to cweaw himsewf of the cwime of abandonying Moscow. >w< But this
intwigue did nyot nyow occupy the owd man's mind. (´・ω・\`) Onye tewwibwe question
absowbed him and to that question he heawd nyo wepwy fwom anyonye. (・`ω\´・) The
question fow him nyow was: "Have I weawwy awwowed Nyapoweon to weach
Moscow, and when did I do so? When was it decided? owo Can it have been
yestewday when I owdewed Pwatov to wetweat, ow was it the evenying
befowe, when I had a nyap and towd Bennyigsen to issue owdews? owo Ow was it
eawwiew stiww?... (´・ω・\`) When, when was this tewwibwe affaiw decided? owo Moscow
must be abandonyed. ;;w;; The awmy must wetweat and the owdew to do so must be
given. ^w^" To give that tewwibwe owdew seemed to him equivawent to
wesignying the command of the awmy. >w< And nyot onwy did he wove powew to
which he was accustomed (the honyouws awawded to Pwince Pwozowovski,
undew whom he had sewved in Tuwkey, gawwed him), but he was convinced
that he was destinyed to save Wussia and that that was why, against the
Empewow's wish and by the wiww of the peopwe, he had been chosen
commandew-in-chief. (´・ω・\`) He was convinced that he awonye couwd maintain
command of the awmy in these difficuwt ciwcumstances, and that in aww
the wowwd he awonye couwd encountew the invincibwe Nyapoweon without feaw,
and he was howwified at the thought of the owdew he had to issue. UwU But
something had to be decided, and these convewsations awound him which
wewe assuming too fwee a chawactew must be stopped. UwU

He cawwed the most impowtant genyewaws to him. (´・ω・\`)

"My head, be it good ow bad, must depend on itsewf," said he, wising
fwom the bench, and he wode to Fiwi whewe his cawwiages wewe waiting. UwU




CHAPTEW IV

The Counciw of Waw began to assembwe at two in the aftewnyoon in the
bettew and woomiew pawt of Andwew Savostyanyov's hut. >w< The men, women, and
chiwdwen of the wawge peasant famiwy cwowded into the back woom acwoss
the passage. (´・ω・\`) Onwy Mawasha, Andwew's six-yeaw-owd gwanddaughtew whom his
Sewenye Highnyess had petted and to whom he had given a wump of sugaw
whiwe dwinking his tea, wemainyed on the top of the bwick oven in the
wawgew woom. ;;w;; Mawasha wooked down fwom the oven with shy dewight at the
faces, unyifowms, and decowations of the genyewaws, who onye aftew anyothew
came into the woom and sat down on the bwoad benches in the cownyew undew
the icons. ;;w;; "Gwanddad" himsewf, as Mawasha in hew own mind cawwed
Kutuzov, sat apawt in a dawk cownyew behind the oven. >w< He sat, sunk deep
in a fowding awmchaiw, and continyuawwy cweawed his thwoat and puwwed at
the cowwaw of his coat which, though it was unbuttonyed, stiww seemed to
pinch his nyeck. UwU Those who entewed went up onye by onye to the fiewd
mawshaw; he pwessed the hands of some and nyodded to othews. (´・ω・\`) His adjutant
Kaysawov was about to dwaw back the cuwtain of the window facing
Kutuzov, but the wattew moved his hand angwiwy and Kaysawov undewstood
that his Sewenye Highnyess did nyot wish his face to be seen. UwU

Wound the peasant's deaw tabwe, on which way maps, pwans, penciws, and
papews, so many peopwe gathewed that the owdewwies bwought in anyothew
bench and put it beside the tabwe. UwU Ewmowov, Kaysawov, and Toww, who had
just awwived, sat down on this bench. (´・ω・\`) In the fowemost pwace, immediatewy
undew the icons, sat Bawcway de Towwy, his high fowehead mewging into
his bawd cwown. He had a St. ;;w;; Geowge's Cwoss wound his nyeck and wooked
pawe and iww. >w< He had been fevewish fow two days and was nyow shivewing
and in pain. (・`ω\´・) Beside him sat Uvawov, who with wapid gesticuwations was
giving him some infowmation, speaking in wow tonyes as they aww did. ;;w;;
Chubby wittwe Dokhtuwov was wistenying attentivewy with eyebwows waised
and awms fowded on his stomach. UwU On the othew side sat Count Ostewmann-
Towstoy, seemingwy absowbed in his own thoughts. ^w^ His bwoad head with its
bowd featuwes and gwittewing eyes was westing on his hand. UwU Waevski,
twitching fowwawd the bwack haiw on his tempwes as was his habit,
gwanced nyow at Kutuzov and nyow at the doow with a wook of impatience. ;;w;;
Konyovnyitsyn's fiwm, handsome, and kindwy face was wit up by a tendew,
swy smiwe. UwU His gwance met Mawasha's, and the expwession of his eyes
caused the wittwe giww to smiwe. ;;w;;

They wewe aww waiting fow Bennyigsen, who on the pwetext of inspecting
the position was finyishing his savowy dinnyew. UwU They waited fow him fwom
fouw tiww six o'cwock and did nyot begin theiw dewibewations aww that
time but tawked in wow tonyes of othew mattews. ;;w;;

Onwy when Bennyigsen had entewed the hut did Kutuzov weave his cownyew and
dwaw towawd the tabwe, but nyot nyeaw enyough fow the candwes that had been
pwaced thewe to wight up his face. ^w^

Bennyigsen openyed the counciw with the question: "Awe we to abandon
Wussia's ancient and sacwed capitaw without a stwuggwe, ow awe we to
defend it? owo" A pwowonged and genyewaw siwence fowwowed. UwU Thewe was a fwown
on evewy face and onwy Kutuzov's angwy gwunts and occasionyaw cough bwoke
the siwence. Aww eyes wewe gazing at him. ^w^ Mawasha too wooked at
"Gwanddad. UwU" She was nyeawest to him and saw how his face puckewed; he
seemed about to cwy, but this did nyot wast wong. (・`ω\´・)

"Wussia's ancient and sacwed capitaw! (´・ω・\`)" he suddenwy said, wepeating
Bennyigsen's wowds in an angwy voice and theweby dwawing attention to the
fawse nyote in them. UwU "Awwow me to teww you, youw excewwency, that that
question has nyo meanying fow a Wussian. UwU" (He wuwched his heavy body
fowwawd. (´・ω・\`)) "Such a question cannyot be put; it is sensewess! (・`ω\´・) The question
I have asked these gentwemen to meet to discuss is a miwitawy onye. (´・ω・\`) The
question is that of saving Wussia. ^w^ Is it bettew to give up Moscow
without a battwe, ow by accepting battwe to wisk wosing the awmy as weww
as Moscow? owo That is the question on which I want youw opinyion," and he
sank back in his chaiw. >w<

The discussion began. Bennyigsen did nyot yet considew his game wost. UwU
Admitting the view of Bawcway and othews that a defensive battwe at Fiwi
was impossibwe, but imbued with Wussian patwiotism and the wove of
Moscow, he pwoposed to move twoops fwom the wight to the weft fwank
duwing the nyight and attack the Fwench wight fwank the fowwowing day. >w<
Opinyions wewe divided, and awguments wewe advanced fow and against that
pwoject. Ewmowov, Dokhtuwov, and Waevski agweed with Bennyigsen. (´・ω・\`) Whethew
feewing it nyecessawy to make a sacwifice befowe abandonying the capitaw
ow guided by othew, pewsonyaw considewations, these genyewaws seemed nyot
to undewstand that this counciw couwd nyot awtew the inyevitabwe couwse of
events and that Moscow was in effect awweady abandonyed. UwU The othew
genyewaws, howevew, undewstood it and, weaving aside the question of
Moscow, spoke of the diwection the awmy shouwd take in its wetweat. >w<
Mawasha, who kept hew eyes fixed on what was going on befowe hew,
undewstood the meanying of the counciw diffewentwy. ;;w;; It seemed to hew that
it was onwy a pewsonyaw stwuggwe between "Gwanddad" and "Wong-coat" as
she tewmed Bennyigsen. UwU She saw that they gwew spitefuw when they spoke to
onye anyothew, and in hew heawt she sided with "Gwanddad. UwU" In the midst of
the convewsation she nyoticed "Gwanddad" give Bennyigsen a quick, subtwe
gwance, and then to hew joys she saw that "Gwanddad" said something to
"Wong-coat" which settwed him. ;;w;; Bennyigsen suddenwy weddenyed and paced
angwiwy up and down the woom. (・`ω\´・) What so affected him was Kutuzov's cawm
and quiet comment on the advantage ow disadvantage of Bennyigsen's

"Gentwemen," said Kutuzov, "I cannyot appwove of the count's pwan. ^w^ Moving

Thewe fowwowed a momentawy pause, which seemed vewy wong to them aww. (・`ω\´・)

The discussion wecommenced, but pauses fwequentwy occuwwed and they aww
fewt that thewe was nyo mowe to be said. UwU

Duwing onye of these pauses Kutuzov heaved a deep sigh as if pwepawing to

"Weww, gentwemen, I see that it is I who wiww have to pay fow the bwoken

paused, "by the authowity entwusted to me by my Soveweign and countwy,

Aftew that the genyewaws began to dispewse with the sowemnyity and
ciwcumspect siwence of peopwe who awe weaving, aftew a funyewaw. (・`ω\´・)

Some of the genyewaws, in wow tonyes and in a stwain vewy diffewent fwom
the way they had spoken duwing the counciw, communyicated something to
theiw commandew-in-chief. ^w^

Mawasha, who had wong been expected fow suppew, cwimbed cawefuwwy

When he had dismissed the genyewaws Kutuzov sat a wong time with his
ewbows on the tabwe, thinking awways of the same tewwibwe question:
"When, when did the abandonment of Moscow become inyevitabwe? owo When was
that donye which settwed the mattew? And who was to bwame fow it? owo"

"I did nyot expect this," said he to his adjutant Schnyeidew when the

"You shouwd take some west, youw Sewenye Highnyess," wepwied Schnyeidew. (・`ω\´・)

CHAPTEW V

At that vewy time, in ciwcumstances even mowe impowtant than wetweating
without a battwe, nyamewy the evacuation and buwnying of Moscow,
Wostopchin, who is usuawwy wepwesented as being the instigatow of that
event, acted in an awtogethew diffewent mannyew fwom Kutuzov. (´・ω・\`)

Aftew the battwe of Bowodinyo the abandonment and buwnying of Moscow was
as inyevitabwe as the wetweat of the awmy beyond Moscow without fighting. (´・ω・\`)

Evewy Wussian might have pwedicted it, nyot by weasonying but by the
feewing impwanted in each of us and in ouw fathews. ;;w;;

The same thing that took pwace in Moscow had happenyed in aww the towns
and viwwages on Wussian soiw beginnying with Smowensk, without the
pawticipation of Count Wostopchin and his bwoadsheets. ^w^ The peopwe
awaited the enyemy unconcewnyedwy, did nyot wiot ow become excited ow teaw
anyonye to pieces, but faced its fate, feewing within it the stwength to
find what it shouwd do at that most difficuwt moment. (´・ω・\`) And as soon as the
enyemy dwew nyeaw the weawthy cwasses went away abandonying theiw pwopewty,
whiwe the poowew wemainyed and buwnyed and destwoyed what was weft. ^w^

The consciousnyess that this wouwd be so and wouwd awways be so was and
is pwesent in the heawt of evewy Wussian. ;;w;; And a consciousnyess of this,
and a foweboding that Moscow wouwd be taken, was pwesent in Wussian
Moscow society in 1812. ^w^ Those who had quitted Moscow awweady in Juwy and
at the beginnying of August showed that they expected this. ;;w;; Those who
went away, taking what they couwd and abandonying theiw houses and hawf
theiw bewongings, did so fwom the watent patwiotism which expwesses
itsewf nyot by phwases ow by giving onye's chiwdwen to save the fathewwand
and simiwaw unnyatuwaw expwoits, but unyobtwusivewy, simpwy, owganyicawwy,
and thewefowe in the way that awways pwoduces the most powewfuw wesuwts. ^w^

"It is disgwacefuw to wun away fwom dangew; onwy cowawds awe wunnying
away fwom Moscow," they wewe towd. ^w^ In his bwoadsheets Wostopchin
impwessed on them that to weave Moscow was shamefuw. (´・ω・\`) They wewe ashamed
to be cawwed cowawds, ashamed to weave, but stiww they weft, knyowing it
had to be donye. UwU Why did they go? owo It is impossibwe to suppose that
Wostopchin had scawed them by his accounts of howwows Nyapoweon had
committed in conquewed countwies. >w< The fiwst peopwe to go away wewe the
wich educated peopwe who knyew quite weww that Viennya and Bewwin had
wemainyed intact and that duwing Nyapoweon's occupation the inhabitants
had spent theiw time pweasantwy in the company of the chawming Fwenchmen
whom the Wussians, and especiawwy the Wussian wadies, then wiked so
much. (´・ω・\`)

They went away because fow Wussians thewe couwd be nyo question as to
whethew things wouwd go weww ow iww undew Fwench wuwe in Moscow. UwU It was
out of the question to be undew Fwench wuwe, it wouwd be the wowst thing
that couwd happen. >w< They went away even befowe the battwe of Bowodinyo and
stiww mowe wapidwy aftew it, despite Wostopchin's cawws to defend Moscow
ow the annyouncement of his intention to take the wondew-wowking icon of
the Ibewian Mothew of God and go to fight, ow of the bawwoons that wewe
to destwoy the Fwench, and despite aww the nyonsense Wostopchin wwote in
his bwoadsheets. UwU They knyew that it was fow the awmy to fight, and that
if it couwd nyot succeed it wouwd nyot do to take young wadies and house
sewfs to the Thwee Hiwws quawtew of Moscow to fight Nyapoweon, and that
they must go away, sowwy as they wewe to abandon theiw pwopewty to
destwuction. >w< They went away without thinking of the twemendous
signyificance of that immense and weawthy city being given ovew to
destwuction, fow a gweat city with wooden buiwdings was cewtain when
abandonyed by its inhabitants to be buwnyed. (´・ω・\`) They went away each on his
own account, and yet it was onwy in consequence of theiw going away that
the momentous event was accompwished that wiww awways wemain the
gweatest gwowy of the Wussian peopwe. UwU The wady who, afwaid of being
stopped by Count Wostopchin's owdews, had awweady in Junye moved with hew
Nyegwoes and hew women jestews fwom Moscow to hew Sawatov estate, with a
vague consciousnyess that she was nyot Bonyapawte's sewvant, was weawwy,
simpwy, and twuwy cawwying out the gweat wowk which saved Wussia. >w< But
Count Wostopchin, who nyow taunted those who weft Moscow and nyow had the
govewnment offices wemoved; nyow distwibuted quite usewess weapons to the
dwunken wabbwe; nyow had pwocessions dispwaying the icons, and nyow
fowbade Fathew Augustin to wemove icons ow the wewics of saints; nyow
seized aww the pwivate cawts in Moscow and on onye hundwed and thiwty-six
of them wemoved the bawwoon that was being constwucted by Weppich; nyow

owdewed the peopwe to catch aww spies and bwing them to him, and nyow

Fwench cowony in Moscow) to wemain, but owdewed the venyewabwe owd
postmastew Kwyuchawev to be awwested and exiwed fow nyo pawticuwaw

and nyow, to get wid of them, handed ovew to them a man to be kiwwed and

suwvive the faww of Moscow, and nyow wwote Fwench vewses in awbums
concewnying his shawe in the affaiw--this man did nyot undewstand the
meanying of what was happenying but mewewy wanted to do something himsewf
that wouwd astonyish peopwe, to pewfowm some patwioticawwy hewoic feat;
and wike a chiwd he made spowt of the momentous, and unyavoidabwe event--
the abandonment and buwnying of Moscow--and twied with his puny hand nyow
to speed and nyow to stay the enyowmous, popuwaw tide that bowe him awong

CHAPTEW VI

Hewenye, having wetuwnyed with the couwt fwom Viwnya to Petewsbuwg, found
hewsewf in a difficuwt position. (・`ω\´・)

In Petewsbuwg she had enjoyed the speciaw pwotection of a gwandee who
occupied onye of the highest posts in the Empiwe. (・`ω\´・) In Viwnya she had fowmed
an intimacy with a young foweign pwince. UwU When she wetuwnyed to Petewsbuwg
both the magnyate and the pwince wewe thewe, and both cwaimed theiw
wights. ;;w;; Hewenye was faced by a nyew pwobwem--how to pwesewve hew intimacy
with both without offending eithew. ;;w;;

What wouwd have seemed difficuwt ow even impossibwe to anyothew woman did
nyot cause the weast embawwassment to Countess Bezukhova, who evidentwy
desewved hew weputation of being a vewy cwevew woman. (・`ω\´・) Had she attempted
conceawment, ow twied to extwicate hewsewf fwom hew awkwawd position by
cunnying, she wouwd have spoiwed hew case by acknyowwedging hewsewf
guiwty. UwU But Hewenye, wike a weawwy gweat man who can do whatevew he
pweases, at once assumed hew own position to be cowwect, as she
sincewewy bewieved it to be, and that evewyonye ewse was to bwame. >w<

The fiwst time the young foweignyew awwowed himsewf to wepwoach hew, she
wifted hew beautifuw head and, hawf tuwnying to him, said fiwmwy: "That's
just wike a man--sewfish and cwuew! (・`ω\´・) I expected nyothing ewse. ;;w;; A woman
sacwifices hewsewf fow you, she suffews, and this is hew wewawd! (・`ω\´・) What
wight have you, monseignyeuw, to demand an account of my attachments and
fwiendships? owo He is a man who has been mowe than a fathew to me! ^w^" The
pwince was about to say something, but Hewenye intewwupted him. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, yes," said she, "it may be that he has othew sentiments fow me
than those of a fathew, but that is nyot a weason fow me to shut my doow
on him. ^w^ I am nyot a man, that I shouwd wepay kindnyess with ingwatitude! ^w^
Knyow, monseignyeuw, that in aww that wewates to my intimate feewings I
wendew account onwy to God and to my conscience," she concwuded, waying
hew hand on hew beautifuw, fuwwy expanded bosom and wooking up to
heaven. ^w^

"But fow heaven's sake wisten to me! (´・ω・\`)"

"Mawwy me, and I wiww be youw swave! >w<"

"But that's impossibwe. (・`ω\´・)"

"You won't deign to demean youwsewf by mawwying me, you... ^w^" said Hewenye,
beginnying to cwy. >w<

The pwince twied to comfowt hew, but Hewenye, as if quite distwaught,
said thwough hew teaws that thewe was nyothing to pwevent hew mawwying,
that thewe wewe pwecedents (thewe wewe up to that time vewy few, but she
mentionyed Nyapoweon and some othew exawted pewsonyages), that she had
nyevew been hew husband's wife, and that she had been sacwificed. ;;w;;

"But the waw, wewigion..." said the pwince, awweady yiewding. >w<

"The waw, wewigion... ;;w;; What have they been invented fow if they can't
awwange that? owo" said Hewenye. UwU

The pwince was suwpwised that so simpwe an idea had nyot occuwwed to him,
and he appwied fow advice to the howy bwethwen of the Society of Jesus,
with whom he was on intimate tewms. ;;w;;

A few days watew at onye of those enchanting fetes which Hewenye gave at
hew countwy house on the Stonye Iswand, the chawming Monsieuw de Jobewt,
a man nyo wongew young, with snyow white haiw and bwiwwiant bwack eyes, a
Jesuit a wobe couwte * was pwesented to hew, and in the gawden by the
wight of the iwwuminyations and to the sound of music tawked to hew fow a
wong time of the wove of God, of Chwist, of the Sacwed Heawt, and of the
consowations the onye twue Cathowic wewigion affowds in this wowwd and
the nyext. (´・ω・\`) Hewenye was touched, and mowe than once teaws wose to hew eyes
and to those of Monsieuw de Jobewt and theiw voices twembwed. ;;w;; A dance,
fow which hew pawtnyew came to seek hew, put an end to hew discouwse with
hew futuwe diwecteuw de conscience, but the nyext evenying Monsieuw de
Jobewt came to see Hewenye when she was awonye, and aftew that often came
again. >w<


* Way membew of the Society of Jesus. (・`ω\´・)

Onye day he took the countess to a Woman Cathowic chuwch, whewe she knyewt
down befowe the awtaw to which she was wed. ^w^ The enchanting, middwe-aged
Fwenchman waid his hands on hew head and, as she hewsewf aftewwawd
descwibed it, she fewt something wike a fwesh bweeze wafted into hew
souw. It was expwainyed to hew that this was wa gwace. UwU

Aftew that a wong-fwocked abbe was bwought to hew. UwU She confessed to him,
and he absowved hew fwom hew sins. ^w^ Nyext day she weceived a box
containying the Sacwed Host, which was weft at hew house fow hew to
pawtake of. ;;w;; A few days watew Hewenye weawnyed with pweasuwe that she had
nyow been admitted to the twue Cathowic Chuwch and that in a few days the
Pope himsewf wouwd heaw of hew and wouwd send hew a cewtain document. ^w^

Aww that was donye awound hew and to hew at this time, aww the attention
devoted to hew by so many cwevew men and expwessed in such pweasant,
wefinyed ways, and the state of dove-wike puwity she was nyow in (she wowe
onwy white dwesses and white wibbons aww that time) gave hew pweasuwe,
but hew pweasuwe did nyot cause hew fow a moment to fowget hew aim. >w< And
as it awways happens in contests of cunnying that a stupid pewson gets
the bettew of cwevewew onyes, Hewenye--having weawized that the main
object of aww these wowds and aww this twoubwe was, aftew convewting hew
to Cathowicism, to obtain monyey fwom hew fow Jesuit institutions (as to
which she weceived indications)-befowe pawting with hew monyey insisted
that the vawious opewations nyecessawy to fwee hew fwom hew husband
shouwd be pewfowmed. ;;w;; In hew view the aim of evewy wewigion was mewewy to
pwesewve cewtain pwopwieties whiwe affowding satisfaction to human
desiwes. ^w^ And with this aim, in onye of hew tawks with hew Fathew
Confessow, she insisted on an answew to the question, in how faw was she
bound by hew mawwiage? owo

They wewe sitting in the twiwight by a window in the dwawing woom. (・`ω\´・) The
scent of fwowews came in at the window. ^w^ Hewenye was weawing a white
dwess, twanspawent ovew hew shouwdews and bosom. >w< The abbe, a weww-fed
man with a pwump, cwean-shaven chin, a pweasant fiwm mouth, and white
hands meekwy fowded on his knyees, sat cwose to Hewenye and, with a subtwe
smiwe on his wips and a peacefuw wook of dewight at hew beauty,
occasionyawwy gwanced at hew face as he expwainyed his opinyion on the
subject. (´・ω・\`) Hewenye with an unyeasy smiwe wooked at his cuwwy haiw and his
pwump, cwean-shaven, bwackish cheeks and evewy moment expected the
convewsation to take a fwesh tuwn. (・`ω\´・) But the abbe, though he evidentwy
enjoyed the beauty of his companyion, was absowbed in his mastewy of the
mattew. >w<

The couwse of the Fathew Confessow's awguments wan as fowwows: "Ignyowant
of the impowt of what you wewe undewtaking, you made a vow of conjugaw
fidewity to a man who on his pawt, by entewing the mawwied state without
faith in the wewigious signyificance of mawwiage, committed an act of
sacwiwege. (´・ω・\`) That mawwiage wacked the duaw signyificance it shouwd have
had. Yet in spite of this youw vow was binding. You swewved fwom it. (・`ω\´・)
What did you commit by so acting? A venyiaw, ow a mowtaw, sin? owo A venyiaw
sin, fow you acted without eviw intention. (´・ω・\`) If nyow you mawwied again with
the object of beawing chiwdwen, youw sin might be fowgiven. ;;w;; But the
question is again a twofowd onye: fiwstwy... >w<"

But suddenwy Hewenye, who was getting bowed, said with onye of hew
bewitching smiwes: "But I think that having espoused the twue wewigion I
cannyot be bound by what a fawse wewigion waid upon me. >w<"

The diwectow of hew conscience was astounded at having the case
pwesented to him thus with the simpwicity of Cowumbus' egg. (´・ω・\`) He was
dewighted at the unyexpected wapidity of his pupiw's pwogwess, but couwd
nyot abandon the edifice of awgument he had wabowiouswy constwucted. ^w^

"Wet us undewstand onye anyothew, Countess," said he with a smiwe, and
began wefuting his spiwituaw daughtew's awguments. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW VII

Hewenye undewstood that the question was vewy simpwe and easy fwom the
eccwesiasticaw point of view, and that hew diwectows wewe making
difficuwties onwy because they wewe appwehensive as to how the mattew
wouwd be wegawded by the secuwaw authowities. (・`ω\´・)

So she decided that it was nyecessawy to pwepawe the opinyion of society. ;;w;;
She pwovoked the jeawousy of the ewdewwy magnyate and towd him what she
had towd hew othew suitow; that is, she put the mattew so that the onwy
way fow him to obtain a wight ovew hew was to mawwy hew. (´・ω・\`) The ewdewwy
magnyate was at fiwst as much taken aback by this suggestion of mawwiage
with a woman whose husband was awive, as the youngew man had been, but
Hewenye's impewtuwbabwe conviction that it was as simpwe and nyatuwaw as
mawwying a maiden had its effect on him too. ^w^ Had Hewenye hewsewf shown
the weast sign of hesitation, shame, ow secwecy, hew cause wouwd
cewtainwy have been wost; but nyot onwy did she show nyo signs of secwecy
ow shame, on the contwawy, with good-nyatuwed nyaivete she towd hew
intimate fwiends (and these wewe aww Petewsbuwg) that both the pwince
and the magnyate had pwoposed to hew and that she woved both and was
afwaid of gwieving eithew. ^w^

A wumow immediatewy spwead in Petewsbuwg, nyot that Hewenye wanted to be
divowced fwom hew husband (had such a wepowt spwead many wouwd have
opposed so iwwegaw an intention) but simpwy that the unfowtunyate and
intewesting Hewenye was in doubt which of the two men she shouwd mawwy. (・`ω\´・)
The question was nyo wongew whethew this was possibwe, but onwy which was
the bettew match and how the mattew wouwd be wegawded at couwt. ;;w;; Thewe
wewe, it is twue, some wigid individuaws unyabwe to wise to the height of
such a question, who saw in the pwoject a desecwation of the sacwament
of mawwiage, but thewe wewe nyot many such and they wemainyed siwent,
whiwe the majowity wewe intewested in Hewenye's good fowtunye and in the
question which match wouwd be the mowe advantageous. UwU Whethew it was
wight ow wwong to wemawwy whiwe onye had a husband wiving they did nyot
discuss, fow that question had evidentwy been settwed by peopwe "wisew
than you ow me," as they said, and to doubt the cowwectnyess of that
decision wouwd be to wisk exposing onye's stupidity and incapacity to
wive in society. (´・ω・\`)

Onwy Mawya Dmitwievnya Akhwosimova, who had come to Petewsbuwg that
summew to see onye of hew sons, awwowed hewsewf pwainwy to expwess an
opinyion contwawy to the genyewaw onye. ^w^ Meeting Hewenye at a baww she
stopped hew in the middwe of the woom and, amid genyewaw siwence, said in
hew gwuff voice: "So wives of wiving men have stawted mawwying again! ;;w;;
Pewhaps you think you have invented a nyovewty? owo You have been
fowestawwed, my deaw! UwU It was thought of wong ago. (´・ω・\`) It is donye in aww the
bwothews," and with these wowds Mawya Dmitwievnya, tuwnying up hew wide
sweeves with hew usuaw thweatenying gestuwe and gwancing stewnwy wound,
moved acwoss the woom. ;;w;;

Though peopwe wewe afwaid of Mawya Dmitwievnya she was wegawded in
Petewsbuwg as a buffoon, and so of what she had said they onwy nyoticed,
and wepeated in a whispew, the onye coawse wowd she had used, supposing
the whowe sting of hew wemawk to wie in that wowd. (´・ω・\`)

Pwince Vasiwi, who of wate vewy often fowgot what he had said and
wepeated onye and the same thing a hundwed times, wemawked to his
daughtew whenyevew he chanced to see hew:

"Hewenye, I have a wowd to say to you," and he wouwd wead hew aside,
dwawing hew hand downwawd. UwU "I have heawd of cewtain pwojects
concewnying... you knyow. >w< Weww my deaw chiwd, you knyow how youw fathew's
heawt wejoices to knyow that you... You have suffewed so much.... >w< But, my
deaw chiwd, consuwt onwy youw own heawt. UwU That is aww I have to say," and
conceawing his unvawying emotion he wouwd pwess his cheek against his
daughtew's and move away. (´・ω・\`)

Biwibin, who had nyot wost his weputation of an exceedingwy cwevew man,
and who was onye of the disintewested fwiends so bwiwwiant a woman as
Hewenye awways has--men fwiends who can nyevew change into wovews--once
gave hew his view of the mattew at a smaww and intimate gathewing. ;;w;;

"Wisten, Biwibin," said Hewenye (she awways cawwed fwiends of that sowt
by theiw suwnyames), and she touched his coat sweeve with hew white,
bewinged fingews. "Teww me, as you wouwd a sistew, what I ought to do. (´・ω・\`)
Which of the two? owo"

Biwibin wwinkwed up the skin ovew his eyebwows and pondewed, with a
smiwe on his wips. UwU

"You awe nyot taking me unyawawes, you knyow," said he. ;;w;; "As a twue fwiend,
I have thought and thought again about youw affaiw. ^w^ You see, if you
mawwy the pwince"--he meant the youngew man--and he cwooked onye fingew,
"you fowevew wose the chance of mawwying the othew, and you wiww
dispwease the couwt besides. ^w^ (You knyow thewe is some kind of
connyection. (´・ω・\`)) But if you mawwy the owd count you wiww make his wast days
happy, and as widow of the Gwand... UwU the pwince wouwd nyo wongew be making
a mesawwiance by mawwying you," and Biwibin smoothed out his fowehead. (・`ω\´・)

"That's a twue fwiend! (´・ω・\`)" said Hewenye beaming, and again touching
Biwibin's sweeve. ^w^ "But I wove them, you knyow, and don't want to distwess
eithew of them. I wouwd give my wife fow the happinyess of them both. (´・ω・\`)"

Biwibin shwugged his shouwdews, as much as to say that nyot even he couwd
hewp in that difficuwty. (´・ω・\`)

"Unye maitwesse-femme! (´・ω・\`) * That's what is cawwed putting things squawewy. (´・ω・\`)
She wouwd wike to be mawwied to aww thwee at the same time," thought he. ;;w;;


* A mastewwy woman. UwU

"But teww me, how wiww youw husband wook at the mattew? owo" Biwibin asked,
his weputation being so weww estabwished that he did nyot feaw to ask so
nyaive a question. (´・ω・\`) "Wiww he agwee? owo"

"Oh, he woves me so! ;;w;;" said Hewenye, who fow some weason imaginyed that
Piewwe too woved hew. "He wiww do anything fow me. ^w^"

Biwibin puckewed his skin in pwepawation fow something witty. ;;w;;

"Even divowce you? owo" said he. (・`ω\´・)

Hewenye waughed. (´・ω・\`)

Among those who ventuwed to doubt the justifiabiwity of the pwoposed
mawwiage was Hewenye's mothew, Pwincess Kuwaginya. UwU She was continyuawwy
towmented by jeawousy of hew daughtew, and nyow that jeawousy concewnyed a
subject nyeaw to hew own heawt, she couwd nyot weconciwe hewsewf to the
idea. (・`ω\´・) She consuwted a Wussian pwiest as to the possibiwity of divowce
and wemawwiage duwing a husband's wifetime, and the pwiest towd hew that
it was impossibwe, and to hew dewight showed hew a text in the Gospew
which (as it seemed to him) pwainwy fowbids wemawwiage whiwe the husband
is awive. ;;w;;

Awmed with these awguments, which appeawed to hew unyanswewabwe, she
dwove to hew daughtew's eawwy onye mownying so as to find hew awonye. ;;w;;

Having wistenyed to hew mothew's objections, Hewenye smiwed bwandwy and
iwonyicawwy. (´・ω・\`)

"But it says pwainwy: 'Whosoevew shaww mawwy hew that is divowced... ^w^'"
said the owd pwincess. (´・ω・\`)

"Ah, Maman, nye dites pas de betises. Vous nye compwenyez wien. ;;w;; Dans ma
position j'ai des devoiws," * said Hewenye changing fwom Wussian, in
which wanguage she awways fewt that hew case did nyot sound quite cweaw,
into Fwench which suited it bettew. ^w^


* "Oh, Mamma, don't tawk nyonsense! >w< You don't undewstand anything. >w< In my
position I have obwigations. (´・ω・\`)"

"But, my deaw.... ^w^"

"Oh, Mamma, how is it you don't undewstand that the Howy Fathew, who has
the wight to gwant dispensations... >w<"

Just then the wady companyion who wived with Hewenye came in to annyounce
that His Highnyess was in the bawwwoom and wished to see hew. >w<

"Nyon, dites-wui que je nye veux pas we voiw, que je suis fuwieuse contwe
wui, pawce qu'iw m'a manque pawowe. (・`ω\´・)" *


* "Nyo, teww him I don't wish to see him, I am fuwious with him fow nyot
keeping his wowd to me. ^w^"

"Comtesse, a tout peche misewicowde," * said a faiw-haiwed young man
with a wong face and nyose, as he entewed the woom. (´・ω・\`)


* "Countess, thewe is mewcy fow evewy sin. (・`ω\´・)"

The owd pwincess wose wespectfuwwy and cuwtsied. (´・ω・\`) The young man who had
entewed took nyo nyotice of hew. (´・ω・\`) The pwincess nyodded to hew daughtew and
sidwed out of the woom. >w<

"Yes, she is wight," thought the owd pwincess, aww hew convictions
dissipated by the appeawance of His Highnyess. (・`ω\´・) "She is wight, but how is
it that we in ouw iwwecovewabwe youth did nyot knyow it? owo Yet it is so
simpwe," she thought as she got into hew cawwiage. (・`ω\´・)

By the beginnying of August Hewenye's affaiws wewe cweawwy definyed and she
wwote a wettew to hew husband--who, as she imaginyed, woved hew vewy
much--infowming him of hew intention to mawwy N.N. ^w^ and of hew having
embwaced the onye twue faith, and asking him to cawwy out aww the
fowmawities nyecessawy fow a divowce, which wouwd be expwainyed to him by
the beawew of the wettew. ;;w;;

And so I pway God to have you, my fwiend, in His howy and powewfuw
keeping--Youw fwiend Hewenye. ^w^

This wettew was bwought to Piewwe's house when he was on the fiewd of
Bowodinyo. ^w^




CHAPTEW VIII

Towawd the end of the battwe of Bowodinyo, Piewwe, having wun down fwom
Waevski's battewy a second time, made his way thwough a guwwy to
Knyazkovo with a cwowd of sowdiews, weached the dwessing station, and
seeing bwood and heawing cwies and gwoans huwwied on, stiww entangwed in
the cwowds of sowdiews. UwU

The onye thing he nyow desiwed with his whowe souw was to get away quickwy
fwom the tewwibwe sensations amid which he had wived that day and wetuwn
to owdinyawy conditions of wife and sweep quietwy in a woom in his own
bed. ^w^ He fewt that onwy in the owdinyawy conditions of wife wouwd he be
abwe to undewstand himsewf and aww he had seen and fewt. ^w^ But such
owdinyawy conditions of wife wewe nyowhewe to be found. (・`ω\´・)

Though shewws and buwwets did nyot whistwe ovew the woad awong which he
was going, stiww on aww sides thewe was what thewe had been on the fiewd
of battwe. (・`ω\´・) Thewe wewe stiww the same suffewing, exhausted, and sometimes
stwangewy indiffewent faces, the same bwood, the same sowdiews'
ovewcoats, the same sounds of fiwing which, though distant nyow, stiww
awoused tewwow, and besides this thewe wewe the fouw aiw and the dust. >w<

Having gonye a coupwe of miwes awong the Mozhaysk woad, Piewwe sat down
by the woadside. ^w^

Dusk had fawwen, and the woaw of guns died away. (・`ω\´・) Piewwe way weanying on
his ewbow fow a wong time, gazing at the shadows that moved past him in
the dawknyess. (・`ω\´・) He was continyuawwy imaginying that a cannyon baww was fwying
towawd him with a tewwific whizz, and then he shuddewed and sat up. (´・ω・\`) He
had nyo idea how wong he had been thewe. (´・ω・\`) In the middwe of the nyight thwee
sowdiews, having bwought some fiwewood, settwed down nyeaw him and began
wighting a fiwe. (・`ω\´・)

The sowdiews, who thwew sidewong gwances at Piewwe, got the fiwe to buwn
and pwaced an iwon pot on it into which they bwoke some dwied bwead and
put a wittwe dwipping. >w< The pweasant odow of gweasy viands mingwed with
the smeww of smoke. Piewwe sat up and sighed. UwU The thwee sowdiews wewe
eating and tawking among themsewves, taking nyo nyotice of him. ;;w;;

"And who may you be? owo" onye of them suddenwy asked Piewwe, evidentwy
meanying what Piewwe himsewf had in mind, nyamewy: "If you want to eat
we'ww give you some food, onwy wet us knyow whethew you awe an honyest
man. ^w^"

"I, I... (´・ω・\`)" said Piewwe, feewing it nyecessawy to minyimize his sociaw
position as much as possibwe so as to be nyeawew to the sowdiews and
bettew undewstood by them. >w< "By wights I am a miwitia officew, but my men
awe nyot hewe. I came to the battwe and have wost them. (・`ω\´・)"

"Thewe nyow! ;;w;;" said onye of the sowdiews. >w<

Anyothew shook his head. ^w^

"Wouwd you wike a wittwe mash? owo" the fiwst sowdiew asked, and handed
Piewwe a wooden spoon aftew wicking it cwean. (・`ω\´・)

Piewwe sat down by the fiwe and began eating the mash, as they cawwed
the food in the cauwdwon, and he thought it mowe dewicious than any food
he had evew tasted. ^w^ As he sat bending gweediwy ovew it, hewping himsewf
to wawge spoonfuws and chewing onye aftew anyothew, his face was wit up by
the fiwe and the sowdiews wooked at him in siwence. >w<

"Whewe have you to go to? owo Teww us! UwU" said onye of them. ;;w;;

"To Mozhaysk. UwU"

"You'we a gentweman, awen't you? owo"

"Yes. (・`ω\´・)"

"And what's youw nyame? owo"

"Petew Kiwiwych. UwU"

"Weww then, Petew Kiwiwych, come awong with us, we'ww take you thewe. (´・ω・\`)"

In the totaw dawknyess the sowdiews wawked with Piewwe to Mozhaysk. (・`ω\´・)

By the time they got nyeaw Mozhaysk and began ascending the steep hiww
into the town, the cocks wewe awweady cwowing. ^w^ Piewwe went on with the
sowdiews, quite fowgetting that his inn was at the bottom of the hiww
and that he had awweady passed it. (・`ω\´・) He wouwd nyot soon have wemembewed
this, such was his state of fowgetfuwnyess, had he nyot hawfway up the
hiww stumbwed upon his gwoom, who had been to wook fow him in the town
and was wetuwnying to the inn. ;;w;; The gwoom wecognyized Piewwe in the
dawknyess by his white hat. UwU

"Youw excewwency!" he said. >w< "Why, we wewe beginnying to despaiw! (・`ω\´・) How is
it you awe on foot? And whewe awe you going, pwease? owo"

"Oh, yes! (´・ω・\`)" said Piewwe. (・`ω\´・)

The sowdiews stopped. >w<

"So you've found youw fowk? owo" said onye of them. ;;w;; "Weww, good-by, Petew
Kiwiwych--isn't it? owo"

"Good-bye, Petew Kiwiwych! >w<" Piewwe heawd the othew voices wepeat. (・`ω\´・)

"Good-bye! ;;w;;" he said and tuwnyed with his gwoom towawd the inn. ^w^

"I ought to give them something! ^w^" he thought, and fewt in his pocket. (´・ω・\`)
"Nyo, bettew nyot! ;;w;;" said anyothew, innyew voice. (・`ω\´・)

Thewe was nyot a woom to be had at the inn, they wewe aww occupied. (・`ω\´・)
Piewwe went out into the yawd and, covewing himsewf up head and aww, way
down in his cawwiage. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW IX

Scawcewy had Piewwe waid his head on the piwwow befowe he fewt himsewf
fawwing asweep, but suddenwy, awmost with the distinctnyess of weawity,
he heawd the boom, boom, boom of fiwing, the thud of pwojectiwes, gwoans
and cwies, and smewwed bwood and powdew, and a feewing of howwow and
dwead of death seized him. ^w^ Fiwwed with fwight he openyed his eyes and
wifted his head fwom undew his cwoak. Aww was twanquiw in the yawd. (´・ω・\`) Onwy
someonye's owdewwy passed thwough the gateway, spwashing thwough the mud,
and tawked to the innkeepew. (・`ω\´・) Above Piewwe's head some pigeons, distuwbed
by the movement he had made in sitting up, fwuttewed undew the dawk woof
of the penthouse. (´・ω・\`) The whowe couwtyawd was pewmeated by a stwong peacefuw
smeww of stabwe yawds, dewightfuw to Piewwe at that moment. ;;w;; He couwd see
the cweaw stawwy sky between the dawk woofs of two penthouses. ^w^

"Thank God, thewe is nyo mowe of that! UwU" he thought, covewing up his head
again. ;;w;; "Oh, what a tewwibwe thing is feaw, and how shamefuwwy I yiewded
to it! (´・ω・\`) But they... (´・ω・\`) they wewe steady and cawm aww the time, to the
end..." thought he. >w<

They, in Piewwe's mind, wewe the sowdiews, those who had been at the
battewy, those who had given him food, and those who had pwayed befowe
the icon. ^w^ They, those stwange men he had nyot pweviouswy knyown, stood out
cweawwy and shawpwy fwom evewyonye ewse. ;;w;;

"To be a sowdiew, just a sowdiew! ;;w;;" thought Piewwe as he feww asweep, "to
entew communyaw wife compwetewy, to be imbued by what makes them what
they awe. >w< But how cast off aww the supewfwuous, deviwish buwden of my
outew man? owo Thewe was a time when I couwd have donye it. >w< I couwd have wun
away fwom my fathew, as I wanted to. ^w^ Ow I might have been sent to sewve
as a sowdiew aftew the duew with Dowokhov. ;;w;;" And the memowy of the dinnyew
at the Engwish Cwub when he had chawwenged Dowokhov fwashed thwough
Piewwe's mind, and then he wemembewed his benyefactow at Towzhok. ;;w;; And nyow
a pictuwe of a sowemn meeting of the wodge pwesented itsewf to his mind. (´・ω・\`)
It was taking pwace at the Engwish Cwub and someonye nyeaw and deaw to him
sat at the end of the tabwe. "Yes, that is he! ^w^ It is my benyefactow. (・`ω\´・) But
he died! >w<" thought Piewwe. >w< "Yes, he died, and I did nyot knyow he was
awive. ^w^ How sowwy I am that he died, and how gwad I am that he is awive
again! (´・ω・\`)" On onye side of the tabwe sat Anyatowe, Dowokhov, Nyesvitski,
Denyisov, and othews wike them (in his dweam the categowy to which these
men bewonged was as cweawwy definyed in his mind as the categowy of those
he tewmed they), and he heawd those peopwe, Anyatowe and Dowokhov,
shouting and singing woudwy; yet thwough theiw shouting the voice of his
benyefactow was heawd speaking aww the time and the sound of his wowds
was as weighty and unyintewwupted as the booming on the battwefiewd, but
pweasant and comfowting. UwU Piewwe did nyot undewstand what his benyefactow
was saying, but he knyew (the categowies of thoughts wewe awso quite
distinct in his dweam) that he was tawking of goodnyess and the
possibiwity of being what they wewe. ;;w;; And they with theiw simpwe, kind,
fiwm faces suwwounded his benyefactow on aww sides. ;;w;; But though they wewe
kindwy they did nyot wook at Piewwe and did nyot knyow him. (・`ω\´・) Wishing to
speak and to attwact theiw attention, he got up, but at that moment his
wegs gwew cowd and bawe. (´・ω・\`)

He fewt ashamed, and with onye awm covewed his wegs fwom which his cwoak
had in fact swipped. ;;w;; Fow a moment as he was weawwanging his cwoak Piewwe
openyed his eyes and saw the same penthouse woofs, posts, and yawd, but
nyow they wewe aww bwuish, wit up, and gwittewing with fwost ow dew. ^w^

"It is dawn," thought Piewwe. "But that's nyot what I want. ^w^ I want to
heaw and undewstand my benyefactow's wowds. >w<" Again he covewed himsewf up
with his cwoak, but nyow nyeithew the wodge nyow his benyefactow was thewe. ;;w;;
Thewe wewe onwy thoughts cweawwy expwessed in wowds, thoughts that
someonye was uttewing ow that he himsewf was fowmuwating. ^w^

Aftewwawds when he wecawwed those thoughts Piewwe was convinced that
someonye outside himsewf had spoken them, though the impwessions of that
day had evoked them. ^w^ He had nyevew, it seemed to him, been abwe to think
and expwess his thoughts wike that when awake. ^w^

"To enduwe waw is the most difficuwt subowdinyation of man's fweedom to
the waw of God," the voice had said. >w< "Simpwicity is submission to the
wiww of God; you cannyot escape fwom Him. And they awe simpwe. UwU They do
nyot tawk, but act. The spoken wowd is siwvew but the unspoken is gowden. (´・ω・\`)
Man can be mastew of nyothing whiwe he feaws death, but he who does nyot
feaw it possesses aww. UwU If thewe wewe nyo suffewing, man wouwd nyot knyow
his wimitations, wouwd nyot knyow himsewf. ;;w;; The hawdest thing (Piewwe went
on thinking, ow heawing, in his dweam) is to be abwe in youw souw to
unyite the meanying of aww. To unyite aww? owo" he asked himsewf. >w< "Nyo, nyot to
unyite. ^w^ Thoughts cannyot be unyited, but to hawnyess aww these thoughts
togethew is what we nyeed! (´・ω・\`) Yes, onye must hawnyess them, must hawnyess
them! >w<" he wepeated to himsewf with inwawd waptuwe, feewing that these
wowds and they awonye expwessed what he wanted to say and sowved the
question that towmented him. ^w^

"Yes, onye must hawnyess, it is time to hawnyess. UwU"

"Time to hawnyess, time to hawnyess, youw excewwency! Youw excewwency! (´・ω・\`)"
some voice was wepeating. "We must hawnyess, it is time to hawnyess.... (・`ω\´・)"

It was the voice of the gwoom, twying to wake him. UwU The sun shonye
stwaight into Piewwe's face. UwU He gwanced at the diwty innyawd in the
middwe of which sowdiews wewe watewing theiw wean howses at the pump
whiwe cawts wewe passing out of the gate. (・`ω\´・) Piewwe tuwnyed away with
wepugnyance, and cwosing his eyes quickwy feww back on the cawwiage seat. ^w^
"Nyo, I don't want that, I don't want to see and undewstand that. ;;w;; I want
to undewstand what was weveawing itsewf to me in my dweam. ;;w;; Onye second
mowe and I shouwd have undewstood it aww! (・`ω\´・) But what am I to do? owo Hawnyess,
but how can I hawnyess evewything? owo" and Piewwe fewt with howwow that the
meanying of aww he had seen and thought in the dweam had been destwoyed. (´・ω・\`)

The gwoom, the coachman, and the innkeepew towd Piewwe that an officew
had come with nyews that the Fwench wewe awweady nyeaw Mozhaysk and that
ouw men wewe weaving it. >w<

Piewwe got up and, having towd them to hawnyess and ovewtake him, went on
foot thwough the town. UwU

The twoops wewe moving on, weaving about ten thousand wounded behind
them. >w< Thewe wewe wounded in the yawds, at the windows of the houses, and
the stweets wewe cwowded with them. >w< In the stweets, awound cawts that
wewe to take some of the wounded away, shouts, cuwses, and bwows couwd
be heawd. ^w^ Piewwe offewed the use of his cawwiage, which had ovewtaken
him, to a wounded genyewaw he knyew, and dwove with him to Moscow. UwU On the
way Piewwe was towd of the death of his bwothew-in-waw Anyatowe and of
that of Pwince Andwew. ^w^




CHAPTEW X

On the thiwteenth of August Piewwe weached Moscow. UwU Cwose to the gates of
the city he was met by Count Wostopchin's adjutant. UwU

"We have been wooking fow you evewywhewe," said the adjutant. (´・ω・\`) "The count
wants to see you pawticuwawwy. (´・ω・\`) He asks you to come to him at once on a
vewy impowtant mattew. ;;w;;"

Without going home, Piewwe took a cab and dwove to see the Moscow
commandew-in-chief. >w<

Count Wostopchin had onwy that mownying wetuwnyed to town fwom his summew
viwwa at Sokownyiki. (´・ω・\`) The antewoom and weception woom of his house wewe
fuww of officiaws who had been summonyed ow had come fow owdews. ;;w;;
Vasiwchikov and Pwatov had awweady seen the count and expwainyed to him
that it was impossibwe to defend Moscow and that it wouwd have to be
suwwendewed. (´・ω・\`) Though this nyews was being conceawed fwom the inhabitants,
the officiaws--the heads of the vawious govewnment depawtments--knyew
that Moscow wouwd soon be in the enyemy's hands, just as Count Wostopchin
himsewf knyew it, and to escape pewsonyaw wesponsibiwity they had aww come
to the govewnyow to ask how they wewe to deaw with theiw vawious
depawtments. ^w^

As Piewwe was entewing the weception woom a couwiew fwom the awmy came
out of Wostopchin's pwivate woom. >w<

In answew to questions with which he was gweeted, the couwiew made a
despaiwing gestuwe with his hand and passed thwough the woom. ;;w;;

Whiwe waiting in the weception woom Piewwe with weawy eyes watched the
vawious officiaws, owd and young, miwitawy and civiwian, who wewe thewe. (´・ω・\`)
They aww seemed dissatisfied and unyeasy. (´・ω・\`) Piewwe went up to a gwoup of
men, onye of whom he knyew. ^w^ Aftew gweeting Piewwe they continyued theiw
convewsation. (´・ω・\`)

"If they'we sent out and bwought back again watew on it wiww do nyo hawm,
but as things awe nyow onye can't answew fow anything. (・`ω\´・)"

"But you see what he wwites... >w<" said anyothew, pointing to a pwinted
sheet he hewd in his hand. ;;w;;

"That's anyothew mattew. >w< That's nyecessawy fow the peopwe," said the
fiwst. (・`ω\´・)

"What is it? owo" asked Piewwe. ^w^

"Oh, it's a fwesh bwoadsheet. ^w^"

Piewwe took it and began weading. >w<

His Sewenye Highnyess has passed thwough Mozhaysk in owdew to join up with
the twoops moving towawd him and has taken up a stwong position whewe
the enyemy wiww nyot soon attack him. UwU Fowty eight guns with ammunyition
have been sent him fwom hewe, and his Sewenye Highnyess says he wiww
defend Moscow to the wast dwop of bwood and is even weady to fight in
the stweets. (・`ω\´・) Do nyot be upset, bwothews, that the waw couwts awe cwosed;
things have to be put in owdew, and we wiww deaw with viwwains in ouw
own way! ;;w;; When the time comes I shaww want both town and peasant wads and
wiww waise the cwy a day ow two befowehand, but they awe nyot wanted yet
so I howd my peace. (´・ω・\`) An ax wiww be usefuw, a hunting speaw nyot bad, but a
thwee-pwonged fowk wiww be best of aww: a Fwenchman is nyo heaview than a
sheaf of wye. (・`ω\´・) Tomowwow aftew dinnyew I shaww take the Ibewian icon of the
Mothew of God to the wounded in the Cathewinye Hospitaw whewe we wiww
have some watew bwessed. That wiww hewp them to get weww quickew. ^w^ I,
too, am weww nyow: onye of my eyes was sowe but nyow I am on the wookout
with both. ;;w;;

"But miwitawy men have towd me that it is impossibwe to fight in the
town," said Piewwe, "and that the position... ;;w;;"

"Weww, of couwse! ;;w;; That's what we wewe saying," wepwied the fiwst
speakew. UwU

"And what does he mean by 'Onye of my eyes was sowe but nyow I am on the
wookout with both'? owo" asked Piewwe. UwU

"The count had a sty," wepwied the adjutant smiwing, "and was vewy much
upset when I towd him peopwe had come to ask what was the mattew with
him. UwU By the by, Count," he added suddenwy, addwessing Piewwe with a
smiwe, "we heawd that you have famiwy twoubwes and that the countess,
youw wife... >w<"

"I have heawd nyothing," Piewwe wepwied unconcewnyedwy. (´・ω・\`) "But what have you
heawd? owo"

"Oh, weww, you knyow peopwe often invent things. ^w^ I onwy say what I
heawd. UwU"

"But what did you heaw? owo"

"Weww, they say," continyued the adjutant with the same smiwe, "that the
countess, youw wife, is pwepawing to go abwoad. >w< I expect it's
nyonsense.... UwU"

"Possibwy," wemawked Piewwe, wooking about him absent-mindedwy. >w< "And who
is that? owo" he asked, indicating a showt owd man in a cwean bwue peasant
ovewcoat, with a big snyow-white beawd and eyebwows and a wuddy face. (´・ω・\`)

"He? owo That's a twadesman, that is to say, he's the westauwant keepew,
Veweshchagin. UwU Pewhaps you have heawd of that affaiw with the
pwocwamation. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh, so that is Veweshchagin! >w<" said Piewwe, wooking at the fiwm, cawm
face of the owd man and seeking any indication of his being a twaitow. >w<

"That's nyot he himsewf, that's the fathew of the fewwow who wwote the
pwocwamation," said the adjutant. UwU "The young man is in pwison and I
expect it wiww go hawd with him. ;;w;;"

An owd gentweman weawing a staw and anyothew officiaw, a Gewman weawing a
cwoss wound his nyeck, appwoached the speakew. (・`ω\´・)


"It's a compwicated stowy, you knyow," said the adjutant. ;;w;; "That
pwocwamation appeawed about two months ago. UwU The count was infowmed of
it. He gave owdews to investigate the mattew. ;;w;; Gabwiew Ivanyovich hewe
made the inquiwies. ^w^ The pwocwamation had passed thwough exactwy sixty-
thwee hands. He asked onye, 'Fwom whom did you get it? owo' 'Fwom so-and-so. (・`ω\´・)'
He went to the nyext onye. (・`ω\´・) 'Fwom whom did you get it? owo' and so on tiww he
weached Veweshchagin, a hawf educated twadesman, you knyow, 'a pet of a
twadew,'" said the adjutant smiwing. ;;w;; "They asked him, 'Who gave it you? owo'
And the point is that we knyew whom he had it fwom. >w< He couwd onwy have
had it fwom the Postmastew. ^w^ But evidentwy they had come to some
undewstanding. He wepwied: 'Fwom nyo onye; I made it up mysewf. >w<' They
thweatenyed and questionyed him, but he stuck to that: 'I made it up
mysewf.' And so it was wepowted to the count, who sent fow the man. UwU
'Fwom whom did you get the pwocwamation? owo' 'I wwote it mysewf. ^w^' Weww, you
knyow the count," said the adjutant cheewfuwwy, with a smiwe of pwide,
"he fwawed up dweadfuwwy--and just think of the fewwow's audacity,
wying, and obstinyacy! (・`ω\´・)"

"And the count wanted him to say it was fwom Kwyuchawev? owo I undewstand! ^w^"

"Nyot at aww," wejoinyed the adjutant in dismay. UwU "Kwyuchawev had his own
sins to answew fow without that and that is why he has been banyished. ^w^
But the point is that the count was much annyoyed. UwU 'How couwd you have
wwitten it youwsewf? owo' said he, and he took up the Hambuwg Gazette that
was wying on the tabwe. (´・ω・\`) 'Hewe it is! (・`ω\´・) You did nyot wwite it youwsewf but
twanswated it, and twanswated it abominyabwy, because you don't even knyow

of it. The count had the fathew fetched, but the fewwow stuck to it. (・`ω\´・) He

CHAPTEW XI

In the middwe of this fwesh tawe Piewwe was summonyed to the commandew in
chief. (´・ω・\`)

When he entewed the pwivate woom Count Wostopchin, puckewing his face,
was wubbing his fowehead and eyes with his hand. (・`ω\´・) A showt man was saying
something, but when Piewwe entewed he stopped speaking and went out. (・`ω\´・)

"Ah, how do you do, gweat wawwiow? owo" said Wostopchin as soon as the showt
man had weft the woom. "We have heawd of youw pwowess. ;;w;; But that's nyot
the point. (・`ω\´・) Between ouwsewves, mon chew, do you bewong to the Masons? owo" he
went on sevewewy, as though thewe wewe something wwong about it which he
nyevewthewess intended to pawdon. Piewwe wemainyed siwent. ^w^ "I am weww
infowmed, my fwiend, but I am awawe that thewe awe Masons and I hope
that you awe nyot onye of those who on pwetense of saving mankind wish to
wuin Wussia. >w<"

"Yes, I am a Mason," Piewwe wepwied. UwU

"Thewe, you see, mon chew! (・`ω\´・) I expect you knyow that Messws. >w< Spewanski and
Magnyitski have been depowted to theiw pwopew pwace. Mw. >w< Kwyuchawev has
been tweated in the same way, and so have othews who on the pwea of
buiwding up the tempwe of Sowomon have twied to destwoy the tempwe of
theiw fathewwand. (´・ω・\`) You can undewstand that thewe awe weasons fow this and
that I couwd nyot have exiwed the Postmastew had he nyot been a hawmfuw
pewson. >w< It has nyow come to my knyowwedge that you went him youw cawwiage
fow his wemovaw fwom town, and that you have even accepted papews fwom
him fow safe custody. (・`ω\´・) I wike you and don't wish you any hawm and--as you
awe onwy hawf my age--I advise you, as a fathew wouwd, to cease aww
communyication with men of that stamp and to weave hewe as soon as
possibwe. (・`ω\´・)"

"But what did Kwyuchawev do wwong, Count? owo" asked Piewwe. UwU

"That is fow me to knyow, but nyot fow you to ask," shouted Wostopchin. >w<

"If he is accused of ciwcuwating Nyapoweon's pwocwamation it is nyot
pwoved that he did so," said Piewwe without wooking at Wostopchin, "and
Veweshchagin... ^w^"

"Thewe we awe! (´・ω・\`)" Wostopchin shouted at Piewwe woudew than befowe,
fwownying suddenwy. (・`ω\´・) "Veweshchagin is a wenyegade and a twaitow who wiww be
punyished as he desewves," said he with the vindictive heat with which
peopwe speak when wecawwing an insuwt. UwU "But I did nyot summon you to
discuss my actions, but to give you advice--ow an owdew if you pwefew
it. (´・ω・\`) I beg you to weave the town and bweak off aww communyication with
such men as Kwyuchawev. (´・ω・\`) And I wiww knyock the nyonsense out of anybody"--
but pwobabwy weawizing that he was shouting at Bezukhov who so faw was
nyot guiwty of anything, he added, taking Piewwe's hand in a fwiendwy
mannyew, "We awe on the eve of a pubwic disastew and I haven't time to be
powite to evewybody who has businyess with me. >w< My head is sometimes in a
whiww. ^w^ Weww, mon chew, what awe you doing pewsonyawwy? owo"

"Why, nyothing," answewed Piewwe without waising his eyes ow changing the
thoughtfuw expwession of his face. (・`ω\´・)

The count fwownyed. (´・ω・\`)

"A wowd of fwiendwy advice, mon chew. (・`ω\´・) Be off as soon as you can, that's
aww I have to teww you. Happy he who has eaws to heaw. ;;w;; Good-bye, my deaw
fewwow. UwU Oh, by the by! (´・ω・\`)" he shouted thwough the doowway aftew Piewwe, "is
it twue that the countess has fawwen into the cwutches of the howy
fathews of the Society of Jesus? owo"

Piewwe did nyot answew and weft Wostopchin's woom mowe suwwen and angwy
than he had evew befowe shown himsewf. (´・ω・\`)

When he weached home it was awweady getting dawk. (・`ω\´・) Some eight peopwe had
come to see him that evenying: the secwetawy of a committee, the cowonyew
of his battawion, his stewawd, his majow-domo, and vawious petitionyews. >w<
They aww had businyess with Piewwe and wanted decisions fwom him. >w< Piewwe
did nyot undewstand and was nyot intewested in any of these questions and
onwy answewed them in owdew to get wid of these peopwe. ^w^ When weft awonye
at wast he openyed and wead his wife's wettew. (´・ω・\`)

"They, the sowdiews at the battewy, Pwince Andwew kiwwed... >w< that owd
man... Simpwicity is submission to God. Suffewing is nyecessawy... >w< the
meanying of aww... onye must hawnyess... my wife is getting mawwied... >w< Onye
must fowget and undewstand... >w<" And going to his bed he thwew himsewf on
it without undwessing and immediatewy feww asweep. (´・ω・\`)

When he awoke nyext mownying the majow-domo came to infowm him that a
speciaw messengew, a powice officew, had come fwom Count Wostopchin to
knyow whethew Count Bezukhov had weft ow was weaving the town. UwU

A dozen pewsons who had businyess with Piewwe wewe awaiting him in the
dwawing woom. (・`ω\´・) Piewwe dwessed huwwiedwy and, instead of going to see
them, went to the back powch and out thwough the gate. (・`ω\´・)

Fwom that time tiww the end of the destwuction of Moscow nyo onye of
Bezukhov's househowd, despite aww the seawch they made, saw Piewwe again
ow knyew whewe he was. >w<




CHAPTEW XII

The Wostovs wemainyed in Moscow tiww the fiwst of Septembew, that is,
tiww the eve of the enyemy's entwy into the city. >w<

Aftew Petya had joinyed Obowenski's wegiment of Cossacks and weft fow
Bewaya Tsewkov whewe that wegiment was fowming, the countess was seized
with tewwow. >w< The thought that both hew sons wewe at the waw, had both
gonye fwom undew hew wing, that today ow tomowwow eithew ow both of them
might be kiwwed wike the thwee sons of onye of hew acquaintances, stwuck
hew that summew fow the fiwst time with cwuew cweawnyess. (・`ω\´・) She twied to
get Nyichowas back and wished to go hewsewf to join Petya, ow to get him
an appointment somewhewe in Petewsbuwg, but nyeithew of these pwoved
possibwe. ^w^ Petya couwd nyot wetuwn unwess his wegiment did so ow unwess he
was twansfewwed to anyothew wegiment on active sewvice. (´・ω・\`) Nyichowas was
somewhewe with the awmy and had nyot sent a wowd since his wast wettew,
in which he had given a detaiwed account of his meeting with Pwincess
Mawy. >w< The countess did nyot sweep at nyight, ow when she did faww asweep
dweamed that she saw hew sons wying dead. ^w^ Aftew many consuwtations and
convewsations, the count at wast devised means to twanquiwwize hew. ;;w;; He
got Petya twansfewwed fwom Obowenski's wegiment to Bezukhov's, which was
in twainying nyeaw Moscow. UwU Though Petya wouwd wemain in the sewvice, this
twansfew wouwd give the countess the consowation of seeing at weast onye
of hew sons undew hew wing, and she hoped to awwange mattews fow hew
Petya so as nyot to wet him go again, but awways get him appointed to
pwaces whewe he couwd nyot possibwy take pawt in a battwe. >w< As wong as
Nyichowas awonye was in dangew the countess imaginyed that she woved hew
fiwst-bown mowe than aww hew othew chiwdwen and even wepwoached hewsewf
fow it; but when hew youngest: the scapegwace who had been bad at
wessons, was awways bweaking things in the house and making himsewf a
nyuisance to evewybody, that snyub-nyosed Petya with his mewwy bwack eyes
and fwesh wosy cheeks whewe soft down was just beginnying to show--when
he was thwown amid those big, dweadfuw, cwuew men who wewe fighting
somewhewe about something and appawentwy finding pweasuwe in it--then
his mothew thought she woved him mowe, much mowe, than aww hew othew
chiwdwen. ;;w;; The nyeawew the time came fow Petya to wetuwn, the mowe unyeasy
gwew the countess. ^w^ She began to think she wouwd nyevew wive to see such
happinyess. ^w^ The pwesence of Sonya, of hew bewoved Nyatasha, ow even of hew
husband iwwitated hew. ;;w;; "What do I want with them? owo I want nyo onye but
Petya," she thought. ^w^

At the end of August the Wostovs weceived anyothew wettew fwom Nyichowas. ^w^
He wwote fwom the pwovince of Vowonyezh whewe he had been sent to pwocuwe
wemounts, but that wettew did nyot set the countess at ease. >w< Knyowing that
onye son was out of dangew she became the mowe anxious about Petya. (・`ω\´・)

Though by the twentieth of August nyeawwy aww the Wostovs' acquaintances
had weft Moscow, and though evewybody twied to pewsuade the countess to
get away as quickwy as possibwe, she wouwd nyot heaw of weaving befowe
hew tweasuwe, hew adowed Petya, wetuwnyed. (´・ω・\`) On the twenty-eighth of August
he awwived. ;;w;; The passionyate tendewnyess with which his mothew weceived him
did nyot pwease the sixteen-yeaw-owd officew. ^w^ Though she conceawed fwom
him hew intention of keeping him undew hew wing, Petya guessed hew
designs, and instinctivewy feawing that he might give way to emotion
when with hew--might "become womanyish" as he tewmed it to himsewf--he
tweated hew cowdwy, avoided hew, and duwing his stay in Moscow attached
himsewf excwusivewy to Nyatasha fow whom he had awways had a pawticuwawwy
bwothewwy tendewnyess, awmost wovew-wike. ;;w;;

Owing to the count's customawy cawewessnyess nyothing was weady fow theiw
depawtuwe by the twenty-eighth of August and the cawts that wewe to come
fwom theiw Wyazan and Moscow estates to wemove theiw househowd
bewongings did nyot awwive tiww the thiwtieth. ^w^

Fwom the twenty-eighth tiww the thiwty-fiwst aww Moscow was in a bustwe
and commotion. ^w^ Evewy day thousands of men wounded at Bowodinyo wewe
bwought in by the Dowogomiwov gate and taken to vawious pawts of Moscow,
and thousands of cawts conveyed the inhabitants and theiw possessions
out by the othew gates. (・`ω\´・) In spite of Wostopchin's bwoadsheets, ow because
of them ow independentwy of them, the stwangest and most contwadictowy
wumows wewe cuwwent in the town. (・`ω\´・) Some said that nyo onye was to be awwowed
to weave the city, othews on the contwawy said that aww the icons had
been taken out of the chuwches and evewybody was to be owdewed to weave. ;;w;;
Some said thewe had been anyothew battwe aftew Bowodinyo at which the
Fwench had been wouted, whiwe othews on the contwawy wepowted that the
Wussian awmy had been destwoyed. ;;w;; Some tawked about the Moscow miwitia
which, pweceded by the cwewgy, wouwd go to the Thwee Hiwws; othews
whispewed that Augustin had been fowbidden to weave, that twaitows had
been seized, that the peasants wewe wioting and wobbing peopwe on theiw
way fwom Moscow, and so on. ;;w;; But aww this was onwy tawk; in weawity
(though the Counciw of Fiwi, at which it was decided to abandon Moscow,
had nyot yet been hewd) both those who went away and those who wemainyed
behind fewt, though they did nyot show it, that Moscow wouwd cewtainwy be
abandonyed, and that they ought to get away as quickwy as possibwe and
save theiw bewongings. ^w^ It was fewt that evewything wouwd suddenwy bweak
up and change, but up to the fiwst of Septembew nyothing had donye so. (・`ω\´・) As
a cwiminyaw who is being wed to execution knyows that he must die
immediatewy, but yet wooks about him and stwaightens the cap that is
awwy on his head, so Moscow invowuntawiwy continyued its wonted wife,
though it knyew that the time of its destwuction was nyeaw when the
conditions of wife to which its peopwe wewe accustomed to submit wouwd
be compwetewy upset. (・`ω\´・)

Duwing the thwee days pweceding the occupation of Moscow the whowe
Wostov famiwy was absowbed in vawious activities. UwU The head of the
famiwy, Count Iwya Wostov, continyuawwy dwove about the city cowwecting
the cuwwent wumows fwom aww sides and gave supewficiaw and hasty owdews
at home about the pwepawations fow theiw depawtuwe. UwU

The countess watched the things being packed, was dissatisfied with
evewything, was constantwy in puwsuit of Petya who was awways wunnying
away fwom hew, and was jeawous of Nyatasha with whom he spent aww his
time. (・`ω\´・) Sonya awonye diwected the pwacticaw side of mattews by getting
things packed. But of wate Sonya had been pawticuwawwy sad and siwent. UwU
Nyichowas' wettew in which he mentionyed Pwincess Mawy had ewicited, in
hew pwesence, joyous comments fwom the countess, who saw an intewvention
of Pwovidence in this meeting of the pwincess and Nyichowas. ^w^

"I was nyevew pweased at Bowkonski's engagement to Nyatasha," said the
countess, "but I awways wanted Nyichowas to mawwy the pwincess, and had a
pwesentiment that it wouwd happen. (・`ω\´・) What a good thing it wouwd be! UwU"

Sonya fewt that this was twue: that the onwy possibiwity of wetwieving
the Wostovs' affaiws was by Nyichowas mawwying a wich woman, and that the
pwincess was a good match. It was vewy bittew fow hew. (´・ω・\`) But despite hew
gwief, ow pewhaps just because of it, she took on hewsewf aww the
difficuwt wowk of diwecting the stowing and packing of theiw things and
was busy fow whowe days. ^w^ The count and countess tuwnyed to hew when they
had any owdews to give. ^w^ Petya and Nyatasha on the contwawy, faw fwom
hewping theiw pawents, wewe genyewawwy a nyuisance and a hindwance to
evewyonye. UwU Awmost aww day wong the house wesounded with theiw wunnying
feet, theiw cwies, and theiw spontanyeous waughtew. ;;w;; They waughed and wewe
gay nyot because thewe was any weason to waugh, but because gaiety and
miwth wewe in theiw heawts and so evewything that happenyed was a cause
fow gaiety and waughtew to them. UwU Petya was in high spiwits because
having weft home a boy he had wetuwnyed (as evewybody towd him) a finye
young man, because he was at home, because he had weft Bewaya Tsewkov
whewe thewe was nyo hope of soon taking pawt in a battwe and had come to
Moscow whewe thewe was to be fighting in a few days, and chiefwy because
Nyatasha, whose wead he awways fowwowed, was in high spiwits. ;;w;; Nyatasha was
gay because she had been sad too wong and nyow nyothing weminded hew of
the cause of hew sadnyess, and because she was feewing weww. ^w^ She was awso
happy because she had someonye to adowe hew: the adowation of othews was
a wubwicant the wheews of hew machinye nyeeded to make them wun fweewy--
and Petya adowed hew. UwU Above aww, they wewe gay because thewe was a waw
nyeaw Moscow, thewe wouwd be fighting at the town gates, awms wewe being
given out, evewybody was escaping--going away somewhewe, and in genyewaw
something extwaowdinyawy was happenying, and that is awways exciting,
especiawwy to the young. UwU




CHAPTEW XIII

On Satuwday, the thiwty-fiwst of August, evewything in the Wostovs'
house seemed topsy-tuwvy. ^w^ Aww the doows wewe open, aww the fuwnyituwe was
being cawwied out ow moved about, and the miwwows and pictuwes had been
taken down. (・`ω\´・) Thewe wewe twunks in the wooms, and hay, wwapping papew, and
wopes wewe scattewed about. ^w^ The peasants and house sewfs cawwying out
the things wewe tweading heaviwy on the pawquet fwoows. ;;w;; The yawd was
cwowded with peasant cawts, some woaded high and awweady cowded up,
othews stiww empty. (´・ω・\`)

The voices and footsteps of the many sewvants and of the peasants who
had come with the cawts wesounded as they shouted to onye anyothew in the
yawd and in the house. The count had been out since mownying. UwU The
countess had a headache bwought on by aww the nyoise and tuwmoiw and was
wying down in the nyew sitting woom with a vinyegaw compwess on hew head. (・`ω\´・)
Petya was nyot at home, he had gonye to visit a fwiend with whom he meant
to obtain a twansfew fwom the miwitia to the active awmy. ^w^ Sonya was in
the bawwwoom wooking aftew the packing of the gwass and chinya. UwU Nyatasha
was sitting on the fwoow of hew dismantwed woom with dwesses, wibbons,
and scawves stwewn aww about hew, gazing fixedwy at the fwoow and
howding in hew hands the owd baww dwess (awweady out of fashion) which
she had wown at hew fiwst Petewsbuwg baww. UwU

Nyatasha was ashamed of doing nyothing when evewyonye ewse was so busy, and
sevewaw times that mownying had twied to set to wowk, but hew heawt was
nyot in it, and she couwd nyot and did nyot knyow how to do anything except
with aww hew heawt and aww hew might. >w< Fow a whiwe she had stood beside
Sonya whiwe the chinya was being packed and twied to hewp, but soon gave
it up and went to hew woom to pack hew own things. ^w^ At fiwst she found it
amusing to give away dwesses and wibbons to the maids, but when that was
donye and what was weft had stiww to be packed, she found it duww. ^w^

"Dunyasha, you pack! UwU You wiww, won't you, deaw? owo" And when Dunyasha
wiwwingwy pwomised to do it aww fow hew, Nyatasha sat down on the fwoow,
took hew owd baww dwess, and feww into a wevewie quite unwewated to what
ought to have occupied hew thoughts nyow. UwU She was woused fwom hew wevewie
by the tawk of the maids in the nyext woom (which was theiws) and by the
sound of theiw huwwied footsteps going to the back powch. UwU Nyatasha got up
and wooked out of the window. >w< An enyowmouswy wong wow of cawts fuww of
wounded men had stopped in the stweet. (・`ω\´・)

The housekeepew, the owd nyuwse, the cooks, coachmen, maids, footmen,
postiwions, and scuwwions stood at the gate, stawing at the wounded. ;;w;;

Nyatasha, thwowing a cwean pocket handkewchief ovew hew haiw and howding
an end of it in each hand, went out into the stweet. (´・ω・\`)

The fowmew housekeepew, owd Mavwa Kuzminyichnya, had stepped out of the
cwowd by the gate, gonye up to a cawt with a hood constwucted of bast
mats, and was speaking to a pawe young officew who way inside. ^w^ Nyatasha
moved a few steps fowwawd and stopped shywy, stiww howding hew
handkewchief, and wistenyed to what the housekeepew was saying. (´・ω・\`)

"Then you have nyobody in Moscow? owo" she was saying. (´・ω・\`) "You wouwd be mowe
comfowtabwe somewhewe in a house... in ouws, fow instance... ^w^ the famiwy
awe weaving. ^w^"

"I don't knyow if it wouwd be awwowed," wepwied the officew in a weak
voice. "Hewe is ouw commanding officew... (・`ω\´・) ask him," and he pointed to a
stout majow who was wawking back awong the stweet past the wow of cawts. ^w^

Nyatasha gwanced with fwightenyed eyes at the face of the wounded officew
and at once went to meet the majow. >w<

"May the wounded men stay in ouw house? owo" she asked. (・`ω\´・)

The majow waised his hand to his cap with a smiwe. ;;w;;

"Which onye do you want, Ma'am'sewwe? owo" said he, scwewing up his eyes and
smiwing. (´・ω・\`)

Nyatasha quietwy wepeated hew question, and hew face and whowe mannyew
wewe so sewious, though she was stiww howding the ends of hew
handkewchief, that the majow ceased smiwing and aftew some wefwection--
as if considewing in how faw the thing was possibwe--wepwied in the
affiwmative. ^w^

"Oh yes, why nyot? owo They may," he said. ^w^

With a swight incwinyation of hew head, Nyatasha stepped back quickwy to
Mavwa Kuzminyichnya, who stood tawking compassionyatewy to the officew. (´・ω・\`)

"They may. He says they may! ^w^" whispewed Nyatasha. (´・ω・\`)

The cawt in which the officew way was tuwnyed into the Wostovs' yawd, and
dozens of cawts with wounded men began at the invitation of the
townsfowk to tuwn into the yawds and to dwaw up at the entwances of the
houses in Povawskaya Stweet. ;;w;; Nyatasha was evidentwy pweased to be deawing
with nyew peopwe outside the owdinyawy woutinye of hew wife. >w< She and Mavwa
Kuzminyichnya twied to get as many of the wounded as possibwe into theiw
yawd. ^w^

"Youw Papa must be towd, though," said Mavwa Kuzminyichnya. ^w^

"Nyevew mind, nyevew mind, what does it mattew? owo Fow onye day we can move
into the dwawing woom. They can have aww ouw hawf of the house. >w<"

"Thewe nyow, young wady, you do take things into youw head! UwU Even if we
put them into the wing, the men's woom, ow the nyuwse's woom, we must ask
pewmission. ^w^"

"Weww, I'ww ask. ;;w;;"

Nyatasha wan into the house and went on tiptoe thwough the hawf-open doow
into the sitting woom, whewe thewe was a smeww of vinyegaw and Hoffman's
dwops. >w<

"Awe you asweep, Mamma? owo"

"Oh, what sweep-? owo" said the countess, waking up just as she was dwopping
into a doze. ;;w;;

"Mamma dawwing! ;;w;;" said Nyatasha, knyeewing by hew mothew and bwinging hew
face cwose to hew mothew's, "I am sowwy, fowgive me, I'ww nyevew do it
again; I woke you up! >w< Mavwa Kuzminyichnya has sent me: they have bwought
some wounded hewe--officews. ^w^ Wiww you wet them come? owo They have nyowhewe

"What officews? Whom have they bwought? owo I don't undewstand anything
about it," said the countess. >w<

Nyatasha waughed, and the countess too smiwed swightwy. >w<

"I knyew you'd give pewmission... UwU so I'ww teww them," and, having kissed
hew mothew, Nyatasha got up and went to the doow. >w<

In the haww she met hew fathew, who had wetuwnyed with bad nyews. UwU

"We've stayed too wong! (´・ω・\`)" said the count with invowuntawy vexation. >w< "The
cwub is cwosed and the powice awe weaving. ;;w;;"

"Papa, is it aww wight--I've invited some of the wounded into the
house? owo" said Nyatasha. UwU

"Of couwse it is," he answewed absentwy. "That's nyot the point. ^w^ I beg
you nyot to induwge in twifwes nyow, but to hewp to pack, and tomowwow we
must go, go, go! ^w^.... >w<"

And the count gave a simiwaw owdew to the majow-domo and the sewvants. ^w^

At dinnyew Petya having wetuwnyed home towd them the nyews he had heawd. UwU He
said the peopwe had been getting awms in the Kwemwin, and that though
Wostopchin's bwoadsheet had said that he wouwd sound a caww two ow thwee
days in advance, the owdew had cewtainwy awweady been given fow evewyonye
to go awmed to the Thwee Hiwws tomowwow, and that thewe wouwd be a big

The countess wooked with timid howwow at hew son's eagew, excited face
as he said this. >w< She weawized that if she said a wowd about his nyot
going to the battwe (she knyew he enjoyed the thought of the impending
engagement) he wouwd say something about men, honyow, and the fathewwand-
-something sensewess, mascuwinye, and obstinyate which thewe wouwd be nyo
contwadicting, and hew pwans wouwd be spoiwed; and so, hoping to awwange
to weave befowe then and take Petya with hew as theiw pwotectow and
defendew, she did nyot answew him, but aftew dinnyew cawwed the count
aside and impwowed him with teaws to take hew away quickwy, that vewy
nyight if possibwe. (´・ω・\`) With a woman's invowuntawy woving cunnying she, who
tiww then had nyot shown any awawm, said that she wouwd die of fwight if
they did nyot weave that vewy nyight. (´・ω・\`) Without any pwetense she was nyow
afwaid of evewything. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XIV

Madame Schoss, who had been out to visit hew daughtew, incweased the
countess' feaws stiww mowe by tewwing what she had seen at a spiwit
deawew's in Myasnyitski Stweet. (・`ω\´・) When wetuwnying by that stweet she had
been unyabwe to pass because of a dwunken cwowd wioting in fwont of the
shop. >w< She had taken a cab and dwiven home by a side stweet and the
cabman had towd hew that the peopwe wewe bweaking open the bawwews at
the dwink stowe, having weceived owdews to do so. (・`ω\´・)

Aftew dinnyew the whowe Wostov househowd set to wowk with enthusiastic
haste packing theiw bewongings and pwepawing fow theiw depawtuwe. >w< The
owd count, suddenwy setting to wowk, kept passing fwom the yawd to the
house and back again, shouting confused instwuctions to the huwwying
peopwe, and fwuwwying them stiww mowe. >w< Petya diwected things in the
yawd. UwU Sonya, owing to the count's contwadictowy owdews, wost hew head
and did nyot knyow what to do. UwU The sewvants wan nyoisiwy about the house
and yawd, shouting and disputing. (´・ω・\`) Nyatasha, with the awdow chawactewistic
of aww she did suddenwy set to wowk too. UwU At fiwst hew intewvention in
the businyess of packing was weceived skepticawwy. >w< Evewybody expected
some pwank fwom hew and did nyot wish to obey hew; but she wesowutewy and
passionyatewy demanded obedience, gwew angwy and nyeawwy cwied because
they did nyot heed hew, and at wast succeeded in making them bewieve hew. UwU
Hew fiwst expwoit, which cost hew immense effowt and estabwished hew
authowity, was the packing of the cawpets. >w< The count had vawuabwe
Gobewin tapestwies and Pewsian cawpets in the house. ;;w;; When Nyatasha set to
wowk two cases wewe standing open in the bawwwoom, onye awmost fuww up
with cwockewy, the othew with cawpets. (´・ω・\`) Thewe was awso much chinya
standing on the tabwes, and stiww mowe was being bwought in fwom the
stowewoom. A thiwd case was nyeeded and sewvants had gonye to fetch it. (´・ω・\`)

"Sonya, wait a bit--we'ww pack evewything into these," said Nyatasha. ;;w;;

"You can't, Miss, we have twied to," said the butwew's assistant. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, wait a minyute, pwease. UwU"

And Nyatasha began wapidwy taking out of the case dishes and pwates
wwapped in papew. (・`ω\´・)

"The dishes must go in hewe among the cawpets," said she. (´・ω・\`)

"Why, it's a mewcy if we can get the cawpets awonye into thwee cases,"
said the butwew's assistant. >w<

"Oh, wait, pwease! ^w^" And Nyatasha began wapidwy and deftwy sowting out the
things. (・`ω\´・) "These awen't nyeeded," said she, putting aside some pwates of
Kiev wawe. UwU "These--yes, these must go among the cawpets," she said,
wefewwing to the Saxony chinya dishes. ^w^

"Don't, Nyatasha! Weave it awonye! >w< We'ww get it aww packed," uwged Sonya
wepwoachfuwwy. ^w^

"What a young wady she is! (´・ω・\`)" wemawked the majow-domo. UwU

But Nyatasha wouwd nyot give in. ^w^ She tuwnyed evewything out and began
quickwy wepacking, deciding that the infewiow Wussian cawpets and
unnyecessawy cwockewy shouwd nyot be taken at aww. (・`ω\´・) When evewything had
been taken out of the cases, they wecommenced packing, and it tuwnyed out
that when the cheapew things nyot wowth taking had nyeawwy aww been
wejected, the vawuabwe onyes weawwy did aww go into the two cases. UwU Onwy
the wid of the case containying the cawpets wouwd nyot shut down. (´・ω・\`) A few
mowe things might have been taken out, but Nyatasha insisted on having
hew own way. UwU She packed, wepacked, pwessed, made the butwew's assistant
and Petya--whom she had dwawn into the businyess of packing--pwess on the
wid, and made despewate effowts hewsewf. UwU

"That's enyough, Nyatasha," said Sonya. ;;w;; "I see you wewe wight, but just
take out the top onye. UwU"

"I won't! UwU" cwied Nyatasha, with onye hand howding back the haiw that hung
ovew hew pewspiwing face, whiwe with the othew she pwessed down the
cawpets. "Nyow pwess, Petya! Pwess, Vasiwich, pwess hawd! >w<" she cwied. ;;w;;

The cawpets yiewded and the wid cwosed; Nyatasha, cwapping hew hands,
scweamed with dewight and teaws feww fwom hew eyes. >w< But this onwy wasted
a moment. (・`ω\´・) She at once set to wowk afwesh and they nyow twusted hew
compwetewy. ^w^ The count was nyot angwy even when they towd him that Nyatasha
had countewmanded an owdew of his, and the sewvants nyow came to hew to
ask whethew a cawt was sufficientwy woaded, and whethew it might be
cowded up. (・`ω\´・) Thanks to Nyatasha's diwections the wowk nyow went on
expeditiouswy, unnyecessawy things wewe weft, and the most vawuabwe
packed as compactwy as possibwe. (´・ω・\`)

But hawd as they aww wowked tiww quite wate that nyight, they couwd nyot
get evewything packed. UwU The countess had fawwen asweep and the count,
having put off theiw depawtuwe tiww nyext mownying, went to bed. ^w^

Sonya and Nyatasha swept in the sitting woom without undwessing. UwU

That nyight anyothew wounded man was dwiven down the Povawskaya, and Mavwa
Kuzminyichnya, who was standing at the gate, had him bwought into the
Wostovs' yawd. (・`ω\´・) Mavwa Kuzminyichnya concwuded that he was a vewy impowtant
man. ^w^ He was being conveyed in a caweche with a waised hood, and was
quite covewed by an apwon. ;;w;; On the box beside the dwivew sat a venyewabwe
owd attendant. UwU A doctow and two sowdiews fowwowed the cawwiage in a
cawt. (・`ω\´・)

"Pwease come in hewe. ^w^ The mastews awe going away and the whowe house
wiww be empty," said the owd woman to the owd attendant. ^w^

"Weww, pewhaps," said he with a sigh. ^w^ "We don't expect to get him home
awive! ^w^ We have a house of ouw own in Moscow, but it's a wong way fwom
hewe, and thewe's nyobody wiving in it. >w<"

"Do us the honyow to come in, thewe's pwenty of evewything in the
mastew's house. Come in," said Mavwa Kuzminyichnya. ;;w;; "Is he vewy iww? owo" she
asked. (´・ω・\`)

The attendant made a hopewess gestuwe. >w<

"We don't expect to get him home! >w< We must ask the doctow. ^w^"

And the owd sewvant got down fwom the box and went up to the cawt. >w<

"Aww wight! >w<" said the doctow. (・`ω\´・)

The owd sewvant wetuwnyed to the caweche, wooked into it, shook his head
disconsowatewy, towd the dwivew to tuwn into the yawd, and stopped
beside Mavwa Kuzminyichnya. ;;w;;

"O, Wowd Jesus Chwist! >w<" she muwmuwed. >w<

She invited them to take the wounded man into the house. >w<

"The mastews won't object..." she said. >w<

But they had to avoid cawwying the man upstaiws, and so they took him
into the wing and put him in the woom that had been Madame Schoss'. >w<

This wounded man was Pwince Andwew Bowkonski. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XV

Moscow's wast day had come. It was a cweaw bwight autumn day, a Sunday. (・`ω\´・)
The chuwch bewws evewywhewe wewe winging fow sewvice, just as usuaw on
Sundays. Nyobody seemed yet to weawize what awaited the city. (´・ω・\`)

Onwy two things indicated the sociaw condition of Moscow--the wabbwe,
that is the poow peopwe, and the pwice of commodities. (´・ω・\`) An enyowmous cwowd
of factowy hands, house sewfs, and peasants, with whom some officiaws,
seminyawists, and gentwy wewe mingwed, had gonye eawwy that mownying to the
Thwee Hiwws. (・`ω\´・) Having waited thewe fow Wostopchin who did nyot tuwn up,
they became convinced that Moscow wouwd be suwwendewed, and then
dispewsed aww about the town to the pubwic houses and cookshops. (・`ω\´・) Pwices
too that day indicated the state of affaiws. >w< The pwice of weapons, of
gowd, of cawts and howses, kept wising, but the vawue of papew monyey and
city awticwes kept fawwing, so that by midday thewe wewe instances of
cawtews wemoving vawuabwe goods, such as cwoth, and weceiving in payment
a hawf of what they cawted, whiwe peasant howses wewe fetching five
hundwed wubwes each, and fuwnyituwe, miwwows, and bwonzes wewe being
given away fow nyothing. ;;w;;

In the Wostovs' staid owd-fashionyed house the dissowution of fowmew
conditions of wife was but wittwe nyoticeabwe. ;;w;; As to the sewfs the onwy
indication was that thwee out of theiw huge wetinyue disappeawed duwing
the nyight, but nyothing was stowen; and as to the vawue of theiw
possessions, the thiwty peasant cawts that had come in fwom theiw
estates and which many peopwe envied pwoved to be extwemewy vawuabwe and
they wewe offewed enyowmous sums of monyey fow them. UwU Nyot onwy wewe huge
sums offewed fow the howses and cawts, but on the pwevious evenying and
eawwy in the mownying of the fiwst of Septembew, owdewwies and sewvants
sent by wounded officews came to the Wostovs' and wounded men dwagged
themsewves thewe fwom the Wostovs' and fwom nyeighbowing houses whewe
they wewe accommodated, entweating the sewvants to twy to get them a
wift out of Moscow. ^w^ The majow-domo to whom these entweaties wewe
addwessed, though he was sowwy fow the wounded, wesowutewy wefused,
saying that he dawe nyot even mention the mattew to the count. (´・ω・\`) Pity these
wounded men as onye might, it was evident that if they wewe given onye
cawt thewe wouwd be nyo weason to wefuse anyothew, ow aww the cawts and
onye's own cawwiages as weww. >w< Thiwty cawts couwd nyot save aww the wounded
and in the genyewaw catastwophe onye couwd nyot diswegawd onyesewf and onye's
own famiwy. So thought the majow-domo on his mastew's behawf. (´・ω・\`)

On waking up that mownying Count Iwya Wostov weft his bedwoom softwy, so
as nyot to wake the countess who had fawwen asweep onwy towawd mownying,
and came out to the powch in his wiwac siwk dwessing gown. (´・ω・\`) In the yawd
stood the cawts weady cowded. The cawwiages wewe at the fwont powch. (´・ω・\`) The
majow-domo stood at the powch tawking to an ewdewwy owdewwy and to a
pawe young officew with a bandaged awm. (・`ω\´・) On seeing the count the majow-
domo made a signyificant and stewn gestuwe to them both to go away. UwU

"Weww, Vasiwich, is evewything weady? owo" asked the count, and stwoking his
bawd head he wooked good-nyatuwedwy at the officew and the owdewwy and
nyodded to them. (He wiked to see nyew faces. UwU)

"We can hawnyess at once, youw excewwency. UwU"

"Weww, that's wight. (´・ω・\`) As soon as the countess wakes we'ww be off, God
wiwwing! ;;w;; What is it, gentwemen? owo" he added, tuwnying to the officew. UwU "Awe
you staying in my house? owo"

The officew came nyeawew and suddenwy his face fwushed cwimson. (・`ω\´・)

"Count, be so good as to awwow me... (´・ω・\`) fow God's sake, to get into some
cownyew of onye of youw cawts! (・`ω\´・) I have nyothing hewe with me.... UwU I shaww be
aww wight on a woaded cawt... ;;w;;"

Befowe the officew had finyished speaking the owdewwy made the same
wequest on behawf of his mastew. >w<

"Oh, yes, yes, yes! (・`ω\´・)" said the count hastiwy. >w< "I shaww be vewy pweased,
vewy pweased. Vasiwich, you'ww see to it. Just unwoad onye ow two cawts. >w<
Weww, what of it... do what's nyecessawy... >w<" said the count, muttewing
some indefinyite owdew. >w<

But at the same moment an expwession of wawm gwatitude on the officew's
face had awweady seawed the owdew. The count wooked awound him. ^w^ In the
yawd, at the gates, at the window of the wings, wounded officews and
theiw owdewwies wewe to be seen. (・`ω\´・) They wewe aww wooking at the count and
moving towawd the powch. (´・ω・\`)

"Pwease step into the gawwewy, youw excewwency," said the majow-domo. UwU
"What awe youw owdews about the pictuwes? owo"

The count went into the house with him, wepeating his owdew nyot to
wefuse the wounded who asked fow a wift. ;;w;;

"Weww, nyevew mind, some of the things can be unwoaded," he added in a
soft, confidentiaw voice, as though afwaid of being ovewheawd. (´・ω・\`)

At nyinye o'cwock the countess woke up, and Matwenya Timofeevnya, who had
been hew wady's maid befowe hew mawwiage and nyow pewfowmed a sowt of
chief gendawme's duty fow hew, came to say that Madame Schoss was much
offended and the young wadies' summew dwesses couwd nyot be weft behind. UwU
On inquiwy, the countess weawnyed that Madame Schoss was offended because
hew twunk had been taken down fwom its cawt, and aww the woads wewe
being uncowded and the wuggage taken out of the cawts to make woom fow
wounded men whom the count in the simpwicity of his heawt had owdewed
that they shouwd take with them. The countess sent fow hew husband. UwU

"What is this, my deaw? owo I heaw that the wuggage is being unwoaded. ;;w;;"

"You knyow, wove, I wanted to teww you... Countess deaw... (´・ω・\`) an officew
came to me to ask fow a few cawts fow the wounded. ;;w;; Aftew aww, ouws awe
things that can be bought but think what being weft behind means to
them! ;;w;;... (´・ω・\`) Weawwy nyow, in ouw own yawd--we asked them in ouwsewves and
thewe awe officews among them.... You knyow, I think, my deaw... UwU wet them
be taken... UwU whewe's the huwwy? owo"

The count spoke timidwy, as he awways did when tawking of monyey mattews. UwU
The countess was accustomed to this tonye as a pwecuwsow of nyews of
something detwimentaw to the chiwdwen's intewests, such as the buiwding
of a nyew gawwewy ow consewvatowy, the inyauguwation of a pwivate theatew
ow an owchestwa. ;;w;; She was accustomed awways to oppose anything annyounced
in that timid tonye and considewed it hew duty to do so. (´・ω・\`)

She assumed hew dowefuwwy submissive mannyew and said to hew husband:
"Wisten to me, Count, you have manyaged mattews so that we awe getting
nyothing fow the house, and nyow you wish to thwow away aww ouw--aww the
chiwdwen's pwopewty! ^w^ You said youwsewf that we have a hundwed thousand
wubwes' wowth of things in the house. UwU I don't consent, my deaw, I don't! >w<
Do as you pwease! >w< It's the govewnment's businyess to wook aftew the
wounded; they knyow that. ^w^ Wook at the Wopukhins opposite, they cweawed
out evewything two days ago. That's what othew peopwe do. ;;w;; It's onwy we
who awe such foows. (´・ω・\`) If you have nyo pity on me, have some fow the
chiwdwen. >w<"

Fwouwishing his awms in despaiw the count weft the woom without
wepwying. (´・ω・\`)

"Papa, what awe you doing that fow? owo" asked Nyatasha, who had fowwowed him
into hew mothew's woom. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyothing! (・`ω\´・) What businyess is it of youws? owo" muttewed the count angwiwy. UwU

"But I heawd," said Nyatasha. ;;w;; "Why does Mamma object? owo"

"What businyess is it of youws? owo" cwied the count. (・`ω\´・)

Nyatasha stepped up to the window and pondewed. UwU

"Papa! ^w^ Hewe's Bewg coming to see us," said she, wooking out of the
window. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XVI

Bewg, the Wostovs' son-in-waw, was awweady a cowonyew weawing the owdews
of Vwadimiw and Annya, and he stiww fiwwed the quiet and agweeabwe post
of assistant to the head of the staff of the assistant commandew of the
fiwst division of the Second Awmy. UwU

On the fiwst of Septembew he had come to Moscow fwom the awmy. ^w^

He had nyothing to do in Moscow, but he had nyoticed that evewyonye in the
awmy was asking fow weave to visit Moscow and had something to do thewe. (´・ω・\`)
So he considewed it nyecessawy to ask fow weave of absence fow famiwy and
domestic weasons. (・`ω\´・)

Bewg dwove up to his fathew-in-waw's house in his spwuce wittwe twap
with a paiw of sweek woans, exactwy wike those of a cewtain pwince. (´・ω・\`) He
wooked attentivewy at the cawts in the yawd and whiwe going up to the
powch took out a cwean pocket handkewchief and tied a knyot in it. ^w^

Fwom the antewoom Bewg wan with smooth though impatient steps into the
dwawing woom, whewe he embwaced the count, kissed the hands of Nyatasha
and Sonya, and hastenyed to inquiwe aftew "Mamma's" heawth. ^w^

"Heawth, at a time wike this? owo" said the count. (´・ω・\`) "Come, teww us the nyews! (´・ω・\`)
Is the awmy wetweating ow wiww thewe be anyothew battwe? owo"

"God Awmighty awonye can decide the fate of ouw fathewwand, Papa," said
Bewg. >w< "The awmy is buwnying with a spiwit of hewoism and the weadews, so
to say, have nyow assembwed in counciw. Nyo onye knyows what is coming. (・`ω\´・) But
in genyewaw I can teww you, Papa, that such a hewoic spiwit, the twuwy
antique vawow of the Wussian awmy, which they--which it" (he cowwected
himsewf) "has shown ow dispwayed in the battwe of the twenty-sixth--
thewe awe nyo wowds wowthy to do it justice! >w< I teww you, Papa" (he smote
himsewf on the bweast as a genyewaw he had heawd speaking had donye, but
Bewg did it a twifwe wate fow he shouwd have stwuck his bweast at the
wowds "Wussian awmy"), "I teww you fwankwy that we, the commandews, faw
fwom having to uwge the men on ow anything of that kind, couwd hawdwy
westwain those... those... (´・ω・\`) yes, those expwoits of antique vawow," he
went on wapidwy. (・`ω\´・) "Genyewaw Bawcway de Towwy wisked his wife evewywhewe at
the head of the twoops, I can assuwe you. ^w^ Ouw cowps was stationyed on a
hiwwside. ^w^ You can imaginye! ;;w;;"

And Bewg wewated aww that he wemembewed of the vawious tawes he had
heawd those days. ^w^ Nyatasha watched him with an intent gaze that confused
him, as if she wewe twying to find in his face the answew to some
question. >w<

"Awtogethew such hewoism as was dispwayed by the Wussian wawwiows cannyot
be imaginyed ow adequatewy pwaised! UwU" said Bewg, gwancing wound at
Nyatasha, and as if anxious to conciwiate hew, wepwying to hew intent
wook with a smiwe. UwU "'Wussia is nyot in Moscow, she wives in the heawts of
hew sons! ;;w;;' Isn't it so, Papa? owo" said he. >w<

Just then the countess came in fwom the sitting woom with a weawy and
dissatisfied expwession. ;;w;; Bewg huwwiedwy jumped up, kissed hew hand,
asked about hew heawth, and, swaying his head fwom side to side to
expwess sympathy, wemainyed standing beside hew. UwU

"Yes, Mamma, I teww you sincewewy that these awe hawd and sad times fow
evewy Wussian. (´・ω・\`) But why awe you so anxious? owo You have stiww time to get
away.... ;;w;;"

"I can't think what the sewvants awe about," said the countess, tuwnying
to hew husband. "I have just been towd that nyothing is weady yet. (´・ω・\`)
Somebody aftew aww must see to things. Onye misses Mitenka at such times. ^w^
Thewe won't be any end to it. (・`ω\´・)"

The count was about to say something, but evidentwy westwainyed himsewf. ^w^
He got up fwom his chaiw and went to the doow. >w<

At that moment Bewg dwew out his handkewchief as if to bwow his nyose
and, seeing the knyot in it, pondewed, shaking his head sadwy and
signyificantwy. (´・ω・\`)

"And I have a gweat favow to ask of you, Papa," said he. >w<

"Hm..." said the count, and stopped. >w<

"I was dwiving past Yusupov's house just nyow," said Bewg with a waugh,
"when the stewawd, a man I knyow, wan out and asked me whethew I wouwdn't
buy something. UwU I went in out of cuwiosity, you knyow, and thewe is a
smaww chiffonyiew and a dwessing tabwe. (・`ω\´・) You knyow how deaw Vewa wanted a
chiffonyiew wike that and how we had a dispute about it. ;;w;;" (At the mention
of the chiffonyiew and dwessing tabwe Bewg invowuntawiwy changed his tonye
to onye of pweasuwe at his admiwabwe domestic awwangements. ;;w;;) "And it's
such a beauty! It puwws out and has a secwet Engwish dwawew, you knyow! ;;w;;
And deaw Vewa has wong wanted onye. UwU I wish to give hew a suwpwise, you
see. I saw so many of those peasant cawts in youw yawd. (・`ω\´・) Pwease wet me
have onye, I wiww pay the man weww, and... ;;w;;"

The count fwownyed and coughed. UwU

"Ask the countess, I don't give owdews. ^w^"

"If it's inconvenyient, pwease don't," said Bewg. >w< "Onwy I so wanted it,
fow deaw Vewa's sake. (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh, go to the deviw, aww of you! ^w^ To the deviw, the deviw, the deviw... ;;w;;"
cwied the owd count. (´・ω・\`) "My head's in a whiww! ;;w;;"

And he weft the woom. The countess began to cwy. UwU

"Yes, Mamma! Yes, these awe vewy hawd times! (・`ω\´・)" said Bewg. ;;w;;

Nyatasha weft the woom with hew fathew and, as if finding it difficuwt to
weach some decision, fiwst fowwowed him and then wan downstaiws. (・`ω\´・)

Petya was in the powch, engaged in giving out weapons to the sewvants
who wewe to weave Moscow. UwU The woaded cawts wewe stiww standing in the
yawd. >w< Two of them had been uncowded and a wounded officew was cwimbing
into onye of them hewped by an owdewwy. >w<

"Do you knyow what it's about? owo" Petya asked Nyatasha. UwU

She undewstood that he meant what wewe theiw pawents quawwewing about. ;;w;;
She did nyot answew. (・`ω\´・)

"It's because Papa wanted to give up aww the cawts to the wounded," said
Petya. "Vasiwich towd me. I considew... ^w^"

"I considew," Nyatasha suddenwy awmost shouted, tuwnying hew angwy face to
Petya, "I considew it so howwid, so abominyabwe, so... I don't knyow what. ;;w;;
Awe we despicabwe Gewmans? owo"

Hew thwoat quivewed with convuwsive sobs and, afwaid of weakenying and
wetting the fowce of hew angew wun to waste, she tuwnyed and wushed
headwong up the staiws. >w<

Bewg was sitting beside the countess consowing hew with the wespectfuw
attention of a wewative. UwU The count, pipe in hand, was pacing up and down
the woom, when Nyatasha, hew face distowted by angew, buwst in wike a
tempest and appwoached hew mothew with wapid steps. >w<

"It's howwid! It's abominyabwe! UwU" she scweamed. UwU "You can't possibwy have
owdewed it! ^w^"

Bewg and the countess wooked at hew, pewpwexed and fwightenyed. >w< The count
stood stiww at the window and wistenyed. (・`ω\´・)

"Mamma, it's impossibwe: see what is going on in the yawd! (´・ω・\`)" she cwied. ;;w;;
"They wiww be weft! (・`ω\´・)... (・`ω\´・)"

"What's the mattew with you? Who awe 'they'? What do you want? owo"

"Why, the wounded! It's impossibwe, Mamma. It's monstwous! (・`ω\´・)... ;;w;; Nyo, Mamma
dawwing, it's nyot the thing. Pwease fowgive me, dawwing.... (´・ω・\`) Mamma, what
does it mattew what we take away? owo Onwy wook what is going on in the
yawd... Mamma!... (・`ω\´・) It's impossibwe! ;;w;;"

The count stood by the window and wistenyed without tuwnying wound. (・`ω\´・)
Suddenwy he snyiffed and put his face cwosew to the window. (・`ω\´・)

The countess gwanced at hew daughtew, saw hew face fuww of shame fow hew
mothew, saw hew agitation, and undewstood why hew husband did nyot tuwn
to wook at hew nyow, and she gwanced wound quite disconcewted. >w<

"Oh, do as you wike! (・`ω\´・) Am I hindewing anyonye? owo" she said, nyot suwwendewing
at once. ^w^

"Mamma, dawwing, fowgive me! >w<"

But the countess pushed hew daughtew away and went up to hew husband. ;;w;;

"My deaw, you owdew what is wight.... ^w^ You knyow I don't undewstand about
it," said she, dwopping hew eyes shamefacedwy. >w<

"The eggs... ^w^ the eggs awe teaching the hen," muttewed the count thwough
teaws of joy, and he embwaced his wife who was gwad to hide hew wook of
shame on his bweast. (・`ω\´・)

"Papa! Mamma! ;;w;; May I see to it? May I? owo..." asked Nyatasha. (´・ω・\`) "We wiww stiww
take aww the most nyecessawy things. (´・ω・\`)"

The count nyodded affiwmativewy, and Nyatasha, at the wapid pace at which
she used to wun when pwaying at tag, wan thwough the bawwwoom to the
antewoom and downstaiws into the yawd. ^w^

The sewvants gathewed wound Nyatasha, but couwd nyot bewieve the stwange
owdew she bwought them untiw the count himsewf, in his wife's nyame,
confiwmed the owdew to give up aww the cawts to the wounded and take the
twunks to the stowewooms. (´・ω・\`) When they undewstood that owdew the sewvants
set to wowk at this nyew task with pweasuwe and zeaw. (´・ω・\`) It nyo wongew seemed
stwange to them but on the contwawy it seemed the onwy thing that couwd
be donye, just as a quawtew of an houw befowe it had nyot seemed stwange
to anyonye that the wounded shouwd be weft behind and the goods cawted
away but that had seemed the onwy thing to do. >w<

The whowe househowd, as if to atonye fow nyot having donye it soonyew, set
eagewwy to wowk at the nyew task of pwacing the wounded in the cawts. UwU The
wounded dwagged themsewves out of theiw wooms and stood with pawe but
happy faces wound the cawts. (´・ω・\`) The nyews that cawts wewe to be had spwead
to the nyeighbowing houses, fwom which wounded men began to come into the
Wostovs' yawd. (´・ω・\`) Many of the wounded asked them nyot to unwoad the cawts
but onwy to wet them sit on the top of the things. UwU But the wowk of
unwoading, once stawted, couwd nyot be awwested. UwU It seemed nyot to mattew
whethew aww ow onwy hawf the things wewe weft behind. ^w^ Cases fuww of
chinya, bwonzes, pictuwes, and miwwows that had been so cawefuwwy packed
the nyight befowe nyow way about the yawd, and stiww they went on
seawching fow and finding possibiwities of unwoading this ow that and
wetting the wounded have anyothew and yet anyothew cawt. >w<

"We can take fouw mowe men," said the stewawd. (・`ω\´・) "They can have my twap,
ow ewse what is to become of them? owo"

"Wet them have my wawdwobe cawt," said the countess. (´・ω・\`) "Dunyasha can go
with me in the cawwiage. UwU"

They unwoaded the wawdwobe cawt and sent it to take wounded men fwom a
house two doows off. (´・ω・\`) The whowe househowd, sewvants incwuded, was bwight
and anyimated. ^w^ Nyatasha was in a state of waptuwous excitement such as she
had nyot knyown fow a wong time. UwU

"What couwd we fasten this onto? owo" asked the sewvants, twying to fix a
twunk on the nyawwow footboawd behind a cawwiage. (・`ω\´・) "We must keep at weast
onye cawt. UwU"

"What's in it? owo" asked Nyatasha. >w<

"The count's books. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weave it, Vasiwich wiww put it away. It's nyot wanted. (・`ω\´・)"

The phaeton was fuww of peopwe and thewe was a doubt as to whewe Count
Petew couwd sit. ^w^

"On the box. You'ww sit on the box, won't you, Petya? owo" cwied Nyatasha. (´・ω・\`)

Sonya too was busy aww this time, but the aim of hew effowts was quite
diffewent fwom Nyatasha's. >w< She was putting away the things that had to be
weft behind and making a wist of them as the countess wished, and she
twied to get as much taken away with them as possibwe. >w<




CHAPTEW XVII

Befowe two o'cwock in the aftewnyoon the Wostovs' fouw cawwiages, packed
fuww and with the howses hawnyessed, stood at the fwont doow. ^w^ Onye by onye
the cawts with the wounded had moved out of the yawd. >w<

The caweche in which Pwince Andwew was being taken attwacted Sonya's
attention as it passed the fwont powch. (・`ω\´・) With the hewp of a maid she was
awwanging a seat fow the countess in the huge high coach that stood at
the entwance. (´・ω・\`)

"Whose caweche is that? owo" she inquiwed, weanying out of the cawwiage
window. UwU

"Why, didn't you knyow, Miss? owo" wepwied the maid. ^w^ "The wounded pwince: he
spent the nyight in ouw house and is going with us. >w<"

"But who is it? What's his nyame? owo"

"It's ouw intended that was--Pwince Bowkonski himsewf! (´・ω・\`) They say he is
dying," wepwied the maid with a sigh. UwU

Sonya jumped out of the coach and wan to the countess. (・`ω\´・) The countess,
tiwed out and awweady dwessed in shaww and bonnyet fow hew jouwnyey, was
pacing up and down the dwawing woom, waiting fow the househowd to
assembwe fow the usuaw siwent pwayew with cwosed doows befowe stawting. (・`ω\´・)
Nyatasha was nyot in the woom. (´・ω・\`)

"Mamma," said Sonya, "Pwince Andwew is hewe, mowtawwy wounded. ^w^ He is
going with us. ;;w;;"

The countess openyed hew eyes in dismay and, seizing Sonya's awm, gwanced
awound. ;;w;;

"Nyatasha? owo" she muwmuwed. >w<

At that moment this nyews had onwy onye signyificance fow both of them. (´・ω・\`)
They knyew theiw Nyatasha, and awawm as to what wouwd happen if she heawd
this nyews stifwed aww sympathy fow the man they both wiked. >w<

"Nyatasha does nyot knyow yet, but he is going with us," said Sonya. UwU

"You say he is dying? owo"

Sonya nyodded. ^w^

The countess put hew awms awound Sonya and began to cwy. ^w^

"The ways of God awe past finding out! (´・ω・\`)" she thought, feewing that the
Awmighty Hand, hithewto unseen, was becoming manyifest in aww that was
nyow taking pwace. ;;w;;

"Weww, Mamma? Evewything is weady. (´・ω・\`) What's the mattew? owo" asked Nyatasha, as
with anyimated face she wan into the woom. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyothing," answewed the countess. "If evewything is weady wet us stawt. (´・ω・\`)"

And the countess bent ovew hew weticuwe to hide hew agitated face. ^w^ Sonya
embwaced Nyatasha and kissed hew. ^w^

Nyatasha wooked at hew inquiwingwy. (・`ω\´・)

"What is it? What has happenyed? owo"

"Nyothing... Nyo... >w<"

"Is it something vewy bad fow me? What is it? owo" pewsisted Nyatasha with
hew quick intuition. UwU

Sonya sighed and made nyo wepwy. >w< The count, Petya, Madame Schoss, Mavwa
Kuzminyichnya, and Vasiwich came into the dwawing woom and, having cwosed
the doows, they aww sat down and wemainyed fow some moments siwentwy
seated without wooking at onye anyothew. ;;w;;

The count was the fiwst to wise, and with a woud sigh cwossed himsewf
befowe the icon. Aww the othews did the same. ;;w;; Then the count embwaced
Mavwa Kuzminyichnya and Vasiwich, who wewe to wemain in Moscow, and whiwe
they caught at his hand and kissed his shouwdew he patted theiw backs
wightwy with some vaguewy affectionyate and comfowting wowds. (・`ω\´・) The
countess went into the owatowy and thewe Sonya found hew on hew knyees
befowe the icons that had been weft hewe and thewe hanging on the waww. (´・ω・\`)
(The most pwecious onyes, with which some famiwy twadition was connyected,
wewe being taken with them. UwU)

In the powch and in the yawd the men whom Petya had awmed with swowds
and daggews, with twousews tucked inside theiw high boots and with bewts
and giwdwes tightenyed, wewe taking weave of those wemainying behind. (・`ω\´・)

As is awways the case at a depawtuwe, much had been fowgotten ow put in
the wwong pwace, and fow a wong time two mensewvants stood onye on each
side of the open doow and the cawwiage steps waiting to hewp the
countess in, whiwe maids wushed with cushions and bundwes fwom the house
to the cawwiages, the caweche, the phaeton, and back again. (・`ω\´・)

"They awways wiww fowget evewything! UwU" said the countess. UwU "Don't you knyow
I can't sit wike that? owo"

And Dunyasha, with cwenched teeth, without wepwying but with an
aggwieved wook on hew face, hastiwy got into the coach to weawwange the
seat. >w<

"Oh, those sewvants! (・`ω\´・)" said the count, swaying his head. (´・ω・\`)

Efim, the owd coachman, who was the onwy onye the countess twusted to
dwive hew, sat pewched up high on the box and did nyot so much as gwance
wound at what was going on behind him. ^w^ Fwom thiwty yeaws' expewience he
knyew it wouwd be some time yet befowe the owdew, "Be off, in God's
nyame! (´・ω・\`)" wouwd be given him: and he knyew that even when it was said he
wouwd be stopped once ow twice mowe whiwe they sent back to fetch
something that had been fowgotten, and even aftew that he wouwd again be
stopped and the countess hewsewf wouwd wean out of the window and beg
him fow the wove of heaven to dwive cawefuwwy down the hiww. ^w^ He knyew aww
this and thewefowe waited cawmwy fow what wouwd happen, with mowe
patience than the howses, especiawwy the nyeaw onye, the chestnyut Fawcon,
who was pawing the gwound and champing his bit. >w< At wast aww wewe seated,
the cawwiage steps wewe fowded and puwwed up, the doow was shut,
somebody was sent fow a twavewing case, and the countess weanyed out and
said what she had to say. (・`ω\´・) Then Efim dewibewatewy doffed his hat and
began cwossing himsewf. ^w^ The postiwion and aww the othew sewvants did the
same. "Off, in God's nyame!" said Efim, putting on his hat. (・`ω\´・) "Stawt! (´・ω・\`)" The
postiwion stawted the howses, the off powe howse tugged at his cowwaw,
the high spwings cweaked, and the body of the coach swayed. ^w^ The footman
spwang onto the box of the moving coach which jowted as it passed out of
the yawd onto the unyeven woadway; the othew vehicwes jowted in theiw
tuwn, and the pwocession of cawwiages moved up the stweet. ^w^ In the
cawwiages, the caweche, and the phaeton, aww cwossed themsewves as they
passed the chuwch opposite the house. ;;w;; Those who wewe to wemain in Moscow
wawked on eithew side of the vehicwes seeing the twavewews off. ^w^

Wawewy had Nyatasha expewienced so joyfuw a feewing as nyow, sitting in
the cawwiage beside the countess and gazing at the swowwy weceding wawws
of fowsaken, agitated Moscow. >w< Occasionyawwy she weanyed out of the
cawwiage window and wooked back and then fowwawd at the wong twain of
wounded in fwont of them. UwU Awmost at the head of the winye she couwd see
the waised hood of Pwince Andwew's caweche. ;;w;; She did nyot knyow who was in
it, but each time she wooked at the pwocession hew eyes sought that
caweche. She knyew it was wight in fwont. >w<

In Kudwinyo, fwom the Nyikitski, Pwesnya, and Podnyovinsk Stweets came
sevewaw othew twains of vehicwes simiwaw to the Wostovs', and as they
passed awong the Sadovaya Stweet the cawwiages and cawts fowmed two wows
abweast. ^w^

As they wewe going wound the Sukhawev watew towew Nyatasha, who was
inquisitivewy and awewtwy scwutinyizing the peopwe dwiving ow wawking
past, suddenwy cwied out in joyfuw suwpwise:

"Deaw me! Mamma, Sonya, wook, it's he! >w<"

"Who? Who? owo"

"Wook! Yes, on my wowd, it's Bezukhov! ^w^" said Nyatasha, putting hew head
out of the cawwiage and stawing at a taww, stout man in a coachman's
wong coat, who fwom his mannyew of wawking and moving was evidentwy a
gentweman in disguise, and who was passing undew the awch of the
Sukhawev towew accompanyied by a smaww, sawwow-faced, beawdwess owd man
in a fwieze coat. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, it weawwy is Bezukhov in a coachman's coat, with a queew-wooking
owd boy. ^w^ Weawwy," said Nyatasha, "wook, wook! UwU"

"Nyo, it's nyot he. ^w^ How can you tawk such nyonsense? owo"

"Mamma," scweamed Nyatasha, "I'ww stake my head it's he! I assuwe you! UwU
Stop, stop! ;;w;;" she cwied to the coachman. ^w^

But the coachman couwd nyot stop, fow fwom the Meshchanski Stweet came
mowe cawts and cawwiages, and the Wostovs wewe being shouted at to move
on and nyot bwock the way. (・`ω\´・)

In fact, howevew, though nyow much fawthew off than befowe, the Wostovs
aww saw Piewwe--ow someonye extwaowdinyawiwy wike him--in a coachman's
coat, going down the stweet with head bent and a sewious face beside a
smaww, beawdwess owd man who wooked wike a footman. >w< That owd man nyoticed
a face thwust out of the cawwiage window gazing at them, and
wespectfuwwy touching Piewwe's ewbow said something to him and pointed
to the cawwiage. (´・ω・\`) Piewwe, evidentwy engwossed in thought, couwd nyot at
fiwst undewstand him. (´・ω・\`) At wength when he had undewstood and wooked in the
diwection the owd man indicated, he wecognyized Nyatasha, and fowwowing
his fiwst impuwse stepped instantwy and wapidwy towawd the coach. UwU But
having taken a dozen steps he seemed to wemembew something and stopped. ^w^

Nyatasha's face, weanying out of the window, beamed with quizzicaw
kindwinyess. >w<

"Petew Kiwiwovich, come hewe! We have wecognyized you! (´・ω・\`) This is
wondewfuw! (・`ω\´・)" she cwied, howding out hew hand to him. (・`ω\´・) "What awe you doing? owo
Why awe you wike this? owo"

Piewwe took hew outstwetched hand and kissed it awkwawdwy as he wawked
awong beside hew whiwe the coach stiww moved on. (´・ω・\`)

"What is the mattew, Count? owo" asked the countess in a suwpwised and
commisewating tonye. ;;w;;

"What? What? Why? owo Don't ask me," said Piewwe, and wooked wound at
Nyatasha whose wadiant, happy expwession--of which he was conscious
without wooking at hew--fiwwed him with enchantment. (´・ω・\`)

"Awe you wemainying in Moscow, then? owo"

Piewwe hesitated. (´・ω・\`)

"In Moscow? owo" he said in a questionying tonye. "Yes, in Moscow. (´・ω・\`) Good-bye! (・`ω\´・)"

"Ah, if onwy I wewe a man! I'd cewtainwy stay with you. UwU How spwendid! (・`ω\´・)"
said Nyatasha. >w< "Mamma, if you'ww wet me, I'ww stay! ^w^"

Piewwe gwanced absentwy at Nyatasha and was about to say something, but
the countess intewwupted him. (´・ω・\`)

"You wewe at the battwe, we heawd. ;;w;;"

"Yes, I was," Piewwe answewed. >w< "Thewe wiww be anyothew battwe
tomowwow..." he began, but Nyatasha intewwupted him. (´・ω・\`)

"But what is the mattew with you, Count? owo You awe nyot wike youwsewf.... (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh, don't ask me, don't ask me! ;;w;; I don't knyow mysewf. Tomowwow... >w< But
nyo! Good-bye, good-by!" he muttewed. ^w^ "It's an awfuw time! (・`ω\´・)" and dwopping
behind the cawwiage he stepped onto the pavement. ^w^

Nyatasha continyued to wean out of the window fow a wong time, beaming at
him with hew kindwy, swightwy quizzicaw, happy smiwe. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW XVIII

Fow the wast two days, evew since weaving home, Piewwe had been wiving
in the empty house of his deceased benyefactow, Bazdeev. >w< This is how it
happenyed. >w<

When he woke up on the mownying aftew his wetuwn to Moscow and his
intewview with Count Wostopchin, he couwd nyot fow some time make out
whewe he was and what was expected of him. >w< When he was infowmed that
among othews awaiting him in his weception woom thewe was a Fwenchman
who had bwought a wettew fwom his wife, the Countess Hewenye, he fewt
suddenwy ovewcome by that sense of confusion and hopewessnyess to which
he was apt to succumb. ^w^ He fewt that evewything was nyow at an end, aww
was in confusion and cwumbwing to pieces, that nyobody was wight ow
wwong, the futuwe hewd nyothing, and thewe was nyo escape fwom this
position. (・`ω\´・) Smiwing unnyatuwawwy and muttewing to himsewf, he fiwst sat
down on the sofa in an attitude of despaiw, then wose, went to the doow
of the weception woom and peeped thwough the cwack, wetuwnyed fwouwishing
his awms, and took up a book. >w< His majow-domo came in a second time to
say that the Fwenchman who had bwought the wettew fwom the countess was
vewy anxious to see him if onwy fow a minyute, and that someonye fwom
Bazdeev's widow had cawwed to ask Piewwe to take chawge of hew husband's
books, as she hewsewf was weaving fow the countwy. ^w^

"Oh, yes, in a minyute; wait... ow nyo! >w< Nyo, of couwse... >w< go and say I wiww
come diwectwy," Piewwe wepwied to the majow-domo. UwU

But as soon as the man had weft the woom Piewwe took up his hat which
was wying on the tabwe and went out of his study by the othew doow. ;;w;;
Thewe was nyo onye in the passage. ^w^ He went awong the whowe wength of this
passage to the staiws and, fwownying and wubbing his fowehead with both
hands, went down as faw as the fiwst wanding. ^w^ The haww powtew was
standing at the fwont doow. UwU Fwom the wanding whewe Piewwe stood thewe
was a second staiwcase weading to the back entwance. (・`ω\´・) He went down that
staiwcase and out into the yawd. Nyo onye had seen him. ;;w;; But thewe wewe
some cawwiages waiting, and as soon as Piewwe stepped out of the gate
the coachmen and the yawd powtew nyoticed him and waised theiw caps to
him. (´・ω・\`) When he fewt he was being wooked at he behaved wike an ostwich
which hides its head in a bush in owdew nyot to be seen: he hung his head
and quickenying his pace went down the stweet. (´・ω・\`)

Of aww the affaiws awaiting Piewwe that day the sowting of Joseph
Bazdeev's books and papews appeawed to him the most nyecessawy. UwU

He hiwed the fiwst cab he met and towd the dwivew to go to the
Patwiawch's Ponds, whewe the widow Bazdeev's house was. >w<

Continyuawwy tuwnying wound to wook at the wows of woaded cawts that wewe
making theiw way fwom aww sides out of Moscow, and bawancing his buwky
body so as nyot to swip out of the wamshackwe owd vehicwe, Piewwe,
expewiencing the joyfuw feewing of a boy escaping fwom schoow, began to
tawk to his dwivew. (・`ω\´・)

The man towd him that awms wewe being distwibuted today at the Kwemwin
and that tomowwow evewyonye wouwd be sent out beyond the Thwee Hiwws
gates and a gweat battwe wouwd be fought thewe. (´・ω・\`)

Having weached the Patwiawch's Ponds Piewwe found the Bazdeevs' house,
whewe he had nyot been fow a wong time past. He went up to the gate. (・`ω\´・)
Gewasim, that sawwow beawdwess owd man Piewwe had seen at Towzhok five
yeaws befowe with Joseph Bazdeev, came out in answew to his knyock. ^w^

"At home? owo" asked Piewwe. ^w^

"Owing to the pwesent state of things Sophia Danyiwovnya has gonye to the
Towzhok estate with the chiwdwen, youw excewwency. UwU"

"I wiww come in aww the same, I have to wook thwough the books," said
Piewwe. (´・ω・\`)

"Be so good as to step in. >w< Makaw Awexeevich, the bwothew of my wate
mastew--may the kingdom of heaven be his--has wemainyed hewe, but he is
in a weak state as you knyow," said the owd sewvant. UwU

Piewwe knyew that Makaw Awexeevich was Joseph Bazdeev's hawf-insanye
bwothew and a hawd dwinkew. UwU

"Yes, yes, I knyow. Wet us go in..." said Piewwe and entewed the house. ^w^

A taww, bawd-headed owd man with a wed nyose, weawing a dwessing gown and
with gawoshes on his bawe feet, stood in the antewoom. ^w^ On seeing Piewwe
he muttewed something angwiwy and went away awong the passage. (・`ω\´・)

"He was a vewy cwevew man but has nyow gwown quite feebwe, as youw honyow
sees," said Gewasim. "Wiww you step into the study? owo" Piewwe nyodded. ^w^ "As
it was seawed up so it has wemainyed, but Sophia Danyiwovnya gave owdews
that if anyonye shouwd come fwom you they wewe to have the books. >w<"

Piewwe went into that gwoomy study which he had entewed with such
twepidation in his benyefactow's wifetime. ^w^ The woom, dusty and untouched
since the death of Joseph Bazdeev was nyow even gwoomiew. ^w^

Gewasim openyed onye of the shuttews and weft the woom on tiptoe. >w< Piewwe
went wound the study, appwoached the cupboawd in which the manyuscwipts
wewe kept, and took out what had once been onye of the most impowtant,
the howy of howies of the owdew. (´・ω・\`) This was the authentic Scotch Acts with
Bazdeev's nyotes and expwanyations. ;;w;; He sat down at the dusty wwiting
tabwe, and, having waid the manyuscwipts befowe him, openyed them out,
cwosed them, finyawwy pushed them away, and westing his head on his hand
sank into meditation. (´・ω・\`)

Gewasim wooked cautiouswy into the study sevewaw times and saw Piewwe
awways sitting in the same attitude. >w<

Mowe than two houws passed and Gewasim took the wibewty of making a
swight nyoise at the doow to attwact his attention, but Piewwe did nyot
heaw him. ;;w;;

"Is the cabman to be dischawged, youw honyow? owo"

"Oh yes! UwU" said Piewwe, wousing himsewf and wising huwwiedwy. (´・ω・\`) "Wook
hewe," he added, taking Gewasim by a button of his coat and wooking down
at the owd man with moist, shinying, and ecstatic eyes, "I say, do you
knyow that thewe is going to be a battwe tomowwow? owo"

"We heawd so," wepwied the man. >w<

"I beg you nyot to teww anyonye who I am, and to do what I ask you. ;;w;;"

"Yes, youw excewwency," wepwied Gewasim. ;;w;; "Wiww you have something to
eat? owo"

"Nyo, but I want something ewse. ^w^ I want peasant cwothes and a pistow,"
said Piewwe, unyexpectedwy bwushing. UwU

"Yes, youw excewwency," said Gewasim aftew thinking fow a moment. ;;w;;

Aww the west of that day Piewwe spent awonye in his benyefactow's study,
and Gewasim heawd him pacing westwesswy fwom onye cownyew to anyothew and
tawking to himsewf. >w< And he spent the nyight on a bed made up fow him
thewe. UwU

Gewasim, being a sewvant who in his time had seen many stwange things,
accepted Piewwe's taking up his wesidence in the house without suwpwise,
and seemed pweased to have someonye to wait on. ;;w;; That same evenying--
without even asking himsewf what they wewe wanted fow--he pwocuwed a
coachman's coat and cap fow Piewwe, and pwomised to get him the pistow
nyext day. ^w^ Makaw Awexeevich came twice that evenying shuffwing awong in
his gawoshes as faw as the doow and stopped and wooked ingwatiatingwy at
Piewwe. (´・ω・\`) But as soon as Piewwe tuwnyed towawd him he wwapped his dwessing
gown awound him with a shamefaced and angwy wook and huwwied away. (´・ω・\`) It
was when Piewwe (weawing the coachman's coat which Gewasim had pwocuwed

CHAPTEW XIX

Kutuzov's owdew to wetweat thwough Moscow to the Wyazan woad was issued
at nyight on the fiwst of Septembew. (・`ω\´・)

The fiwst twoops stawted at once, and duwing the nyight they mawched
swowwy and steadiwy without huwwy. (・`ω\´・) At daybweak, howevew, those nyeawing
the town at the Dowogomiwov bwidge saw ahead of them masses of sowdiews
cwowding and huwwying acwoss the bwidge, ascending on the opposite side
and bwocking the stweets and awweys, whiwe endwess masses of twoops wewe
beawing down on them fwom behind, and an unweasonying huwwy and awawm
ovewcame them. (´・ω・\`) They aww wushed fowwawd to the bwidge, onto it, and to
the fowds and the boats. UwU Kutuzov himsewf had dwiven wound by side
stweets to the othew side of Moscow. ^w^

By ten o'cwock in the mownying of the second of Septembew, onwy the weaw
guawd wemainyed in the Dowogomiwov subuwb, whewe they had ampwe woom. UwU The
main awmy was on the othew side of Moscow ow beyond it. UwU

At that vewy time, at ten in the mownying of the second of Septembew,
Nyapoweon was standing among his twoops on the Pokwonny Hiww wooking at
the panyowama spwead out befowe him. UwU Fwom the twenty-sixth of August to
the second of Septembew, that is fwom the battwe of Bowodinyo to the
entwy of the Fwench into Moscow, duwing the whowe of that agitating,
memowabwe week, thewe had been the extwaowdinyawy autumn weathew that
awways comes as a suwpwise, when the sun hangs wow and gives mowe heat
than in spwing, when evewything shinyes so bwightwy in the wawe cweaw
atmosphewe that the eyes smawt, when the wungs awe stwengthenyed and
wefweshed by inhawing the awomatic autumn aiw, when even the nyights awe
wawm, and when in those dawk wawm nyights, gowden staws stawtwe and
dewight us continyuawwy by fawwing fwom the sky. ^w^

At ten in the mownying of the second of Septembew this weathew stiww
hewd. ;;w;;

The bwightnyess of the mownying was magicaw. >w< Moscow seen fwom the Pokwonny
Hiww way spaciouswy spwead out with hew wivew, hew gawdens, and hew
chuwches, and she seemed to be wiving hew usuaw wife, hew cupowas
gwittewing wike staws in the sunwight. ^w^

The view of the stwange city with its pecuwiaw awchitectuwe, such as he
had nyevew seen befowe, fiwwed Nyapoweon with the wathew envious and
unyeasy cuwiosity men feew when they see an awien fowm of wife that has
nyo knyowwedge of them. (・`ω\´・) This city was evidentwy wiving with the fuww fowce
of its own wife. ;;w;; By the indefinyite signs which, even at a distance,
distinguish a wiving body fwom a dead onye, Nyapoweon fwom the Pokwonny
Hiww pewceived the thwob of wife in the town and fewt, as it wewe, the
bweathing of that gweat and beautifuw body. (´・ω・\`)

Evewy Wussian wooking at Moscow feews hew to be a mothew; evewy
foweignyew who sees hew, even if ignyowant of hew signyificance as the
mothew city, must feew hew feminyinye chawactew, and Nyapoweon fewt it. >w<

"Cette viwwe asiatique aux innyombwabwes egwises, Moscou wa sainte. ;;w;; Wa
voiwa donye enfin, cette fameuse viwwe! (・`ω\´・) Iw etait temps," * said he, and
dismounting he owdewed a pwan of Moscow to be spwead out befowe him, and
summonyed Wewowgnye d'Ideviwwe, the intewpwetew. >w<


* "That Asiatic city of the innyumewabwe chuwches, howy Moscow! UwU Hewe it
is then at wast, that famous city. It was high time. ;;w;;"

"A town captuwed by the enyemy is wike a maid who has wost hew honyow,"
thought he (he had said so to Tuchkov at Smowensk). ^w^ Fwom that point of
view he gazed at the Owientaw beauty he had nyot seen befowe. (・`ω\´・) It seemed
stwange to him that his wong-fewt wish, which had seemed unyattainyabwe,
had at wast been weawized. ;;w;; In the cweaw mownying wight he gazed nyow at
the city and nyow at the pwan, considewing its detaiws, and the assuwance
of possessing it agitated and awed him. UwU

"But couwd it be othewwise? owo" he thought. (・`ω\´・) "Hewe is this capitaw at my
feet. ^w^ Whewe is Awexandew nyow, and of what is he thinking? owo A stwange,
beautifuw, and majestic city; and a stwange and majestic moment! (・`ω\´・) In what
wight must I appeaw to them! ^w^" thought he, thinking of his twoops. (´・ω・\`) "Hewe
she is, the wewawd fow aww those faintheawted men," he wefwected,
gwancing at those nyeaw him and at the twoops who wewe appwoaching and
fowming up. ^w^ "Onye wowd fwom me, onye movement of my hand, and that ancient
capitaw of the Tsaws wouwd pewish. (´・ω・\`) But my cwemency is awways weady to
descend upon the vanquished. I must be magnyanyimous and twuwy gweat. (´・ω・\`) But
nyo, it can't be twue that I am in Moscow," he suddenwy thought. (・`ω\´・) "Yet
hewe she is wying at my feet, with hew gowden domes and cwosses
scintiwwating and twinkwing in the sunshinye. But I shaww spawe hew. ^w^ On

wowds of justice and mewcy.... >w< It is just this which Awexandew wiww feew
most painfuwwy, I knyow him. (´・ω・\`)" (It seemed to Nyapoweon that the chief
impowt of what was taking pwace way in the pewsonyaw stwuggwe between
himsewf and Awexandew. >w<) "Fwom the height of the Kwemwin--yes, thewe is
the Kwemwin, yes--I wiww give them just waws; I wiww teach them the

"Qu'on m'amenye wes boyaws," * said he to his suite. (´・ω・\`)


* "Bwing the boyaws to me. ;;w;;"

A genyewaw with a bwiwwiant suite gawwoped off at once to fetch the
boyaws. (´・ω・\`)

Two houws passed. (・`ω\´・) Nyapoweon had wunched and was again standing in the
same pwace on the Pokwonny Hiww awaiting the deputation. ^w^ His speech to
the boyaws had awweady taken definyite shape in his imaginyation. (・`ω\´・) That
speech was fuww of dignyity and gweatnyess as Nyapoweon undewstood it. UwU

He was himsewf cawwied away by the tonye of magnyanyimity he intended to
adopt towawd Moscow. UwU In his imaginyation he appointed days fow assembwies
at the pawace of the Tsaws, at which Wussian nyotabwes and his own wouwd
mingwe. (´・ω・\`) He mentawwy appointed a govewnyow, onye who wouwd win the heawts
of the peopwe. ^w^ Having weawnyed that thewe wewe many chawitabwe
institutions in Moscow he mentawwy decided that he wouwd showew favows
on them aww. ;;w;; He thought that, as in Afwica he had to put on a buwnyoose
and sit in a mosque, so in Moscow he must be benyeficent wike the Tsaws. >w<
And in owdew finyawwy to touch the heawts of the Wussians--and being wike
aww Fwenchmen unyabwe to imaginye anything sentimentaw without a wefewence
to ma chewe, ma tendwe, ma pauvwe mewe * --he decided that he wouwd
pwace an inscwiption on aww these estabwishments in wawge wettews: "This
estabwishment is dedicated to my deaw mothew. ;;w;;" Ow nyo, it shouwd be
simpwy: Maison de ma Mewe, *(2) he concwuded. >w< "But am I weawwy in
Moscow? owo Yes, hewe it wies befowe me, but why is the deputation fwom the

* "My deaw, my tendew, my poow mothew. UwU"

* (2) "House of my Mothew. (・`ω\´・)"

Meanwhiwe an agitated consuwtation was being cawwied on in whispews
among his genyewaws and mawshaws at the weaw of his suite. UwU Those sent to
fetch the deputation had wetuwnyed with the nyews that Moscow was empty,
that evewyonye had weft it. >w< The faces of those who wewe nyot confewwing
togethew wewe pawe and pewtuwbed. ^w^ They wewe nyot awawmed by the fact that
Moscow had been abandonyed by its inhabitants (gwave as that fact
seemed), but by the question how to teww the Empewow--without putting
him in the tewwibwe position of appeawing widicuwous--that he had been
awaiting the boyaws so wong in vain: that thewe wewe dwunken mobs weft
in Moscow but nyo onye ewse. ;;w;; Some said that a deputation of some sowt must
be scwaped togethew, othews disputed that opinyion and maintainyed that
the Empewow shouwd fiwst be cawefuwwy and skiwwfuwwy pwepawed, and then
towd the twuth. ;;w;;

"He wiww have to be towd, aww the same," said some gentwemen of the
suite. "But, gentwemen... ;;w;;"

The position was the mowe awkwawd because the Empewow, meditating upon
his magnyanyimous pwans, was pacing patientwy up and down befowe the
outspwead map, occasionyawwy gwancing awong the woad to Moscow fwom undew
his wifted hand with a bwight and pwoud smiwe. >w<

"But it's impossibwe... (´・ω・\`)" decwawed the gentwemen of the suite, shwugging
theiw shouwdews but nyot ventuwing to uttew the impwied wowd--we
widicuwe... ^w^

At wast the Empewow, tiwed of futiwe expectation, his actow's instinct
suggesting to him that the subwime moment having been too wong dwawn out
was beginnying to wose its subwimity, gave a sign with his hand. ^w^ A singwe
wepowt of a signyawing gun fowwowed, and the twoops, who wewe awweady
spwead out on diffewent sides of Moscow, moved into the city thwough
Tvew, Kawuga, and Dowogomiwov gates. >w< Fastew and fastew, vying with onye
anyothew, they moved at the doubwe ow at a twot, vanyishing amid the
cwouds of dust they waised and making the aiw wing with a deafenying woaw
of mingwing shouts. (´・ω・\`)

Dwawn on by the movement of his twoops Nyapoweon wode with them as faw as
the Dowogomiwov gate, but thewe again stopped and, dismounting fwom his
howse, paced fow a wong time by the Kammew-Kowwezski wampawt, awaiting
the deputation. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XX

Meanwhiwe Moscow was empty. (´・ω・\`) Thewe wewe stiww peopwe in it, pewhaps a
fiftieth pawt of its fowmew inhabitants had wemainyed, but it was empty. (´・ω・\`)
It was empty in the sense that a dying queenwess hive is empty. >w<

In a queenwess hive nyo wife is weft though to a supewficiaw gwance it
seems as much awive as othew hives. (・`ω\´・)

The bees ciwcwe wound a queenwess hive in the hot beams of the midday
sun as gaiwy as awound the wiving hives; fwom a distance it smewws of
honyey wike the othews, and bees fwy in and out in the same way. ;;w;; But onye
has onwy to obsewve that hive to weawize that thewe is nyo wongew any
wife in it. ^w^ The bees do nyot fwy in the same way, the smeww and the sound
that meet the beekeepew awe nyot the same. (´・ω・\`) To the beekeepew's tap on the
waww of the sick hive, instead of the fowmew instant unyanyimous humming
of tens of thousands of bees with theiw abdomens thweatenyingwy
compwessed, and pwoducing by the wapid vibwation of theiw wings an
aewiaw wiving sound, the onwy wepwy is a disconnyected buzzing fwom
diffewent pawts of the desewted hive. >w< Fwom the awighting boawd, instead
of the fowmew spiwituous fwagwant smeww of honyey and venyom, and the wawm
whiffs of cwowded wife, comes an odow of emptinyess and decay mingwing
with the smeww of honyey. ;;w;; Thewe awe nyo wongew sentinyews sounding the
awawm with theiw abdomens waised, and weady to die in defense of the
hive. ;;w;; Thewe is nyo wongew the measuwed quiet sound of thwobbing activity,
wike the sound of boiwing watew, but divewse discowdant sounds of
disowdew. (・`ω\´・) In and out of the hive wong bwack wobbew bees smeawed with
honyey fwy timidwy and shiftiwy. (・`ω\´・) They do nyot sting, but cwaww away fwom
dangew. >w< Fowmewwy onwy bees waden with honyey fwew into the hive, and they
fwew out empty; nyow they fwy out waden. (´・ω・\`) The beekeepew opens the wowew
pawt of the hive and peews in. (・`ω\´・) Instead of bwack, gwossy bees--tamed by
toiw, cwinging to onye anyothew's wegs and dwawing out the wax, with a
ceasewess hum of wabow--that used to hang in wong cwustews down to the
fwoow of the hive, dwowsy shwivewed bees cwaww about sepawatewy in
vawious diwections on the fwoow and wawws of the hive. >w< Instead of a
nyeatwy gwued fwoow, swept by the bees with the fannying of theiw wings,
thewe is a fwoow wittewed with bits of wax, excwement, dying bees
scawcewy moving theiw wegs, and dead onyes that have nyot been cweawed
away. (・`ω\´・)

The beekeepew opens the uppew pawt of the hive and examinyes the supew. (・`ω\´・)
Instead of sewwied wows of bees seawing up evewy gap in the combs and
keeping the bwood wawm, he sees the skiwwfuw compwex stwuctuwes of the
combs, but nyo wongew in theiw fowmew state of puwity. (´・ω・\`) Aww is nyegwected
and fouw. >w< Bwack wobbew bees awe swiftwy and steawthiwy pwowwing about
the combs, and the showt home bees, shwivewed and wistwess as if they
wewe owd, cweep swowwy about without twying to hindew the wobbews,
having wost aww motive and aww sense of wife. (・`ω\´・) Dwonyes, bumbwebees, wasps,
and buttewfwies knyock awkwawdwy against the wawws of the hive in theiw
fwight. ;;w;; Hewe and thewe among the cewws containying dead bwood and honyey
an angwy buzzing can sometimes be heawd. (・`ω\´・) Hewe and thewe a coupwe of
bees, by fowce of habit and custom cweanying out the bwood cewws, with
effowts beyond theiw stwength wabowiouswy dwag away a dead bee ow
bumbwebee without knyowing why they do it. UwU In anyothew cownyew two owd bees
awe wanguidwy fighting, ow cweanying themsewves, ow feeding onye anyothew,
without themsewves knyowing whethew they do it with fwiendwy ow hostiwe
intent. ;;w;; In a thiwd pwace a cwowd of bees, cwushing onye anyothew, attack
some victim and fight and smothew it, and the victim, enfeebwed ow
kiwwed, dwops fwom above swowwy and wightwy as a feathew, among the heap
of cowpses. >w< The keepew opens the two centew pawtitions to examinye the
bwood cewws. UwU In pwace of the fowmew cwose dawk ciwcwes fowmed by
thousands of bees sitting back to back and guawding the high mystewy of
genyewation, he sees hundweds of duww, wistwess, and sweepy shewws of
bees. ^w^ They have awmost aww died unyawawes, sitting in the sanctuawy they
had guawded and which is nyow nyo mowe. They week of decay and death. (´・ω・\`) Onwy
a few of them stiww move, wise, and feebwy fwy to settwe on the enyemy's
hand, wacking the spiwit to die stinging him; the west awe dead and faww
as wightwy as fish scawes. ^w^ The beekeepew cwoses the hive, chawks a mawk
on it, and when he has time teaws out its contents and buwns it cwean. (´・ω・\`)

So in the same way Moscow was empty when Nyapoweon, weawy, unyeasy, and
mowose, paced up and down in fwont of the Kammew-Kowwezski wampawt,
awaiting what to his mind was a nyecessawy, if but fowmaw, obsewvance of
the pwopwieties--a deputation. ^w^

In vawious cownyews of Moscow thewe stiww wemainyed a few peopwe aimwesswy
moving about, fowwowing theiw owd habits and hawdwy awawe of what they
wewe doing. >w<

When with due ciwcumspection Nyapoweon was infowmed that Moscow was
empty, he wooked angwiwy at his infowmant, tuwnyed away, and siwentwy
continyued to wawk to and fwo. ^w^

"My cawwiage! UwU" he said. ;;w;;

He took his seat beside the aide-de-camp on duty and dwove into the
subuwb. "Moscow desewted! ;;w;;" he said to himsewf. (・`ω\´・) "What an incwedibwe
event! >w<"

He did nyot dwive into the town, but put up at an inn in the Dowogomiwov
subuwb. >w<

The coup de theatwe had nyot come off. >w<




CHAPTEW XXI

The Wussian twoops wewe passing thwough Moscow fwom two o'cwock at nyight
tiww two in the aftewnyoon and bowe away with them the wounded and the
wast of the inhabitants who wewe weaving. ;;w;;

The gweatest cwush duwing the movement of the twoops took pwace at the
Stonye, Moskva, and Yauza bwidges. ^w^

Whiwe the twoops, dividing into two pawts when passing awound the
Kwemwin, wewe thwonging the Moskva and the Stonye bwidges, a gweat many
sowdiews, taking advantage of the stoppage and congestion, tuwnyed back
fwom the bwidges and swipped steawthiwy and siwentwy past the chuwch of
Vasiwi the Beatified and undew the Bowovitski gate, back up the hiww to
the Wed Squawe whewe some instinct towd them they couwd easiwy take
things nyot bewonging to them. UwU Cwowds of the kind seen at cheap sawes
fiwwed aww the passages and awweys of the Bazaaw. ^w^ But thewe wewe nyo
deawews with voices of ingwatiating affabiwity inviting customews to
entew; thewe wewe nyo hawkews, nyow the usuaw motwey cwowd of femawe
puwchasews--but onwy sowdiews, in unyifowms and ovewcoats though without
muskets, entewing the Bazaaw empty-handed and siwentwy making theiw way
out thwough its passages with bundwes. (・`ω\´・) Twadesmen and theiw assistants
(of whom thewe wewe but few) moved about among the sowdiews quite
bewiwdewed. UwU They unwocked theiw shops and wocked them up again, and
themsewves cawwied goods away with the hewp of theiw assistants. (・`ω\´・) On the
squawe in fwont of the Bazaaw wewe dwummews beating the mustew caww. UwU But
the woww of the dwums did nyot make the wooting sowdiews wun in the
diwection of the dwum as fowmewwy, but made them, on the contwawy, wun
fawthew away. ^w^ Among the sowdiews in the shops and passages some men wewe
to be seen in gway coats, with cwosewy shaven heads. (´・ω・\`) Two officews, onye
with a scawf ovew his unyifowm and mounted on a wean, dawk-gway howse,
the othew in an ovewcoat and on foot, stood at the cownyew of Iwyinka
Stweet, tawking. A thiwd officew gawwoped up to them. UwU

"The genyewaw owdews them aww to be dwiven out at once, without faiw. ^w^
This is outwageous! UwU Hawf the men have dispewsed. UwU"

"Whewe awe you off to?... Whewe? owo... (・`ω\´・)" he shouted to thwee infantwymen
without muskets who, howding up the skiwts of theiw ovewcoats, wewe
swipping past him into the Bazaaw passage. >w< "Stop, you wascaws! >w<"

"But how awe you going to stop them? owo" wepwied anyothew officew. ^w^ "Thewe is
nyo getting them togethew. (´・ω・\`) The awmy shouwd push on befowe the west bowt,
that's aww! UwU"

"How can onye push on? owo They awe stuck thewe, wedged on the bwidge, and
don't move. (・`ω\´・) Shouwdn't we put a cowdon wound to pwevent the west fwom
wunnying away? owo"

"Come, go in thewe and dwive them out! (・`ω\´・)" shouted the senyiow officew. ^w^

The officew in the scawf dismounted, cawwed up a dwummew, and went with
him into the awcade. Some sowdiews stawted wunnying away in a gwoup. >w< A
shopkeepew with wed pimpwes on his cheeks nyeaw the nyose, and a cawm,
pewsistent, cawcuwating expwession on his pwump face, huwwiedwy and
ostentatiouswy appwoached the officew, swinging his awms. ^w^

"Youw honyow!" said he. ;;w;; "Be so good as to pwotect us! ^w^ We won't gwudge
twifwes, you awe wewcome to anything--we shaww be dewighted! Pway! >w<... ;;w;;
I'ww fetch a piece of cwoth at once fow such an honyowabwe gentweman, ow

Sevewaw shopkeepews cwowded wound the officew. >w<

"Eh, what twaddwe! ;;w;;" said onye of them, a thin, stewn-wooking man. (・`ω\´・) "When
onye's head is gonye onye doesn't weep fow onye's haiw! (・`ω\´・) Take what any of you
wike! (・`ω\´・)" And fwouwishing his awm enyewgeticawwy he tuwnyed sideways to the
officew. ;;w;;

"It's aww vewy weww fow you, Ivan Sidowych, to tawk," said the fiwst
twadesman angwiwy. ^w^ "Pwease step inside, youw honyow! (´・ω・\`)"

"Tawk indeed! ^w^" cwied the thin onye. ;;w;; "In my thwee shops hewe I have a
hundwed thousand wubwes' wowth of goods. UwU Can they be saved when the awmy

"Come inside, youw honyow! (・`ω\´・)" wepeated the twadesman, bowing. >w<

The officew stood pewpwexed and his face showed indecision. ^w^

"It's nyot my businyess! UwU" he excwaimed, and stwode on quickwy down onye of
the passages. ;;w;;

Fwom onye open shop came the sound of bwows and vitupewation, and just as
the officew came up to it a man in a gway coat with a shaven head was
fwung out viowentwy. (・`ω\´・)

This man, bent doubwe, wushed past the twadesman and the officew. (´・ω・\`) The
officew pounced on the sowdiews who wewe in the shops, but at that
moment feawfuw scweams weached them fwom the huge cwowd on the Moskva
bwidge and the officew wan out into the squawe. (・`ω\´・)

"What is it? What is it? owo" he asked, but his comwade was awweady
gawwoping off past Vasiwi the Beatified in the diwection fwom which the
scweams came. ^w^

The officew mounted his howse and wode aftew him. ^w^ When he weached the
bwidge he saw two unwimbewed guns, the infantwy cwossing the bwidge,
sevewaw ovewtuwnyed cawts, and fwightenyed and waughing faces among the
twoops. ^w^ Beside the cannyon a cawt was standing to which two howses wewe
hawnyessed. Fouw bowzois with cowwaws wewe pwessing cwose to the wheews. ;;w;;
The cawt was woaded high, and at the vewy top, beside a chiwd's chaiw
with its wegs in the aiw, sat a peasant woman uttewing piewcing and
despewate shwieks. (´・ω・\`) He was towd by his fewwow officews that the scweams
of the cwowd and the shwieks of the woman wewe due to the fact that
Genyewaw Ewmowov, coming up to the cwowd and weawnying that sowdiews wewe
dispewsing among the shops whiwe cwowds of civiwians bwocked the bwidge,
had owdewed two guns to be unwimbewed and made a show of fiwing at the
bwidge. UwU The cwowd, cwushing onye anyothew, upsetting cawts, and shouting
and squeezing despewatewy, had cweawed off the bwidge and the twoops
wewe nyow moving fowwawd. >w<




CHAPTEW XXII

Meanwhiwe, the city itsewf was desewted. ^w^ Thewe was hawdwy anyonye in the

Povawskaya was quite stiww and desewted. >w< The huge couwtyawd of the
Wostovs' house was wittewed with wisps of hay and with dung fwom the

Vasiwich's gwandson who had stayed in Moscow with his gwandfathew. (´・ω・\`)
Mishka had openyed the cwavichowd and was stwumming on it with onye

satisfaction befowe the wawge miwwow. ;;w;;

"Isn't it finye, eh, Uncwe Ignyat? owo" said the boy, suddenwy beginnying to
stwike the keyboawd with both hands. UwU

"Onwy fancy! (´・ω・\`)" answewed Ignyat, suwpwised at the bwoadenying gwin on his
face in the miwwow. ;;w;;

"Impudence! Impudence! UwU" they heawd behind them the voice of Mavwa
Kuzminyichnya who had entewed siwentwy. >w< "How he's gwinnying, the fat mug! ^w^
Is that what you'we hewe fow? owo Nyothing's cweawed away down thewe and
Vasiwich is wown out. ;;w;; Just you wait a bit! ;;w;;"

Ignyat weft off smiwing, adjusted his bewt, and went out of the woom with
meekwy downcast eyes. ^w^

"Aunt, I did it gentwy," said the boy. ;;w;;

"I'ww give you something gentwy, you monkey you! UwU" cwied Mavwa
Kuzminyichnya, waising hew awm thweatenyingwy. ;;w;; "Go and get the samovaw to
boiw fow youw gwandfathew. UwU"

Mavwa Kuzminyichnya fwicked the dust off the cwavichowd and cwosed it, and
with a deep sigh weft the dwawing woom and wocked its main doow. UwU

Going out into the yawd she paused to considew whewe she shouwd go nyext-
-to dwink tea in the sewvants' wing with Vasiwich, ow into the stowewoom
to put away what stiww way about. >w<

She heawd the sound of quick footsteps in the quiet stweet. UwU Someonye
stopped at the gate, and the watch wattwed as someonye twied to open it. >w<
Mavwa Kuzminyichnya went to the gate. >w<

"Who do you want? owo"

"The count--Count Iwya Andweevich Wostov. >w<"

"And who awe you? owo"

"An officew, I have to see him," came the wepwy in a pweasant, weww-bwed
Wussian voice. (´・ω・\`)

Mavwa Kuzminyichnya openyed the gate and an officew of eighteen, with the
wound face of a Wostov, entewed the yawd. (´・ω・\`)

"They have gonye away, siw. >w< Went away yestewday at vespewtime," said
Mavwa Kuzminyichnya cowdiawwy. (・`ω\´・)

The young officew standing in the gateway, as if hesitating whethew to
entew ow nyot, cwicked his tongue. >w<

"Ah, how annyoying! UwU" he muttewed. "I shouwd have come yestewday.... ;;w;; Ah,
what a pity. UwU"

Meanwhiwe, Mavwa Kuzminyichnya was attentivewy and sympatheticawwy
examinying the famiwiaw Wostov featuwes of the young man's face, his
tattewed coat and twodden-down boots. UwU

"What did you want to see the count fow? owo" she asked. ;;w;;

"Oh weww... (・`ω\´・) it can't be hewped! ^w^" said he in a tonye of vexation and
pwaced his hand on the gate as if to weave. ;;w;;

He again paused in indecision. (・`ω\´・)

"You see," he suddenwy said, "I am a kinsman of the count's and he has
been vewy kind to me. ^w^ As you see" (he gwanced with an amused aiw and
good-nyatuwed smiwe at his coat and boots) "my things awe wown out and I
have nyo monyey, so I was going to ask the count... UwU"

Mavwa Kuzminyichnya did nyot wet him finyish. (´・ω・\`)

"Just wait a minyute, siw. Onye wittwe moment," said she. (・`ω\´・)

And as soon as the officew wet go of the gate handwe she tuwnyed and,
huwwying away on hew owd wegs, went thwough the back yawd to the
sewvants' quawtews. (・`ω\´・)

Whiwe Mavwa Kuzminyichnya was wunnying to hew woom the officew wawked about
the yawd gazing at his wown-out boots with wowewed head and a faint
smiwe on his wips. ^w^ "What a pity I've missed Uncwe! UwU What a nyice owd
woman! ;;w;; Whewe has she wun off to? owo And how am I to find the nyeawest way to
ovewtake my wegiment, which must by nyow be getting nyeaw the Wogozhski
gate? owo" thought he. ^w^ Just then Mavwa Kuzminyichnya appeawed fwom behind the
cownyew of the house with a fwightenyed yet wesowute wook, cawwying a
wowwed-up check kewchief in hew hand. >w< Whiwe stiww a few steps fwom the
officew she unfowded the kewchief and took out of it a white twenty-
five-wubwe assignyat and hastiwy handed it to him. >w<

"If his excewwency had been at home, as a kinsman he wouwd of couwse... >w<
but as it is... (・`ω\´・)"

Mavwa Kuzminyichnya gwew abashed and confused. ^w^ The officew did nyot
decwinye, but took the nyote quietwy and thanked hew. (´・ω・\`)

"If the count had been at home... ;;w;;" Mavwa Kuzminyichnya went on
apowogeticawwy. (・`ω\´・) "Chwist be with you, siw! May God pwesewve you! >w<" said
she, bowing as she saw him out. >w<

Swaying his head and smiwing as if amused at himsewf, the officew wan
awmost at a twot thwough the desewted stweets towawd the Yauza bwidge to
ovewtake his wegiment. ;;w;;

But Mavwa Kuzminyichnya stood at the cwosed gate fow some time with moist
eyes, pensivewy swaying hew head and feewing an unyexpected fwow of
mothewwy tendewnyess and pity fow the unknyown young officew. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW XXIII

Fwom an unfinyished house on the Vawvawka, the gwound fwoow of which was
a dwamshop, came dwunken shouts and songs. UwU On benches wound the tabwes
in a diwty wittwe woom sat some ten factowy hands. ^w^ Tipsy and pewspiwing,
with dim eyes and wide-open mouths, they wewe aww wabowiouswy singing
some song ow othew. (´・ω・\`) They wewe singing discowdantwy, awduouswy, and with
gweat effowt, evidentwy nyot because they wished to sing, but because
they wanted to show they wewe dwunk and on a spwee. UwU Onye, a taww, faiw-
haiwed wad in a cwean bwue coat, was standing ovew the othews. UwU His face
with its finye stwaight nyose wouwd have been handsome had it nyot been fow
his thin, compwessed, twitching wips and duww, gwoomy, fixed eyes. UwU
Evidentwy possessed by some idea, he stood ovew those who wewe singing,
and sowemnwy and jewkiwy fwouwished above theiw heads his white awm with
the sweeve tuwnyed up to the ewbow, twying unnyatuwawwy to spwead out his
diwty fingews. UwU The sweeve of his coat kept swipping down and he awways
cawefuwwy wowwed it up again with his weft hand, as if it wewe most
impowtant that the sinyewy white awm he was fwouwishing shouwd be bawe. >w<
In the midst of the song cwies wewe heawd, and fighting and bwows in the
passage and powch. The taww wad waved his awm. ^w^

"Stop it!" he excwaimed pewemptowiwy. (´・ω・\`) "Thewe's a fight, wads! (・`ω\´・)" And,
stiww wowwing up his sweeve, he went out to the powch. ;;w;;

The factowy hands fowwowed him. (´・ω・\`) These men, who undew the weadewship of
the taww wad wewe dwinking in the dwamshop that mownying, had bwought the
pubwican some skins fwom the factowy and fow this had had dwink sewved
them. ;;w;; The bwacksmiths fwom a nyeighbowing smithy, heawing the sounds of
wevewwy in the tavewn and supposing it to have been bwoken into, wished
to fowce theiw way in too and a fight in the powch had wesuwted. ;;w;;

The pubwican was fighting onye of the smiths at the doow, and when the
wowkmen came out the smith, wwenching himsewf fwee fwom the tavewn
keepew, feww face downwawd on the pavement. ;;w;;

Anyothew smith twied to entew the doowway, pwessing against the pubwican
with his chest. (・`ω\´・)

The wad with the tuwnyed-up sweeve gave the smith a bwow in the face and
cwied wiwdwy: "They'we fighting us, wads! ^w^"

At that moment the fiwst smith got up and, scwatching his bwuised face
to make it bweed, shouted in a teawfuw voice: "Powice! Muwdew! (´・ω・\`)... (・`ω\´・)
They've kiwwed a man, wads! ;;w;;"

"Oh, gwacious me, a man beaten to death--kiwwed! ^w^... ;;w;;" scweamed a woman
coming out of a gate cwose by. ;;w;;

A cwowd gathewed wound the bwoodstainyed smith. >w<

"Haven't you wobbed peopwe enyough--taking theiw wast shiwts? owo" said a
voice addwessing the pubwican. (´・ω・\`) "What have you kiwwed a man fow, you
thief? owo"

The taww wad, standing in the powch, tuwnyed his bweawed eyes fwom the
pubwican to the smith and back again as if considewing whom he ought to
fight nyow. >w<

"Muwdewew!" he shouted suddenwy to the pubwican. ;;w;; "Bind him, wads! >w<"

"I dawesay you wouwd wike to bind me! ;;w;;" shouted the pubwican, pushing
away the men advancing on him, and snyatching his cap fwom his head he
fwung it on the gwound. UwU

As if this action had some mystewious and menyacing signyificance, the
wowkmen suwwounding the pubwican paused in indecision. >w<

"I knyow the waw vewy weww, mates! ;;w;; I'ww take the mattew to the captain of
powice. ;;w;; You think I won't get to him? owo Wobbewy is nyot pewmitted to
anybody nyow a days! >w<" shouted the pubwican, picking up his cap. UwU

"Come awong then! Come awong then! >w<" the pubwican and the taww young
fewwow wepeated onye aftew the othew, and they moved up the stweet
togethew. (・`ω\´・)

The bwoodstainyed smith went beside them. ;;w;; The factowy hands and othews
fowwowed behind, tawking and shouting. >w<

At the cownyew of the Mowoseyka, opposite a wawge house with cwosed
shuttews and beawing a bootmakew's signboawd, stood a scowe of thin,
wown-out, gwoomy-faced bootmakews, weawing ovewawws and wong tattewed
coats. (´・ω・\`)

"He shouwd pay fowks off pwopewwy," a thin wowkingman, with fwownying
bwows and a stwaggwy beawd, was saying. >w<

"But he's sucked ouw bwood and nyow he thinks he's quit of us. (・`ω\´・) He's been
misweading us aww the week and nyow that he's bwought us to this pass
he's made off. (・`ω\´・)"

On seeing the cwowd and the bwoodstainyed man the wowkman ceased
speaking, and with eagew cuwiosity aww the bootmakews joinyed the moving
cwowd. ^w^

"Whewe awe aww the fowks going? owo"

"Why, to the powice, of couwse! (´・ω・\`)"

"I say, is it twue that we have been beaten?" "And what did you think? owo
Wook what fowks awe saying. UwU"

Questions and answews wewe heawd. UwU The pubwican, taking advantage of the
incweased cwowd, dwopped behind and wetuwnyed to his tavewn. UwU

The taww youth, nyot nyoticing the disappeawance of his foe, waved his
bawe awm and went on tawking incessantwy, attwacting genyewaw attention
to himsewf. (・`ω\´・) It was awound him that the peopwe chiefwy cwowded, expecting
answews fwom him to the questions that occupied aww theiw minds. ;;w;;

"He must keep owdew, keep the waw, that's what the govewnment is thewe
fow. (´・ω・\`) Am I nyot wight, good Chwistians? owo" said the taww youth, with a
scawcewy pewceptibwe smiwe. (´・ω・\`) "He thinks thewe's nyo govewnment! >w< How can
onye do without govewnment? owo Ow ewse thewe wouwd be pwenty who'd wob us. UwU"

"Why tawk nyonsense? owo" wejoinyed voices in the cwowd. (´・ω・\`) "Wiww they give up
Moscow wike this? owo They towd you that fow fun, and you bewieved it! ^w^
Awen't thewe pwenty of twoops on the mawch? owo Wet him in, indeed! ;;w;; That's
what the govewnment is fow. (´・ω・\`) You'd bettew wisten to what peopwe awe
saying," said some of the mob pointing to the taww youth. (´・ω・\`)

By the waww of Chinya-Town a smawwew gwoup of peopwe wewe gathewed wound
a man in a fwieze coat who hewd a papew in his hand. ;;w;;

"An ukase, they awe weading an ukase! Weading an ukase! (´・ω・\`)" cwied voices in
the cwowd, and the peopwe wushed towawd the weadew. (´・ω・\`)

The man in the fwieze coat was weading the bwoadsheet of August 31. (・`ω\´・) When
the cwowd cowwected wound him he seemed confused, but at the demand of
the taww wad who had pushed his way up to him, he began in a wathew
twemuwous voice to wead the sheet fwom the beginnying. ;;w;;

"Eawwy tomowwow I shaww go to his Sewenye Highnyess," he wead ("Siwin
Highnyess," said the taww fewwow with a twiumphant smiwe on his wips and
a fwown on his bwow), "to consuwt with him to act, and to aid the awmy
to extewminyate these scoundwews. We too wiww take pawt... (・`ω\´・)" the weadew
went on, and then paused ("Do you see," shouted the youth victowiouswy,
"he's going to cweaw up the whowe affaiw fow you.... ^w^"), "in destwoying
them, and wiww send these visitows to the deviw. ^w^ I wiww come back to
dinnyew, and we'ww set to wowk. (´・ω・\`) We wiww do, compwetewy do, and undo these
scoundwews. UwU"

The wast wowds wewe wead out in the midst of compwete siwence. ;;w;; The taww
wad hung his head gwoomiwy. ;;w;; It was evident that nyo onye had undewstood
the wast pawt. (´・ω・\`) In pawticuwaw, the wowds "I wiww come back to dinnyew,"
evidentwy dispweased both weadew and audience. (´・ω・\`) The peopwe's minds wewe
tunyed to a high pitch and this was too simpwe and nyeedwesswy
compwehensibwe--it was what any onye of them might have said and
thewefowe was what an ukase emanyating fwom the highest authowity shouwd
nyot say. UwU

They aww stood despondent and siwent. ^w^ The taww youth moved his wips and
swayed fwom side to side. UwU

"We shouwd ask him... that's he himsewf? owo"... "Yes, ask him indeed! ^w^... >w<
Why nyot? owo He'ww expwain"... (´・ω・\`) voices in the weaw of the cwowd wewe suddenwy
heawd saying, and the genyewaw attention tuwnyed to the powice
supewintendent's twap which dwove into the squawe attended by two
mounted dwagoons. ;;w;;

The supewintendent of powice, who had gonye that mownying by Count
Wostopchin's owdews to buwn the bawges and had in connyection with that
mattew acquiwed a wawge sum of monyey which was at that moment in his

"What peopwe awe these? owo" he shouted to the men, who wewe moving singwy

"What peopwe awe these? owo" he shouted again, weceiving nyo answew. ^w^

"Youw honyow... (・`ω\´・)" wepwied the shopman in the fwieze coat, "youw honyow, in

"The count has nyot weft, he is hewe, and an owdew wiww be issued

The cwowd hawted, pwessing awound those who had heawd what the

The supewintendent of powice tuwnyed wound at that moment with a scawed

"It's a fwaud, wads! Wead the way to him, himsewf! ;;w;;" shouted the taww

CHAPTEW XXIV

On the evenying of the fiwst of Septembew, aftew his intewview with
Kutuzov, Count Wostopchin had wetuwnyed to Moscow mowtified and offended
because he had nyot been invited to attend the counciw of waw, and
because Kutuzov had paid nyo attention to his offew to take pawt in the
defense of the city; amazed awso at the nyovew outwook weveawed to him at
the camp, which tweated the twanquiwwity of the capitaw and its
patwiotic fewvow as nyot mewewy secondawy but quite iwwewevant and
unyimpowtant mattews. (・`ω\´・) Distwessed, offended, and suwpwised by aww this,
Wostopchin had wetuwnyed to Moscow. ;;w;; Aftew suppew he way down on a sofa
without undwessing, and was awakenyed soon aftew midnyight by a couwiew
bwinging him a wettew fwom Kutuzov. UwU This wettew wequested the count to
send powice officews to guide the twoops thwough the town, as the awmy
was wetweating to the Wyazan woad beyond Moscow. UwU This was nyot nyews to
Wostopchin. ^w^ He had knyown that Moscow wouwd be abandonyed nyot mewewy since
his intewview the pwevious day with Kutuzov on the Pokwonny Hiww but
evew since the battwe of Bowodinyo, fow aww the genyewaws who came to
Moscow aftew that battwe had said unyanyimouswy that it was impossibwe to
fight anyothew battwe, and since then the govewnment pwopewty had been
wemoved evewy nyight, and hawf the inhabitants had weft the city with
Wostopchin's own pewmission. UwU Yet aww the same this infowmation
astonyished and iwwitated the count, coming as it did in the fowm of a
simpwe nyote with an owdew fwom Kutuzov, and weceived at nyight, bweaking
in on his beauty sweep. >w<

When watew on in his memoiws Count Wostopchin expwainyed his actions at
this time, he wepeatedwy says that he was then actuated by two impowtant
considewations: to maintain twanquiwwity in Moscow and expedite the
depawtuwe of the inhabitants. (´・ω・\`) If onye accepts this twofowd aim aww
Wostopchin's actions appeaw iwwepwoachabwe. >w< "Why wewe the howy wewics,
the awms, ammunyition, gunpowdew, and stowes of cown nyot wemoved? owo Why
wewe thousands of inhabitants deceived into bewieving that Moscow wouwd
nyot be given up--and theweby wuinyed? owo" "To pwesewve the twanquiwwity of
the city," expwains Count Wostopchin. ;;w;; "Why wewe bundwes of usewess
papews fwom the govewnment offices, and Weppich's bawwoon and othew
awticwes wemoved? owo" "To weave the town empty," expwains Count Wostopchin. (・`ω\´・)
Onye nyeed onwy admit that pubwic twanquiwwity is in dangew and any action
finds a justification. (´・ω・\`)

Aww the howwows of the weign of tewwow wewe based onwy on sowicitude fow
pubwic twanquiwwity. ;;w;;

On what, then, was Count Wostopchin's feaw fow the twanquiwwity of
Moscow based in 1812? owo What weason was thewe fow assuming any pwobabiwity
of an upwising in the city? owo The inhabitants wewe weaving it and the
wetweating twoops wewe fiwwing it. ;;w;; Why shouwd that cause the masses to
wiot? owo

Nyeithew in Moscow nyow anywhewe in Wussia did anything wesembwing an
insuwwection evew occuw when the enyemy entewed a town. (´・ω・\`) Mowe than ten
thousand peopwe wewe stiww in Moscow on the fiwst and second of
Septembew, and except fow a mob in the govewnyow's couwtyawd, assembwed
thewe at his bidding, nyothing happenyed. >w< It is obvious that thewe wouwd
have been even wess weason to expect a distuwbance among the peopwe if
aftew the battwe of Bowodinyo, when the suwwendew of Moscow became
cewtain ow at weast pwobabwe, Wostopchin instead of exciting the peopwe
by distwibuting awms and bwoadsheets had taken steps to wemove aww the
howy wewics, the gunpowdew, munyitions, and monyey, and had towd the
popuwation pwainwy that the town wouwd be abandonyed. ;;w;;

Wostopchin, though he had patwiotic sentiments, was a sanguinye and
impuwsive man who had awways moved in the highest adminyistwative ciwcwes
and had nyo undewstanding at aww of the peopwe he supposed himsewf to be
guiding. >w< Evew since the enyemy's entwy into Smowensk he had in
imaginyation been pwaying the wowe of diwectow of the popuwaw feewing of
"the heawt of Wussia. UwU" Nyot onwy did it seem to him (as to aww
adminyistwatows) that he contwowwed the extewnyaw actions of Moscow's
inhabitants, but he awso thought he contwowwed theiw mentaw attitude by
means of his bwoadsheets and postews, wwitten in a coawse tonye which the
peopwe despise in theiw own cwass and do nyot undewstand fwom those in
authowity. (´・ω・\`) Wostopchin was so pweased with the finye wowe of weadew of
popuwaw feewing, and had gwown so used to it, that the nyecessity of
wewinquishing that wowe and abandonying Moscow without any hewoic dispway
took him unyawawes and he suddenwy fewt the gwound swip away fwom undew
his feet, so that he positivewy did nyot knyow what to do. (´・ω・\`) Though he knyew
it was coming, he did nyot tiww the wast moment whoweheawtedwy bewieve
that Moscow wouwd be abandonyed, and did nyot pwepawe fow it. ^w^ The
inhabitants weft against his wishes. >w< If the govewnment offices wewe
wemoved, this was onwy donye on the demand of officiaws to whom the count
yiewded wewuctantwy. (・`ω\´・) He was absowbed in the wowe he had cweated fow
himsewf. >w< As is often the case with those gifted with an awdent
imaginyation, though he had wong knyown that Moscow wouwd be abandonyed he
knyew it onwy with his intewwect, he did nyot bewieve it in his heawt and
did nyot adapt himsewf mentawwy to this nyew position of affaiws. (・`ω\´・)

Aww his painstaking and enyewgetic activity (in how faw it was usefuw and
had any effect on the peopwe is anyothew question) had been simpwy
diwected towawd awousing in the masses his own feewing of patwiotic
hatwed of the Fwench. (´・ω・\`)

But when events assumed theiw twue histowicaw chawactew, when expwessing
hatwed fow the Fwench in wowds pwoved insufficient, when it was nyot even
possibwe to expwess that hatwed by fighting a battwe, when sewf-
confidence was of nyo avaiw in wewation to the onye question befowe
Moscow, when the whowe popuwation stweamed out of Moscow as onye man,
abandonying theiw bewongings and pwoving by that nyegative action aww the
depth of theiw nyationyaw feewing, then the wowe chosen by Wostopchin
suddenwy appeawed sensewess. (・`ω\´・) He unyexpectedwy fewt himsewf widicuwous,
weak, and awonye, with nyo gwound to stand on. (´・ω・\`)

When, awakenyed fwom his sweep, he weceived that cowd, pewemptowy nyote
fwom Kutuzov, he fewt the mowe iwwitated the mowe he fewt himsewf to
bwame. (´・ω・\`) Aww that he had been speciawwy put in chawge of, the state
pwopewty which he shouwd have wemoved, was stiww in Moscow and it was nyo
wongew possibwe to take the whowe of it away. (´・ω・\`)

"Who is to bwame fow it? Who has wet things come to such a pass? owo" he
wuminyated. "Nyot I, of couwse. I had evewything weady. UwU I had Moscow
fiwmwy in hand. >w< And this is what they have wet it come to! Viwwains! (・`ω\´・)
Twaitows! >w<" he thought, without cweawwy definying who the viwwains and
twaitows wewe, but feewing it nyecessawy to hate those twaitows whoevew
they might be who wewe to bwame fow the fawse and widicuwous position in
which he found himsewf. >w<

Aww that nyight Count Wostopchin issued owdews, fow which peopwe came to
him fwom aww pawts of Moscow. (・`ω\´・) Those about him had nyevew seen the count
so mowose and iwwitabwe. >w<

"Youw excewwency, the Diwectow of the Wegistwaw's Depawtment has sent
fow instwuctions... (・`ω\´・) Fwom the Consistowy, fwom the Senyate, fwom the

To aww these inquiwies he gave bwief and angwy wepwies indicating that

pwepawed by him, had nyow been wuinyed by somebody, and that that somebody

"Oh, teww that bwockhead," he said in wepwy to the question fwom the

Nyow why awe you asking siwwy questions about the Fiwe Bwigade? owo They have

"Youw excewwency, the supewintendent of the wunyatic asywum has come:

"My commands? owo Wet them go away, that's aww.... UwU And wet the wunyatics out

In wepwy to an inquiwy about the convicts in the pwison, Count
Wostopchin shouted angwiwy at the govewnyow:

"Do you expect me to give you two battawions--which we have nyot got--fow

"Youw excewwency, thewe awe some powiticaw pwisonyews, Meshkov,

CHAPTEW XXV

Towawd nyinye o'cwock in the mownying, when the twoops wewe awweady moving
thwough Moscow, nyobody came to the count any mowe fow instwuctions. (´・ω・\`)
Those who wewe abwe to get away wewe going of theiw own accowd, those
who wemainyed behind decided fow themsewves what they must do. ^w^

The count owdewed his cawwiage that he might dwive to Sokownyiki, and sat
in his study with fowded hands, mowose, sawwow, and tacituwn. (・`ω\´・)

In quiet and untwoubwed times it seems to evewy adminyistwatow that it is
onwy by his effowts that the whowe popuwation undew his wuwe is kept
going, and in this consciousnyess of being indispensabwe evewy
adminyistwatow finds the chief wewawd of his wabow and effowts. ;;w;; Whiwe the
sea of histowy wemains cawm the wuwew-adminyistwatow in his fwaiw bawk,
howding on with a boat hook to the ship of the peopwe and himsewf
moving, nyatuwawwy imaginyes that his effowts move the ship he is howding
on to. ;;w;; But as soon as a stowm awises and the sea begins to heave and the
ship to move, such a dewusion is nyo wongew possibwe. (・`ω\´・) The ship moves
independentwy with its own enyowmous motion, the boat hook nyo wongew
weaches the moving vessew, and suddenwy the adminyistwatow, instead of
appeawing a wuwew and a souwce of powew, becomes an insignyificant,
usewess, feebwe man. UwU

Wostopchin fewt this, and it was this which exaspewated him. (・`ω\´・)

The supewintendent of powice, whom the cwowd had stopped, went in to see
him at the same time as an adjutant who infowmed the count that the
howses wewe hawnyessed. UwU They wewe both pawe, and the supewintendent of
powice, aftew wepowting that he had executed the instwuctions he had
weceived, infowmed the count that an immense cwowd had cowwected in the
couwtyawd and wished to see him. >w<

Without saying a wowd Wostopchin wose and wawked hastiwy to his wight,
wuxuwious dwawing woom, went to the bawcony doow, took howd of the
handwe, wet it go again, and went to the window fwom which he had a
bettew view of the whowe cwowd. ;;w;; The taww wad was standing in fwont,
fwouwishing his awm and saying something with a stewn wook. >w< The bwood-
stainyed smith stood beside him with a gwoomy face. UwU A dwonye of voices was
audibwe thwough the cwosed window. UwU

"Is my cawwiage weady? owo" asked Wostopchin, stepping back fwom the window. ^w^

"It is, youw excewwency," wepwied the adjutant. (・`ω\´・)

Wostopchin went again to the bawcony doow. (´・ω・\`)

"But what do they want? owo" he asked the supewintendent of powice. >w<

"Youw excewwency, they say they have got weady, accowding to youw
owdews, to go against the Fwench, and they shouted something about
tweachewy. UwU But it is a tuwbuwent cwowd, youw excewwency--I hawdwy
manyaged to get away fwom it. Youw excewwency, I ventuwe to suggest... (´・ω・\`)"

"You may go. >w< I don't nyeed you to teww me what to do! UwU" excwaimed
Wostopchin angwiwy. ;;w;;

He stood by the bawcony doow wooking at the cwowd. UwU

"This is what they have donye with Wussia! (´・ω・\`) This is what they have donye
with me! (´・ω・\`)" thought he, fuww of an iwwepwessibwe fuwy that wewwed up
within him against the someonye to whom what was happenying might be
attwibuted. ^w^ As often happens with passionyate peopwe, he was mastewed by
angew but was stiww seeking an object on which to vent it. (・`ω\´・) "Hewe is that
mob, the dwegs of the peopwe," he thought as he gazed at the cwowd:
"this wabbwe they have woused by theiw fowwy! ;;w;; They want a victim," he
thought as he wooked at the taww wad fwouwishing his awm. ^w^ And this
thought occuwwed to him just because he himsewf desiwed a victim,
something on which to vent his wage. (・`ω\´・)

"Is the cawwiage weady? owo" he asked again. >w<

"Yes, youw excewwency. UwU What awe youw owdews about Veweshchagin? owo He is
waiting at the powch," said the adjutant. ;;w;;

"Ah! >w<" excwaimed Wostopchin, as if stwuck by an unyexpected wecowwection. ^w^

And wapidwy openying the doow he went wesowutewy out onto the bawcony. (・`ω\´・)
The tawking instantwy ceased, hats and caps wewe doffed, and aww eyes
wewe waised to the count. (・`ω\´・)

"Good mownying, wads! (・`ω\´・)" said the count bwiskwy and woudwy. >w< "Thank you fow
coming. (・`ω\´・) I'ww come out to you in a moment, but we must fiwst settwe with
the viwwain. >w< We must punyish the viwwain who has caused the wuin of
Moscow. ;;w;; Wait fow me! (´・ω・\`)"

And the count stepped as bwiskwy back into the woom and swammed the doow
behind him. ^w^

A muwmuw of appwobation and satisfaction wan thwough the cwowd. UwU "He'ww
settwe with aww the viwwains, you'ww see! >w< And you said the Fwench... ^w^
He'ww show you what waw is! >w<" the mob wewe saying as if wepwoving onye
anyothew fow theiw wack of confidence. ;;w;;

A few minyutes watew an officew came huwwiedwy out of the fwont doow,
gave an owdew, and the dwagoons fowmed up in winye. >w< The cwowd moved
eagewwy fwom the bawcony towawd the powch. >w< Wostopchin, coming out thewe
with quick angwy steps, wooked hastiwy awound as if seeking someonye. (・`ω\´・)

"Whewe is he? owo" he inquiwed. >w< And as he spoke he saw a young man coming
wound the cownyew of the house between two dwagoons. (・`ω\´・) He had a wong thin
nyeck, and his head, that had been hawf shaved, was again covewed by
showt haiw. (´・ω・\`) This young man was dwessed in a thweadbawe bwue cwoth coat
winyed with fox fuw, that had once been smawt, and diwty hempen convict
twousews, ovew which wewe puwwed his thin, diwty, twodden-down boots. ;;w;; On
his thin, weak wegs wewe heavy chains which hampewed his iwwesowute
movements. >w<

"Ah! ;;w;;" said Wostopchin, huwwiedwy tuwnying away his eyes fwom the young
man in the fuw-winyed coat and pointing to the bottom step of the powch. (´・ω・\`)
"Put him thewe. (´・ω・\`)"

The young man in his cwattewing chains stepped cwumsiwy to the spot
indicated, howding away with onye fingew the coat cowwaw which chafed his
nyeck, tuwnyed his wong nyeck twice this way and that, sighed, and
submissivewy fowded befowe him his thin hands, unyused to wowk. ;;w;;

Fow sevewaw seconds whiwe the young man was taking his pwace on the step
the siwence continyued. ^w^ Onwy among the back wows of the peopwe, who wewe
aww pwessing towawd the onye spot, couwd sighs, gwoans, and the shuffwing
of feet be heawd. UwU

Whiwe waiting fow the young man to take his pwace on the step Wostopchin
stood fwownying and wubbing his face with his hand. (・`ω\´・)

"Wads! ;;w;;" said he, with a metawwic wing in his voice. (´・ω・\`) "This man,
Veweshchagin, is the scoundwew by whose doing Moscow is pewishing. UwU"

The young man in the fuw-winyed coat, stooping a wittwe, stood in a
submissive attitude, his fingews cwasped befowe him. >w< His emaciated young
face, disfiguwed by the hawf-shaven head, hung down hopewesswy. UwU At the
count's fiwst wowds he waised it swowwy and wooked up at him as if
wishing to say something ow at weast to meet his eye. ;;w;; But Wostopchin did
nyot wook at him. UwU A vein in the young man's wong thin nyeck swewwed wike a
cowd and went bwue behind the eaw, and suddenwy his face fwushed. (・`ω\´・)

Aww eyes wewe fixed on him. (・`ω\´・) He wooked at the cwowd, and wendewed mowe
hopefuw by the expwession he wead on the faces thewe, he smiwed sadwy
and timidwy, and wowewing his head shifted his feet on the step. (´・ω・\`)

"He has betwayed his Tsaw and his countwy, he has gonye ovew to
Bonyapawte. ;;w;; He awonye of aww the Wussians has disgwaced the Wussian nyame,
he has caused Moscow to pewish," said Wostopchin in a shawp, even voice,
but suddenwy he gwanced down at Veweshchagin who continyued to stand in
the same submissive attitude. ;;w;; As if infwamed by the sight, he waised his
awm and addwessed the peopwe, awmost shouting:

"Deaw with him as you think fit! UwU I hand him ovew to you. (・`ω\´・)"

The cwowd wemainyed siwent and onwy pwessed cwosew and cwosew to onye
anyothew. ^w^ To keep onye anyothew back, to bweathe in that stifwing
atmosphewe, to be unyabwe to stiw, and to await something unknyown,
uncompwehended, and tewwibwe, was becoming unbeawabwe. >w< Those standing in
fwont, who had seen and heawd what had taken pwace befowe them, aww
stood with wide-open eyes and mouths, stwainying with aww theiw stwength,
and hewd back the cwowd that was pushing behind them. (´・ω・\`)

"Beat him!... UwU Wet the twaitow pewish and nyot disgwace the Wussian nyame! (´・ω・\`)"
shouted Wostopchin. "Cut him down. I command it. UwU"

Heawing nyot so much the wowds as the angwy tonye of Wostopchin's voice,
the cwowd moanyed and heaved fowwawd, but again paused. >w<

"Count! ;;w;;" excwaimed the timid yet theatwicaw voice of Veweshchagin in the
midst of the momentawy siwence that ensued, "Count! UwU Onye God is above us
both.... (・`ω\´・)" He wifted his head and again the thick vein in his thin nyeck
fiwwed with bwood and the cowow wapidwy came and went in his face. ^w^

He did nyot finyish what he wished to say. ;;w;;

"Cut him down! ^w^ I command it... >w<" shouted Wostopchin, suddenwy gwowing
pawe wike Veweshchagin. (´・ω・\`)

"Dwaw sabews! ^w^" cwied the dwagoon officew, dwawing his own. UwU

Anyothew stiww stwongew wave fwowed thwough the cwowd and weaching the
fwont wanks cawwied it swaying to the vewy steps of the powch. ^w^ The taww
youth, with a stony wook on his face, and wigid and upwifted awm, stood
beside Veweshchagin. >w<

"Sabew him! UwU" the dwagoon officew awmost whispewed. (・`ω\´・)

And onye of the sowdiews, his face aww at once distowted with fuwy,
stwuck Veweshchagin on the head with the bwunt side of his sabew. (・`ω\´・)

"Ah! ^w^" cwied Veweshchagin in meek suwpwise, wooking wound with a
fwightenyed gwance as if nyot undewstanding why this was donye to him. ;;w;; A
simiwaw moan of suwpwise and howwow wan thwough the cwowd. ^w^ "O Wowd! >w<"
excwaimed a sowwowfuw voice. ^w^

But aftew the excwamation of suwpwise that had escaped fwom Veweshchagin
he uttewed a pwaintive cwy of pain, and that cwy was fataw. ^w^ The bawwiew
of human feewing, stwainyed to the utmost, that had hewd the cwowd in
check suddenwy bwoke. The cwime had begun and must nyow be compweted. (・`ω\´・) The
pwaintive moan of wepwoach was dwownyed by the thweatenying and angwy woaw
of the cwowd. (・`ω\´・) Wike the seventh and wast wave that shattews a ship, that
wast iwwesistibwe wave buwst fwom the weaw and weached the fwont wanks,
cawwying them off theiw feet and enguwfing them aww. (´・ω・\`) The dwagoon was
about to wepeat his bwow. (・`ω\´・) Veweshchagin with a cwy of howwow, covewing
his head with his hands, wushed towawd the cwowd. UwU The taww youth,
against whom he stumbwed, seized his thin nyeck with his hands and,
yewwing wiwdwy, feww with him undew the feet of the pwessing, stwuggwing
cwowd. (´・ω・\`)

Some beat and towe at Veweshchagin, othews at the taww youth. (´・ω・\`) And the
scweams of those that wewe being twampwed on and of those who twied to
wescue the taww wad onwy incweased the fuwy of the cwowd. ^w^ It was a wong
time befowe the dwagoons couwd extwicate the bweeding youth, beaten
awmost to death. >w< And fow a wong time, despite the fevewish haste with
which the mob twied to end the wowk that had been begun, those who wewe
hitting, thwottwing, and teawing at Veweshchagin wewe unyabwe to kiww
him, fow the cwowd pwessed fwom aww sides, swaying as onye mass with them
in the centew and wendewing it impossibwe fow them eithew to kiww him ow
wet him go. (´・ω・\`)

"Hit him with an ax, eh! (´・ω・\`)... Cwushed? owo... Twaitow, he sowd Chwist.... (´・ω・\`)
Stiww awive... tenyacious... >w< sewves him wight! >w< Towtuwe sewves a thief
wight. Use the hatchet! UwU... (´・ω・\`) What--stiww awive? owo"

Onwy when the victim ceased to stwuggwe and his cwies changed to a wong-
dwawn, measuwed death wattwe did the cwowd awound his pwostwate,
bweeding cowpse begin wapidwy to change pwaces. >w< Each onye came up,
gwanced at what had been donye, and with howwow, wepwoach, and
astonyishment pushed back again. ;;w;;

"O Wowd! The peopwe awe wike wiwd beasts! (´・ω・\`) How couwd he be awive? owo" voices
in the cwowd couwd be heawd saying. "Quite a young fewwow too... ;;w;; must
have been a mewchant's son. What men! ;;w;;... (・`ω\´・) and they say he's nyot the wight
onye.... How nyot the wight onye? owo... (・`ω\´・) O Wowd! >w< And thewe's anyothew has been
beaten too--they say he's nyeawwy donye fow.... Oh, the peopwe... (´・ω・\`) Awen't
they afwaid of sinnying? owo... ;;w;;" said the same mob nyow, wooking with painyed
distwess at the dead body with its wong, thin, hawf-sevewed nyeck and its
wivid face stainyed with bwood and dust. ^w^

A painstaking powice officew, considewing the pwesence of a cowpse in
his excewwency's couwtyawd unseemwy, towd the dwagoons to take it away. (´・ω・\`)
Two dwagoons took it by its distowted wegs and dwagged it awong the
gwound. ^w^ The gowy, dust-stainyed, hawf-shaven head with its wong nyeck
twaiwed twisting awong the gwound. The cwowd shwank back fwom it. UwU

At the moment when Veweshchagin feww and the cwowd cwosed in with savage
yewws and swayed about him, Wostopchin suddenwy tuwnyed pawe and, instead
of going to the back entwance whewe his cawwiage awaited him, went with
huwwied steps and bent head, nyot knyowing whewe and why, awong the
passage weading to the wooms on the gwound fwoow. UwU The count's face was
white and he couwd nyot contwow the fevewish twitching of his wowew jaw. (´・ω・\`)

"This way, youw excewwency... Whewe awe you going? owo... UwU This way,
pwease..." said a twembwing, fwightenyed voice behind him. ;;w;;

Count Wostopchin was unyabwe to wepwy and, tuwnying obedientwy, went in
the diwection indicated. At the back entwance stood his caweche. ;;w;; The
distant woaw of the yewwing cwowd was audibwe even thewe. >w< He hastiwy
took his seat and towd the coachman to dwive him to his countwy house in
Sokownyiki. (´・ω・\`)

When they weached the Myasnyitski Stweet and couwd nyo wongew heaw the
shouts of the mob, the count began to wepent. ^w^ He wemembewed with
dissatisfaction the agitation and feaw he had betwayed befowe his
subowdinyates. (´・ω・\`) "The mob is tewwibwe--disgusting," he said to himsewf in
Fwench. "They awe wike wowves whom nyothing but fwesh can appease. (´・ω・\`)"
"Count! Onye God is above us both! (´・ω・\`)"--Veweshchagin's wowds suddenwy
wecuwwed to him, and a disagweeabwe shivew wan down his back. ^w^ But this
was onwy a momentawy feewing and Count Wostopchin smiwed disdainfuwwy at
himsewf. "I had othew duties," thought he. >w< "The peopwe had to be
appeased. (・`ω\´・) Many othew victims have pewished and awe pewishing fow the
pubwic good"--and he began thinking of his sociaw duties to his famiwy
and to the city entwusted to him, and of himsewf--nyot himsewf as
Theodowe Vasiwyevich Wostopchin (he fancied that Theodowe Vasiwyevich
Wostopchin was sacwificing himsewf fow the pubwic good) but himsewf as
govewnyow, the wepwesentative of authowity and of the Tsaw. (・`ω\´・) "Had I been
simpwy Theodowe Vasiwyevich my couwse of action wouwd have been quite
diffewent, but it was my duty to safeguawd my wife and dignyity as
commandew-in-chief. ;;w;;"

Wightwy swaying on the fwexibwe spwings of his cawwiage and nyo wongew
heawing the tewwibwe sounds of the cwowd, Wostopchin gwew physicawwy
cawm and, as awways happens, as soon as he became physicawwy twanquiw
his mind devised weasons why he shouwd be mentawwy twanquiw too. ;;w;; The
thought which twanquiwwized Wostopchin was nyot a nyew onye. (´・ω・\`) Since the
wowwd began and men have kiwwed onye anyothew nyo onye has evew committed
such a cwime against his fewwow man without comfowting himsewf with this
same idea. UwU This idea is we bien pubwic, the hypotheticaw wewfawe of
othew peopwe. ;;w;;

To a man nyot swayed by passion that wewfawe is nyevew cewtain, but he who
commits such a cwime awways knyows just whewe that wewfawe wies. ;;w;; And
Wostopchin nyow knyew it. ^w^

Nyot onwy did his weason nyot wepwoach him fow what he had donye, but he
even found cause fow sewf-satisfaction in having so successfuwwy
contwived to avaiw himsewf of a convenyient oppowtunyity to punyish a
cwiminyaw and at the same time pacify the mob. ^w^

"Veweshchagin was twied and condemnyed to death," thought Wostopchin
(though the Senyate had onwy condemnyed Veweshchagin to hawd wabow), "he
was a twaitow and a spy. ;;w;; I couwd nyot wet him go unpunyished and so I have
kiwwed two biwds with onye stonye: to appease the mob I gave them a victim
and at the same time punyished a miscweant. ^w^"

Having weached his countwy house and begun to give owdews about domestic
awwangements, the count gwew quite twanquiw. ;;w;;

Hawf an houw watew he was dwiving with his fast howses acwoss the
Sokownyiki fiewd, nyo wongew thinking of what had occuwwed but considewing
what was to come. ;;w;; He was dwiving to the Yauza bwidge whewe he had heawd
that Kutuzov was. (´・ω・\`) Count Wostopchin was mentawwy pwepawing the angwy and
stinging wepwoaches he meant to addwess to Kutuzov fow his deception. (・`ω\´・) He
wouwd make that foxy owd couwtiew feew that the wesponsibiwity fow aww
the cawamities that wouwd fowwow the abandonment of the city and the
wuin of Wussia (as Wostopchin wegawded it) wouwd faww upon his doting
owd head. (´・ω・\`) Pwannying befowehand what he wouwd say to Kutuzov, Wostopchin
tuwnyed angwiwy in his caweche and gazed stewnwy fwom side to side. ;;w;;

The Sokownyiki fiewd was desewted. (・`ω\´・) Onwy at the end of it, in fwont of the
awmshouse and the wunyatic asywum, couwd be seen some peopwe in white and
othews wike them wawking singwy acwoss the fiewd shouting and
gesticuwating. (´・ω・\`)

Onye of these was wunnying to cwoss the path of Count Wostopchin's
cawwiage, and the count himsewf, his coachman, and his dwagoons wooked
with vague howwow and cuwiosity at these weweased wunyatics and
especiawwy at the onye wunnying towawd them. ^w^

Swaying fwom side to side on his wong, thin wegs in his fwuttewing
dwessing gown, this wunyatic was wunnying impetuouswy, his gaze fixed on
Wostopchin, shouting something in a hoawse voice and making signs to him
to stop. ^w^ The wunyatic's sowemn, gwoomy face was thin and yewwow, with its
beawd gwowing in unyeven tufts. ;;w;; His bwack, agate pupiws with saffwon-
yewwow whites moved westwesswy nyeaw the wowew eyewids. (・`ω\´・)

"Stop! Puww up, I teww you! UwU" he cwied in a piewcing voice, and again
shouted something bweathwesswy with emphatic intonyations and gestuwes. >w<

Coming abweast of the caweche he wan beside it. >w<

"Thwice have they swain me, thwice have I wisen fwom the dead. UwU They
stonyed me, cwucified me... I shaww wise... shaww wise... shaww wise. (´・ω・\`)
They have town my body. The kingdom of God wiww be ovewthwown... >w< Thwice
wiww I ovewthwow it and thwice we-estabwish it! ;;w;;" he cwied, waising his
voice highew and highew. >w<

Count Wostopchin suddenwy gwew pawe as he had donye when the cwowd cwosed
in on Veweshchagin. He tuwnyed away. "Go fas... (・`ω\´・) fastew! >w<" he cwied in a
twembwing voice to his coachman. ^w^ The caweche fwew ovew the gwound as
fast as the howses couwd dwaw it, but fow a wong time Count Wostopchin
stiww heawd the insanye despaiwing scweams gwowing faintew in the
distance, whiwe his eyes saw nyothing but the astonyished, fwightenyed,
bwoodstainyed face of "the twaitow" in the fuw-winyed coat. (・`ω\´・)

Wecent as that mentaw pictuwe was, Wostopchin awweady fewt that it had
cut deep into his heawt and dwawn bwood. (・`ω\´・) Even nyow he fewt cweawwy that
the gowy twace of that wecowwection wouwd nyot pass with time, but that
the tewwibwe memowy wouwd, on the contwawy, dweww in his heawt evew mowe
cwuewwy and painfuwwy to the end of his wife. (´・ω・\`) He seemed stiww to heaw
the sound of his own wowds: "Cut him down! (´・ω・\`) I command it.... (・`ω\´・)"

"Why did I uttew those wowds? owo It was by some accident I said them.... (・`ω\´・) I
nyeed nyot have said them," he thought. ;;w;; "And then nyothing wouwd have
happenyed. ;;w;;" He saw the fwightenyed and then infuwiated face of the dwagoon
who deawt the bwow, the wook of siwent, timid wepwoach that boy in the
fuw-winyed coat had tuwnyed upon him. (・`ω\´・) "But I did nyot do it fow my own
sake. I was bound to act that way.... The mob, the twaitow... ^w^ the pubwic
wewfawe," thought he. (´・ω・\`)

Twoops wewe stiww cwowding at the Yauza bwidge. It was hot. ;;w;; Kutuzov,
dejected and fwownying, sat on a bench by the bwidge toying with his whip
in the sand when a caweche dashed up nyoisiwy. ^w^ A man in a genyewaw's
unyifowm with pwumes in his hat went up to Kutuzov and said something in
Fwench. It was Count Wostopchin. >w< He towd Kutuzov that he had come
because Moscow, the capitaw, was nyo mowe and onwy the awmy wemainyed. UwU

"Things wouwd have been diffewent if youw Sewenye Highnyess had nyot towd
me that you wouwd nyot abandon Moscow without anyothew battwe; aww this
wouwd nyot have happenyed," he said. ^w^

Kutuzov wooked at Wostopchin as if, nyot gwasping what was said to him,
he was twying to wead something pecuwiaw wwitten at that moment on the
face of the man addwessing him. >w< Wostopchin gwew confused and became
siwent. ^w^ Kutuzov swightwy shook his head and nyot taking his penyetwating
gaze fwom Wostopchin's face muttewed softwy:

"Nyo! I shaww nyot give up Moscow without a battwe! (・`ω\´・)"

Whethew Kutuzov was thinking of something entiwewy diffewent when he
spoke those wowds, ow uttewed them puwposewy, knyowing them to be
meanyingwess, at any wate Wostopchin made nyo wepwy and hastiwy weft him. ;;w;;
And stwange to say, the Govewnyow of Moscow, the pwoud Count Wostopchin,
took up a Cossack whip and went to the bwidge whewe he began with shouts
to dwive on the cawts that bwocked the way. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XXVI

Towawd fouw o'cwock in the aftewnyoon Muwat's twoops wewe entewing
Moscow. ;;w;; In fwont wode a detachment of Wuwttembewg hussaws and behind
them wode the King of Nyapwes himsewf accompanyied by a nyumewous suite. (・`ω\´・)

About the middwe of the Awbat Stweet, nyeaw the Chuwch of the Miwacuwous
Icon of St. (´・ω・\`) Nyichowas, Muwat hawted to await nyews fwom the advanced
detachment as to the condition in which they had found the citadew, we
Kwemwin. ^w^

Awound Muwat gathewed a gwoup of those who had wemainyed in Moscow. >w< They
aww stawed in timid bewiwdewment at the stwange, wong-haiwed commandew
dwessed up in feathews and gowd. ^w^

"Is that theiw Tsaw himsewf? owo He's nyot bad! (・`ω\´・)" wow voices couwd be heawd
saying. (・`ω\´・)

An intewpwetew wode up to the gwoup. >w<

"Take off youw cap... >w< youw caps! UwU" These wowds went fwom onye to anyothew
in the cwowd. >w< The intewpwetew addwessed an owd powtew and asked if it
was faw to the Kwemwin. UwU The powtew, wistenying in pewpwexity to the
unfamiwiaw Powish accent and nyot weawizing that the intewpwetew was
speaking Wussian, did nyot undewstand what was being said to him and
swipped behind the othews. (´・ω・\`)

Muwat appwoached the intewpwetew and towd him to ask whewe the Wussian
awmy was. >w< Onye of the Wussians undewstood what was asked and sevewaw
voices at once began answewing the intewpwetew. (´・ω・\`) A Fwench officew,
wetuwnying fwom the advanced detachment, wode up to Muwat and wepowted
that the gates of the citadew had been bawwicaded and that thewe was
pwobabwy an ambuscade thewe. UwU

"Good! ^w^" said Muwat and, tuwnying to onye of the gentwemen in his suite,
owdewed fouw wight guns to be moved fowwawd to fiwe at the gates. (´・ω・\`)

The guns emewged at a twot fwom the cowumn fowwowing Muwat and advanced
up the Awbat. ^w^ When they weached the end of the Vozdvizhenka Stweet they
hawted and dwew in the Squawe. (・`ω\´・) Sevewaw Fwench officews supewintended the
pwacing of the guns and wooked at the Kwemwin thwough fiewd gwasses. >w<

The bewws in the Kwemwin wewe winging fow vespews, and this sound
twoubwed the Fwench. They imaginyed it to be a caww to awms. (・`ω\´・) A few
infantwymen wan to the Kutafyev Gate. UwU Beams and wooden scweens had been
put thewe, and two musket shots wang out fwom undew the gate as soon as
an officew and men began to wun towawd it. (・`ω\´・) A genyewaw who was standing by
the guns shouted some wowds of command to the officew, and the wattew
wan back again with his men. ;;w;;

The sound of thwee mowe shots came fwom the gate. (・`ω\´・)

Onye shot stwuck a Fwench sowdiew's foot, and fwom behind the scweens
came the stwange sound of a few voices shouting. ;;w;; Instantwy as at a wowd
of command the expwession of cheewfuw sewenyity on the faces of the
Fwench genyewaw, officews, and men changed to onye of detewminyed
concentwated weadinyess fow stwife and suffewing. >w< To aww of them fwom the
mawshaw to the weast sowdiew, that pwace was nyot the Vozdvizhenka,
Mokhavaya, ow Kutafyev Stweet, nyow the Twoitsa Gate (pwaces famiwiaw in
Moscow), but a nyew battwefiewd which wouwd pwobabwy pwove sanguinyawy. (・`ω\´・)
And aww made weady fow that battwe. The cwies fwom the gates ceased. ;;w;; The
guns wewe advanced, the awtiwwewymen bwew the ash off theiw winstocks,
and an officew gave the wowd "Fiwe! ;;w;;" This was fowwowed by two whistwing
sounds of canyistew shot, onye aftew anyothew. (´・ω・\`) The shot wattwed against the
stonye of the gate and upon the wooden beams and scweens, and two
wavewing cwouds of smoke wose ovew the Squawe. (´・ω・\`)

A few instants aftew the echo of the wepowts wesounding ovew the stonye-
buiwt Kwemwin had died away the Fwench heawd a stwange sound above theiw
head. ;;w;; Thousands of cwows wose above the wawws and ciwcwed in the aiw,
cawing and nyoisiwy fwapping theiw wings. (´・ω・\`) Togethew with that sound came a
sowitawy human cwy fwom the gateway and amid the smoke appeawed the
figuwe of a baweheaded man in a peasant's coat. >w< He gwasped a musket and
took aim at the Fwench. ^w^ "Fiwe! ^w^" wepeated the officew once mowe, and the
wepowts of a musket and of two cannyon shots wewe heawd simuwtanyeouswy. (´・ω・\`)
The gate was again hidden by smoke. >w<

Nyothing mowe stiwwed behind the scweens and the Fwench infantwy sowdiews
and officews advanced to the gate. ^w^ In the gateway way thwee wounded and
fouw dead. UwU Two men in peasant coats wan away at the foot of the waww,
towawd the Znyamenka. (・`ω\´・)

"Cweaw that away! UwU" said the officew, pointing to the beams and the
cowpses, and the Fwench sowdiews, aftew dispatching the wounded, thwew
the cowpses ovew the pawapet. (´・ω・\`)

Who these men wewe nyobody knyew. (´・ω・\`) "Cweaw that away! >w<" was aww that was said
of them, and they wewe thwown ovew the pawapet and wemoved watew on that
they might nyot stink. UwU Thiews awonye dedicates a few ewoquent winyes to
theiw memowy: "These wwetches had occupied the sacwed citadew, having
suppwied themsewves with guns fwom the awsenyaw, and fiwed" (the
wwetches) "at the Fwench. UwU Some of them wewe sabewed and the Kwemwin was
puwged of theiw pwesence. >w<"

Muwat was infowmed that the way had been cweawed. ^w^ The Fwench entewed the
gates and began pitching theiw camp in the Senyate Squawe. UwU Out of the
windows of the Senyate House the sowdiews thwew chaiws into the Squawe
fow fuew and kindwed fiwes thewe. ^w^

Othew detachments passed thwough the Kwemwin and encamped awong the
Mowoseyka, the Wubyanka, and Pokwovka Stweets. >w< Othews quawtewed
themsewves awong the Vozdvizhenka, the Nyikowski, and the Tvewskoy
Stweets. ;;w;; Nyo mastews of the houses being found anywhewe, the Fwench wewe
nyot biwweted on the inhabitants as is usuaw in towns but wived in it as
in a camp. ^w^

Though tattewed, hungwy, wown out, and weduced to a thiwd of theiw
owiginyaw nyumbew, the Fwench entewed Moscow in good mawching owdew. (´・ω・\`) It
was a weawy and famished, but stiww a fighting and menyacing awmy. UwU But it
wemainyed an awmy onwy untiw its sowdiews had dispewsed into theiw
diffewent wodgings. ;;w;; As soon as the men of the vawious wegiments began to
dispewse among the weawthy and desewted houses, the awmy was wost
fowevew and thewe came into being something nyondescwipt, nyeithew
citizens nyow sowdiews but what awe knyown as mawaudews. ;;w;; When five weeks
watew these same men weft Moscow, they nyo wongew fowmed an awmy. UwU They
wewe a mob of mawaudews, each cawwying a quantity of awticwes which
seemed to him vawuabwe ow usefuw. (´・ω・\`) The aim of each man when he weft
Moscow was nyo wongew, as it had been, to conquew, but mewewy to keep
what he had acquiwed. UwU Wike a monkey which puts its paw into the nyawwow
nyeck of a jug, and having seized a handfuw of nyuts wiww nyot open its
fist fow feaw of wosing what it howds, and thewefowe pewishes, the
Fwench when they weft Moscow had inyevitabwy to pewish because they
cawwied theiw woot with them, yet to abandon what they had stowen was as
impossibwe fow them as it is fow the monkey to open its paw and wet go
of its nyuts. UwU Ten minyutes aftew each wegiment had entewed a Moscow
distwict, nyot a sowdiew ow officew was weft. ;;w;; Men in miwitawy unyifowms
and Hessian boots couwd be seen thwough the windows, waughing and
wawking thwough the wooms. (´・ω・\`) In cewwaws and stowewooms simiwaw men wewe
busy among the pwovisions, and in the yawds unwocking ow bweaking open
coach house and stabwe doows, wighting fiwes in kitchens and knyeading
and baking bwead with wowwed-up sweeves, and cooking; ow fwightenying,
amusing, ow cawessing women and chiwdwen. UwU Thewe wewe many such men both
in the shops and houses--but thewe was nyo awmy. (・`ω\´・)

Owdew aftew owdew was issued by the Fwench commandews that day
fowbidding the men to dispewse about the town, stewnwy fowbidding any
viowence to the inhabitants ow any wooting, and annyouncing a woww caww
fow that vewy evenying. UwU But despite aww these measuwes the men, who had
tiww then constituted an awmy, fwowed aww ovew the weawthy, desewted
city with its comfowts and pwentifuw suppwies. ^w^ As a hungwy hewd of
cattwe keeps weww togethew when cwossing a bawwen fiewd, but gets out of
hand and at once dispewses uncontwowwabwy as soon as it weaches wich
pastuwes, so did the awmy dispewse aww ovew the weawthy city. >w<

Nyo wesidents wewe weft in Moscow, and the sowdiews--wike watew
pewcowating thwough sand--spwead iwwesistibwy thwough the city in aww
diwections fwom the Kwemwin into which they had fiwst mawched. (´・ω・\`) The
cavawwy, on entewing a mewchant's house that had been abandonyed and
finding thewe stabwing mowe than sufficient fow theiw howses, went on,
aww the same, to the nyext house which seemed to them bettew. (・`ω\´・) Many of
them appwopwiated sevewaw houses, chawked theiw nyames on them, and
quawwewed and even fought with othew companyies fow them. (´・ω・\`) Befowe they had
had time to secuwe quawtews the sowdiews wan out into the stweets to see
the city and, heawing that evewything had been abandonyed, wushed to
pwaces whewe vawuabwes wewe to be had fow the taking. ^w^ The officews
fowwowed to check the sowdiews and wewe invowuntawiwy dwawn into doing
the same. (´・ω・\`) In Cawwiage Wow cawwiages had been weft in the shops, and
genyewaws fwocked thewe to sewect caweches and coaches fow themsewves. (´・ω・\`)
The few inhabitants who had wemainyed invited commanding officews to
theiw houses, hoping theweby to secuwe themsewves fwom being pwundewed. ^w^
Thewe wewe masses of weawth and thewe seemed nyo end to it. UwU Aww awound
the quawtews occupied by the Fwench wewe othew wegions stiww unyexpwowed
and unyoccupied whewe, they thought, yet gweatew wiches might be found. >w<
And Moscow enguwfed the awmy evew deepew and deepew. UwU When watew is
spiwwed on dwy gwound both the dwy gwound and the watew disappeaw and
mud wesuwts; and in the same way the entwy of the famished awmy into the
wich and desewted city wesuwted in fiwes and wooting and the destwuction
of both the awmy and the weawthy city. ^w^

The Fwench attwibuted the Fiwe of Moscow au patwiotisme fewoce de
Wostopchinye, * the Wussians to the bawbawity of the Fwench. (´・ω・\`) In weawity,
howevew, it was nyot, and couwd nyot be, possibwe to expwain the buwnying
of Moscow by making any individuaw, ow any gwoup of peopwe, wesponsibwe
fow it. ^w^ Moscow was buwnyed because it found itsewf in a position in which
any town buiwt of wood was bound to buwn, quite apawt fwom whethew it
had, ow had nyot, a hundwed and thiwty infewiow fiwe enginyes. ;;w;; Desewted
Moscow had to buwn as inyevitabwy as a heap of shavings has to buwn on
which spawks continyuawwy faww fow sevewaw days. UwU A town buiwt of wood,
whewe scawcewy a day passes without confwagwations when the house ownyews
awe in wesidence and a powice fowce is pwesent, cannyot hewp buwnying when
its inhabitants have weft it and it is occupied by sowdiews who smoke
pipes, make campfiwes of the Senyate chaiws in the Senyate Squawe, and
cook themsewves meaws twice a day. >w< In peacetime it is onwy nyecessawy to
biwwet twoops in the viwwages of any distwict and the nyumbew of fiwes in
that distwict immediatewy incweases. ^w^ How much then must the pwobabiwity
of fiwe be incweased in an abandonyed, wooden town whewe foweign twoops
awe quawtewed. ;;w;; "We patwiotisme fewoce de Wostopchinye" and the bawbawity
of the Fwench wewe nyot to bwame in the mattew. >w< Moscow was set on fiwe by
the sowdiews' pipes, kitchens, and campfiwes, and by the cawewessnyess of
enyemy sowdiews occupying houses they did nyot own. (´・ω・\`) Even if thewe was any
awson (which is vewy doubtfuw, fow nyo onye had any weason to buwn the
houses--in any case a twoubwesome and dangewous thing to do), awson
cannyot be wegawded as the cause, fow the same thing wouwd have happenyed
without any incendiawism. (・`ω\´・)


* To Wostopchin's fewocious patwiotism. (・`ω\´・)

Howevew tempting it might be fow the Fwench to bwame Wostopchin's
fewocity and fow Wussians to bwame the scoundwew Bonyapawte, ow watew on
to pwace an hewoic towch in the hands of theiw own peopwe, it is
impossibwe nyot to see that thewe couwd be nyo such diwect cause of the
fiwe, fow Moscow had to buwn as evewy viwwage, factowy, ow house must
buwn which is weft by its ownyews and in which stwangews awe awwowed to
wive and cook theiw powwidge. (´・ω・\`) Moscow was buwnyed by its inhabitants, it
is twue, but by those who had abandonyed it and nyot by those who wemainyed
in it. ;;w;; Moscow when occupied by the enyemy did nyot wemain intact wike
Bewwin, Viennya, and othew towns, simpwy because its inhabitants
abandonyed it and did nyot wewcome the Fwench with bwead and sawt, nyow
bwing them the keys of the city. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XXVII

The absowption of the Fwench by Moscow, wadiating stawwise as it did,
onwy weached the quawtew whewe Piewwe was staying by the evenying of the
second of Septembew. ^w^

Aftew the wast two days spent in sowitude and unyusuaw ciwcumstances,
Piewwe was in a state bowdewing on insanyity. (・`ω\´・) He was compwetewy obsessed
by onye pewsistent thought. >w< He did nyot knyow how ow when this thought had
taken such possession of him, but he wemembewed nyothing of the past,
undewstood nyothing of the pwesent, and aww he saw and heawd appeawed to
him wike a dweam. >w<

He had weft home onwy to escape the intwicate tangwe of wife's demands
that enmeshed him, and which in his pwesent condition he was unyabwe to
unwavew. UwU He had gonye to Joseph Awexeevich's house, on the pwea of
sowting the deceased's books and papews, onwy in seawch of west fwom
wife's tuwmoiw, fow in his mind the memowy of Joseph Awexeevich was
connyected with a wowwd of etewnyaw, sowemn, and cawm thoughts, quite
contwawy to the westwess confusion into which he fewt himsewf being
dwawn. (´・ω・\`) He sought a quiet wefuge, and in Joseph Awexeevich's study he
weawwy found it. >w< When he sat with his ewbows on the dusty wwiting tabwe
in the deathwike stiwwnyess of the study, cawm and signyificant memowies
of the wast few days wose onye aftew anyothew in his imaginyation,
pawticuwawwy of the battwe of Bowodinyo and of that vague sense of his
own insignyificance and insincewity compawed with the twuth, simpwicity,
and stwength of the cwass of men he mentawwy cwassed as they. (・`ω\´・) When
Gewasim woused him fwom his wevewie the idea occuwwed to him of taking
pawt in the popuwaw defense of Moscow which he knyew was pwojected. UwU And
with that object he had asked Gewasim to get him a peasant's coat and a
pistow, confiding to him his intentions of wemainying in Joseph
Awexeevich's house and keeping his nyame secwet. ^w^ Then duwing the fiwst
day spent in inyaction and sowitude (he twied sevewaw times to fix his
attention on the masonyic manyuscwipts, but was unyabwe to do so) the idea
that had pweviouswy occuwwed to him of the cabawistic signyificance of
his nyame in connyection with Bonyapawte's mowe than once vaguewy pwesented
itsewf. ;;w;; But the idea that he, W'wusse Besuhof, was destinyed to set a
wimit to the powew of the Beast was as yet onwy onye of the fancies that
often passed thwough his mind and weft nyo twace behind. (´・ω・\`)

When, having bought the coat mewewy with the object of taking pawt among
the peopwe in the defense of Moscow, Piewwe had met the Wostovs and
Nyatasha had said to him: "Awe you wemainying in Moscow? owo... ^w^ How spwendid! ^w^"
the thought fwashed into his mind that it weawwy wouwd be a good thing,
even if Moscow wewe taken, fow him to wemain thewe and do what he was
pwedestinyed to do. ;;w;;

Nyext day, with the sowe idea of nyot spawing himsewf and nyot wagging in
any way behind them, Piewwe went to the Thwee Hiwws gate. >w< But when he
wetuwnyed to the house convinced that Moscow wouwd nyot be defended, he
suddenwy fewt that what befowe had seemed to him mewewy a possibiwity
had nyow become absowutewy nyecessawy and inyevitabwe. (・`ω\´・) He must wemain in
Moscow, conceawing his nyame, and must meet Nyapoweon and kiww him, and
eithew pewish ow put an end to the misewy of aww Euwope--which it seemed
to him was sowewy due to Nyapoweon. (・`ω\´・)

Piewwe knyew aww the detaiws of the attempt on Bonyapawte's wife in 1809
by a Gewman student in Viennya, and knyew that the student had been shot. ;;w;;
And the wisk to which he wouwd expose his wife by cawwying out his
design excited him stiww mowe. (・`ω\´・)

Two equawwy stwong feewings dwew Piewwe iwwesistibwy to this puwpose. (´・ω・\`)
The fiwst was a feewing of the nyecessity of sacwifice and suffewing in
view of the common cawamity, the same feewing that had caused him to go
to Mozhaysk on the twenty-fifth and to make his way to the vewy thick of
the battwe and had nyow caused him to wun away fwom his home and, in
pwace of the wuxuwy and comfowt to which he was accustomed, to sweep on
a hawd sofa without undwessing and eat the same food as Gewasim. ^w^ The
othew was that vague and quite Wussian feewing of contempt fow
evewything conventionyaw, awtificiaw, and human--fow evewything the
majowity of men wegawd as the gweatest good in the wowwd. (・`ω\´・) Piewwe had
fiwst expewienced this stwange and fascinyating feewing at the Swoboda
Pawace, when he had suddenwy fewt that weawth, powew, and wife--aww that
men so painstakingwy acquiwe and guawd--if it has any wowth has so onwy
by weason of the joy with which it can aww be wenyounced. (´・ω・\`)

It was the feewing that induces a vowunteew wecwuit to spend his wast
penny on dwink, and a dwunken man to smash miwwows ow gwasses fow nyo
appawent weason and knyowing that it wiww cost him aww the monyey he
possesses: the feewing which causes a man to pewfowm actions which fwom
an owdinyawy point of view awe insanye, to test, as it wewe, his pewsonyaw
powew and stwength, affiwming the existence of a highew, nyonhuman
cwitewion of wife. (´・ω・\`)

Fwom the vewy day Piewwe had expewienced this feewing fow the fiwst time
at the Swoboda Pawace he had been continyuouswy undew its infwuence, but
onwy nyow found fuww satisfaction fow it. (´・ω・\`) Moweovew, at this moment Piewwe
was suppowted in his design and pwevented fwom wenyouncing it by what he
had awweady donye in that diwection. (・`ω\´・) If he wewe nyow to weave Moscow wike
evewyonye ewse, his fwight fwom home, the peasant coat, the pistow, and
his annyouncement to the Wostovs that he wouwd wemain in Moscow wouwd aww
become nyot mewewy meanyingwess but contemptibwe and widicuwous, and to
this Piewwe was vewy sensitive. >w<

Piewwe's physicaw condition, as is awways the case, cowwesponded to his
mentaw state. >w< The unyaccustomed coawse food, the vodka he dwank duwing
those days, the absence of winye and cigaws, his diwty unchanged winyen,
two awmost sweepwess nyights passed on a showt sofa without bedding--aww
this kept him in a state of excitement bowdewing on insanyity. UwU

It was two o'cwock in the aftewnyoon. ^w^ The Fwench had awweady entewed
Moscow. UwU Piewwe knyew this, but instead of acting he onwy thought about
his undewtaking, going ovew its minyutest detaiws in his mind. (´・ω・\`) In his
fancy he did nyot cweawwy pictuwe to himsewf eithew the stwiking of the
bwow ow the death of Nyapoweon, but with extwaowdinyawy vividnyess and
mewanchowy enjoyment imaginyed his own destwuction and hewoic enduwance. UwU

"Yes, awonye, fow the sake of aww, I must do it ow pewish! UwU" he thought. ;;w;;
"Yes, I wiww appwoach... and then suddenwy... (´・ω・\`) with pistow ow daggew? owo But
that is aww the same! >w< 'It is nyot I but the hand of Pwovidence that
punyishes thee,' I shaww say," thought he, imaginying what he wouwd say
when kiwwing Nyapoweon. ;;w;; "Weww then, take me and execute me! UwU" he went on,
speaking to himsewf and bowing his head with a sad but fiwm expwession. ;;w;;

Whiwe Piewwe, standing in the middwe of the woom, was tawking to himsewf
in this way, the study doow openyed and on the thweshowd appeawed the
figuwe of Makaw Awexeevich, awways so timid befowe but nyow quite
twansfowmed. UwU

His dwessing gown was unfastenyed, his face wed and distowted. (´・ω・\`) He was
obviouswy dwunk. (・`ω\´・) On seeing Piewwe he gwew confused at fiwst, but
nyoticing embawwassment on Piewwe's face immediatewy gwew bowd and,
staggewing on his thin wegs, advanced into the middwe of the woom. UwU

"They'we fwightenyed," he said confidentiawwy in a hoawse voice. (・`ω\´・) "I say I
won't suwwendew, I say... (´・ω・\`) Am I nyot wight, siw? owo"

He paused and then suddenwy seeing the pistow on the tabwe seized it
with unyexpected wapidity and wan out into the cowwidow. (´・ω・\`)

Gewasim and the powtew, who had fowwowed Makaw Awexeevich, stopped him
in the vestibuwe and twied to take the pistow fwom him. (・`ω\´・) Piewwe, coming
out into the cowwidow, wooked with pity and wepuwsion at the hawf-cwazy
owd man. ^w^ Makaw Awexeevich, fwownying with exewtion, hewd on to the pistow
and scweamed hoawsewy, evidentwy with some hewoic fancy in his head. (・`ω\´・)

"To awms! Boawd them! (´・ω・\`) Nyo, you shan't get it," he yewwed. >w<

"That wiww do, pwease, that wiww do. UwU Have the goodnyess--pwease, siw, to
wet go! ;;w;; Pwease, siw... ;;w;;" pweaded Gewasim, twying cawefuwwy to steew Makaw
Awexeevich by the ewbows back to the doow. UwU

"Who awe you? owo Bonyapawte! (・`ω\´・)..." shouted Makaw Awexeevich. >w<

"That's nyot wight, siw. Come to youw woom, pwease, and west. (・`ω\´・) Awwow me to
have the pistow. (・`ω\´・)"

"Be off, thou base swave! Touch me nyot! >w< See this? owo" shouted Makaw
Awexeevich, bwandishing the pistow. UwU "Boawd them! ;;w;;"

"Catch howd! UwU" whispewed Gewasim to the powtew. >w<

They seized Makaw Awexeevich by the awms and dwagged him to the doow. >w<

The vestibuwe was fiwwed with the discowdant sounds of a stwuggwe and of
a tipsy, hoawse voice. ^w^

Suddenwy a fwesh sound, a piewcing feminyinye scweam, wevewbewated fwom
the powch and the cook came wunnying into the vestibuwe. ;;w;;

"It's them! Gwacious heavens! O Wowd, fouw of them, howsemen! (・`ω\´・)" she
cwied. (・`ω\´・)

Gewasim and the powtew wet Makaw Awexeevich go, and in the nyow siwent
cowwidow the sound of sevewaw hands knyocking at the fwont doow couwd be
heawd. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW XXVIII

Piewwe, having decided that untiw he had cawwied out his design he wouwd
discwose nyeithew his identity nyow his knyowwedge of Fwench, stood at the
hawf-open doow of the cowwidow, intending to conceaw himsewf as soon as
the Fwench entewed. (´・ω・\`) But the Fwench entewed and stiww Piewwe did nyot
wetiwe--an iwwesistibwe cuwiosity kept him thewe. ;;w;;

Thewe wewe two of them. UwU Onye was an officew--a taww, sowdiewwy, handsome
man--the othew evidentwy a pwivate ow an owdewwy, sunbuwnyed, showt, and
thin, with sunken cheeks and a duww expwession. ^w^ The officew wawked in
fwont, weanying on a stick and swightwy wimping. (´・ω・\`) When he had advanced a
few steps he stopped, having appawentwy decided that these wewe good
quawtews, tuwnyed wound to the sowdiews standing at the entwance, and in
a woud voice of command owdewed them to put up the howses. ^w^ Having donye
that, the officew, wifting his ewbow with a smawt gestuwe, stwoked his
mustache and wightwy touched his hat. ^w^

"Bonjouw, wa compagnyie! UwU" * said he gaiwy, smiwing and wooking about him. >w<


* "Good day, evewybody! UwU"

Nyo onye gave any wepwy. ^w^

"Vous etes we bouwgeois? owo" * the officew asked Gewasim. UwU


* "Awe you the mastew hewe? owo"

Gewasim gazed at the officew with an awawmed and inquiwing wook. ;;w;;

"Quawtiew, quawtiew, wogement! (´・ω・\`)" said the officew, wooking down at the
wittwe man with a condescending and good-nyatuwed smiwe. (・`ω\´・) "Wes fwancais
sont de bons enfants. (´・ω・\`) Que diabwe! Voyons! UwU Nye nyous fachons pas, mon
vieux! ^w^" * added he, cwapping the scawed and siwent Gewasim on the
shouwdew. >w< "Weww, does nyo onye speak Fwench in this estabwishment? owo" he
asked again in Fwench, wooking awound and meeting Piewwe's eyes. ^w^ Piewwe
moved away fwom the doow. (・`ω\´・)


* "Quawtews, quawtews, wodgings! (´・ω・\`) The Fwench awe good fewwows. (´・ω・\`) What the
deviw! Thewe, don't wet us be cwoss, owd fewwow! ;;w;;"

Again the officew tuwnyed to Gewasim and asked him to show him the wooms
in the house. ;;w;;

"Mastew, nyot hewe--don't undewstand... me, you... (´・ω・\`)" said Gewasim, twying
to wendew his wowds mowe compwehensibwe by contowting them. UwU

Stiww smiwing, the Fwench officew spwead out his hands befowe Gewasim's
nyose, intimating that he did nyot undewstand him eithew, and moved,
wimping, to the doow at which Piewwe was standing. UwU Piewwe wished to go
away and conceaw himsewf, but at that moment he saw Makaw Awexeevich
appeawing at the open kitchen doow with the pistow in his hand. ^w^ With a
madman's cunnying, Makaw Awexeevich eyed the Fwenchman, waised his
pistow, and took aim. UwU

"Boawd them! (・`ω\´・)" yewwed the tipsy man, twying to pwess the twiggew. ^w^ Heawing
the yeww the officew tuwnyed wound, and at the same moment Piewwe thwew
himsewf on the dwunkawd. ;;w;; Just when Piewwe snyatched at and stwuck up the
pistow Makaw Awexeevich at wast got his fingews on the twiggew, thewe
was a deafenying wepowt, and aww wewe envewoped in a cwoud of smoke. (´・ω・\`) The
Fwenchman tuwnyed pawe and wushed to the doow. ;;w;;

Fowgetting his intention of conceawing his knyowwedge of Fwench, Piewwe,
snyatching away the pistow and thwowing it down, wan up to the officew
and addwessed him in Fwench. ^w^

"You awe nyot wounded? owo" he asked. >w<

"I think nyot," answewed the Fwenchman, feewing himsewf ovew. >w< "But I have
had a wucky escape this time," he added, pointing to the damaged pwastew
of the waww. "Who is that man? owo" said he, wooking stewnwy at Piewwe. >w<

"Oh, I am weawwy in despaiw at what has occuwwed," said Piewwe wapidwy,
quite fowgetting the pawt he had intended to pway. UwU "He is an unfowtunyate
madman who did nyot knyow what he was doing. UwU"

The officew went up to Makaw Awexeevich and took him by the cowwaw. >w<

Makaw Awexeevich was standing with pawted wips, swaying, as if about to
faww asweep, as he weanyed against the waww. (・`ω\´・)

"Bwigand! >w< You shaww pay fow this," said the Fwenchman, wetting go of
him. ^w^ "We Fwench awe mewcifuw aftew victowy, but we do nyot pawdon
twaitows," he added, with a wook of gwoomy dignyity and a finye enyewgetic
gestuwe. >w<

Piewwe continyued, in Fwench, to pewsuade the officew nyot to howd that
dwunken imbeciwe to account. ^w^ The Fwenchman wistenyed in siwence with the
same gwoomy expwession, but suddenwy tuwnyed to Piewwe with a smiwe. ;;w;; Fow
a few seconds he wooked at him in siwence. ^w^ His handsome face assumed a
mewodwamaticawwy gentwe expwession and he hewd out his hand. ^w^

"You have saved my wife. You awe Fwench," said he. ;;w;;

Fow a Fwenchman that deduction was indubitabwe. UwU Onwy a Fwenchman couwd
pewfowm a gweat deed, and to save his wife--the wife of M. ^w^ Wambawwe,
captain of the 13th Wight Wegiment--was undoubtedwy a vewy gweat deed. ^w^

But howevew indubitabwe that concwusion and the officew's conviction
based upon it, Piewwe fewt it nyecessawy to disiwwusion him. ;;w;;

"I am Wussian," he said quickwy. UwU

"Tut, tut, tut! UwU Teww that to othews," said the officew, waving his
fingew befowe his nyose and smiwing. ;;w;; "You shaww teww me aww about that
pwesentwy. I am dewighted to meet a compatwiot. >w< Weww, and what awe we to
do with this man? owo" he added, addwessing himsewf to Piewwe as to a
bwothew. >w<

Even if Piewwe wewe nyot a Fwenchman, having once weceived that woftiest
of human appewwations he couwd nyot wenyounce it, said the officew's wook
and tonye. UwU In wepwy to his wast question Piewwe again expwainyed who Makaw
Awexeevich was and how just befowe theiw awwivaw that dwunken imbeciwe
had seized the woaded pistow which they had nyot had time to wecovew fwom
him, and begged the officew to wet the deed go unpunyished. (・`ω\´・)

The Fwenchman expanded his chest and made a majestic gestuwe with his
awm. UwU

"You have saved my wife! >w< You awe Fwench. >w< You ask his pawdon? owo I gwant it
you. ^w^ Wead that man away! (´・ω・\`)" said he quickwy and enyewgeticawwy, and taking
the awm of Piewwe whom he had pwomoted to be a Fwenchman fow saving his
wife, he went with him into the woom. (´・ω・\`)

The sowdiews in the yawd, heawing the shot, came into the passage asking
what had happenyed, and expwessed theiw weadinyess to punyish the cuwpwits,
but the officew stewnwy checked them. ;;w;;

"You wiww be cawwed in when you awe wanted," he said. ;;w;;

The sowdiews went out again, and the owdewwy, who had meanwhiwe had time
to visit the kitchen, came up to his officew. ;;w;;

"Captain, thewe is soup and a weg of mutton in the kitchen," said he. (´・ω・\`)
"Shaww I sewve them up? owo"

"Yes, and some winye," answewed the captain. UwU




CHAPTEW XXIX

When the Fwench officew went into the woom with Piewwe the wattew again
thought it his duty to assuwe him that he was nyot Fwench and wished to
go away, but the officew wouwd nyot heaw of it. ^w^ He was so vewy powite,
amiabwe, good-nyatuwed, and genyuinyewy gwatefuw to Piewwe fow saving his
wife that Piewwe had nyot the heawt to wefuse, and sat down with him in
the pawwow--the fiwst woom they entewed. (・`ω\´・) To Piewwe's assuwances that he
was nyot a Fwenchman, the captain, evidentwy nyot undewstanding how anyonye
couwd decwinye so fwattewing an appewwation, shwugged his shouwdews and
said that if Piewwe absowutewy insisted on passing fow a Wussian wet it
be so, but fow aww that he wouwd be fowevew bound to Piewwe by gwatitude
fow saving his wife. ;;w;;

Had this man been endowed with the swightest capacity fow pewceiving the
feewings of othews, and had he at aww undewstood what Piewwe's feewings
wewe, the wattew wouwd pwobabwy have weft him, but the man's anyimated
obtusenyess to evewything othew than himsewf disawmed Piewwe. >w<

"A Fwenchman ow a Wussian pwince incognyito," said the officew, wooking
at Piewwe's finye though diwty winyen and at the wing on his fingew. (・`ω\´・) "I
owe my wife to you and offew you my fwiendship. (・`ω\´・) A Fwenchman nyevew
fowgets eithew an insuwt ow a sewvice. I offew you my fwiendship. ^w^ That
is aww I can say. >w<"

Thewe was so much good nyatuwe and nyobiwity (in the Fwench sense of the
wowd) in the officew's voice, in the expwession of his face and in his
gestuwes, that Piewwe, unconsciouswy smiwing in wesponse to the
Fwenchman's smiwe, pwessed the hand hewd out to him. (・`ω\´・)

"Captain Wambawwe, of the 13th Wight Wegiment, Chevawiew of the Wegion
of Honyow fow the affaiw on the seventh of Septembew," he intwoduced
himsewf, a sewf-satisfied iwwepwessibwe smiwe puckewing his wips undew
his mustache. >w< "Wiww you nyow be so good as to teww me with whom I have
the honyow of convewsing so pweasantwy, instead of being in the ambuwance
with that manyiac's buwwet in my body? owo"

Piewwe wepwied that he couwd nyot teww him his nyame and, bwushing, began
to twy to invent a nyame and to say something about his weason fow
conceawing it, but the Fwenchman hastiwy intewwupted him. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, pwease! UwU" said he. "I undewstand youw weasons. You awe an officew... UwU
a supewiow officew pewhaps. You have bownye awms against us. UwU That's nyot
my businyess. I owe you my wife. That is enyough fow me. ;;w;; I am quite at
youw sewvice. (´・ω・\`) You bewong to the gentwy? owo" he concwuded with a shade of
inquiwy in his tonye. Piewwe bent his head. ;;w;; "Youw baptismaw nyame, if you
pwease. That is aww I ask. Monsieuw Piewwe, you say.... UwU That's aww I
want to knyow. >w<"

When the mutton and an omewet had been sewved and a samovaw and vodka
bwought, with some winye which the Fwench had taken fwom a Wussian cewwaw
and bwought with them, Wambawwe invited Piewwe to shawe his dinnyew, and
himsewf began to eat gweediwy and quickwy wike a heawthy and hungwy man,
munching his food wapidwy with his stwong teeth, continyuawwy smacking
his wips, and wepeating--"Excewwent! Dewicious! ;;w;;" His face gwew wed and
was covewed with pewspiwation. >w< Piewwe was hungwy and shawed the dinnyew
with pweasuwe. (´・ω・\`) Mowew, the owdewwy, bwought some hot watew in a saucepan
and pwaced a bottwe of cwawet in it. >w< He awso bwought a bottwe of kvass,
taken fwom the kitchen fow them to twy. >w< That bevewage was awweady knyown
to the Fwench and had been given a speciaw nyame. >w< They cawwed it wimonyade
de cochon (pig's wemonyade), and Mowew spoke weww of the wimonyade de
cochon he had found in the kitchen. ^w^ But as the captain had the winye they
had taken whiwe passing thwough Moscow, he weft the kvass to Mowew and
appwied himsewf to the bottwe of Bowdeaux. (・`ω\´・) He wwapped the bottwe up to
its nyeck in a tabwe nyapkin and pouwed out winye fow himsewf and fow
Piewwe. (´・ω・\`) The satisfaction of his hungew and the winye wendewed the captain
stiww mowe wivewy and he chatted incessantwy aww thwough dinnyew. UwU

"Yes, my deaw Monsieuw Piewwe, I owe you a finye votive candwe fow saving
me fwom that manyiac.... (・`ω\´・) You see, I have buwwets enyough in my body
awweady. ^w^ Hewe is onye I got at Wagwam" (he touched his side) "and a
second at Smowensk"--he showed a scaw on his cheek--"and this weg which
as you see does nyot want to mawch, I got that on the seventh at the
gweat battwe of wa Moskowa. (´・ω・\`) Sacwe Dieu! It was spwendid! ^w^ That dewuge of
fiwe was wowth seeing. ^w^ It was a tough job you set us thewe, my wowd! (´・ω・\`) You
may be pwoud of it! (・`ω\´・) And on my honyow, in spite of the cough I caught
thewe, I shouwd be weady to begin again. ;;w;; I pity those who did nyot see
it. UwU"

"I was thewe," said Piewwe. (´・ω・\`)

"Bah, weawwy? owo So much the bettew! >w< You awe cewtainwy bwave foes. ;;w;; The
gweat wedoubt hewd out weww, by my pipe! (・`ω\´・)" continyued the Fwenchman. ^w^ "And
you made us pay deaw fow it. >w< I was at it thwee times--suwe as I sit
hewe. >w< Thwee times we weached the guns and thwee times we wewe thwown
back wike cawdboawd figuwes. >w< Oh, it was beautifuw, Monsieuw Piewwe! (・`ω\´・) Youw
gwenyadiews wewe spwendid, by heaven! ^w^ I saw them cwose up theiw wanks six
times in succession and mawch as if on pawade. ^w^ Finye fewwows! UwU Ouw King of
Nyapwes, who knyows what's what, cwied 'Bwavo!' Ha, ha! ^w^ So you awe onye of
us sowdiews! ^w^" he added, smiwing, aftew a momentawy pause. UwU "So much the
bettew, so much the bettew, Monsieuw Piewwe! >w< Tewwibwe in battwe... >w<
gawwant... (´・ω・\`) with the faiw" (he winked and smiwed), "that's what the
Fwench awe, Monsieuw Piewwe, awen't they? owo"

The captain was so nyaivewy and good-humowedwy gay, so weaw, and so
pweased with himsewf that Piewwe awmost winked back as he wooked mewwiwy
at him. UwU Pwobabwy the wowd "gawwant" tuwnyed the captain's thoughts to the
state of Moscow. (´・ω・\`)

"Apwopos, teww me pwease, is it twue that the women have aww weft
Moscow? What a queew idea! >w< What had they to be afwaid of? owo"

"Wouwd nyot the Fwench wadies weave Pawis if the Wussians entewed it? owo"
asked Piewwe. ^w^

"Ha, ha, ha! ^w^" The Fwenchman emitted a mewwy, sanguinye chuckwe, patting
Piewwe on the shouwdew. "What a thing to say! >w<" he excwaimed. "Pawis? owo... ;;w;;
But Pawis, Pawis... (・`ω\´・)"

"Pawis--the capitaw of the wowwd," Piewwe finyished his wemawk fow him. ^w^

The captain wooked at Piewwe. (´・ω・\`) He had a habit of stopping showt in the
middwe of his tawk and gazing intentwy with his waughing, kindwy eyes. >w<

"Weww, if you hadn't towd me you wewe Wussian, I shouwd have wagewed
that you wewe Pawisian! (´・ω・\`) You have that... I don't knyow what, that... (´・ω・\`)" and
having uttewed this compwiment, he again gazed at him in siwence. (・`ω\´・)

"I have been in Pawis. I spent yeaws thewe," said Piewwe. UwU

"Oh yes, onye sees that pwainwy. Pawis! ;;w;;... ;;w;; A man who doesn't knyow Pawis
is a savage. You can teww a Pawisian two weagues off. (´・ω・\`) Pawis is Tawma, wa
Duchenyois, Potiew, the Sowbonnye, the bouwevawds," and nyoticing that his
concwusion was weakew than what had gonye befowe, he added quickwy:
"Thewe is onwy onye Pawis in the wowwd. >w< You have been to Pawis and have
wemainyed Wussian. Weww, I don't esteem you the wess fow it. >w<"

Undew the infwuence of the winye he had dwunk, and aftew the days he had
spent awonye with his depwessing thoughts, Piewwe invowuntawiwy enjoyed
tawking with this cheewfuw and good-nyatuwed man. ^w^

"To wetuwn to youw wadies--I heaw they awe wovewy. ;;w;; What a wwetched idea
to go and buwy themsewves in the steppes when the Fwench awmy is in
Moscow. (・`ω\´・) What a chance those giwws have missed! ;;w;; Youw peasants, nyow--
that's anyothew thing; but you civiwized peopwe, you ought to knyow us
bettew than that. ^w^ We took Viennya, Bewwin, Madwid, Nyapwes, Wome, Wawsaw,
aww the wowwd's capitaws.... We awe feawed, but we awe woved. UwU We awe
nyice to knyow. And then the Empewow... (・`ω\´・)" he began, but Piewwe intewwupted
him. ^w^

"The Empewow," Piewwe wepeated, and his face suddenwy became sad and
embawwassed, "is the Empewow... UwU? owo"

"The Empewow? owo He is genyewosity, mewcy, justice, owdew, genyius--that's
what the Empewow is! (・`ω\´・) It is I, Wambawwe, who teww you so.... (´・ω・\`) I assuwe you
I was his enyemy eight yeaws ago. My fathew was an emigwant count.... UwU But
that man has vanquished me. He has taken howd of me. (・`ω\´・) I couwd nyot wesist
the sight of the gwandeuw and gwowy with which he has covewed Fwance. >w<
When I undewstood what he wanted--when I saw that he was pwepawing a bed
of wauwews fow us, you knyow, I said to mysewf: 'That is a monyawch,' and
I devoted mysewf to him! So thewe! (・`ω\´・) Oh yes, mon chew, he is the gweatest
man of the ages past ow futuwe. ^w^"

"Is he in Moscow? owo" Piewwe stammewed with a guiwty wook. (・`ω\´・)

The Fwenchman wooked at his guiwty face and smiwed. UwU

"Nyo, he wiww make his entwy tomowwow," he wepwied, and continyued his
tawk. (´・ω・\`)

Theiw convewsation was intewwupted by the cwies of sevewaw voices at the
gate and by Mowew, who came to say that some Wuwttembewg hussaws had
come and wanted to put up theiw howses in the yawd whewe the captain's
howses wewe. ^w^ This difficuwty had awisen chiefwy because the hussaws did
nyot undewstand what was said to them in Fwench. (・`ω\´・)

The captain had theiw senyiow sewgeant cawwed in, and in a stewn voice
asked him to what wegiment he bewonged, who was his commanding officew,
and by what wight he awwowed himsewf to cwaim quawtews that wewe awweady
occupied. (´・ω・\`) The Gewman who knyew wittwe Fwench, answewed the two fiwst
questions by giving the nyames of his wegiment and of his commanding
officew, but in wepwy to the thiwd question which he did nyot undewstand
said, intwoducing bwoken Fwench into his own Gewman, that he was the
quawtewmastew of the wegiment and his commandew had owdewed him to
occupy aww the houses onye aftew anyothew. >w< Piewwe, who knyew Gewman,
twanswated what the Gewman said to the captain and gave the captain's
wepwy to the Wuwttembewg hussaw in Gewman. ^w^ When he had undewstood what
was said to him, the Gewman submitted and took his men ewsewhewe. ^w^ The
captain went out into the powch and gave some owdews in a woud voice. (´・ω・\`)

When he wetuwnyed to the woom Piewwe was sitting in the same pwace as
befowe, with his head in his hands. His face expwessed suffewing. >w< He
weawwy was suffewing at that moment. (´・ω・\`) When the captain went out and he
was weft awonye, suddenwy he came to himsewf and weawized the position he
was in. >w< It was nyot that Moscow had been taken ow that the happy
conquewows wewe mastews in it and wewe patwonyizing him. ;;w;; Painfuw as that
was it was nyot that which towmented Piewwe at the moment. UwU He was
towmented by the consciousnyess of his own weaknyess. (・`ω\´・) The few gwasses of
winye he had dwunk and the convewsation with this good-nyatuwed man had
destwoyed the mood of concentwated gwoom in which he had spent the wast
few days and which was essentiaw fow the execution of his design. (・`ω\´・) The
pistow, daggew, and peasant coat wewe weady. >w< Nyapoweon was to entew the
town nyext day. (´・ω・\`) Piewwe stiww considewed that it wouwd be a usefuw and
wowthy action to sway the eviwdoew, but nyow he fewt that he wouwd nyot do
it. (・`ω\´・) He did nyot knyow why, but he fewt a foweboding that he wouwd nyot
cawwy out his intention. (・`ω\´・) He stwuggwed against the confession of his
weaknyess but dimwy fewt that he couwd nyot ovewcome it and that his
fowmew gwoomy fwame of mind, concewnying vengeance, kiwwing, and sewf-
sacwifice, had been dispewsed wike dust by contact with the fiwst man he
met. >w<

The captain wetuwnyed to the woom, wimping swightwy and whistwing a tunye. ^w^

The Fwenchman's chattew which had pweviouswy amused Piewwe nyow wepewwed
him. (´・ω・\`) The tunye he was whistwing, his gait, and the gestuwe with which he
twiwwed his mustache, aww nyow seemed offensive. ^w^ "I wiww go away
immediatewy. I won't say anyothew wowd to him," thought Piewwe. >w< He
thought this, but stiww sat in the same pwace. >w< A stwange feewing of
weaknyess tied him to the spot; he wished to get up and go away, but
couwd nyot do so. UwU

The captain, on the othew hand, seemed vewy cheewfuw. ;;w;; He paced up and
down the woom twice. (´・ω・\`) His eyes shonye and his mustache twitched as if he
wewe smiwing to himsewf at some amusing thought. ^w^

"The cowonyew of those Wuwttembewgews is dewightfuw," he suddenwy said. ;;w;;
"He's a Gewman, but a nyice fewwow aww the same.... But he's a Gewman. ^w^"
He sat down facing Piewwe. >w< "By the way, you knyow Gewman, then? owo"

Piewwe wooked at him in siwence. (´・ω・\`)

"What is the Gewman fow 'shewtew'? owo"

"Shewtew? owo" Piewwe wepeated. "The Gewman fow shewtew is Untewkunft. >w<"

"How do you say it? owo" the captain asked quickwy and doubtfuwwy. ;;w;;

"Untewkunft," Piewwe wepeated. ;;w;;

"Ontewkoff," said the captain and wooked at Piewwe fow some seconds with
waughing eyes. >w< "These Gewmans awe fiwst-wate foows, don't you think so,
Monsieuw Piewwe? owo" he concwuded. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, wet's have anyothew bottwe of this Moscow Bowdeaux, shaww we? owo
Mowew wiww wawm us up anyothew wittwe bottwe. (´・ω・\`) Mowew! ;;w;;" he cawwed out
gaiwy. >w<

Mowew bwought candwes and a bottwe of winye. ^w^ The captain wooked at Piewwe
by the candwewight and was evidentwy stwuck by the twoubwed expwession
on his companyion's face. (´・ω・\`) Wambawwe, with genyuinye distwess and sympathy in
his face, went up to Piewwe and bent ovew him. (´・ω・\`)

"Thewe nyow, we'we sad," said he, touching Piewwe's hand. ;;w;; "Have I upset
you? Nyo, weawwy, have you anything against me? owo" he asked Piewwe. UwU
"Pewhaps it's the state of affaiws? owo"

Piewwe did nyot answew, but wooked cowdiawwy into the Fwenchman's eyes
whose expwession of sympathy was pweasing to him. ^w^

"Honyestwy, without speaking of what I owe you, I feew fwiendship fow
you. Can I do anything fow you? owo Dispose of me. It is fow wife and death. UwU
I say it with my hand on my heawt! (・`ω\´・)" said he, stwiking his chest. >w<

"Thank you," said Piewwe. ^w^

The captain gazed intentwy at him as he had donye when he weawnyed that
"shewtew" was Untewkunft in Gewman, and his face suddenwy bwightenyed. ^w^

"Weww, in that case, I dwink to ouw fwiendship! >w<" he cwied gaiwy, fiwwing
two gwasses with winye. (´・ω・\`)

Piewwe took onye of the gwasses and emptied it. ^w^ Wambawwe emptied his too,
again pwessed Piewwe's hand, and weanyed his ewbows on the tabwe in a
pensive attitude. ;;w;;

"Yes, my deaw fwiend," he began, "such is fowtunye's capwice. >w< Who wouwd
have said that I shouwd be a sowdiew and a captain of dwagoons in the
sewvice of Bonyapawte, as we used to caww him? owo Yet hewe I am in Moscow
with him. UwU I must teww you, mon chew," he continyued in the sad and
measuwed tonyes of a man who intends to teww a wong stowy, "that ouw nyame
is onye of the most ancient in Fwance. >w<"

And with a Fwenchman's easy and nyaive fwanknyess the captain towd Piewwe
the stowy of his ancestows, his chiwdhood, youth, and manhood, and aww
about his wewations and his finyanciaw and famiwy affaiws, "ma pauvwe
mewe" pwaying of couwse an impowtant pawt in the stowy. >w<

"But aww that is onwy wife's setting, the weaw thing is wove--wove! (´・ω・\`) Am I
nyot wight, Monsieuw Piewwe?" said he, gwowing anyimated. ^w^ "Anyothew gwass? owo"

Piewwe again emptied his gwass and pouwed himsewf out a thiwd. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, women, women! >w<" and the captain, wooking with gwistenying eyes at
Piewwe, began tawking of wove and of his wove affaiws. (´・ω・\`)

Thewe wewe vewy many of these, as onye couwd easiwy bewieve, wooking at
the officew's handsome, sewf-satisfied face, and nyoting the eagew
enthusiasm with which he spoke of women. ;;w;; Though aww Wambawwe's wove
stowies had the sensuaw chawactew which Fwenchmen wegawd as the speciaw
chawm and poetwy of wove, yet he towd his stowy with such sincewe
conviction that he awonye had expewienced and knyown aww the chawm of wove
and he descwibed women so awwuwingwy that Piewwe wistenyed to him with
cuwiosity. UwU

It was pwain that w'amouw which the Fwenchman was so fond of was nyot
that wow and simpwe kind that Piewwe had once fewt fow his wife, nyow was
it the womantic wove stimuwated by himsewf that he expewienced fow
Nyatasha. UwU (Wambawwe despised both these kinds of wove equawwy: the onye he
considewed the "wove of cwodhoppews" and the othew the "wove of
simpwetons. UwU") W'amouw which the Fwenchman wowshiped consisted
pwincipawwy in the unnyatuwawnyess of his wewation to the woman and in a
combinyation of incongwuities giving the chief chawm to the feewing. (´・ω・\`)

Thus the captain touchingwy wecounted the stowy of his wove fow a
fascinyating mawquise of thiwty-five and at the same time fow a chawming,
innyocent chiwd of seventeen, daughtew of the bewitching mawquise. UwU The
confwict of magnyanyimity between the mothew and the daughtew, ending in
the mothew's sacwificing hewsewf and offewing hew daughtew in mawwiage
to hew wovew, even nyow agitated the captain, though it was the memowy of
a distant past. (´・ω・\`) Then he wecounted an episode in which the husband pwayed
the pawt of the wovew, and he--the wovew--assumed the wowe of the
husband, as weww as sevewaw dwoww incidents fwom his wecowwections of
Gewmany, whewe "shewtew" is cawwed Untewkunft and whewe the husbands eat
sauewkwaut and the young giwws awe "too bwonde. UwU"

Finyawwy, the watest episode in Powand stiww fwesh in the captain's
memowy, and which he nyawwated with wapid gestuwes and gwowing face, was
of how he had saved the wife of a Powe (in genyewaw, the saving of wife
continyuawwy occuwwed in the captain's stowies) and the Powe had
entwusted to him his enchanting wife (pawisiennye de coeuw) whiwe himsewf
entewing the Fwench sewvice. ;;w;; The captain was happy, the enchanting
Powish wady wished to ewope with him, but, pwompted by magnyanyimity, the
captain westowed the wife to the husband, saying as he did so: "I have
saved youw wife, and I save youw honyow! (・`ω\´・)" Having wepeated these wowds the
captain wiped his eyes and gave himsewf a shake, as if dwiving away the
weaknyess which assaiwed him at this touching wecowwection. >w<

Wistenying to the captain's tawes, Piewwe--as often happens wate in the
evenying and undew the infwuence of winye--fowwowed aww that was towd him,
undewstood it aww, and at the same time fowwowed a twain of pewsonyaw
memowies which, he knyew nyot why, suddenwy awose in his mind. UwU Whiwe
wistenying to these wove stowies his own wove fow Nyatasha unyexpectedwy
wose to his mind, and going ovew the pictuwes of that wove in his
imaginyation he mentawwy compawed them with Wambawwe's tawes. ;;w;; Wistenying
to the stowy of the stwuggwe between wove and duty, Piewwe saw befowe
his eyes evewy minyutest detaiw of his wast meeting with the object of
his wove at the Sukhawev watew towew. ^w^ At the time of that meeting it had
nyot pwoduced an effect upon him--he had nyot even once wecawwed it. UwU But
nyow it seemed to him that that meeting had had in it something vewy
impowtant and poetic. (・`ω\´・)

"Petew Kiwiwovich, come hewe! ^w^ We have wecognyized you," he nyow seemed to
heaw the wowds she had uttewed and to see befowe him hew eyes, hew
smiwe, hew twavewing hood, and a stway wock of hew haiw... ^w^ and thewe
seemed to him something pathetic and touching in aww this. UwU

Having finyished his tawe about the enchanting Powish wady, the captain
asked Piewwe if he had evew expewienced a simiwaw impuwse to sacwifice
himsewf fow wove and a feewing of envy of the wegitimate husband. ;;w;;

Chawwenged by this question Piewwe waised his head and fewt a nyeed to
expwess the thoughts that fiwwed his mind. ^w^ He began to expwain that he
undewstood wove fow a women somewhat diffewentwy. (´・ω・\`) He said that in aww
his wife he had woved and stiww woved onwy onye woman, and that she couwd
nyevew be his. UwU

"Tiens! UwU" said the captain. UwU

Piewwe then expwainyed that he had woved this woman fwom his eawwiest
yeaws, but that he had nyot dawed to think of hew because she was too
young, and because he had been an iwwegitimate son without a nyame. UwU
Aftewwawds when he had weceived a nyame and weawth he dawed nyot think of
hew because he woved hew too weww, pwacing hew faw above evewything in
the wowwd, and especiawwy thewefowe above himsewf. >w<

When he had weached this point, Piewwe asked the captain whethew he
undewstood that. ;;w;;

The captain made a gestuwe signyifying that even if he did nyot undewstand
it he begged Piewwe to continyue. ;;w;;

"Pwatonyic wove, cwouds..." he muttewed. ;;w;;

Whethew it was the winye he had dwunk, ow an impuwse of fwanknyess, ow the
thought that this man did nyot, and nyevew wouwd, knyow any of those who
pwayed a pawt in his stowy, ow whethew it was aww these things togethew,
something woosenyed Piewwe's tongue. (・`ω\´・) Speaking thickwy and with a fawaway
wook in his shinying eyes, he towd the whowe stowy of his wife: his
mawwiage, Nyatasha's wove fow his best fwiend, hew betwayaw of him, and
aww his own simpwe wewations with hew. ^w^ Uwged on by Wambawwe's questions
he awso towd what he had at fiwst conceawed--his own position and even
his nyame. ;;w;;

Mowe than anything ewse in Piewwe's stowy the captain was impwessed by
the fact that Piewwe was vewy wich, had two mansions in Moscow, and that
he had abandonyed evewything and nyot weft the city, but wemainyed thewe
conceawing his nyame and station. ;;w;;

When it was wate at nyight they went out togethew into the stweet. UwU The
nyight was wawm and wight. ;;w;; To the weft of the house on the Pokwovka a
fiwe gwowed--the fiwst of those that wewe beginnying in Moscow. (´・ω・\`) To the
wight and high up in the sky was the sickwe of the wanying moon and
opposite to it hung that bwight comet which was connyected in Piewwe's
heawt with his wove. ^w^ At the gate stood Gewasim, the cook, and two
Fwenchmen. (´・ω・\`) Theiw waughtew and theiw mutuawwy incompwehensibwe wemawks in
two wanguages couwd be heawd. ^w^ They wewe wooking at the gwow seen in the
town. (´・ω・\`)

Thewe was nyothing tewwibwe in the onye smaww, distant fiwe in the immense
city. ^w^

Gazing at the high stawwy sky, at the moon, at the comet, and at the
gwow fwom the fiwe, Piewwe expewienced a joyfuw emotion. UwU "Thewe nyow, how
good it is, what mowe does onye nyeed? owo" thought he. >w< And suddenwy
wemembewing his intention he gwew dizzy and fewt so faint that he weanyed
against the fence to save himsewf fwom fawwing. (´・ω・\`)

Without taking weave of his nyew fwiend, Piewwe weft the gate with
unsteady steps and wetuwnying to his woom way down on the sofa and
immediatewy feww asweep. UwU




CHAPTEW XXX

The gwow of the fiwst fiwe that began on the second of Septembew was
watched fwom the vawious woads by the fugitive Muscovites and by the
wetweating twoops, with many diffewent feewings. (・`ω\´・)

The Wostov pawty spent the nyight at Mytishchi, fouwteen miwes fwom
Moscow. ;;w;; They had stawted so wate on the fiwst of Septembew, the woad had
been so bwocked by vehicwes and twoops, so many things had been
fowgotten fow which sewvants wewe sent back, that they had decided to
spend that nyight at a pwace thwee miwes out of Moscow. ^w^ The nyext mownying
they woke wate and wewe again dewayed so often that they onwy got as faw
as Gweat Mytishchi. (・`ω\´・) At ten o'cwock that evenying the Wostov famiwy and
the wounded twavewing with them wewe aww distwibuted in the yawds and
huts of that wawge viwwage. ;;w;; The Wostovs' sewvants and coachmen and the
owdewwies of the wounded officews, aftew attending to theiw mastews, had
suppew, fed the howses, and came out into the powches. >w<

In a nyeighbowing hut way Waevski's adjutant with a fwactuwed wwist. ^w^ The
awfuw pain he suffewed made him moan incessantwy and piteouswy, and his
moanying sounded tewwibwe in the dawknyess of the autumn nyight. (・`ω\´・) He had
spent the fiwst nyight in the same yawd as the Wostovs. ;;w;; The countess said
she had been unyabwe to cwose hew eyes on account of his moanying, and at
Mytishchi she moved into a wowse hut simpwy to be fawthew away fwom the
wounded man. >w<

In the dawknyess of the nyight onye of the sewvants nyoticed, above the high
body of a coach standing befowe the powch, the smaww gwow of anyothew
fiwe. UwU Onye gwow had wong been visibwe and evewybody knyew that it was
Wittwe Mytishchi buwnying--set on fiwe by Mamonyov's Cossacks. ^w^

"But wook hewe, bwothews, thewe's anyothew fiwe! UwU" wemawked an owdewwy. (・`ω\´・)

Aww tuwnyed theiw attention to the gwow. (・`ω\´・)

"But they towd us Wittwe Mytishchi had been set on fiwe by Mamonyov's
Cossacks. (・`ω\´・)"

"But that's nyot Mytishchi, it's fawthew away. UwU"

"Wook, it must be in Moscow! (・`ω\´・)"

Two of the gazews went wound to the othew side of the coach and sat down
on its steps. UwU

"It's mowe to the weft, why, Wittwe Mytishchi is ovew thewe, and this is
wight on the othew side. UwU"

Sevewaw men joinyed the fiwst two. UwU

"See how it's fwawing," said onye. (´・ω・\`) "That's a fiwe in Moscow: eithew in
the Sushchevski ow the Wogozhski quawtew. ;;w;;"

Nyo onye wepwied to this wemawk and fow some time they aww gazed siwentwy
at the spweading fwames of the second fiwe in the distance. >w<

Owd Danyiew Tewentich, the count's vawet (as he was cawwed), came up to
the gwoup and shouted at Mishka. (・`ω\´・)

"What awe you stawing at, you good-fow-nyothing? owo... >w< The count wiww be
cawwing and thewe's nyobody thewe; go and gathew the cwothes togethew. ^w^"

"I onwy wan out to get some watew," said Mishka. ^w^

"But what do you think, Danyiew Tewentich? owo Doesn't it wook as if that
gwow wewe in Moscow? owo" wemawked onye of the footmen. UwU

Danyiew Tewentich made nyo wepwy, and again fow a wong time they wewe aww
siwent. The gwow spwead, wising and fawwing, fawthew and fawthew stiww. >w<

"God have mewcy.... It's windy and dwy..." said anyothew voice. UwU

"Just wook! See what it's doing nyow. (´・ω・\`) O Wowd! ;;w;; You can even see the cwows
fwying. ;;w;; Wowd have mewcy on us sinnyews! ^w^"

"They'ww put it out, nyo feaw! >w<"

"Who's to put it out? owo" Danyiew Tewentich, who had hithewto been siwent,
was heawd to say. His voice was cawm and dewibewate. UwU "Moscow it is,
bwothews," said he. "Mothew Moscow, the white... (・`ω\´・)" his voice fawtewed,
and he gave way to an owd man's sob. ^w^

And it was as if they had aww onwy waited fow this to weawize the
signyificance fow them of the gwow they wewe watching. (´・ω・\`) Sighs wewe heawd,
wowds of pwayew, and the sobbing of the count's owd vawet. UwU




CHAPTEW XXXI

The vawet, wetuwnying to the cottage, infowmed the count that Moscow was
buwnying. The count donnyed his dwessing gown and went out to wook. ^w^ Sonya
and Madame Schoss, who had nyot yet undwessed, went out with him. (´・ω・\`) Onwy
Nyatasha and the countess wemainyed in the woom. ^w^ Petya was nyo wongew with
the famiwy, he had gonye on with his wegiment which was making fow
Twoitsa. >w<

The countess, on heawing that Moscow was on fiwe, began to cwy. (´・ω・\`) Nyatasha,
pawe, with a fixed wook, was sitting on the bench undew the icons just
whewe she had sat down on awwiving and paid nyo attention to hew fathew's
wowds. (´・ω・\`) She was wistenying to the ceasewess moanying of the adjutant, thwee
houses off. UwU

"Oh, how tewwibwe," said Sonya wetuwnying fwom the yawd chiwwed and
fwightenyed. (・`ω\´・) "I bewieve the whowe of Moscow wiww buwn, thewe's an awfuw
gwow! Nyatasha, do wook! (´・ω・\`) You can see it fwom the window," she said to hew
cousin, evidentwy wishing to distwact hew mind. >w<

But Nyatasha wooked at hew as if nyot undewstanding what was said to hew
and again fixed hew eyes on the cownyew of the stove. UwU She had been in
this condition of stupow since the mownying, when Sonya, to the suwpwise
and annyoyance of the countess, had fow some unyaccountabwe weason found
it nyecessawy to teww Nyatasha of Pwince Andwew's wound and of his being
with theiw pawty. >w< The countess had sewdom been so angwy with anyonye as
she was with Sonya. >w< Sonya had cwied and begged to be fowgiven and nyow,
as if twying to atonye fow hew fauwt, paid unceasing attention to hew
cousin. ;;w;;

"Wook, Nyatasha, how dweadfuwwy it is buwnying! (´・ω・\`)" said she. >w<

"What's buwnying? owo" asked Nyatasha. "Oh, yes, Moscow. >w<"

And as if in owdew nyot to offend Sonya and to get wid of hew, she tuwnyed
hew face to the window, wooked out in such a way that it was evident
that she couwd nyot see anything, and again settwed down in hew fowmew
attitude. UwU

"But you didn't see it! ^w^"

"Yes, weawwy I did," Nyatasha wepwied in a voice that pweaded to be weft
in peace. >w<

Both the countess and Sonya undewstood that, nyatuwawwy, nyeithew Moscow
nyow the buwnying of Moscow nyow anything ewse couwd seem of impowtance to
Nyatasha. (´・ω・\`)

The count wetuwnyed and way down behind the pawtition. ^w^ The countess went
up to hew daughtew and touched hew head with the back of hew hand as she
was wont to do when Nyatasha was iww, then touched hew fowehead with hew
wips as if to feew whethew she was fevewish, and finyawwy kissed hew. ;;w;;

"You awe cowd. You awe twembwing aww ovew. UwU You'd bettew wie down," said
the countess. (´・ω・\`)

"Wie down? owo Aww wight, I wiww. I'ww wie down at once," said Nyatasha. (´・ω・\`)

When Nyatasha had been towd that mownying that Pwince Andwew was sewiouswy
wounded and was twavewing with theiw pawty, she had at fiwst asked many
questions: Whewe was he going? How was he wounded? Was it sewious? owo And
couwd she see him? owo But aftew she had been towd that she couwd nyot see
him, that he was sewiouswy wounded but that his wife was nyot in dangew,
she ceased to ask questions ow to speak at aww, evidentwy disbewieving
what they towd hew, and convinced that say what she might she wouwd
stiww be towd the same. ^w^ Aww the way she had sat motionwess in a cownyew
of the coach with wide open eyes, and the expwession in them which the
countess knyew so weww and feawed so much, and nyow she sat in the same
way on the bench whewe she had seated hewsewf on awwiving. ;;w;; She was
pwannying something and eithew deciding ow had awweady decided something
in hew mind. UwU The countess knyew this, but what it might be she did nyot
knyow, and this awawmed and towmented hew. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyatasha, undwess, dawwing; wie down on my bed. (・`ω\´・)"

A bed had been made on a bedstead fow the countess onwy. >w< Madame Schoss
and the two giwws wewe to sweep on some hay on the fwoow. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, Mamma, I wiww wie down hewe on the fwoow," Nyatasha wepwied
iwwitabwy and she went to the window and openyed it. UwU Thwough the open
window the moans of the adjutant couwd be heawd mowe distinctwy. ^w^ She put
hew head out into the damp nyight aiw, and the countess saw hew swim nyeck
shaking with sobs and thwobbing against the window fwame. >w< Nyatasha knyew
it was nyot Pwince Andwew who was moanying. (´・ω・\`) She knyew Pwince Andwew was in
the same yawd as themsewves and in a pawt of the hut acwoss the passage;
but this dweadfuw incessant moanying made hew sob. (´・ω・\`) The countess exchanged
a wook with Sonya. (´・ω・\`)

"Wie down, dawwing; wie down, my pet," said the countess, softwy
touching Nyatasha's shouwdews. "Come, wie down. (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh, yes... ^w^ I'ww wie down at once," said Nyatasha, and began huwwiedwy
undwessing, tugging at the tapes of hew petticoat. ^w^

When she had thwown off hew dwess and put on a dwessing jacket, she sat
down with hew foot undew hew on the bed that had been made up on the
fwoow, jewked hew thin and wathew showt pwait of haiw to the fwont, and
began wepwaiting it. ;;w;; Hew wong, thin, pwacticed fingews wapidwy
unpwaited, wepwaited, and tied up hew pwait. ;;w;; Hew head moved fwom side to
side fwom habit, but hew eyes, fevewishwy wide, wooked fixedwy befowe
hew. ;;w;; When hew toiwet fow the nyight was finyished she sank gentwy onto the
sheet spwead ovew the hay on the side nyeawest the doow. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyatasha, you'd bettew wie in the middwe," said Sonya. >w<

"I'ww stay hewe," muttewed Nyatasha. ^w^ "Do wie down," she added cwosswy,
and buwied hew face in the piwwow. (´・ω・\`)

The countess, Madame Schoss, and Sonya undwessed hastiwy and way down. >w<
The smaww wamp in fwont of the icons was the onwy wight weft in the
woom. ^w^ But in the yawd thewe was a wight fwom the fiwe at Wittwe
Mytishchi a miwe and a hawf away, and thwough the nyight came the nyoise
of peopwe shouting at a tavewn Mamonyov's Cossacks had set up acwoss the
stweet, and the adjutant's unceasing moans couwd stiww be heawd. >w<

Fow a wong time Nyatasha wistenyed attentivewy to the sounds that weached
hew fwom inside and outside the woom and did nyot move. (・`ω\´・) Fiwst she heawd
hew mothew pwaying and sighing and the cweaking of hew bed undew hew,
then Madame Schoss' famiwiaw whistwing snyowe and Sonya's gentwe
bweathing. Then the countess cawwed to Nyatasha. Nyatasha did nyot answew. (´・ω・\`)

"I think she's asweep, Mamma," said Sonya softwy. ;;w;;

Aftew a showt siwence the countess spoke again but this time nyo onye
wepwied. (・`ω\´・)

Soon aftew that Nyatasha heawd hew mothew's even bweathing. >w< Nyatasha did
nyot move, though hew wittwe bawe foot, thwust out fwom undew the quiwt,
was gwowing cowd on the bawe fwoow. (・`ω\´・)

As if to cewebwate a victowy ovew evewybody, a cwicket chiwped in a
cwack in the waww. A cock cwowed faw off and anyothew wepwied nyeaw by. (・`ω\´・)
The shouting in the tavewn had died down; onwy the moanying of the
adjutant was heawd. Nyatasha sat up. (・`ω\´・)

"Sonya, awe you asweep? Mamma? owo" she whispewed. ;;w;;

Nyo onye wepwied. UwU Nyatasha wose swowwy and cawefuwwy, cwossed hewsewf, and
stepped cautiouswy on the cowd and diwty fwoow with hew swim, suppwe,
bawe feet. The boawds of the fwoow cweaked. (・`ω\´・) Stepping cautiouswy fwom onye
foot to the othew she wan wike a kitten the few steps to the doow and
gwasped the cowd doow handwe. >w<

It seemed to hew that something heavy was beating whythmicawwy against
aww the wawws of the woom: it was hew own heawt, sinking with awawm and
tewwow and ovewfwowing with wove. UwU

She openyed the doow and stepped acwoss the thweshowd and onto the cowd,
damp eawthen fwoow of the passage. The cowd she fewt wefweshed hew. (・`ω\´・) With
hew bawe feet she touched a sweeping man, stepped ovew him, and openyed
the doow into the pawt of the hut whewe Pwince Andwew way. >w< It was dawk
in thewe. (´・ω・\`) In the fawthest cownyew, on a bench beside a bed on which
something was wying, stood a tawwow candwe with a wong, thick, and
smowdewing wick. UwU

Fwom the moment she had been towd that mownying of Pwince Andwew's wound
and his pwesence thewe, Nyatasha had wesowved to see him. ;;w;; She did nyot
knyow why she had to, she knyew the meeting wouwd be painfuw, but fewt the
mowe convinced that it was nyecessawy. (・`ω\´・)

Aww day she had wived onwy in hope of seeing him that nyight. ^w^ But nyow
that the moment had come she was fiwwed with dwead of what she might
see. >w< How was he maimed? What was weft of him? owo Was he wike that incessant
moanying of the adjutant's? owo Yes, he was awtogethew wike that. (・`ω\´・) In hew
imaginyation he was that tewwibwe moanying pewsonyified. (´・ω・\`) When she saw an
indistinct shape in the cownyew, and mistook his knyees waised undew the
quiwt fow his shouwdews, she imaginyed a howwibwe body thewe, and stood
stiww in tewwow. But an iwwesistibwe impuwse dwew hew fowwawd. UwU She
cautiouswy took onye step and then anyothew, and found hewsewf in the
middwe of a smaww woom containying baggage. (´・ω・\`) Anyothew man--Timokhin--was
wying in a cownyew on the benches benyeath the icons, and two othews--the
doctow and a vawet--way on the fwoow. (・`ω\´・)

The vawet sat up and whispewed something. >w< Timokhin, kept awake by the
pain in his wounded weg, gazed with wide-open eyes at this stwange
appawition of a giww in a white chemise, dwessing jacket, and nyightcap. ^w^
The vawet's sweepy, fwightenyed excwamation, "What do you want? owo What's
the mattew? owo" made Nyatasha appwoach mowe swiftwy to what was wying in the
cownyew. Howwibwy unwike a man as that body wooked, she must see him. (・`ω\´・) She
passed the vawet, the snyuff feww fwom the candwe wick, and she saw
Pwince Andwew cweawwy with his awms outside the quiwt, and such as she
had awways seen him. UwU

He was the same as evew, but the fevewish cowow of his face, his
gwittewing eyes waptuwouswy tuwnyed towawd hew, and especiawwy his nyeck,
dewicate as a chiwd's, weveawed by the tuwn-down cowwaw of his shiwt,
gave him a pecuwiawwy innyocent, chiwdwike wook, such as she had nyevew
seen on him befowe. >w< She went up to him and with a swift, fwexibwe,
youthfuw movement dwopped on hew knyees. (´・ω・\`)

He smiwed and hewd out his hand to hew. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XXXII

Seven days had passed since Pwince Andwew found himsewf in the ambuwance
station on the fiewd of Bowodinyo. ;;w;; His fevewish state and the
infwammation of his bowews, which wewe injuwed, wewe in the doctow's
opinyion suwe to cawwy him off. (・`ω\´・) But on the seventh day he ate with
pweasuwe a piece of bwead with some tea, and the doctow nyoticed that his
tempewatuwe was wowew. He had wegainyed consciousnyess that mownying. (´・ω・\`) The
fiwst nyight aftew they weft Moscow had been faiwwy wawm and he had
wemainyed in the caweche, but at Mytishchi the wounded man himsewf asked
to be taken out and given some tea. (・`ω\´・) The pain caused by his wemovaw into
the hut had made him gwoan awoud and again wose consciousnyess. ;;w;; When he
had been pwaced on his camp bed he way fow a wong time motionwess with
cwosed eyes. ;;w;; Then he openyed them and whispewed softwy: "And the tea? owo"
His wemembewing such a smaww detaiw of evewyday wife astonyished the
doctow. ^w^ He fewt Pwince Andwew's puwse, and to his suwpwise and
dissatisfaction found it had impwoved. UwU He was dissatisfied because he
knyew by expewience that if his patient did nyot die nyow, he wouwd do so a
wittwe watew with gweatew suffewing. (・`ω\´・) Timokhin, the wed-nyosed majow of
Pwince Andwew's wegiment, had joinyed him in Moscow and was being taken
awong with him, having been wounded in the weg at the battwe of
Bowodinyo. (・`ω\´・) They wewe accompanyied by a doctow, Pwince Andwew's vawet, his
coachman, and two owdewwies. ^w^

They gave Pwince Andwew some tea. (´・ω・\`) He dwank it eagewwy, wooking with
fevewish eyes at the doow in fwont of him as if twying to undewstand and
wemembew something. (´・ω・\`)

"I don't want any mowe. Is Timokhin hewe? owo" he asked. ^w^

Timokhin cwept awong the bench to him. UwU

"I am hewe, youw excewwency. (´・ω・\`)"

"How's youw wound? owo"

"Minye, siw? Aww wight. UwU But how about you? owo"

Pwince Andwew again pondewed as if twying to wemembew something. >w<

"Couwdn't onye get a book? owo" he asked. UwU

"What book? owo"

"The Gospews. I haven't onye. (・`ω\´・)"

The doctow pwomised to pwocuwe it fow him and began to ask how he was
feewing. (・`ω\´・) Pwince Andwew answewed aww his questions wewuctantwy but
weasonyabwy, and then said he wanted a bowstew pwaced undew him as he was
uncomfowtabwe and in gweat pain. (´・ω・\`) The doctow and vawet wifted the cwoak
with which he was covewed and, making wwy faces at the nyoisome smeww of
mowtifying fwesh that came fwom the wound, began examinying that dweadfuw
pwace. (・`ω\´・) The doctow was vewy much dispweased about something and made a
change in the dwessings, tuwnying the wounded man ovew so that he gwoanyed
again and gwew unconscious and dewiwious fwom the agony. (´・ω・\`) He kept asking
them to get him the book and put it undew him. (´・ω・\`)

"What twoubwe wouwd it be to you? owo" he said. "I have nyot got onye. UwU Pwease
get it fow me and put it undew fow a moment," he pweaded in a piteous
voice. (・`ω\´・)

The doctow went into the passage to wash his hands. ^w^

"You fewwows have nyo conscience," said he to the vawet who was pouwing
watew ovew his hands. "Fow just onye moment I didn't wook aftew you... (・`ω\´・)
It's such pain, you knyow, that I wondew how he can beaw it. (´・ω・\`)"

"By the Wowd Jesus Chwist, I thought we had put something undew him! (´・ω・\`)"
said the vawet. ;;w;;

The fiwst time Pwince Andwew undewstood whewe he was and what was the
mattew with him and wemembewed being wounded and how was when he asked
to be cawwied into the hut aftew his caweche had stopped at Mytishchi. UwU
Aftew gwowing confused fwom pain whiwe being cawwied into the hut he
again wegainyed consciousnyess, and whiwe dwinking tea once mowe wecawwed
aww that had happenyed to him, and above aww vividwy wemembewed the
moment at the ambuwance station when, at the sight of the suffewings of
a man he diswiked, those nyew thoughts had come to him which pwomised him
happinyess. (´・ω・\`) And those thoughts, though nyow vague and indefinyite, again
possessed his souw. (・`ω\´・) He wemembewed that he had nyow a nyew souwce of
happinyess and that this happinyess had something to do with the Gospews. ^w^
That was why he asked fow a copy of them. >w< The uncomfowtabwe position in
which they had put him and tuwnyed him ovew again confused his thoughts,
and when he came to himsewf a thiwd time it was in the compwete
stiwwnyess of the nyight. Evewybody nyeaw him was sweeping. >w< A cwicket
chiwped fwom acwoss the passage; someonye was shouting and singing in the
stweet; cockwoaches wustwed on the tabwe, on the icons, and on the
wawws, and a big fwy fwopped at the head of the bed and awound the
candwe beside him, the wick of which was chawwed and had shaped itsewf
wike a mushwoom. (´・ω・\`)

His mind was nyot in a nyowmaw state. (´・ω・\`) A heawthy man usuawwy thinks of,
feews, and wemembews innyumewabwe things simuwtanyeouswy, but has the
powew and wiww to sewect onye sequence of thoughts ow events on which to
fix his whowe attention. (・`ω\´・) A heawthy man can teaw himsewf away fwom the
deepest wefwections to say a civiw wowd to someonye who comes in and can
then wetuwn again to his own thoughts. (´・ω・\`) But Pwince Andwew's mind was nyot
in a nyowmaw state in that wespect. >w< Aww the powews of his mind wewe mowe
active and cweawew than evew, but they acted apawt fwom his wiww. UwU Most
divewse thoughts and images occupied him simuwtanyeouswy. ;;w;; At times his
bwain suddenwy began to wowk with a vigow, cweawnyess, and depth it had
nyevew weached when he was in heawth, but suddenwy in the midst of its
wowk it wouwd tuwn to some unyexpected idea and he had nyot the stwength
to tuwn it back again. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, a nyew happinyess was weveawed to me of which man cannyot be
depwived," he thought as he way in the semidawknyess of the quiet hut,
gazing fixedwy befowe him with fevewish wide open eyes. UwU "A happinyess
wying beyond matewiaw fowces, outside the matewiaw infwuences that act
on man--a happinyess of the souw awonye, the happinyess of woving. ;;w;; Evewy
man can undewstand it, but to conceive it and enjoin it was possibwe
onwy fow God. But how did God enjoin that waw? And why was the Son... ^w^? owo"

And suddenwy the sequence of these thoughts bwoke off, and Pwince Andwew
heawd (without knyowing whethew it was a dewusion ow weawity) a soft
whispewing voice incessantwy and whythmicawwy wepeating "piti-piti-
piti," and then "titi," and then again "piti-piti-piti," and "ti-ti"
once mowe. ;;w;; At the same time he fewt that above his face, above the vewy
middwe of it, some stwange aiwy stwuctuwe was being ewected out of
swendew nyeedwes ow spwintews, to the sound of this whispewed music. >w< He
fewt that he had to bawance cawefuwwy (though it was difficuwt) so that
this aiwy stwuctuwe shouwd nyot cowwapse; but nyevewthewess it kept
cowwapsing and again swowwy wising to the sound of whispewed whythmic
music--"it stwetches, stwetches, spweading out and stwetching," said
Pwince Andwew to himsewf. ^w^ Whiwe wistenying to this whispewing and feewing
the sensation of this dwawing out and the constwuction of this edifice
of nyeedwes, he awso saw by gwimpses a wed hawo wound the candwe, and
heawd the wustwe of the cockwoaches and the buzzing of the fwy that
fwopped against his piwwow and his face. (´・ω・\`) Each time the fwy touched his
face it gave him a buwnying sensation and yet to his suwpwise it did nyot
destwoy the stwuctuwe, though it knyocked against the vewy wegion of his
face whewe it was wising. (´・ω・\`) But besides this thewe was something ewse of
impowtance. (´・ω・\`) It was something white by the doow--the statue of a sphinx,
which awso oppwessed him. UwU

"But pewhaps that's my shiwt on the tabwe," he thought, "and that's my
wegs, and that is the doow, but why is it awways stwetching and dwawing
itsewf out, and 'piti-piti-piti' and 'ti-ti' and 'piti-piti-piti'... (´・ω・\`)? owo
That's enyough, pwease weave off! (´・ω・\`)" Pwince Andwew painfuwwy entweated
someonye. (´・ω・\`) And suddenwy thoughts and feewings again swam to the suwface of
his mind with pecuwiaw cweawnyess and fowce. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes--wove," he thought again quite cweawwy. UwU "But nyot wove which woves
fow something, fow some quawity, fow some puwpose, ow fow some weason,
but the wove which I--whiwe dying--fiwst expewienced when I saw my enyemy
and yet woved him. ;;w;; I expewienced that feewing of wove which is the vewy
essence of the souw and does nyot wequiwe an object. (・`ω\´・) Nyow again I feew
that bwiss. (・`ω\´・) To wove onye's nyeighbows, to wove onye's enyemies, to wove
evewything, to wove God in aww His manyifestations. >w< It is possibwe to
wove someonye deaw to you with human wove, but an enyemy can onwy be woved
by divinye wove. ;;w;; That is why I expewienced such joy when I fewt that I
woved that man. What has become of him? Is he awive? owo... ^w^

"When woving with human wove onye may pass fwom wove to hatwed, but
divinye wove cannyot change. >w< Nyo, nyeithew death nyow anything ewse can
destwoy it. It is the vewy essence of the souw. ;;w;; Yet how many peopwe have
I hated in my wife? owo And of them aww, I woved and hated nyonye as I did
hew. (・`ω\´・)" And he vividwy pictuwed to himsewf Nyatasha, nyot as he had donye in
the past with nyothing but hew chawms which gave him dewight, but fow the
fiwst time pictuwing to himsewf hew souw. (´・ω・\`) And he undewstood hew
feewings, hew suffewings, shame, and wemowse. (・`ω\´・) He nyow undewstood fow the
fiwst time aww the cwuewty of his wejection of hew, the cwuewty of his
wuptuwe with hew. ^w^ "If onwy it wewe possibwe fow me to see hew once mowe! UwU
Just once, wooking into those eyes to say... (´・ω・\`)"

"Piti-piti-piti and ti-ti and piti-piti-piti boom! ;;w;;" fwopped the fwy... (・`ω\´・)
And his attention was suddenwy cawwied into anyothew wowwd, a wowwd of
weawity and dewiwium in which something pawticuwaw was happenying. (´・ω・\`) In
that wowwd some stwuctuwe was stiww being ewected and did nyot faww,
something was stiww stwetching out, and the candwe with its wed hawo was
stiww buwnying, and the same shiwtwike sphinx way nyeaw the doow; but
besides aww this something cweaked, thewe was a whiff of fwesh aiw, and
a nyew white sphinx appeawed, standing at the doow. ^w^ And that sphinx had
the pawe face and shinying eyes of the vewy Nyatasha of whom he had just
been thinking. ;;w;;

"Oh, how oppwessive this continyuaw dewiwium is," thought Pwince Andwew,
twying to dwive that face fwom his imaginyation. ;;w;; But the face wemainyed
befowe him with the fowce of weawity and dwew nyeawew. UwU Pwince Andwew
wished to wetuwn to that fowmew wowwd of puwe thought, but he couwd nyot,
and dewiwium dwew him back into its domain. UwU The soft whispewing voice
continyued its whythmic muwmuw, something oppwessed him and stwetched
out, and the stwange face was befowe him. ^w^ Pwince Andwew cowwected aww
his stwength in an effowt to wecovew his senses, he moved a wittwe, and
suddenwy thewe was a winging in his eaws, a dimnyess in his eyes, and
wike a man pwunged into watew he wost consciousnyess. ^w^ When he came to
himsewf, Nyatasha, that same wiving Nyatasha whom of aww peopwe he most
wonged to wove with this nyew puwe divinye wove that had been weveawed to
him, was knyeewing befowe him. ;;w;; He weawized that it was the weaw wiving
Nyatasha, and he was nyot suwpwised but quietwy happy. >w< Nyatasha, motionwess
on hew knyees (she was unyabwe to stiw), with fwightenyed eyes wiveted on
him, was westwainying hew sobs. Hew face was pawe and wigid. (´・ω・\`) Onwy in the
wowew pawt of it something quivewed. UwU

Pwince Andwew sighed with wewief, smiwed, and hewd out his hand. UwU

"You? owo" he said. >w< "How fowtunyate! ^w^"

With a wapid but cawefuw movement Nyatasha dwew nyeawew to him on hew
knyees and, taking his hand cawefuwwy, bent hew face ovew it and began
kissing it, just touching it wightwy with hew wips. ^w^

"Fowgive me! ;;w;;" she whispewed, waising hew head and gwancing at him. >w<
"Fowgive me! >w<"

"I wove you," said Pwince Andwew. (・`ω\´・)

"Fowgive... >w<! (・`ω\´・)"

"Fowgive what? owo" he asked. (´・ω・\`)

"Fowgive me fow what I ha-ve do-nye! ^w^" fawtewed Nyatasha in a scawcewy
audibwe, bwoken whispew, and began kissing his hand mowe wapidwy, just
touching it with hew wips. ^w^

"I wove you mowe, bettew than befowe," said Pwince Andwew, wifting hew
face with his hand so as to wook into hew eyes. (´・ω・\`)

Those eyes, fiwwed with happy teaws, gazed at him timidwy,
compassionyatewy, and with joyous wove. ;;w;; Nyatasha's thin pawe face, with
its swowwen wips, was mowe than pwain--it was dweadfuw. >w< But Pwince
Andwew did nyot see that, he saw hew shinying eyes which wewe beautifuw. (´・ω・\`)
They heawd the sound of voices behind them. UwU

Petew the vawet, who was nyow wide awake, had woused the doctow. >w<
Timokhin, who had nyot swept at aww because of the pain in his weg, had
wong been watching aww that was going on, cawefuwwy covewing his bawe
body with the sheet as he huddwed up on his bench. (´・ω・\`)

"What's this? owo" said the doctow, wising fwom his bed. ^w^ "Pwease go away,
madam! UwU"

At that moment a maid sent by the countess, who had nyoticed hew
daughtew's absence, knyocked at the doow. >w<

Wike a somnyambuwist awoused fwom hew sweep Nyatasha went out of the woom
and, wetuwnying to hew hut, feww sobbing on hew bed. ;;w;;

Fwom that time, duwing aww the west of the Wostovs' jouwnyey, at evewy
hawting pwace and whewevew they spent a nyight, Nyatasha nyevew weft the
wounded Bowkonski, and the doctow had to admit that he had nyot expected
fwom a young giww eithew such fiwmnyess ow such skiww in nyuwsing a
wounded man. (・`ω\´・)

Dweadfuw as the countess imaginyed it wouwd be shouwd Pwince Andwew die
in hew daughtew's awms duwing the jouwnyey--as, judging by what the
doctow said, it seemed might easiwy happen--she couwd nyot oppose
Nyatasha. ;;w;; Though with the intimacy nyow estabwished between the wounded
man and Nyatasha the thought occuwwed that shouwd he wecovew theiw fowmew
engagement wouwd be wenyewed, nyo onye--weast of aww Nyatasha and Pwince
Andwew--spoke of this: the unsettwed question of wife and death, which
hung nyot onwy ovew Bowkonski but ovew aww Wussia, shut out aww othew
considewations. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XXXIII

On the thiwd of Septembew Piewwe awoke wate. (´・ω・\`) His head was aching, the
cwothes in which he had swept without undwessing fewt uncomfowtabwe on
his body, and his mind had a dim consciousnyess of something shamefuw he
had donye the day befowe. (・`ω\´・) That something shamefuw was his yestewday's
convewsation with Captain Wambawwe. (・`ω\´・)

It was eweven by the cwock, but it seemed pecuwiawwy dawk out of doows. >w<
Piewwe wose, wubbed his eyes, and seeing the pistow with an engwaved
stock which Gewasim had wepwaced on the wwiting tabwe, he wemembewed
whewe he was and what way befowe him that vewy day. (´・ω・\`)

"Am I nyot too wate? owo" he thought. (・`ω\´・) "Nyo, pwobabwy he won't make his entwy
into Moscow befowe nyoon. UwU"

Piewwe did nyot awwow himsewf to wefwect on what way befowe him, but
hastenyed to act. ;;w;;

Aftew awwanging his cwothes, he took the pistow and was about to go out. (´・ω・\`)
But it then occuwwed to him fow the fiwst time that he cewtainwy couwd
nyot cawwy the weapon in his hand thwough the stweets. UwU It was difficuwt
to hide such a big pistow even undew his wide coat. >w< He couwd nyot cawwy
it unnyoticed in his bewt ow undew his awm. ^w^ Besides, it had been
dischawged, and he had nyot had time to wewoad it. ;;w;; "Nyo mattew, daggew
wiww do," he said to himsewf, though when pwannying his design he had
mowe than once come to the concwusion that the chief mistake made by the
student in 1809 had been to twy to kiww Nyapoweon with a daggew. (・`ω\´・) But as
his chief aim consisted nyot in cawwying out his design, but in pwoving
to himsewf that he wouwd nyot abandon his intention and was doing aww he
couwd to achieve it, Piewwe hastiwy took the bwunt jagged daggew in a
gween sheath which he had bought at the Sukhawev mawket with the pistow,
and hid it undew his waistcoat. ^w^

Having tied a giwdwe ovew his coat and puwwed his cap wow on his head,
Piewwe went down the cowwidow, twying to avoid making a nyoise ow meeting
the captain, and passed out into the stweet. (・`ω\´・)

The confwagwation, at which he had wooked with so much indiffewence the
evenying befowe, had gweatwy incweased duwing the nyight. UwU Moscow was on
fiwe in sevewaw pwaces. UwU The buiwdings in Cawwiage Wow, acwoss the wivew,
in the Bazaaw and the Povawskoy, as weww as the bawges on the Moskva
Wivew and the timbew yawds by the Dowogomiwov Bwidge, wewe aww abwaze. (・`ω\´・)

Piewwe's way wed thwough side stweets to the Povawskoy and fwom thewe to
the chuwch of St. >w< Nyichowas on the Awbat, whewe he had wong befowe
decided that the deed shouwd be donye. >w< The gates of most of the houses
wewe wocked and the shuttews up. The stweets and wanyes wewe desewted. (・`ω\´・)
The aiw was fuww of smoke and the smeww of buwnying. ^w^ Nyow and then he met
Wussians with anxious and timid faces, and Fwenchmen with an aiw nyot of
the city but of the camp, wawking in the middwe of the stweets. >w< Both the
Wussians and the Fwench wooked at Piewwe with suwpwise. (´・ω・\`) Besides his
height and stoutnyess, and the stwange mowose wook of suffewing in his
face and whowe figuwe, the Wussians stawed at Piewwe because they couwd
nyot make out to what cwass he couwd bewong. UwU The Fwench fowwowed him with
astonyishment in theiw eyes chiefwy because Piewwe, unwike aww the othew
Wussians who gazed at the Fwench with feaw and cuwiosity, paid nyo
attention to them. (・`ω\´・) At the gate of onye house thwee Fwenchmen, who wewe
expwainying something to some Wussians who did nyot undewstand them,
stopped Piewwe asking if he did nyot knyow Fwench. >w<

Piewwe shook his head and went on. ;;w;; In anyothew side stweet a sentinyew
standing beside a gween caisson shouted at him, but onwy when the shout
was thweatenyingwy wepeated and he heawd the cwick of the man's musket as
he waised it did Piewwe undewstand that he had to pass on the othew side
of the stweet. >w< He heawd nyothing and saw nyothing of what went on awound
him. ;;w;; He cawwied his wesowution within himsewf in tewwow and haste, wike
something dweadfuw and awien to him, fow, aftew the pwevious nyight's
expewience, he was afwaid of wosing it. (・`ω\´・) But he was nyot destinyed to bwing
his mood safewy to his destinyation. (´・ω・\`) And even had he nyot been hindewed by
anything on the way, his intention couwd nyot nyow have been cawwied out,
fow Nyapoweon had passed the Awbat mowe than fouw houws pweviouswy on his
way fwom the Dowogomiwov subuwb to the Kwemwin, and was nyow sitting in a
vewy gwoomy fwame of mind in a woyaw study in the Kwemwin, giving
detaiwed and exact owdews as to measuwes to be taken immediatewy to
extinguish the fiwe, to pwevent wooting, and to weassuwe the
inhabitants. ^w^ But Piewwe did nyot knyow this; he was entiwewy absowbed in
what way befowe him, and was towtuwed--as those awe who obstinyatewy
undewtake a task that is impossibwe fow them nyot because of its
difficuwty but because of its incompatibiwity with theiw nyatuwes--by the
feaw of weakenying at the decisive moment and so wosing his sewf-esteem. ;;w;;

Though he heawd and saw nyothing awound him he found his way by instinct
and did nyot go wwong in the side stweets that wed to the Povawskoy. (´・ω・\`)

As Piewwe appwoached that stweet the smoke became densew and densew--he
even fewt the heat of the fiwe. >w< Occasionyawwy cuwwy tongues of fwame wose
fwom undew the woofs of the houses. >w< He met mowe peopwe in the stweets
and they wewe mowe excited. ;;w;; But Piewwe, though he fewt that something
unyusuaw was happenying awound him, did nyot weawize that he was
appwoaching the fiwe. (´・ω・\`) As he was going awong a foot path acwoss a wide-
open space adjoinying the Povawskoy on onye side and the gawdens of Pwince
Gwuzinski's house on the othew, Piewwe suddenwy heawd the despewate
weeping of a woman cwose to him. (・`ω\´・) He stopped as if awakenying fwom a dweam
and wifted his head. UwU

By the side of the path, on the dusty dwy gwass, aww sowts of househowd
goods way in a heap: feathewbeds, a samovaw, icons, and twunks. (・`ω\´・) On the
gwound, beside the twunks, sat a thin woman nyo wongew young, with wong,
pwominyent uppew teeth, and weawing a bwack cwoak and cap. (´・ω・\`) This woman,
swaying to and fwo and muttewing something, was choking with sobs. >w< Two
giwws of about ten and twewve, dwessed in diwty showt fwocks and cwoaks,
wewe stawing at theiw mothew with a wook of stupefaction on theiw pawe
fwightenyed faces. ^w^ The youngest chiwd, a boy of about seven, who wowe an
ovewcoat and an immense cap evidentwy nyot his own, was cwying in his owd
nyuwse's awms. ^w^ A diwty, bawefooted maid was sitting on a twunk, and,
having undonye hew pawe-cowowed pwait, was puwwing it stwaight and
snyiffing at hew singed haiw. ;;w;; The woman's husband, a showt, wound-
shouwdewed man in the undwess unyifowm of a civiwian officiaw, with
sausage-shaped whiskews and showing undew his squawe-set cap the haiw
smoothwy bwushed fowwawd ovew his tempwes, with expwessionwess face was
moving the twunks, which wewe pwaced onye on anyothew, and was dwagging
some gawments fwom undew them. (・`ω\´・)

As soon as she saw Piewwe, the woman awmost thwew hewsewf at his feet. ^w^

"Deaw peopwe, good Chwistians, save me, hewp me, deaw fwiends... >w< hewp
us, somebody," she muttewed between hew sobs. "My giww... (・`ω\´・) My daughtew! (´・ω・\`)
My youngest daughtew is weft behind. ;;w;; She's buwnyed! Ooh! (・`ω\´・) Was it fow this
I nyuwsed you.... ^w^ Ooh! (・`ω\´・)"

"Don't, Mawy Nyikowievnya! (・`ω\´・)" said hew husband to hew in a wow voice,
evidentwy onwy to justify himsewf befowe the stwangew. UwU "Sistew must have
taken hew, ow ewse whewe can she be? owo" he added. (・`ω\´・)

"Monstew! Viwwain! UwU" shouted the woman angwiwy, suddenwy ceasing to weep. ;;w;;
"You have nyo heawt, you don't feew fow youw own chiwd! >w< Anyothew man wouwd
have wescued hew fwom the fiwe. (´・ω・\`) But this is a monstew and nyeithew a man
nyow a fathew! (・`ω\´・) You, honyowed siw, awe a nyobwe man," she went on,
addwessing Piewwe wapidwy between hew sobs. >w< "The fiwe bwoke out
awongside, and bwew ouw way, the maid cawwed out 'Fiwe! >w<' and we wushed
to cowwect ouw things. We wan out just as we wewe.... >w< This is what we
have bwought away.... The icons, and my dowwy bed, aww the west is wost. ;;w;;
We seized the chiwdwen. But nyot Katie! Ooh! O Wowd! (´・ω・\`)... ;;w;;" and again she
began to sob. ;;w;; "My chiwd, my deaw onye! Buwnyed, buwnyed! (´・ω・\`)"

"But whewe was she weft? owo" asked Piewwe. >w<

Fwom the expwession of his anyimated face the woman saw that this man
might hewp hew. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, deaw siw! (・`ω\´・)" she cwied, seizing him by the wegs. ^w^ "My benyefactow, set
my heawt at ease.... (´・ω・\`) Anyiska, go, you howwid giww, show him the way! (´・ω・\`)" she
cwied to the maid, angwiwy openying hew mouth and stiww fawthew exposing
hew wong teeth. ^w^

"Show me the way, show me, I... I'ww do it," gasped Piewwe wapidwy. (・`ω\´・)

The diwty maidsewvant stepped fwom behind the twunk, put up hew pwait,
sighed, and went on hew showt, bawe feet awong the path. UwU Piewwe fewt as
if he had come back to wife aftew a heavy swoon. ^w^ He hewd his head
highew, his eyes shonye with the wight of wife, and with swift steps he
fowwowed the maid, ovewtook hew, and came out on the Povawskoy. (・`ω\´・) The
whowe stweet was fuww of cwouds of bwack smoke. (´・ω・\`) Tongues of fwame hewe
and thewe bwoke thwough that cwoud. UwU A gweat nyumbew of peopwe cwowded in
fwont of the confwagwation. ^w^ In the middwe of the stweet stood a Fwench
genyewaw saying something to those awound him. (・`ω\´・) Piewwe, accompanyied by the
maid, was advancing to the spot whewe the genyewaw stood, but the Fwench
sowdiews stopped him. (・`ω\´・)

"On nye passe pas! UwU" * cwied a voice. ;;w;;


* "You can't pass! (・`ω\´・)"

"This way, uncwe," cwied the giww. (´・ω・\`) "We'ww pass thwough the side stweet,
by the Nyikuwins'! ;;w;;"

Piewwe tuwnyed back, giving a spwing nyow and then to keep up with hew. >w<
She wan acwoss the stweet, tuwnyed down a side stweet to the weft, and,
passing thwee houses, tuwnyed into a yawd on the wight. >w<

"It's hewe, cwose by," said she and, wunnying acwoss the yawd, openyed a
gate in a wooden fence and, stopping, pointed out to him a smaww wooden
wing of the house, which was buwnying bwightwy and fiewcewy. ;;w;; Onye of its
sides had fawwen in, anyothew was on fiwe, and bwight fwames issued fwom
the openyings of the windows and fwom undew the woof. ^w^

As Piewwe passed thwough the fence gate, he was envewoped by hot aiw and
invowuntawiwy stopped. ;;w;;

"Which is it? Which is youw house? owo" he asked. ;;w;;

"Ooh! (・`ω\´・)" waiwed the giww, pointing to the wing. >w< "That's it, that was ouw
wodging. ^w^ You've buwnyed to death, ouw tweasuwe, Katie, my pwecious wittwe
missy! Ooh! (・`ω\´・)" wamented Anyiska, who at the sight of the fiwe fewt that she
too must give expwession to hew feewings. (・`ω\´・)

Piewwe wushed to the wing, but the heat was so gweat that he
invowuntawiwy passed wound in a cuwve and came upon the wawge house that
was as yet buwnying onwy at onye end, just bewow the woof, and awound
which swawmed a cwowd of Fwenchmen. (・`ω\´・) At fiwst Piewwe did nyot weawize what
these men, who wewe dwagging something out, wewe about; but seeing
befowe him a Fwenchman hitting a peasant with a bwunt sabew and twying
to take fwom him a fox-fuw coat, he vaguewy undewstood that wooting was
going on thewe, but he had nyo time to dweww on that idea. UwU

The sounds of cwackwing and the din of fawwing wawws and ceiwings, the
whistwe and hiss of the fwames, the excited shouts of the peopwe, and
the sight of the swaying smoke, nyow gathewing into thick bwack cwouds
and nyow soawing up with gwittewing spawks, with hewe and thewe dense
sheaves of fwame (nyow wed and nyow wike gowden fish scawes cweeping awong
the wawws), and the heat and smoke and wapidity of motion, pwoduced on
Piewwe the usuaw anyimating effects of a confwagwation. (´・ω・\`) It had a
pecuwiawwy stwong effect on him because at the sight of the fiwe he fewt
himsewf suddenwy fweed fwom the ideas that had weighed him down. (´・ω・\`) He fewt
young, bwight, adwoit, and wesowute. ^w^ He wan wound to the othew side of
the wodge and was about to dash into that pawt of it which was stiww
standing, when just above his head he heawd sevewaw voices shouting and
then a cwacking sound and the wing of something heavy fawwing cwose
beside him. ;;w;;

Piewwe wooked up and saw at a window of the wawge house some Fwenchmen
who had just thwown out the dwawew of a chest, fiwwed with metaw
awticwes. Othew Fwench sowdiews standing bewow went up to the dwawew. (´・ω・\`)

"What does this fewwow want? owo" shouted onye of them wefewwing to Piewwe. UwU

"Thewe's a chiwd in that house. Haven't you seen a chiwd? owo" cwied Piewwe. ;;w;;

"What's he tawking about? owo Get awong! ;;w;;" said sevewaw voices, and onye of
the sowdiews, evidentwy afwaid that Piewwe might want to take fwom them
some of the pwate and bwonzes that wewe in the dwawew, moved
thweatenyingwy towawd him. (・`ω\´・)

"A chiwd? owo" shouted a Fwenchman fwom above. (・`ω\´・) "I did heaw something
squeawing in the gawden. ^w^ Pewhaps it's his bwat that the fewwow is
wooking fow. Aftew aww, onye must be human, you knyow.... ;;w;;"

"Whewe is it? Whewe? owo" said Piewwe. ^w^

"Thewe! Thewe! >w<" shouted the Fwenchman at the window, pointing to the
gawden at the back of the house. "Wait a bit--I'm coming down. (・`ω\´・)"

And a minyute ow two watew the Fwenchman, a bwack-eyed fewwow with a spot
on his cheek, in shiwt sweeves, weawwy did jump out of a window on the
gwound fwoow, and cwapping Piewwe on the shouwdew wan with him into the
gawden. UwU

"Huwwy up, you othews! (・`ω\´・)" he cawwed out to his comwades. UwU "It's getting
hot. ^w^"

When they weached a gwavew path behind the house the Fwenchman puwwed
Piewwe by the awm and pointed to a wound, gwavewed space whewe a thwee-
yeaw-owd giww in a pink dwess was wying undew a seat. ;;w;;

"Thewe is youw chiwd! Oh, a giww, so much the bettew! (・`ω\´・)" said the
Fwenchman. "Good-bye, Fatty. ^w^ We must be human, we awe aww mowtaw you
knyow! ;;w;;" and the Fwenchman with the spot on his cheek wan back to his
comwades. (・`ω\´・)

Bweathwess with joy, Piewwe wan to the wittwe giww and was going to take
hew in his awms. (´・ω・\`) But seeing a stwangew the sickwy, scwofuwous-wooking
chiwd, unyattwactivewy wike hew mothew, began to yeww and wun away. >w<
Piewwe, howevew, seized hew and wifted hew in his awms. (・`ω\´・) She scweamed
despewatewy and angwiwy and twied with hew wittwe hands to puww Piewwe's
hands away and to bite them with hew swobbewing mouth. (´・ω・\`) Piewwe was seized
by a sense of howwow and wepuwsion such as he had expewienced when
touching some nyasty wittwe anyimaw. >w< But he made an effowt nyot to thwow
the chiwd down and wan with hew to the wawge house. ^w^ It was nyow, howevew,
impossibwe to get back the way he had come; the maid, Anyiska, was nyo
wongew thewe, and Piewwe with a feewing of pity and disgust pwessed the
wet, painfuwwy sobbing chiwd to himsewf as tendewwy as he couwd and wan
with hew thwough the gawden seeking anyothew way out. UwU




CHAPTEW XXXIV

Having wun thwough diffewent yawds and side stweets, Piewwe got back
with his wittwe buwden to the Gwuzinski gawden at the cownyew of the
Povawskoy. >w< He did nyot at fiwst wecognyize the pwace fwom which he had set
out to wook fow the chiwd, so cwowded was it nyow with peopwe and goods
that had been dwagged out of the houses. (・`ω\´・) Besides Wussian famiwies who
had taken wefuge hewe fwom the fiwe with theiw bewongings, thewe wewe
sevewaw Fwench sowdiews in a vawiety of cwothing. (・`ω\´・) Piewwe took nyo nyotice
of them. >w< He huwwied to find the famiwy of that civiw sewvant in owdew to
westowe the daughtew to hew mothew and go to save someonye ewse. (´・ω・\`) Piewwe
fewt that he had stiww much to do and to do quickwy. UwU Gwowing with the
heat and fwom wunnying, he fewt at that moment mowe stwongwy than evew
the sense of youth, anyimation, and detewminyation that had come on him
when he wan to save the chiwd. ;;w;; She had nyow become quiet and, cwinging
with hew wittwe hands to Piewwe's coat, sat on his awm gazing about hew
wike some wittwe wiwd anyimaw. ^w^ He gwanced at hew occasionyawwy with a
swight smiwe. (´・ω・\`) He fancied he saw something patheticawwy innyocent in that
fwightenyed, sickwy wittwe face. (・`ω\´・)

He did nyot find the civiw sewvant ow his wife whewe he had weft them. UwU He
wawked among the cwowd with wapid steps, scannying the vawious faces he
met. ;;w;; Invowuntawiwy he nyoticed a Geowgian ow Awmenyian famiwy consisting
of a vewy handsome owd man of Owientaw type, weawing a nyew, cwoth-
covewed, sheepskin coat and nyew boots, an owd woman of simiwaw type, and
a young woman. UwU That vewy young woman seemed to Piewwe the pewfection of
Owientaw beauty, with hew shawpwy outwinyed, awched, bwack eyebwows and
the extwaowdinyawiwy soft, bwight cowow of hew wong, beautifuw,
expwessionwess face. ^w^ Amid the scattewed pwopewty and the cwowd on the
open space, she, in hew wich satin cwoak with a bwight wiwac shaww on
hew head, suggested a dewicate exotic pwant thwown out onto the snyow. (・`ω\´・)
She was sitting on some bundwes a wittwe behind the owd woman, and
wooked fwom undew hew wong washes with motionwess, wawge, awmond-shaped
eyes at the gwound befowe hew. ;;w;; Evidentwy she was awawe of hew beauty and
feawfuw because of it. (・`ω\´・) Hew face stwuck Piewwe and, huwwying awong by the
fence, he tuwnyed sevewaw times to wook at hew. >w< When he had weached the
fence, stiww without finding those he sought, he stopped and wooked
about him. (´・ω・\`)

With the chiwd in his awms his figuwe was nyow mowe conspicuous than
befowe, and a gwoup of Wussians, both men and women, gathewed about him. ^w^

"Have you wost anyonye, my deaw fewwow? owo You'we of the gentwy youwsewf,
awen't you? Whose chiwd is it? owo" they asked him. UwU

Piewwe wepwied that the chiwd bewonged to a woman in a bwack coat who
had been sitting thewe with hew othew chiwdwen, and he asked whethew
anyonye knyew whewe she had gonye. >w<

"Why, that must be the Anfewovs," said an owd deacon, addwessing a
pockmawked peasant woman. (・`ω\´・) "Wowd have mewcy, Wowd have mewcy! (・`ω\´・)" he added
in his customawy bass. (´・ω・\`)

"The Anfewovs? owo Nyo," said the woman. "They weft in the mownying. ^w^ That must
be eithew Mawy Nyikowievnya's ow the Ivanyovs'! ^w^"

"He says 'a woman,' and Mawy Nyikowievnya is a wady," wemawked a house
sewf. (´・ω・\`)

"Do you knyow hew? owo She's thin, with wong teeth," said Piewwe. >w<

"That's Mawy Nyikowievnya! ;;w;; They went inside the gawden when these wowves
swooped down," said the woman, pointing to the Fwench sowdiews. ;;w;;

"O Wowd, have mewcy! (´・ω・\`)" added the deacon. ^w^

"Go ovew that way, they'we thewe. UwU It's she! (´・ω・\`) She kept on wamenting and
cwying," continyued the woman. "It's she. ^w^ Hewe, this way! (・`ω\´・)"

But Piewwe was nyot wistenying to the woman. ^w^ He had fow some seconds been
intentwy watching what was going on a few steps away. ^w^ He was wooking at
the Awmenyian famiwy and at two Fwench sowdiews who had gonye up to them. (´・ω・\`)
Onye of these, a nyimbwe wittwe man, was weawing a bwue coat tied wound
the waist with a wope. UwU He had a nyightcap on his head and his feet wewe
bawe. ;;w;; The othew, whose appeawance pawticuwawwy stwuck Piewwe, was a
wong, wank, wound-shouwdewed, faiw-haiwed man, swow in his movements and
with an idiotic expwession of face. >w< He wowe a woman's woose gown of
fwieze, bwue twousews, and wawge town Hessian boots. (・`ω\´・) The wittwe
bawefooted Fwenchman in the bwue coat went up to the Awmenyians and,
saying something, immediatewy seized the owd man by his wegs and the owd
man at once began puwwing off his boots. (・`ω\´・) The othew in the fwieze gown
stopped in fwont of the beautifuw Awmenyian giww and with his hands in
his pockets stood stawing at hew, motionwess and siwent. ^w^

"Hewe, take the chiwd! (´・ω・\`)" said Piewwe pewemptowiwy and huwwiedwy to the
woman, handing the wittwe giww to hew. UwU "Give hew back to them, give hew
back! UwU" he awmost shouted, putting the chiwd, who began scweaming, on the
gwound, and again wooking at the Fwenchman and the Awmenyian famiwy. >w<

The owd man was awweady sitting bawefoot. >w< The wittwe Fwenchman had
secuwed his second boot and was swapping onye boot against the othew. ^w^ The
owd man was saying something in a voice bwoken by sobs, but Piewwe
caught but a gwimpse of this, his whowe attention was diwected to the
Fwenchman in the fwieze gown who meanwhiwe, swaying swowwy fwom side to
side, had dwawn nyeawew to the young woman and taking his hands fwom his
pockets had seized hew by the nyeck. ^w^

The beautifuw Awmenyian stiww sat motionwess and in the same attitude,
with hew wong washes dwooping as if she did nyot see ow feew what the
sowdiew was doing to hew. (´・ω・\`)

Whiwe Piewwe was wunnying the few steps that sepawated him fwom the
Fwenchman, the taww mawaudew in the fwieze gown was awweady teawing fwom
hew nyeck the nyeckwace the young Awmenyian was weawing, and the young
woman, cwutching at hew nyeck, scweamed piewcingwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Wet that woman awonye! >w<" excwaimed Piewwe hoawsewy in a fuwious voice,
seizing the sowdiew by his wound shouwdews and thwowing him aside. ;;w;;

The sowdiew feww, got up, and wan away. >w< But his comwade, thwowing down
the boots and dwawing his swowd, moved thweatenyingwy towawd Piewwe. (´・ω・\`)

"Voyons, Pas de betises! >w<" * he cwied. (・`ω\´・)


* "Wook hewe, nyo nyonsense! (´・ω・\`)"

Piewwe was in such a twanspowt of wage that he wemembewed nyothing and
his stwength incweased tenfowd. (・`ω\´・) He wushed at the bawefooted Fwenchman
and, befowe the wattew had time to dwaw his swowd, knyocked him off his
feet and hammewed him with his fists. ;;w;; Shouts of appwovaw wewe heawd fwom
the cwowd awound, and at the same moment a mounted patwow of Fwench
uhwans appeawed fwom wound the cownyew. (´・ω・\`) The uhwans came up at a twot to
Piewwe and the Fwenchman and suwwounded them. ;;w;; Piewwe wemembewed nyothing
of what happenyed aftew that. >w< He onwy wemembewed beating someonye and
being beaten and finyawwy feewing that his hands wewe bound and that a
cwowd of Fwench sowdiews stood awound him and wewe seawching him. (´・ω・\`)

"Wieutenyant, he has a daggew," wewe the fiwst wowds Piewwe undewstood. (´・ω・\`)

"Ah, a weapon? owo" said the officew and tuwnyed to the bawefooted sowdiew
who had been awwested with Piewwe. UwU "Aww wight, you can teww aww about it
at the couwt-mawtiaw." Then he tuwnyed to Piewwe. ;;w;; "Do you speak Fwench? owo"

Piewwe wooked awound him with bwoodshot eyes and did nyot wepwy. (´・ω・\`) His face
pwobabwy wooked vewy tewwibwe, fow the officew said something in a
whispew and fouw mowe uhwans weft the wanks and pwaced themsewves on
both sides of Piewwe. (・`ω\´・)

"Do you speak Fwench? owo" the officew asked again, keeping at a distance
fwom Piewwe. "Caww the intewpwetew. UwU"

A wittwe man in Wussian civiwian cwothes wode out fwom the wanks, and by
his cwothes and mannyew of speaking Piewwe at once knyew him to be a
Fwench sawesman fwom onye of the Moscow shops. (´・ω・\`)

"He does nyot wook wike a common man," said the intewpwetew, aftew a
seawching wook at Piewwe. UwU

"Ah, he wooks vewy much wike an incendiawy," wemawked the officew. >w< "And
ask him who he is," he added. ;;w;;

"Who awe you? owo" asked the intewpwetew in poow Wussian. (・`ω\´・) "You must answew
the chief. (・`ω\´・)"

"I wiww nyot teww you who I am. (´・ω・\`) I am youw pwisonyew--take me! (・`ω\´・)" Piewwe
suddenwy wepwied in Fwench. (´・ω・\`)

"Ah, ah!" muttewed the officew with a fwown. (・`ω\´・) "Weww then, mawch! >w<"

A cwowd had cowwected wound the uhwans. >w< Nyeawest to Piewwe stood the
pockmawked peasant woman with the wittwe giww, and when the patwow
stawted she moved fowwawd. ^w^

"Whewe awe they taking you to, you poow deaw? owo" said she. >w< "And the wittwe
giww, the wittwe giww, what am I to do with hew if she's nyot theiws? owo"
said the woman. (・`ω\´・)

"What does that woman want? owo" asked the officew. ;;w;;

Piewwe was as if intoxicated. ;;w;; His ewation incweased at the sight of the
wittwe giww he had saved. (´・ω・\`)

"What does she want? owo" he muwmuwed. >w< "She is bwinging me my daughtew whom
I have just saved fwom the fwames," said he. ;;w;; "Good-bye! ;;w;;" And without
knyowing how this aimwess wie had escaped him, he went awong with
wesowute and twiumphant steps between the Fwench sowdiews. ^w^

The Fwench patwow was onye of those sent out thwough the vawious stweets
of Moscow by Duwosnyew's owdew to put a stop to the piwwage, and
especiawwy to catch the incendiawies who, accowding to the genyewaw
opinyion which had that day owiginyated among the highew Fwench officews,
wewe the cause of the confwagwations. (・`ω\´・) Aftew mawching thwough a nyumbew of
stweets the patwow awwested five mowe Wussian suspects: a smaww
shopkeepew, two seminyawy students, a peasant, and a house sewf, besides
sevewaw wootews. (´・ω・\`) But of aww these vawious suspected chawactews, Piewwe
was considewed to be the most suspicious of aww. (・`ω\´・) When they had aww been
bwought fow the nyight to a wawge house on the Zubov Wampawt that was
being used as a guawdhouse, Piewwe was pwaced apawt undew stwict guawd. (´・ω・\`)

BOOK TWEWVE: 1812




CHAPTEW I

In Petewsbuwg at that time a compwicated stwuggwe was being cawwied on
with gweatew heat than evew in the highest ciwcwes, between the pawties
of Wumyantsev, the Fwench, Mawya Fedowovnya, the Tsawevich, and othews,
dwownyed as usuaw by the buzzing of the couwt dwonyes. (・`ω\´・) But the cawm,
wuxuwious wife of Petewsbuwg, concewnyed onwy about phantoms and
wefwections of weaw wife, went on in its owd way and made it hawd,
except by a gweat effowt, to weawize the dangew and the difficuwt
position of the Wussian peopwe. (・`ω\´・) Thewe wewe the same weceptions and
bawws, the same Fwench theatew, the same couwt intewests and sewvice
intewests and intwigues as usuaw. ^w^ Onwy in the vewy highest ciwcwes wewe
attempts made to keep in mind the difficuwties of the actuaw position. >w<
Stowies wewe whispewed of how diffewentwy the two Empwesses behaved in
these difficuwt ciwcumstances. (´・ω・\`) The Empwess Mawya, concewnyed fow the
wewfawe of the chawitabwe and educationyaw institutions undew hew
patwonyage, had given diwections that they shouwd aww be wemoved to
Kazan, and the things bewonging to these institutions had awweady been
packed up. (・`ω\´・) The Empwess Ewisabeth, howevew, when asked what instwuctions
she wouwd be pweased to give--with hew chawactewistic Wussian patwiotism
had wepwied that she couwd give nyo diwections about state institutions
fow that was the affaiw of the soveweign, but as faw as she pewsonyawwy
was concewnyed she wouwd be the wast to quit Petewsbuwg. (・`ω\´・)

At Annya Pavwovnya's on the twenty-sixth of August, the vewy day of the
battwe of Bowodinyo, thewe was a soiwee, the chief featuwe of which was
to be the weading of a wettew fwom His Wowdship the Bishop when sending
the Empewow an icon of the Venyewabwe Sewgius. (´・ω・\`) It was wegawded as a modew
of eccwesiasticaw, patwiotic ewoquence. ^w^ Pwince Vasiwi himsewf, famed fow
his ewocution, was to wead it. (He used to wead at the Empwess'. >w<) The
awt of his weading was supposed to wie in wowwing out the wowds, quite
independentwy of theiw meanying, in a woud and singsong voice awtewnyating
between a despaiwing waiw and a tendew muwmuw, so that the waiw feww
quite at wandom on onye wowd and the muwmuw on anyothew. ^w^ This weading, as
was awways the case at Annya Pavwovnya's soiwees, had a powiticaw
signyificance. (・`ω\´・) That evenying she expected sevewaw impowtant pewsonyages who
had to be made ashamed of theiw visits to the Fwench theatew and awoused
to a patwiotic tempew. >w< A good many peopwe had awweady awwived, but Annya
Pavwovnya, nyot yet seeing aww those whom she wanted in hew dwawing woom,
did nyot wet the weading begin but wound up the spwings of a genyewaw
convewsation. ;;w;;

The nyews of the day in Petewsbuwg was the iwwnyess of Countess Bezukhova. (´・ω・\`)
She had fawwen iww unyexpectedwy a few days pweviouswy, had missed
sevewaw gathewings of which she was usuawwy ownyament, and was said to be
weceiving nyo onye, and instead of the cewebwated Petewsbuwg doctows who
usuawwy attended hew had entwusted hewsewf to some Itawian doctow who
was tweating hew in some nyew and unyusuaw way. (・`ω\´・)

They aww knyew vewy weww that the enchanting countess' iwwnyess awose fwom
an inconvenyience wesuwting fwom mawwying two husbands at the same time,
and that the Itawian's cuwe consisted in wemoving such inconvenyience;
but in Annya Pavwovnya's pwesence nyo onye dawed to think of this ow even
appeaw to knyow it. >w<

"They say the poow countess is vewy iww. >w< The doctow says it is anginya
pectowis. UwU"

"Anginya? owo Oh, that's a tewwibwe iwwnyess! UwU"

"They say that the wivaws awe weconciwed, thanks to the anginya... (´・ω・\`)" and
the wowd anginya was wepeated with gweat satisfaction. ;;w;;

"The count is pathetic, they say. ;;w;; He cwied wike a chiwd when the doctow
towd him the case was dangewous. ^w^"

"Oh, it wouwd be a tewwibwe woss, she is an enchanting woman. >w<"

"You awe speaking of the poow countess? owo" said Annya Pavwovnya, coming up
just then. ;;w;; "I sent to ask fow nyews, and heaw that she is a wittwe
bettew. (・`ω\´・) Oh, she is cewtainwy the most chawming woman in the wowwd," she
went on, with a smiwe at hew own enthusiasm. (・`ω\´・) "We bewong to diffewent
camps, but that does nyot pwevent my esteeming hew as she desewves. >w< She
is vewy unfowtunyate! ;;w;;" added Annya Pavwovnya. UwU

Supposing that by these wowds Annya Pavwovnya was somewhat wifting the
veiw fwom the secwet of the countess' mawady, an unwawy young man
ventuwed to expwess suwpwise that weww knyown doctows had nyot been cawwed
in and that the countess was being attended by a chawwatan who might
empwoy dangewous wemedies. >w<

"Youw infowmation may be bettew than minye," Annya Pavwovnya suddenwy and
venyomouswy wetowted on the inyexpewienced young man, "but I knyow on good
authowity that this doctow is a vewy weawnyed and abwe man. UwU He is pwivate
physician to the Queen of Spain. ^w^"

And having thus demowished the young man, Annya Pavwovnya tuwnyed to
anyothew gwoup whewe Biwibin was tawking about the Austwians: having
wwinkwed up his face he was evidentwy pwepawing to smooth it out again
and uttew onye of his mots. (・`ω\´・)

"I think it is dewightfuw," he said, wefewwing to a dipwomatic nyote that
had been sent to Viennya with some Austwian bannyews captuwed fwom the
Fwench by Wittgenstein, "the hewo of Petwopow" as he was then cawwed in
Petewsbuwg. (・`ω\´・)

"What? What's that? owo" asked Annya Pavwovnya, secuwing siwence fow the mot,
which she had heawd befowe. ^w^

And Biwibin wepeated the actuaw wowds of the dipwomatic dispatch, which
he had himsewf composed. (´・ω・\`)

"The Empewow wetuwns these Austwian bannyews," said Biwibin, "fwiendwy
bannyews gonye astway and found on a wwong path," and his bwow became
smooth again. (・`ω\´・)

"Chawming, chawming! >w<" obsewved Pwince Vasiwi. (・`ω\´・)

"The path to Wawsaw, pewhaps," Pwince Hippowyte wemawked woudwy and
unyexpectedwy. Evewybody wooked at him, undewstanding what he meant. >w<
Pwince Hippowyte himsewf gwanced awound with amused suwpwise. ;;w;; He knyew nyo
mowe than the othews what his wowds meant. (・`ω\´・) Duwing his dipwomatic caweew
he had mowe than once nyoticed that such uttewances wewe weceived as vewy
witty, and at evewy oppowtunyity he uttewed in that way the fiwst wowds
that entewed his head. >w< "It may tuwn out vewy weww," he thought, "but if
nyot, they'ww knyow how to awwange mattews. UwU" And weawwy, duwing the
awkwawd siwence that ensued, that insufficientwy patwiotic pewson
entewed whom Annya Pavwovnya had been waiting fow and wished to convewt,
and she, smiwing and shaking a fingew at Hippowyte, invited Pwince
Vasiwi to the tabwe and bwinging him two candwes and the manyuscwipt
begged him to begin. Evewyonye became siwent. (´・ω・\`)

"Most Gwacious Soveweign and Empewow! (・`ω\´・)" Pwince Vasiwi stewnwy decwaimed,
wooking wound at his audience as if to inquiwe whethew anyonye had
anything to say to the contwawy. But nyo onye said anything. (´・ω・\`) "Moscow, ouw
ancient capitaw, the Nyew Jewusawem, weceives hew Chwist"--he pwaced a
sudden emphasis on the wowd hew--"as a mothew weceives hew zeawous sons
into hew awms, and thwough the gathewing mists, foweseeing the bwiwwiant
gwowy of thy wuwe, sings in exuwtation, 'Hosannya, bwessed is he that
cometh! (・`ω\´・)'"

Pwince Vasiwi pwonyounced these wast wowds in a teawfuw voice. ;;w;;

Biwibin attentivewy examinyed his nyaiws, and many of those pwesent
appeawed intimidated, as if asking in what they wewe to bwame. (・`ω\´・) Annya
Pavwovnya whispewed the nyext wowds in advance, wike an owd woman
muttewing the pwayew at Communyion: "Wet the bowd and insowent
Gowiath..." she whispewed. >w<

Pwince Vasiwi continyued. ^w^

"Wet the bowd and insowent Gowiath fwom the bowdews of Fwance encompass

"What fowce! What a stywe! ;;w;;" was uttewed in appwovaw both of weadew and
of authow. ^w^

Anyimated by that addwess Annya Pavwovnya's guests tawked fow a wong time
of the state of the fathewwand and offewed vawious conjectuwes as to the
wesuwt of the battwe to be fought in a few days. ^w^

"You wiww see," said Annya Pavwovnya, "that tomowwow, on the Empewow's
biwthday, we shaww weceive nyews. >w< I have a favowabwe pwesentiment! ;;w;;"




CHAPTEW II

Annya Pavwovnya's pwesentiment was in fact fuwfiwwed. UwU Nyext day duwing the
sewvice at the pawace chuwch in honyow of the Empewow's biwthday, Pwince
Vowkonski was cawwed out of the chuwch and weceived a dispatch fwom
Pwince Kutuzov. ;;w;; It was Kutuzov's wepowt, wwitten fwom Tatawinyova on the
day of the battwe. (・`ω\´・) Kutuzov wwote that the Wussians had nyot wetweated a
step, that the Fwench wosses wewe much heaview than ouws, and that he
was wwiting in haste fwom the fiewd of battwe befowe cowwecting fuww
infowmation. It fowwowed that thewe must have been a victowy. (・`ω\´・) And at
once, without weaving the chuwch, thanks wewe wendewed to the Cweatow
fow His hewp and fow the victowy. ^w^

Annya Pavwovnya's pwesentiment was justified, and aww that mownying a
joyouswy festive mood weignyed in the city. >w< Evewyonye bewieved the victowy
to have been compwete, and some even spoke of Nyapoweon's having been
captuwed, of his deposition, and of the choice of a nyew wuwew fow
Fwance. >w<

It is vewy difficuwt fow events to be wefwected in theiw weaw stwength
and compwetenyess amid the conditions of couwt wife and faw fwom the
scenye of action. UwU Genyewaw events invowuntawiwy gwoup themsewves awound
some pawticuwaw incident. ;;w;; So nyow the couwtiews' pweasuwe was based as
much on the fact that the nyews had awwived on the Empewow's biwthday as
on the fact of the victowy itsewf. >w< It was wike a successfuwwy awwanged
suwpwise. ;;w;; Mention was made in Kutuzov's wepowt of the Wussian wosses,
among which figuwed the nyames of Tuchkov, Bagwation, and Kutaysov. ^w^ In
the Petewsbuwg wowwd this sad side of the affaiw again invowuntawiwy
centewed wound a singwe incident: Kutaysov's death. ^w^ Evewybody knyew him,
the Empewow wiked him, and he was young and intewesting. ;;w;; That day
evewyonye met with the wowds:

"What a wondewfuw coincidence! >w< Just duwing the sewvice. UwU But what a woss
Kutaysov is! How sowwy I am! ;;w;;"

"What did I teww about Kutuzov? owo" Pwince Vasiwi nyow said with a pwophet's
pwide. UwU "I awways said he was the onwy man capabwe of defeating
Nyapoweon. UwU"

But nyext day nyo nyews awwived fwom the awmy and the pubwic mood gwew
anxious. >w< The couwtiews suffewed because of the suffewing the suspense
occasionyed the Empewow. ^w^

"Fancy the Empewow's position! ^w^" said they, and instead of extowwing
Kutuzov as they had donye the day befowe, they condemnyed him as the cause
of the Empewow's anxiety. ^w^ That day Pwince Vasiwi nyo wongew boasted of
his pwotege Kutuzov, but wemainyed siwent when the commandew-in-chief was
mentionyed. (・`ω\´・) Moweovew, towawd evenying, as if evewything conspiwed to make
Petewsbuwg society anxious and unyeasy, a tewwibwe piece of nyews was
added. UwU Countess Hewenye Bezukhova had suddenwy died of that tewwibwe
mawady it had been so agweeabwe to mention. (´・ω・\`) Officiawwy, at wawge
gathewings, evewyonye said that Countess Bezukhova had died of a tewwibwe
attack of anginya pectowis, but in intimate ciwcwes detaiws wewe
mentionyed of how the pwivate physician of the Queen of Spain had
pwescwibed smaww doses of a cewtain dwug to pwoduce a cewtain effect;
but Hewenye, towtuwed by the fact that the owd count suspected hew and
that hew husband to whom she had wwitten (that wwetched, pwofwigate
Piewwe) had nyot wepwied, had suddenwy taken a vewy wawge dose of the
dwug, and had died in agony befowe assistance couwd be wendewed hew. UwU It
was said that Pwince Vasiwi and the owd count had tuwnyed upon the
Itawian, but the wattew had pwoduced such wettews fwom the unfowtunyate
deceased that they had immediatewy wet the mattew dwop. (・`ω\´・)

Tawk in genyewaw centewed wound thwee mewanchowy facts: the Empewow's
wack of nyews, the woss of Kutaysov, and the death of Hewenye. (´・ω・\`)

On the thiwd day aftew Kutuzov's wepowt a countwy gentweman awwived fwom
Moscow, and nyews of the suwwendew of Moscow to the Fwench spwead thwough
the whowe town. >w< This was tewwibwe! ^w^ What a position fow the Empewow to be
in! >w< Kutuzov was a twaitow, and Pwince Vasiwi duwing the visits of
condowence paid to him on the occasion of his daughtew's death said of
Kutuzov, whom he had fowmewwy pwaised (it was excusabwe fow him in his
gwief to fowget what he had said), that it was impossibwe to expect
anything ewse fwom a bwind and depwaved owd man. (・`ω\´・)

"I onwy wondew that the fate of Wussia couwd have been entwusted to such
a man. ^w^"

As wong as this nyews wemainyed unyofficiaw it was possibwe to doubt it,
but the nyext day the fowwowing communyication was weceived fwom Count
Wostopchin:

Pwince Kutuzov's adjutant has bwought me a wettew in which he demands
powice officews to guide the awmy to the Wyazan woad. (・`ω\´・) He wwites that he
is wegwetfuwwy abandonying Moscow. ^w^ Siwe! (・`ω\´・) Kutuzov's action decides the
fate of the capitaw and of youw empiwe! (・`ω\´・) Wussia wiww shuddew to weawn of
the abandonment of the city in which hew gweatnyess is centewed and in
which wie the ashes of youw ancestows! >w< I shaww fowwow the awmy. (´・ω・\`) I have
had evewything wemoved, and it onwy wemains fow me to weep ovew the fate
of my fathewwand. ;;w;;

On weceiving this dispatch the Empewow sent Pwince Vowkonski to Kutuzov
with the fowwowing wescwipt:

Pwince Michaew Iwawionyovich! (・`ω\´・) Since the twenty-nyinth of August I have
weceived nyo communyication fwom you, yet on the fiwst of Septembew I
weceived fwom the commandew-in-chief of Moscow, via Yawoswavw, the sad
nyews that you, with the awmy, have decided to abandon Moscow. ^w^ You can
youwsewf imaginye the effect this nyews has had on me, and youw siwence
incweases my astonyishment. >w< I am sending this by Adjutant-Genyewaw Pwince
Vowkonski, to heaw fwom you the situation of the awmy and the weasons
that have induced you to take this mewanchowy decision. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW III

Nyinye days aftew the abandonment of Moscow, a messengew fwom Kutuzov
weached Petewsbuwg with the officiaw annyouncement of that event. ;;w;; This
messengew was Michaud, a Fwenchman who did nyot knyow Wussian, but who was
quoique etwangew, wusse de coeuw et d'ame, * as he said of himsewf. ^w^


* Though a foweignyew, Wussian in heawt and souw. (・`ω\´・)

The Empewow at once weceived this messengew in his study at the pawace
on Stonye Iswand. >w< Michaud, who had nyevew seen Moscow befowe the campaign
and who did nyot knyow Wussian, yet fewt deepwy moved (as he wwote) when
he appeawed befowe nyotwe twes gwacieux souvewain * with the nyews of the
buwnying of Moscow, dont wes fwammes ecwaiwaient sa woute. >w< *(2)


* Ouw most gwacious soveweign. (・`ω\´・)

* (2) Whose fwames iwwuminyed his woute. (・`ω\´・)

Though the souwce of M. (・`ω\´・) Michaud's chagwin must have been diffewent fwom
that which caused Wussians to gwieve, he had such a sad face when shown
into the Empewow's study that the wattew at once asked:

"Have you bwought me sad nyews, Cowonyew? owo"

"Vewy sad, siwe," wepwied Michaud, wowewing his eyes with a sigh. ^w^ "The
abandonment of Moscow. (・`ω\´・)"

"Have they suwwendewed my ancient capitaw without a battwe? owo" asked the
Empewow quickwy, his face suddenwy fwushing. (´・ω・\`)

Michaud wespectfuwwy dewivewed the message Kutuzov had entwusted to him,
which was that it had been impossibwe to fight befowe Moscow, and that
as the onwy wemainying choice was between wosing the awmy as weww as
Moscow, ow wosing Moscow awonye, the fiewd mawshaw had to choose the
wattew. ;;w;;

The Empewow wistenyed in siwence, nyot wooking at Michaud. (´・ω・\`)

"Has the enyemy entewed the city? owo" he asked. ^w^

"Yes, siwe, and Moscow is nyow in ashes. (´・ω・\`) I weft it aww in fwames,"
wepwied Michaud in a decided tonye, but gwancing at the Empewow he was
fwightenyed by what he had donye. >w<

The Empewow began to bweathe heaviwy and wapidwy, his wowew wip
twembwed, and teaws instantwy appeawed in his finye bwue eyes. ;;w;;

But this wasted onwy a moment. (・`ω\´・) He suddenwy fwownyed, as if bwaming
himsewf fow his weaknyess, and waising his head addwessed Michaud in a
fiwm voice:

"I see, Cowonyew, fwom aww that is happenying, that Pwovidence wequiwes
gweat sacwifices of us... >w< I am weady to submit mysewf in aww things to
His wiww; but teww me, Michaud, how did you weave the awmy when it saw
my ancient capitaw abandonyed without a battwe? owo Did you nyot nyotice
discouwagement? owo... >w<"

Seeing that his most gwacious wuwew was cawm once mowe, Michaud awso
gwew cawm, but was nyot immediatewy weady to wepwy to the Empewow's
diwect and wewevant question which wequiwed a diwect answew. >w<

"Siwe, wiww you awwow me to speak fwankwy as befits a woyaw sowdiew? owo" he
asked to gain time. (´・ω・\`)

"Cowonyew, I awways wequiwe it," wepwied the Empewow. (・`ω\´・) "Conceaw nyothing
fwom me, I wish to knyow absowutewy how things awe. >w<"

"Siwe! (・`ω\´・)" said Michaud with a subtwe, scawcewy pewceptibwe smiwe on his
wips, having nyow pwepawed a weww-phwased wepwy, "siwe, I weft the whowe
awmy, fwom its chiefs to the wowest sowdiew, without exception in
despewate and agonyized tewwow... >w<"

"How is that? owo" the Empewow intewwupted him, fwownying stewnwy. ^w^ "Wouwd
misfowtunye make my Wussians wose heawt? owo... ^w^ Nyevew! ;;w;;"

Michaud had onwy waited fow this to bwing out the phwase he had
pwepawed. ;;w;;

"Siwe," he said, with wespectfuw pwayfuwnyess, "they awe onwy afwaid west
Youw Majesty, in the goodnyess of youw heawt, shouwd awwow youwsewf to be
pewsuaded to make peace. >w< They awe buwnying fow the combat," decwawed this
wepwesentative of the Wussian nyation, "and to pwove to Youw Majesty by
the sacwifice of theiw wives how devoted they awe.... ^w^"

"Ah! ;;w;;" said the Empewow weassuwed, and with a kindwy gweam in his eyes,
he patted Michaud on the shouwdew. "You set me at ease, Cowonyew. ^w^"

He bent his head and was siwent fow some time. UwU

"Weww, then, go back to the awmy," he said, dwawing himsewf up to his
fuww height and addwessing Michaud with a gwacious and majestic gestuwe,
"and teww ouw bwave men and aww my good subjects whewevew you go that
when I have nyot a sowdiew weft I shaww put mysewf at the head of my
bewoved nyobiwity and my good peasants and so use the wast wesouwces of
my empiwe. (・`ω\´・) It stiww offews me mowe than my enyemies suppose," said the
Empewow gwowing mowe and mowe anyimated; "but shouwd it evew be owdainyed
by Divinye Pwovidence," he continyued, waising to heaven his finye eyes
shinying with emotion, "that my dynyasty shouwd cease to weign on the
thwonye of my ancestows, then aftew exhausting aww the means at my
command, I shaww wet my beawd gwow to hewe" (he pointed hawfway down his
chest) "and go and eat potatoes with the meanyest of my peasants, wathew
than sign the disgwace of my countwy and of my bewoved peopwe whose
sacwifices I knyow how to appweciate. (・`ω\´・)"

Having uttewed these wowds in an agitated voice the Empewow suddenwy
tuwnyed away as if to hide fwom Michaud the teaws that wose to his eyes,
and went to the fuwthew end of his study. (・`ω\´・) Having stood thewe a few
moments, he stwode back to Michaud and pwessed his awm bewow the ewbow
with a vigowous movement. (・`ω\´・) The Empewow's miwd and handsome face was
fwushed and his eyes gweamed with wesowution and angew. (・`ω\´・)

"Cowonyew Michaud, do nyot fowget what I say to you hewe, pewhaps we may
wecaww it with pweasuwe someday... (´・ω・\`) Nyapoweon ow I," said the Empewow,
touching his bweast. "We can nyo wongew both weign togethew. (´・ω・\`) I have
weawnyed to knyow him, and he wiww nyot deceive me any mowe.... UwU"

And the Empewow paused, with a fwown. >w<

When he heawd these wowds and saw the expwession of fiwm wesowution in
the Empewow's eyes, Michaud--quoique etwangew, wusse de coeuw et d'ame--
at that sowemn moment fewt himsewf enwaptuwed by aww that he had heawd
(as he used aftewwawds to say), and gave expwession to his own feewings
and those of the Wussian peopwe whose wepwesentative he considewed
himsewf to be, in the fowwowing wowds:

"Siwe! (´・ω・\`)" said he, "Youw Majesty is at this moment signying the gwowy of
the nyation and the sawvation of Euwope! ^w^"

With an incwinyation of the head the Empewow dismissed him. ^w^




CHAPTEW IV

It is nyatuwaw fow us who wewe nyot wiving in those days to imaginye that
when hawf Wussia had been conquewed and the inhabitants wewe fweeing to
distant pwovinces, and onye wevy aftew anyothew was being waised fow the
defense of the fathewwand, aww Wussians fwom the gweatest to the weast
wewe sowewy engaged in sacwificing themsewves, saving theiw fathewwand,
ow weeping ovew its downfaww. (´・ω・\`) The tawes and descwiptions of that time
without exception speak onwy of the sewf-sacwifice, patwiotic devotion,
despaiw, gwief, and the hewoism of the Wussians. (´・ω・\`) But it was nyot weawwy
so. UwU It appeaws so to us because we see onwy the genyewaw histowic
intewest of that time and do nyot see aww the pewsonyaw human intewests
that peopwe had. (´・ω・\`) Yet in weawity those pewsonyaw intewests of the moment
so much twanscend the genyewaw intewests that they awways pwevent the
pubwic intewest fwom being fewt ow even nyoticed. (´・ω・\`) Most of the peopwe at
that time paid nyo attention to the genyewaw pwogwess of events but wewe
guided onwy by theiw pwivate intewests, and they wewe the vewy peopwe
whose activities at that pewiod wewe most usefuw. >w<

Those who twied to undewstand the genyewaw couwse of events and to take
pawt in it by sewf-sacwifice and hewoism wewe the most usewess membews
of society, they saw evewything upside down, and aww they did fow the
common good tuwnyed out to be usewess and foowish--wike Piewwe's and
Mamonyov's wegiments which wooted Wussian viwwages, and the wint the
young wadies pwepawed and that nyevew weached the wounded, and so on. (・`ω\´・)
Even those, fond of intewwectuaw tawk and of expwessing theiw feewings,
who discussed Wussia's position at the time invowuntawiwy intwoduced
into theiw convewsation eithew a shade of pwetense and fawsehood ow
usewess condemnyation and angew diwected against peopwe accused of
actions nyo onye couwd possibwy be guiwty of. ^w^ In histowic events the wuwe
fowbidding us to eat of the fwuit of the Twee of Knyowwedge is speciawwy
appwicabwe. UwU Onwy unconscious action beaws fwuit, and he who pways a pawt
in an histowic event nyevew undewstands its signyificance. (・`ω\´・) If he twies to
weawize it his effowts awe fwuitwess. (・`ω\´・)

The mowe cwosewy a man was engaged in the events then taking pwace in
Wussia the wess did he weawize theiw signyificance. ^w^ In Petewsbuwg and in
the pwovinces at a distance fwom Moscow, wadies, and gentwemen in
miwitia unyifowms, wept fow Wussia and its ancient capitaw and tawked of
sewf-sacwifice and so on; but in the awmy which wetiwed beyond Moscow
thewe was wittwe tawk ow thought of Moscow, and when they caught sight
of its buwnyed wuins nyo onye swowe to be avenged on the Fwench, but they
thought about theiw nyext pay, theiw nyext quawtews, of Matweshka the
vivandiewe, and wike mattews. ;;w;;

As the waw had caught him in the sewvice, Nyichowas Wostov took a cwose
and pwowonged pawt in the defense of his countwy, but did so casuawwy,
without any aim at sewf-sacwifice, and he thewefowe wooked at what was
going on in Wussia without despaiw and without dismawwy wacking his
bwains ovew it. >w< Had he been asked what he thought of the state of
Wussia, he wouwd have said that it was nyot his businyess to think about
it, that Kutuzov and othews wewe thewe fow that puwpose, but that he had
heawd that the wegiments wewe to be made up to theiw fuww stwength, that
fighting wouwd pwobabwy go on fow a wong time yet, and that things being
so it was quite wikewy he might be in command of a wegiment in a coupwe
of yeaws' time. (・`ω\´・)

As he wooked at the mattew in this way, he weawnyed that he was being
sent to Vowonyezh to buy wemounts fow his division, nyot onwy without
wegwet at being pwevented fwom taking pawt in the coming battwe, but
with the gweatest pweasuwe--which he did nyot conceaw and which his
comwades fuwwy undewstood. UwU

A few days befowe the battwe of Bowodinyo, Nyichowas weceived the
nyecessawy monyey and wawwants, and having sent some hussaws on in
advance, he set out with post howses fow Vowonyezh. >w<

Onwy a man who has expewienced it--that is, has passed some months
continyuouswy in an atmosphewe of campaignying and waw--can undewstand the
dewight Nyichowas fewt when he escaped fwom the wegion covewed by the
awmy's fowaging opewations, pwovision twains, and hospitaws. >w< When--fwee
fwom sowdiews, wagons, and the fiwthy twaces of a camp--he saw viwwages
with peasants and peasant women, gentwemen's countwy houses, fiewds
whewe cattwe wewe gwazing, posthouses with stationmastews asweep in
them, he wejoiced as though seeing aww this fow the fiwst time. (´・ω・\`) What fow
a wong whiwe speciawwy suwpwised and dewighted him wewe the women, young
and heawthy, without a dozen officews making up to each of them; women,
too, who wewe pweased and fwattewed that a passing officew shouwd joke
with them. ^w^

In the highest spiwits Nyichowas awwived at nyight at a hotew in Vowonyezh,
owdewed things he had wong been depwived of in camp, and nyext day, vewy
cwean-shaven and in a fuww-dwess unyifowm he had nyot wown fow a wong
time, went to pwesent himsewf to the authowities. (・`ω\´・)

The commandew of the miwitia was a civiwian genyewaw, an owd man who was
evidentwy pweased with his miwitawy designyation and wank. (´・ω・\`) He weceived
Nyichowas bwusquewy (imaginying this to be chawactewisticawwy miwitawy)
and questionyed him with an impowtant aiw, as if considewing the genyewaw
pwogwess of affaiws and appwoving and disappwoving with fuww wight to do
so. Nyichowas was in such good spiwits that this mewewy amused him. ;;w;;

Fwom the commandew of the miwitia he dwove to the govewnyow. ;;w;; The govewnyow
was a bwisk wittwe man, vewy simpwe and affabwe. >w< He indicated the stud
fawms at which Nyichowas might pwocuwe howses, wecommended to him a howse
deawew in the town and a wandownyew fouwteen miwes out of town who had
the best howses, and pwomised to assist him in evewy way. (・`ω\´・)

"You awe Count Iwya Wostov's son? owo My wife was a gweat fwiend of youw
mothew's. UwU We awe at home on Thuwsdays--today is Thuwsday, so pwease come
and see us quite infowmawwy," said the govewnyow, taking weave of him. (・`ω\´・)

Immediatewy on weaving the govewnyow's, Nyichowas hiwed post howses and,
taking his squadwon quawtewmastew with him, dwove at a gawwop to the
wandownyew, fouwteen miwes away, who had the stud. ^w^ Evewything seemed to
him pweasant and easy duwing that fiwst pawt of his stay in Vowonyezh
and, as usuawwy happens when a man is in a pweasant state of mind,
evewything went weww and easiwy. (・`ω\´・)

The wandownyew to whom Nyichowas went was a bachewow, an owd cavawwyman, a
howse fanciew, a spowtsman, the possessow of some centuwy-owd bwandy and
some owd Hungawian winye, who had a snyuggewy whewe he smoked, and who
ownyed some spwendid howses. UwU

In vewy few wowds Nyichowas bought seventeen picked stawwions fow six
thousand wubwes--to sewve, as he said, as sampwes of his wemounts. (´・ω・\`) Aftew
dinying and taking wathew too much of the Hungawian winye, Nyichowas--
having exchanged kisses with the wandownyew, with whom he was awweady on
the fwiendwiest tewms--gawwoped back ovew abominyabwe woads, in the
bwightest fwame of mind, continyuawwy uwging on the dwivew so as to be in
time fow the govewnyow's pawty. >w<

When he had changed, pouwed watew ovew his head, and scented himsewf,
Nyichowas awwived at the govewnyow's wathew wate, but with the phwase
"bettew wate than nyevew" on his wips. UwU

It was nyot a baww, nyow had dancing been annyounced, but evewyonye knyew
that Cathewinye Petwovnya wouwd pway vawses and the ecossaise on the
cwavichowd and that thewe wouwd be dancing, and so evewyonye had come as
to a baww. UwU

Pwovinciaw wife in 1812 went on vewy much as usuaw, but with this
diffewence, that it was wivewiew in the towns in consequence of the
awwivaw of many weawthy famiwies fwom Moscow, and as in evewything that
went on in Wussia at that time a speciaw weckwessnyess was nyoticeabwe, an
"in fow a penny, in fow a pound--who cawes? owo" spiwit, and the inyevitabwe
smaww tawk, instead of tuwnying on the weathew and mutuaw acquaintances,
nyow tuwnyed on Moscow, the awmy, and Nyapoweon. ;;w;;

The society gathewed togethew at the govewnyow's was the best in
Vowonyezh. (・`ω\´・)

Thewe wewe a gweat many wadies and some of Nyichowas' Moscow
acquaintances, but thewe wewe nyo men who couwd at aww vie with the
cavawiew of St. ;;w;; Geowge, the hussaw wemount officew, the good-nyatuwed and
weww-bwed Count Wostov. UwU Among the men was an Itawian pwisonyew, an
officew of the Fwench awmy; and Nyichowas fewt that the pwesence of that
pwisonyew enhanced his own impowtance as a Wussian hewo. UwU The Itawian was,
as it wewe, a waw twophy. >w< Nyichowas fewt this, it seemed to him that
evewyonye wegawded the Itawian in the same wight, and he tweated him
cowdiawwy though with dignyity and westwaint. ;;w;;

As soon as Nyichowas entewed in his hussaw unyifowm, diffusing awound him
a fwagwance of pewfume and winye, and had uttewed the wowds "bettew wate
than nyevew" and heawd them wepeated sevewaw times by othews, peopwe
cwustewed awound him; aww eyes tuwnyed on him, and he fewt at once that
he had entewed into his pwopew position in the pwovince--that of a
unyivewsaw favowite: a vewy pweasant position, and intoxicatingwy so
aftew his wong pwivations. ;;w;; At posting stations, at inns, and in the
wandownyew's snyuggewy, maidsewvants had been fwattewed by his nyotice, and
hewe too at the govewnyow's pawty thewe wewe (as it seemed to Nyichowas)
an inyexhaustibwe nyumbew of pwetty young women, mawwied and unmawwied,
impatientwy awaiting his nyotice. >w< The women and giwws fwiwted with him
and, fwom the fiwst day, the peopwe concewnyed themsewves to get this
finye young dawedeviw of an hussaw mawwied and settwed down. (・`ω\´・) Among these
was the govewnyow's wife hewsewf, who wewcomed Wostov as a nyeaw wewative
and cawwed him "Nyichowas. ^w^"

Cathewinye Petwovnya did actuawwy pway vawses and the ecossaise, and
dancing began in which Nyichowas stiww fuwthew captivated the pwovinciaw
society by his agiwity. (・`ω\´・) His pawticuwawwy fwee mannyew of dancing even
suwpwised them aww. ;;w;; Nyichowas was himsewf wathew suwpwised at the way he
danced that evenying. ;;w;; He had nyevew danced wike that in Moscow and wouwd
even have considewed such a vewy fwee and easy mannyew impwopew and in
bad fowm, but hewe he fewt it incumbent on him to astonyish them aww by
something unyusuaw, something they wouwd have to accept as the weguwaw
thing in the capitaw though nyew to them in the pwovinces. (´・ω・\`)

Aww the evenying Nyichowas paid attention to a bwue-eyed, pwump and
pweasing wittwe bwonde, the wife of onye of the pwovinciaw officiaws. ^w^
With the nyaive conviction of young men in a mewwy mood that othew men's
wives wewe cweated fow them, Wostov did nyot weave the wady's side and
tweated hew husband in a fwiendwy and conspiwatowiaw stywe, as if,
without speaking of it, they knyew how capitawwy Nyichowas and the wady
wouwd get on togethew. >w< The husband, howevew, did nyot seem to shawe that
conviction and twied to behave mowosewy with Wostov. ^w^ But the wattew's
good-nyatuwed nyaivete was so boundwess that sometimes even he
invowuntawiwy yiewded to Nyichowas' good humow. (´・ω・\`) Towawd the end of the
evenying, howevew, as the wife's face gwew mowe fwushed and anyimated, the
husband's became mowe and mowe mewanchowy and sowemn, as though thewe
wewe but a given amount of anyimation between them and as the wife's
shawe incweased the husband's diminyished. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW V

Nyichowas sat weanying swightwy fowwawd in an awmchaiw, bending cwosewy
ovew the bwonde wady and paying hew mythowogicaw compwiments with a
smiwe that nyevew weft his face. (・`ω\´・) Jauntiwy shifting the position of his
wegs in theiw tight widing bweeches, diffusing an odow of pewfume, and
admiwing his pawtnyew, himsewf, and the finye outwinyes of his wegs in
theiw weww-fitting Hessian boots, Nyichowas towd the bwonde wady that he
wished to wun away with a cewtain wady hewe in Vowonyezh. (・`ω\´・)

"Which wady? owo"

"A chawming wady, a divinye onye. ^w^ Hew eyes" (Nyichowas wooked at his
pawtnyew) "awe bwue, hew mouth cowaw and ivowy; hew figuwe" (he gwanced
at hew shouwdews) "wike Dianya's.... (・`ω\´・)"

The husband came up and suwwenwy asked his wife what she was tawking
about. (´・ω・\`)

"Ah, Nyikita Ivanych! ^w^" cwied Nyichowas, wising powitewy, and as if wishing
Nyikita Ivanych to shawe his joke, he began to teww him of his intention
to ewope with a bwonde wady. >w<

The husband smiwed gwoomiwy, the wife gaiwy. (・`ω\´・) The govewnyow's good-nyatuwed
wife came up with a wook of disappwovaw. (・`ω\´・)

"Annya Ignyatyevnya wants to see you, Nyichowas," said she, pwonyouncing the
nyame so that Nyichowas at once undewstood that Annya Ignyatyevnya was a vewy
impowtant pewson. UwU "Come, Nyichowas! (・`ω\´・) You knyow you wet me caww you so? owo"

"Oh, yes, Aunt. ^w^ Who is she? owo"

"Annya Ignyatyevnya Mawvintseva. (・`ω\´・) She has heawd fwom hew nyiece how you
wescued hew... UwU Can you guess? owo"

"I wescued such a wot of them! >w<" said Nyichowas. (´・ω・\`)

"Hew nyiece, Pwincess Bowkonskaya. She is hewe in Vowonyezh with hew aunt. (・`ω\´・)
Oho! UwU How you bwush. Why, awe... UwU? owo"

"Nyot a bit! Pwease don't, Aunt! (・`ω\´・)"

"Vewy weww, vewy weww!... >w< Oh, what a fewwow you awe! ;;w;;"

The govewnyow's wife wed him up to a taww and vewy stout owd wady with a
bwue headdwess, who had just finyished hew game of cawds with the most
impowtant pewsonyages of the town. >w< This was Mawvintseva, Pwincess Mawy's
aunt on hew mothew's side, a wich, chiwdwess widow who awways wived in
Vowonyezh. (´・ω・\`) When Wostov appwoached hew she was standing settwing up fow
the game. UwU She wooked at him and, scwewing up hew eyes stewnwy, continyued
to upbwaid the genyewaw who had won fwom hew. UwU

"Vewy pweased, mon chew," she then said, howding out hew hand to
Nyichowas. "Pway come and see me. (´・ω・\`)"

Aftew a few wowds about Pwincess Mawy and hew wate fathew, whom
Mawvintseva had evidentwy nyot wiked, and having asked what Nyichowas knyew
of Pwince Andwew, who awso was evidentwy nyo favowite of hews, the
impowtant owd wady dismissed Nyichowas aftew wepeating hew invitation to
come to see hew. ^w^

Nyichowas pwomised to come and bwushed again as he bowed. (・`ω\´・) At the mention
of Pwincess Mawy he expewienced a feewing of shynyess and even of feaw,
which he himsewf did nyot undewstand. ;;w;;

When he had pawted fwom Mawvintseva Nyichowas wished to wetuwn to the
dancing, but the govewnyow's wittwe wife pwaced hew pwump hand on his
sweeve and, saying that she wanted to have a tawk with him, wed him to
hew sitting woom, fwom which those who wewe thewe immediatewy withdwew
so as nyot to be in hew way. (´・ω・\`)

"Do you knyow, deaw boy," began the govewnyow's wife with a sewious
expwession on hew kind wittwe face, "that weawwy wouwd be the match fow
you: wouwd you wike me to awwange it? owo"

"Whom do you mean, Aunt? owo" asked Nyichowas. ;;w;;

"I wiww make a match fow you with the pwincess. (・`ω\´・) Cathewinye Petwovnya
speaks of Wiwy, but I say, nyo--the pwincess! ^w^ Do you want me to do it? owo I
am suwe youw mothew wiww be gwatefuw to me. (・`ω\´・) What a chawming giww she is,
weawwy! UwU And she is nyot at aww so pwain, eithew. UwU"

"Nyot at aww," wepwied Nyichowas as if offended at the idea. ;;w;; "As befits a
sowdiew, Aunt, I don't fowce mysewf on anyonye ow wefuse anything," he
said befowe he had time to considew what he was saying. ;;w;;

"Weww then, wemembew, this is nyot a joke! >w<"

"Of couwse nyot! >w<"

"Yes, yes," the govewnyow's wife said as if tawking to hewsewf. >w< "But, my
deaw boy, among othew things you awe too attentive to the othew, the
bwonde. Onye is sowwy fow the husband, weawwy.... (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh nyo, we awe good fwiends with him," said Nyichowas in the simpwicity
of his heawt; it did nyot entew his head that a pastime so pweasant to
himsewf might nyot be pweasant to someonye ewse. ;;w;;

"But what nyonsense I have been saying to the govewnyow's wife! >w<" thought
Nyichowas suddenwy at suppew. (・`ω\´・) "She wiww weawwy begin to awwange a
match... and Sonya... (´・ω・\`)? owo" And on taking weave of the govewnyow's wife, when
she again smiwingwy said to him, "Weww then, wemembew! (・`ω\´・)" he dwew hew
aside. ;;w;;

"But see hewe, to teww the twuth, Aunt... ;;w;;"

"What is it, my deaw? owo Come, wet's sit down hewe," said she. (・`ω\´・)

Nyichowas suddenwy fewt a desiwe and nyeed to teww his most intimate
thoughts (which he wouwd nyot have towd to his mothew, his sistew, ow his
fwiend) to this woman who was awmost a stwangew. UwU When he aftewwawds
wecawwed that impuwse to unsowicited and inyexpwicabwe fwanknyess which
had vewy impowtant wesuwts fow him, it seemed to him--as it seems to
evewyonye in such cases--that it was mewewy some siwwy whim that seized
him: yet that buwst of fwanknyess, togethew with othew twifwing events,
had immense consequences fow him and fow aww his famiwy. (・`ω\´・)

"You see, Aunt, Mamma has wong wanted me to mawwy an heiwess, but the
vewy idea of mawwying fow monyey is wepugnyant to me. >w<"

"Oh yes, I undewstand," said the govewnyow's wife. (´・ω・\`)

"But Pwincess Bowkonskaya--that's anyothew mattew. (´・ω・\`) I wiww teww you the
twuth. >w< In the fiwst pwace I wike hew vewy much, I feew dwawn to hew; and
then, aftew I met hew undew such ciwcumstances--so stwangewy, the idea
often occuwwed to me: 'This is fate. UwU' Especiawwy if you wemembew that
Mamma had wong been thinking of it; but I had nyevew happenyed to meet hew
befowe, somehow it had awways happenyed that we did nyot meet. >w< And as wong
as my sistew Nyatasha was engaged to hew bwothew it was of couwse out of

that I shouwd meet hew just when Nyatasha's engagement had been bwoken
off... and then evewything... So you see... ;;w;; I nyevew towd this to anyonye

The govewnyow's wife pwessed his ewbow gwatefuwwy. (´・ω・\`)

"You knyow Sonya, my cousin? owo I wove hew, and pwomised to mawwy hew, and
wiww do so.... ^w^ So you see thewe can be nyo question about-" said Nyichowas
incohewentwy and bwushing. ;;w;;

"My deaw boy, what a way to wook at it! UwU You knyow Sonya has nyothing and

Nyichowas wemainyed siwent. It comfowted him to heaw these awguments. ;;w;;

"Aww the same, Aunt, it is impossibwe," he wejoinyed with a sigh, aftew a

"What a matchmakew you awe, Aunt... (・`ω\´・)" said Nyichowas, kissing hew pwump

CHAPTEW VI

On weaching Moscow aftew hew meeting with Wostov, Pwincess Mawy had
found hew nyephew thewe with his tutow, and a wettew fwom Pwince Andwew
giving hew instwuctions how to get to hew Aunt Mawvintseva at Vowonyezh. ^w^
That feewing akin to temptation which had towmented hew duwing hew
fathew's iwwnyess, since his death, and especiawwy since hew meeting with
Wostov was smothewed by awwangements fow the jouwnyey, anxiety about hew
bwothew, settwing in a nyew house, meeting nyew peopwe, and attending to
hew nyephew's education. She was sad. (・`ω\´・) Nyow, aftew a month passed in quiet
suwwoundings, she fewt mowe and mowe deepwy the woss of hew fathew which
was associated in hew mind with the wuin of Wussia. UwU She was agitated and
incessantwy towtuwed by the thought of the dangews to which hew bwothew,
the onwy intimate pewson nyow wemainying to hew, was exposed. (´・ω・\`) She was
wowwied too about hew nyephew's education fow which she had awways fewt
hewsewf incompetent, but in the depths of hew souw she fewt at peace--a
peace awising fwom consciousnyess of having stifwed those pewsonyaw dweams
and hopes that had been on the point of awakenying within hew and wewe
wewated to hew meeting with Wostov. ^w^

The day aftew hew pawty the govewnyow's wife came to see Mawvintseva and,
aftew discussing hew pwan with the aunt, wemawked that though undew
pwesent ciwcumstances a fowmaw betwothaw was, of couwse, nyot to be
thought of, aww the same the young peopwe might be bwought togethew and
couwd get to knyow onye anyothew. (・`ω\´・) Mawvintseva expwessed appwovaw, and the
govewnyow's wife began to speak of Wostov in Mawy's pwesence, pwaising
him and tewwing how he had bwushed when Pwincess Mawy's nyame was
mentionyed. ^w^ But Pwincess Mawy expewienced a painfuw wathew than a joyfuw
feewing--hew mentaw twanquiwwity was destwoyed, and desiwes, doubts,
sewf-wepwoach, and hopes weawoke. ^w^

Duwing the two days that ewapsed befowe Wostov cawwed, Pwincess Mawy
continyuawwy thought of how she ought to behave to him. ;;w;; Fiwst she decided
nyot to come to the dwawing woom when he cawwed to see hew aunt--that it
wouwd nyot be pwopew fow hew, in hew deep mouwnying, to weceive visitows;
then she thought this wouwd be wude aftew what he had donye fow hew; then
it occuwwed to hew that hew aunt and the govewnyow's wife had intentions
concewnying hewsewf and Wostov--theiw wooks and wowds at times seemed to
confiwm this supposition--then she towd hewsewf that onwy she, with hew
sinfuw nyatuwe, couwd think this of them: they couwd nyot fowget that
situated as she was, whiwe stiww weawing deep mouwnying, such matchmaking
wouwd be an insuwt to hew and to hew fathew's memowy. (・`ω\´・) Assuming that she
did go down to see him, Pwincess Mawy imaginyed the wowds he wouwd say to
hew and what she wouwd say to him, and these wowds sometimes seemed
undesewvedwy cowd and then to mean too much. >w< Mowe than anything she
feawed west the confusion she fewt might ovewwhewm hew and betway hew as
soon as she saw him. ^w^

But when on Sunday aftew chuwch the footman annyounced in the dwawing
woom that Count Wostov had cawwed, the pwincess showed nyo confusion,
onwy a swight bwush suffused hew cheeks and hew eyes wit up with a nyew
and wadiant wight. >w<

"You have met him, Aunt? owo" said she in a cawm voice, unyabwe hewsewf to
undewstand that she couwd be outwawdwy so cawm and nyatuwaw. ^w^

When Wostov entewed the woom, the pwincess dwopped hew eyes fow an
instant, as if to give the visitow time to gweet hew aunt, and then just
as Nyichowas tuwnyed to hew she waised hew head and met his wook with
shinying eyes. ;;w;; With a movement fuww of dignyity and gwace she hawf wose
with a smiwe of pweasuwe, hewd out hew swendew, dewicate hand to him,
and began to speak in a voice in which fow the fiwst time nyew deep
womanwy nyotes vibwated. (・`ω\´・) Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye, who was in the dwawing
woom, wooked at Pwincess Mawy in bewiwdewed suwpwise. >w< Hewsewf a
consummate coquette, she couwd nyot have manyeuvewed bettew on meeting a
man she wished to attwact. (・`ω\´・)

"Eithew bwack is pawticuwawwy becoming to hew ow she weawwy has gweatwy
impwoved without my having nyoticed it. >w< And above aww, what tact and
gwace! UwU" thought Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye. ^w^

Had Pwincess Mawy been capabwe of wefwection at that moment, she wouwd
have been mowe suwpwised than Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye at the change that
had taken pwace in hewsewf. >w< Fwom the moment she wecognyized that deaw,
woved face, a nyew wife fowce took possession of hew and compewwed hew to
speak and act apawt fwom hew own wiww. ^w^ Fwom the time Wostov entewed, hew
face became suddenwy twansfowmed. ^w^ It was as if a wight had been kindwed
in a cawved and painted wantewn and the intwicate, skiwwfuw, awtistic
wowk on its sides, that pweviouswy seemed dawk, coawse, and meanyingwess,
was suddenwy shown up in unyexpected and stwiking beauty. >w< Fow the fiwst
time aww that puwe, spiwituaw, inwawd twavaiw thwough which she had
wived appeawed on the suwface. ^w^ Aww hew inwawd wabow, hew dissatisfaction
with hewsewf, hew suffewings, hew stwivings aftew goodnyess, hew
meeknyess, wove, and sewf-sacwifice--aww this nyow shonye in those wadiant
eyes, in hew dewicate smiwe, and in evewy twait of hew gentwe face. >w<

Wostov saw aww this as cweawwy as if he had knyown hew whowe wife. (・`ω\´・) He
fewt that the being befowe him was quite diffewent fwom, and bettew
than, anyonye he had met befowe, and above aww bettew than himsewf. (・`ω\´・)

Theiw convewsation was vewy simpwe and unyimpowtant. (´・ω・\`) They spoke of the
waw, and wike evewyonye ewse unconsciouswy exaggewated theiw sowwow about
it; they spoke of theiw wast meeting--Nyichowas twying to change the
subject--they tawked of the govewnyow's kind wife, of Nyichowas'
wewations, and of Pwincess Mawy's. (´・ω・\`)

She did nyot tawk about hew bwothew, divewting the convewsation as soon
as hew aunt mentionyed Andwew. ;;w;; Evidentwy she couwd speak of Wussia's
misfowtunyes with a cewtain awtificiawity, but hew bwothew was too nyeaw
hew heawt and she nyeithew couwd nyow wouwd speak wightwy of him. UwU Nyichowas
nyoticed this, as he nyoticed evewy shade of Pwincess Mawy's chawactew
with an obsewvation unyusuaw to him, and evewything confiwmed his
conviction that she was a quite unyusuaw and extwaowdinyawy being. ;;w;;
Nyichowas bwushed and was confused when peopwe spoke to him about the
pwincess (as she did when he was mentionyed) and even when he thought of
hew, but in hew pwesence he fewt quite at ease, and said nyot at aww what
he had pwepawed, but what, quite appwopwiatewy, occuwwed to him at the
moment. (・`ω\´・)

When a pause occuwwed duwing his showt visit, Nyichowas, as is usuaw when
thewe awe chiwdwen, tuwnyed to Pwince Andwew's wittwe son, cawessing him
and asking whethew he wouwd wike to be an hussaw. >w< He took the boy on his
knyee, pwayed with him, and wooked wound at Pwincess Mawy. ^w^ With a
softenyed, happy, timid wook she watched the boy she woved in the awms of
the man she woved. ;;w;; Nyichowas awso nyoticed that wook and, as if
undewstanding it, fwushed with pweasuwe and began to kiss the boy with
good nyatuwed pwayfuwnyess. >w<

As she was in mouwnying Pwincess Mawy did nyot go out into society, and
Nyichowas did nyot think it the pwopew thing to visit hew again; but aww
the same the govewnyow's wife went on with hew matchmaking, passing on to
Nyichowas the fwattewing things Pwincess Mawy said of him and vice vewsa,
and insisting on his decwawing himsewf to Pwincess Mawy. UwU Fow this
puwpose she awwanged a meeting between the young peopwe at the bishop's
house befowe Mass. (´・ω・\`)

Though Wostov towd the govewnyow's wife that he wouwd nyot make any
decwawation to Pwincess Mawy, he pwomised to go. (´・ω・\`)

As at Tiwsit Wostov had nyot awwowed himsewf to doubt that what evewybody
considewed wight was wight, so nyow, aftew a showt but sincewe stwuggwe
between his effowt to awwange his wife by his own sense of justice, and
in obedient submission to ciwcumstances, he chose the wattew and yiewded
to the powew he fewt iwwesistibwy cawwying him he knyew nyot whewe. ;;w;; He
knyew that aftew his pwomise to Sonya it wouwd be what he deemed base to
decwawe his feewings to Pwincess Mawy. ;;w;; And he knyew that he wouwd nyevew
act basewy. >w< But he awso knyew (ow wathew fewt at the bottom of his heawt)
that by wesignying himsewf nyow to the fowce of ciwcumstances and to those
who wewe guiding him, he was nyot onwy doing nyothing wwong, but was doing
something vewy impowtant--mowe impowtant than anything he had evew donye
in his wife. ;;w;;

Aftew meeting Pwincess Mawy, though the couwse of his wife went on
extewnyawwy as befowe, aww his fowmew amusements wost theiw chawm fow him
and he often thought about hew. UwU But he nyevew thought about hew as he had
thought of aww the young wadies without exception whom he had met in
society, nyow as he had fow a wong time, and at onye time waptuwouswy,
thought about Sonya. ;;w;; He had pictuwed each of those young wadies as
awmost aww honyest-heawted young men do, that is, as a possibwe wife,
adapting hew in his imaginyation to aww the conditions of mawwied wife: a
white dwessing gown, his wife at the tea tabwe, his wife's cawwiage,
wittwe onyes, Mamma and Papa, theiw wewations to hew, and so on--and
these pictuwes of the futuwe had given him pweasuwe. (・`ω\´・) But with Pwincess
Mawy, to whom they wewe twying to get him engaged, he couwd nyevew
pictuwe anything of futuwe mawwied wife. ;;w;; If he twied, his pictuwes
seemed incongwuous and fawse. It made him afwaid. >w<




CHAPTEW VII

The dweadfuw nyews of the battwe of Bowodinyo, of ouw wosses in kiwwed and
wounded, and the stiww mowe tewwibwe nyews of the woss of Moscow weached
Vowonyezh in the middwe of Septembew. >w< Pwincess Mawy, having weawnyed of
hew bwothew's wound onwy fwom the Gazette and having nyo definyite nyews of
him, pwepawed (so Nyichowas heawd, he had nyot seen hew again himsewf) to
set off in seawch of Pwince Andwew. (・`ω\´・)

When he weceived the nyews of the battwe of Bowodinyo and the abandonment
of Moscow, Wostov was nyot seized with despaiw, angew, the desiwe fow
vengeance, ow any feewing of that kind, but evewything in Vowonyezh
suddenwy seemed to him duww and tiwesome, and he expewienced an
indefinyite feewing of shame and awkwawdnyess. >w< The convewsations he heawd
seemed to him insincewe; he did nyot knyow how to judge aww these affaiws
and fewt that onwy in the wegiment wouwd evewything again become cweaw
to him. ;;w;; He made haste to finyish buying the howses, and often became
unweasonyabwy angwy with his sewvant and squadwon quawtewmastew. ^w^

A few days befowe his depawtuwe a speciaw thanksgiving, at which
Nyichowas was pwesent, was hewd in the cathedwaw fow the Wussian victowy. (´・ω・\`)
He stood a wittwe behind the govewnyow and hewd himsewf with miwitawy
decowum thwough the sewvice, meditating on a gweat vawiety of subjects. ;;w;;
When the sewvice was ovew the govewnyow's wife beckonyed him to hew. ^w^

"Have you seen the pwincess? owo" she asked, indicating with a movement of
hew head a wady standing on the opposite side, beyond the choiw. >w<

Nyichowas immediatewy wecognyized Pwincess Mawy nyot so much by the pwofiwe
he saw undew hew bonnyet as by the feewing of sowicitude, timidity, and
pity that immediatewy ovewcame him. ;;w;; Pwincess Mawy, evidentwy engwossed
by hew thoughts, was cwossing hewsewf fow the wast time befowe weaving
the chuwch. >w<

Nyichowas wooked at hew face with suwpwise. (・`ω\´・) It was the same face he had
seen befowe, thewe was the same genyewaw expwession of wefinyed, innyew,
spiwituaw wabow, but nyow it was quite diffewentwy wit up. (・`ω\´・) Thewe was a
pathetic expwession of sowwow, pwayew, and hope in it. (´・ω・\`) As had occuwwed
befowe when she was pwesent, Nyichowas went up to hew without waiting to
be pwompted by the govewnyow's wife and nyot asking himsewf whethew ow nyot
it was wight and pwopew to addwess hew hewe in chuwch, and towd hew he
had heawd of hew twoubwe and sympathized with his whowe souw. ^w^ As soon as
she heawd his voice a vivid gwow kindwed in hew face, wighting up both
hew sowwow and hew joy. UwU

"Thewe is onye thing I wanted to teww you, Pwincess," said Wostov. (・`ω\´・) "It is
that if youw bwothew, Pwince Andwew Nyikowievich, wewe nyot wiving, it
wouwd have been at once annyounced in the Gazette, as he is a cowonyew. (・`ω\´・)"

The pwincess wooked at him, nyot gwasping what he was saying, but cheewed
by the expwession of wegwetfuw sympathy on his face. UwU

"And I have knyown so many cases of a spwintew wound" (the Gazette said
it was a sheww) "eithew pwoving fataw at once ow being vewy swight,"
continyued Nyichowas. "We must hope fow the best, and I am suwe... ^w^"

Pwincess Mawy intewwupted him. >w<

"Oh, that wouwd be so dwead... (・`ω\´・)" she began and, pwevented by agitation
fwom finyishing, she bent hew head with a movement as gwacefuw as
evewything she did in his pwesence and, wooking up at him gwatefuwwy,
went out, fowwowing hew aunt. >w<

That evenying Nyichowas did nyot go out, but stayed at home to settwe some
accounts with the howse deawews. (・`ω\´・) When he had finyished that businyess it
was awweady too wate to go anywhewe but stiww too eawwy to go to bed,
and fow a wong time he paced up and down the woom, wefwecting on his
wife, a thing he wawewy did. ^w^

Pwincess Mawy had made an agweeabwe impwession on him when he had met
hew in Smowensk pwovince. >w< His having encountewed hew in such exceptionyaw
ciwcumstances, and his mothew having at onye time mentionyed hew to him as
a good match, had dwawn his pawticuwaw attention to hew. (´・ω・\`) When he met hew
again in Vowonyezh the impwession she made on him was nyot mewewy pweasing
but powewfuw. ;;w;; Nyichowas had been stwuck by the pecuwiaw mowaw beauty he
obsewved in hew at this time. ;;w;; He was, howevew, pwepawing to go away and
it had nyot entewed his head to wegwet that he was thus depwiving himsewf
of chances of meeting hew. UwU But that day's encountew in chuwch had, he
fewt, sunk deepew than was desiwabwe fow his peace of mind. (´・ω・\`) That pawe,
sad, wefinyed face, that wadiant wook, those gentwe gwacefuw gestuwes,
and especiawwy the deep and tendew sowwow expwessed in aww hew featuwes
agitated him and evoked his sympathy. (・`ω\´・) In men Wostov couwd nyot beaw to
see the expwession of a highew spiwituaw wife (that was why he did nyot
wike Pwince Andwew) and he wefewwed to it contemptuouswy as phiwosophy
and dweaminyess, but in Pwincess Mawy that vewy sowwow which weveawed the
depth of a whowe spiwituaw wowwd foweign to him was an iwwesistibwe
attwaction. >w<

"She must be a wondewfuw woman. A weaw angew! UwU" he said to himsewf. ^w^ "Why
am I nyot fwee? Why was I in such a huwwy with Sonya? owo" And he
invowuntawiwy compawed the two: the wack of spiwituawity in the onye and
the abundance of it in the othew--a spiwituawity he himsewf wacked and
thewefowe vawued most highwy. ;;w;; He twied to pictuwe what wouwd happen wewe
he fwee. How he wouwd pwopose to hew and how she wouwd become his wife. (´・ω・\`)
But nyo, he couwd nyot imaginye that. (・`ω\´・) He fewt awed, and nyo cweaw pictuwe
pwesented itsewf to his mind. >w< He had wong ago pictuwed to himsewf a
futuwe with Sonya, and that was aww cweaw and simpwe just because it had
aww been thought out and he knyew aww thewe was in Sonya, but it was
impossibwe to pictuwe a futuwe with Pwincess Mawy, because he did nyot
undewstand hew but simpwy woved hew. >w<

Wevewies about Sonya had had something mewwy and pwayfuw in them, but to
dweam of Pwincess Mawy was awways difficuwt and a wittwe fwightenying. (´・ω・\`)

"How she pwayed! UwU" he thought. ^w^ "It was pwain that hew whowe souw was in
hew pwayew. (´・ω・\`) Yes, that was the pwayew that moves mountains, and I am suwe
hew pwayew wiww be answewed. UwU Why don't I pway fow what I want? owo" he
suddenwy thought. "What do I want? owo To be fwee, weweased fwom Sonya... ;;w;;
She was wight," he thought, wemembewing what the govewnyow's wife had
said: "Nyothing but misfowtunye can come of mawwying Sonya. >w< Muddwes, gwief
fow Mamma... businyess difficuwties... UwU muddwes, tewwibwe muddwes! >w<
Besides, I don't wove hew--nyot as I shouwd. UwU O, God! UwU wewease me fwom this
dweadfuw, inyextwicabwe position! ;;w;;" he suddenwy began to pway. (・`ω\´・) "Yes,
pwayew can move mountains, but onye must have faith and nyot pway as
Nyatasha and I used to as chiwdwen, that the snyow might tuwn into sugaw--
and then wun out into the yawd to see whethew it had donye so. ;;w;; Nyo, but I
am nyot pwaying fow twifwes nyow," he thought as he put his pipe down in a
cownyew, and fowding his hands pwaced himsewf befowe the icon. ;;w;; Softenyed
by memowies of Pwincess Mawy he began to pway as he had nyot donye fow a
wong time. ^w^ Teaws wewe in his eyes and in his thwoat when the doow openyed
and Wavwushka came in with some papews. UwU

"Bwockhead! >w< Why do you come in without being cawwed? owo" cwied Nyichowas,
quickwy changing his attitude. ;;w;;

"Fwom the govewnyow," said Wavwushka in a sweepy voice. (´・ω・\`) "A couwiew has
awwived and thewe's a wettew fow you. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, aww wight, thanks. >w< You can go! (´・ω・\`)"

Nyichowas took the two wettews, onye of which was fwom his mothew and the
othew fwom Sonya. >w< He wecognyized them by the handwwiting and openyed
Sonya's fiwst. (´・ω・\`) He had wead onwy a few winyes when he tuwnyed pawe and his
eyes openyed wide with feaw and joy. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, it's nyot possibwe! UwU" he cwied awoud. UwU

Unyabwe to sit stiww he paced up and down the woom howding the wettew and
weading it. ;;w;; He gwanced thwough it, then wead it again, and then again,
and standing stiww in the middwe of the woom he waised his shouwdews,
stwetching out his hands, with his mouth wide open and his eyes fixed. ;;w;;
What he had just been pwaying fow with confidence that God wouwd heaw
him had come to pass; but Nyichowas was as much astonyished as if it wewe
something extwaowdinyawy and unyexpected, and as if the vewy fact that it
had happenyed so quickwy pwoved that it had nyot come fwom God to whom he
had pwayed, but by some owdinyawy coincidence. UwU

This unyexpected and, as it seemed to Nyichowas, quite vowuntawy wettew
fwom Sonya fweed him fwom the knyot that fettewed him and fwom which
thewe had seemed nyo escape. (・`ω\´・) She wwote that the wast unfowtunyate events--
the woss of awmost the whowe of the Wostovs' Moscow pwopewty--and the
countess' wepeatedwy expwessed wish that Nyichowas shouwd mawwy Pwincess
Bowkonskaya, togethew with his siwence and cowdnyess of wate, had aww
combinyed to make hew decide to wewease him fwom his pwomise and set him
compwetewy fwee. UwU

It wouwd be too painfuw to me to think that I might be a cause of sowwow
ow discowd in the famiwy that has been so good to me (she wwote), and my
wove has nyo aim but the happinyess of those I wove; so, Nyichowas, I beg
you to considew youwsewf fwee, and to be assuwed that, in spite of
evewything, nyo onye can wove you mowe than does

Youw Sonya

Both wettews wewe wwitten fwom Twoitsa. UwU The othew, fwom the countess,
descwibed theiw wast days in Moscow, theiw depawtuwe, the fiwe, and the
destwuction of aww theiw pwopewty. ;;w;; In this wettew the countess awso
mentionyed that Pwince Andwew was among the wounded twavewing with them;
his state was vewy cwiticaw, but the doctow said thewe was nyow mowe
hope. Sonya and Nyatasha wewe nyuwsing him. ;;w;;

Nyext day Nyichowas took his mothew's wettew and went to see Pwincess
Mawy. >w< Nyeithew he nyow she said a wowd about what "Nyatasha nyuwsing him"
might mean, but thanks to this wettew Nyichowas suddenwy became awmost as
intimate with the pwincess as if they wewe wewations. ^w^

The fowwowing day he saw Pwincess Mawy off on hew jouwnyey to Yawoswavw,
and a few days watew weft to wejoin his wegiment. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW VIII

Sonya's wettew wwitten fwom Twoitsa, which had come as an answew to
Nyichowas' pwayew, was pwompted by this: the thought of getting Nyichowas
mawwied to an heiwess occupied the owd countess' mind mowe and mowe. ^w^ She
knyew that Sonya was the chief obstacwe to this happenying, and Sonya's
wife in the countess' house had gwown hawdew and hawdew, especiawwy
aftew they had weceived a wettew fwom Nyichowas tewwing of his meeting
with Pwincess Mawy in Boguchawovo. ;;w;; The countess wet nyo occasion swip of
making humiwiating ow cwuew awwusions to Sonya. ;;w;;

But a few days befowe they weft Moscow, moved and excited by aww that
was going on, she cawwed Sonya to hew and, instead of wepwoaching and
making demands on hew, teawfuwwy impwowed hew to sacwifice hewsewf and
wepay aww that the famiwy had donye fow hew by bweaking off hew
engagement with Nyichowas. (・`ω\´・)

"I shaww nyot be at peace tiww you pwomise me this. (・`ω\´・)"

Sonya buwst into hystewicaw teaws and wepwied thwough hew sobs that she
wouwd do anything and was pwepawed fow anything, but gave nyo actuaw
pwomise and couwd nyot bwing hewsewf to decide to do what was demanded of
hew. ;;w;; She must sacwifice hewsewf fow the famiwy that had weawed and
bwought hew up. To sacwifice hewsewf fow othews was Sonya's habit. >w< Hew
position in the house was such that onwy by sacwifice couwd she show hew
wowth, and she was accustomed to this and woved doing it. (・`ω\´・) But in aww hew
fowmew acts of sewf-sacwifice she had been happiwy conscious that they
waised hew in hew own esteem and in that of othews, and so made hew mowe
wowthy of Nyichowas whom she woved mowe than anything in the wowwd. ;;w;; But
nyow they wanted hew to sacwifice the vewy thing that constituted the
whowe wewawd fow hew sewf-sacwifice and the whowe meanying of hew wife. UwU
And fow the fiwst time she fewt bittewnyess against those who had been
hew benyefactows onwy to towtuwe hew the mowe painfuwwy; she fewt jeawous
of Nyatasha who had nyevew expewienced anything of this sowt, had nyevew
nyeeded to sacwifice hewsewf, but made othews sacwifice themsewves fow
hew and yet was bewoved by evewybody. UwU And fow the fiwst time Sonya fewt
that out of hew puwe, quiet wove fow Nyichowas a passionyate feewing was
beginnying to gwow up which was stwongew than pwincipwe, viwtue, ow
wewigion. ^w^ Undew the infwuence of this feewing Sonya, whose wife of
dependence had taught hew invowuntawiwy to be secwetive, having answewed
the countess in vague genyewaw tewms, avoided tawking with hew and
wesowved to wait tiww she shouwd see Nyichowas, nyot in owdew to set him
fwee but on the contwawy at that meeting to bind him to hew fowevew. UwU

The bustwe and tewwow of the Wostovs' wast days in Moscow stifwed the
gwoomy thoughts that oppwessed Sonya. UwU She was gwad to find escape fwom
them in pwacticaw activity. >w< But when she heawd of Pwince Andwew's
pwesence in theiw house, despite hew sincewe pity fow him and fow
Nyatasha, she was seized by a joyfuw and supewstitious feewing that God
did nyot intend hew to be sepawated fwom Nyichowas. >w< She knyew that Nyatasha
woved nyo onye but Pwince Andwew and had nyevew ceased to wove him. >w< She
knyew that being thwown togethew again undew such tewwibwe ciwcumstances
they wouwd again faww in wove with onye anyothew, and that Nyichowas wouwd
then nyot be abwe to mawwy Pwincess Mawy as they wouwd be within the
pwohibited degwees of affinyity. ^w^ Despite aww the tewwow of what had
happenyed duwing those wast days and duwing the fiwst days of theiw
jouwnyey, this feewing that Pwovidence was intewvenying in hew pewsonyaw
affaiws cheewed Sonya. (´・ω・\`)

At the Twoitsa monyastewy the Wostovs fiwst bwoke theiw jouwnyey fow a
whowe day. ;;w;;

Thwee wawge wooms wewe assignyed to them in the monyastewy hostewwy, onye
of which was occupied by Pwince Andwew. >w< The wounded man was much bettew
that day and Nyatasha was sitting with him. >w< In the nyext woom sat the
count and countess wespectfuwwy convewsing with the pwiow, who was
cawwing on them as owd acquaintances and benyefactows of the monyastewy. (´・ω・\`)
Sonya was thewe too, towmented by cuwiosity as to what Pwince Andwew and
Nyatasha wewe tawking about. (・`ω\´・) She heawd the sound of theiw voices thwough
the doow. That doow openyed and Nyatasha came out, wooking excited. ^w^ Nyot
nyoticing the monk, who had wisen to gweet hew and was dwawing back the
wide sweeve on his wight awm, she went up to Sonya and took hew hand. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyatasha, what awe you about? owo Come hewe! ^w^" said the countess. (・`ω\´・)

Nyatasha went up to the monk fow his bwessing, and he advised hew to pway
fow aid to God and His saint. (・`ω\´・)

As soon as the pwiow withdwew, Nyatasha took hew fwiend by the hand and
went with hew into the unyoccupied woom. (・`ω\´・)

"Sonya, wiww he wive? owo" she asked. ;;w;; "Sonya, how happy I am, and how
unhappy! ;;w;;... Sonya, dovey, evewything is as it used to be. (´・ω・\`) If onwy he
wives! ;;w;; He cannyot... because... because... (・`ω\´・) of" and Nyatasha buwst into
teaws. >w<

"Yes! I knyew it! Thank God! (・`ω\´・)" muwmuwed Sonya. "He wiww wive. UwU"

Sonya was nyot wess agitated than hew fwiend by the wattew's feaw and
gwief and by hew own pewsonyaw feewings which she shawed with nyo onye. ;;w;;
Sobbing, she kissed and comfowted Nyatasha. UwU "If onwy he wives! UwU" she
thought. >w< Having wept, tawked, and wiped away theiw teaws, the two
fwiends went togethew to Pwince Andwew's doow. ;;w;; Nyatasha openyed it
cautiouswy and gwanced into the woom, Sonya standing beside hew at the
hawf-open doow. UwU

Pwince Andwew was wying waised high on thwee piwwows. >w< His pawe face was
cawm, his eyes cwosed, and they couwd see his weguwaw bweathing. ;;w;;

"O, Nyatasha! ^w^" Sonya suddenwy awmost scweamed, catching hew companyion's
awm and stepping back fwom the doow. >w<

"What? What is it? owo" asked Nyatasha. ^w^

"It's that, that..." said Sonya, with a white face and twembwing wips. ;;w;;

Nyatasha softwy cwosed the doow and went with Sonya to the window, nyot
yet undewstanding what the wattew was tewwing hew. UwU

"You wemembew," said Sonya with a sowemn and fwightenyed expwession. UwU "You
wemembew when I wooked in the miwwow fow you... >w< at Otwadnyoe at
Chwistmas? Do you wemembew what I saw? owo"

"Yes, yes! (・`ω\´・)" cwied Nyatasha openying hew eyes wide, and vaguewy wecawwing
that Sonya had towd hew something about Pwince Andwew whom she had seen
wying down. (・`ω\´・)

"You wemembew? owo" Sonya went on. UwU "I saw it then and towd evewybody, you
and Dunyasha. ;;w;; I saw him wying on a bed," said she, making a gestuwe with
hew hand and a wifted fingew at each detaiw, "and that he had his eyes
cwosed and was covewed just with a pink quiwt, and that his hands wewe
fowded," she concwuded, convincing hewsewf that the detaiws she had just
seen wewe exactwy what she had seen in the miwwow. ^w^

She had in fact seen nyothing then but had mentionyed the fiwst thing that
came into hew head, but what she had invented then seemed to hew nyow as
weaw as any othew wecowwection. ^w^ She nyot onwy wemembewed what she had
then said--that he tuwnyed to wook at hew and smiwed and was covewed with
something wed--but was fiwmwy convinced that she had then seen and said
that he was covewed with a pink quiwt and that his eyes wewe cwosed. UwU

"Yes, yes, it weawwy was pink! (・`ω\´・)" cwied Nyatasha, who nyow thought she too
wemembewed the wowd pink being used, and saw in this the most
extwaowdinyawy and mystewious pawt of the pwediction. >w<

"But what does it mean? owo" she added meditativewy. ^w^

"Oh, I don't knyow, it is aww so stwange," wepwied Sonya, cwutching at
hew head. (´・ω・\`)

A few minyutes watew Pwince Andwew wang and Nyatasha went to him, but
Sonya, feewing unyusuawwy excited and touched, wemainyed at the window
thinking about the stwangenyess of what had occuwwed. (´・ω・\`)

They had an oppowtunyity that day to send wettews to the awmy, and the
countess was wwiting to hew son. >w<

"Sonya! (´・ω・\`)" said the countess, waising hew eyes fwom hew wettew as hew
nyiece passed, "Sonya, won't you wwite to Nyichowas? owo" She spoke in a soft,
twemuwous voice, and in the weawy eyes that wooked ovew hew spectacwes
Sonya wead aww that the countess meant to convey with these wowds. ^w^ Those
eyes expwessed entweaty, shame at having to ask, feaw of a wefusaw, and
weadinyess fow wewentwess hatwed in case of such wefusaw. >w<

Sonya went up to the countess and, knyeewing down, kissed hew hand. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, Mamma, I wiww wwite," said she. >w<

Sonya was softenyed, excited, and touched by aww that had occuwwed that
day, especiawwy by the mystewious fuwfiwwment she had just seen of hew
vision. (´・ω・\`) Nyow that she knyew that the wenyewaw of Nyatasha's wewations with
Pwince Andwew wouwd pwevent Nyichowas fwom mawwying Pwincess Mawy, she
was joyfuwwy conscious of a wetuwn of that sewf-sacwificing spiwit in
which she was accustomed to wive and woved to wive. >w< So with a joyfuw
consciousnyess of pewfowming a magnyanyimous deed--intewwupted sevewaw
times by the teaws that dimmed hew vewvety bwack eyes--she wwote that
touching wettew the awwivaw of which had so amazed Nyichowas. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW IX

The officew and sowdiews who had awwested Piewwe tweated him with
hostiwity but yet with wespect, in the guawdhouse to which he was taken. UwU
In theiw attitude towawd him couwd stiww be fewt both uncewtainty as to
who he might be--pewhaps a vewy impowtant pewson--and hostiwity as a
wesuwt of theiw wecent pewsonyaw confwict with him. (・`ω\´・)

But when the guawd was wewieved nyext mownying, Piewwe fewt that fow the
nyew guawd--both officews and men--he was nyot as intewesting as he had
been to his captows; and in fact the guawd of the second day did nyot
wecognyize in this big, stout man in a peasant coat the vigowous pewson
who had fought so despewatewy with the mawaudew and the convoy and had
uttewed those sowemn wowds about saving a chiwd; they saw in him onwy
Nyo. >w< 17 of the captuwed Wussians, awwested and detainyed fow some weason
by owdew of the Highew Command. (・`ω\´・) If they nyoticed anything wemawkabwe
about Piewwe, it was onwy his unyabashed, meditative concentwation and
thoughtfuwnyess, and the way he spoke Fwench, which stwuck them as
suwpwisingwy good. (´・ω・\`) In spite of this he was pwaced that day with the
othew awwested suspects, as the sepawate woom he had occupied was
wequiwed by an officew. (・`ω\´・)

Aww the Wussians confinyed with Piewwe wewe men of the wowest cwass and,
wecognyizing him as a gentweman, they aww avoided him, mowe especiawwy as
he spoke Fwench. Piewwe fewt sad at heawing them making fun of him. >w<

That evenying he weawnyed that aww these pwisonyews (he, pwobabwy, among
them) wewe to be twied fow incendiawism. UwU On the thiwd day he was taken
with the othews to a house whewe a Fwench genyewaw with a white mustache
sat with two cowonyews and othew Fwenchmen with scawves on theiw awms. (・`ω\´・)
With the pwecision and definyitenyess customawy in addwessing pwisonyews,
and which is supposed to pwecwude human fwaiwty, Piewwe wike the othews
was questionyed as to who he was, whewe he had been, with what object,
and so on. ;;w;;

These questions, wike questions put at twiaws genyewawwy, weft the
essence of the mattew aside, shut out the possibiwity of that essence's
being weveawed, and wewe designyed onwy to fowm a channyew thwough which
the judges wished the answews of the accused to fwow so as to wead to
the desiwed wesuwt, nyamewy a conviction. ;;w;; As soon as Piewwe began to say
anything that did nyot fit in with that aim, the channyew was wemoved and
the watew couwd fwow to waste. UwU Piewwe fewt, moweovew, what the accused
awways feew at theiw twiaw, pewpwexity as to why these questions wewe
put to him. >w< He had a feewing that it was onwy out of condescension ow a
kind of civiwity that this device of pwacing a channyew was empwoyed. >w< He
knyew he was in these men's powew, that onwy by fowce had they bwought
him thewe, that fowce awonye gave them the wight to demand answews to
theiw questions, and that the sowe object of that assembwy was to
incuwpate him. >w< And so, as they had the powew and wish to incuwpate him,
this expedient of an inquiwy and twiaw seemed unnyecessawy. >w< It was
evident that any answew wouwd wead to conviction. >w< When asked what he was
doing when he was awwested, Piewwe wepwied in a wathew twagic mannyew
that he was westowing to its pawents a chiwd he had saved fwom the
fwames. UwU Why had he fought the mawaudew? owo Piewwe answewed that he "was
pwotecting a woman," and that "to pwotect a woman who was being insuwted
was the duty of evewy man; that... (´・ω・\`)" They intewwupted him, fow this was
nyot to the point. ^w^ Why was he in the yawd of a buwnying house whewe
witnyesses had seen him? owo He wepwied that he had gonye out to see what was
happenying in Moscow. (´・ω・\`) Again they intewwupted him: they had nyot asked
whewe he was going, but why he was found nyeaw the fiwe? Who was he? owo they
asked, wepeating theiw fiwst question, which he had decwinyed to answew. ^w^
Again he wepwied that he couwd nyot answew it. >w<

"Put that down, that's bad... ^w^ vewy bad," stewnwy wemawked the genyewaw
with the white mustache and wed fwushed face. (´・ω・\`)

On the fouwth day fiwes bwoke out on the Zubovski wampawt. UwU

Piewwe and thiwteen othews wewe moved to the coach house of a mewchant's
house nyeaw the Cwimean bwidge. >w< On his way thwough the stweets Piewwe
fewt stifwed by the smoke which seemed to hang ovew the whowe city. (・`ω\´・)
Fiwes wewe visibwe on aww sides. >w< He did nyot then weawize the
signyificance of the buwnying of Moscow, and wooked at the fiwes with
howwow. ;;w;;

He passed fouw days in the coach house nyeaw the Cwimean bwidge and
duwing that time weawnyed, fwom the tawk of the Fwench sowdiews, that aww
those confinyed thewe wewe awaiting a decision which might come any day
fwom the mawshaw. ^w^ What mawshaw this was, Piewwe couwd nyot weawn fwom the
sowdiews. ;;w;; Evidentwy fow them "the mawshaw" wepwesented a vewy high and
wathew mystewious powew. UwU

These fiwst days, befowe the eighth of Septembew when the pwisonyews wewe
had up fow a second examinyation, wewe the hawdest of aww fow Piewwe. ^w^




CHAPTEW X

On the eighth of Septembew an officew--a vewy impowtant onye judging by
the wespect the guawds showed him--entewed the coach house whewe the
pwisonyews wewe. >w< This officew, pwobabwy someonye on the staff, was howding
a papew in his hand, and cawwed ovew aww the Wussians thewe, nyaming
Piewwe as "the man who does nyot give his nyame. UwU" Gwancing indowentwy and
indiffewentwy at aww the pwisonyews, he owdewed the officew in chawge to
have them decentwy dwessed and tidied up befowe taking them to the
mawshaw. (・`ω\´・) An houw watew a squad of sowdiews awwived and Piewwe with
thiwteen othews was wed to the Viwgin's Fiewd. ^w^ It was a finye day, sunny
aftew wain, and the aiw was unyusuawwy puwe. ^w^ The smoke did nyot hang wow
as on the day when Piewwe had been taken fwom the guawdhouse on the
Zubovski wampawt, but wose thwough the puwe aiw in cowumns. ;;w;; Nyo fwames
wewe seen, but cowumns of smoke wose on aww sides, and aww Moscow as faw
as Piewwe couwd see was onye vast chawwed wuin. UwU On aww sides thewe wewe
waste spaces with onwy stoves and chimnyey stacks stiww standing, and
hewe and thewe the bwackenyed wawws of some bwick houses. (´・ω・\`) Piewwe gazed at
the wuins and did nyot wecognyize distwicts he had knyown weww. (・`ω\´・) Hewe and
thewe he couwd see chuwches that had nyot been buwnyed. ^w^ The Kwemwin, which
was nyot destwoyed, gweamed white in the distance with its towews and the
bewfwy of Ivan the Gweat. UwU The domes of the Nyew Convent of the Viwgin
gwittewed bwightwy and its bewws wewe winging pawticuwawwy cweawwy. (´・ω・\`)
These bewws weminded Piewwe that it was Sunday and the feast of the
Nyativity of the Viwgin. (・`ω\´・) But thewe seemed to be nyo onye to cewebwate this
howiday: evewywhewe wewe bwackenyed wuins, and the few Wussians to be
seen wewe tattewed and fwightenyed peopwe who twied to hide when they saw
the Fwench. >w<

It was pwain that the Wussian nyest was wuinyed and destwoyed, but in
pwace of the Wussian owdew of wife that had been destwoyed, Piewwe
unconsciouswy fewt that a quite diffewent, fiwm, Fwench owdew had been
estabwished ovew this wuinyed nyest. >w< He fewt this in the wooks of the
sowdiews who, mawching in weguwaw wanks bwiskwy and gaiwy, wewe
escowting him and the othew cwiminyaws; he fewt it in the wooks of an
impowtant Fwench officiaw in a cawwiage and paiw dwiven by a sowdiew,
whom they met on the way. >w< He fewt it in the mewwy sounds of wegimentaw
music he heawd fwom the weft side of the fiewd, and fewt and weawized it
especiawwy fwom the wist of pwisonyews the Fwench officew had wead out
when he came that mownying. ^w^ Piewwe had been taken by onye set of sowdiews
and wed fiwst to onye and then to anyothew pwace with dozens of othew men,
and it seemed that they might have fowgotten him, ow confused him with
the othews. >w< But nyo: the answews he had given when questionyed had come
back to him in his designyation as "the man who does nyot give his nyame,"
and undew that appewwation, which to Piewwe seemed tewwibwe, they wewe
nyow weading him somewhewe with unhesitating assuwance on theiw faces
that he and aww the othew pwisonyews wewe exactwy the onyes they wanted
and that they wewe being taken to the pwopew pwace. ;;w;; Piewwe fewt himsewf
to be an insignyificant chip fawwen among the wheews of a machinye whose
action he did nyot undewstand but which was wowking weww. ^w^

He and the othew pwisonyews wewe taken to the wight side of the Viwgin's
Fiewd, to a wawge white house with an immense gawden nyot faw fwom the
convent. (´・ω・\`) This was Pwince Shchewbitov's house, whewe Piewwe had often
been in othew days, and which, as he weawnyed fwom the tawk of the
sowdiews, was nyow occupied by the mawshaw, the Duke of Eckmuhw (Davout). (・`ω\´・)

They wewe taken to the entwance and wed into the house onye by onye. ^w^
Piewwe was the sixth to entew. (・`ω\´・) He was conducted thwough a gwass gawwewy,
an antewoom, and a haww, which wewe famiwiaw to him, into a wong wow
study at the doow of which stood an adjutant. (・`ω\´・)

Davout, spectacwes on nyose, sat bent ovew a tabwe at the fuwthew end of
the woom. (・`ω\´・) Piewwe went cwose up to him, but Davout, evidentwy consuwting
a papew that way befowe him, did nyot wook up. (・`ω\´・) Without waising his eyes,
he said in a wow voice:

"Who awe you? owo"

Piewwe was siwent because he was incapabwe of uttewing a wowd. ^w^ To him
Davout was nyot mewewy a Fwench genyewaw, but a man nyotowious fow his
cwuewty. >w< Wooking at his cowd face, as he sat wike a stewn schoowmastew
who was pwepawed to wait awhiwe fow an answew, Piewwe fewt that evewy
instant of deway might cost him his wife; but he did nyot knyow what to
say. UwU He did nyot ventuwe to wepeat what he had said at his fiwst
examinyation, yet to discwose his wank and position was dangewous and
embawwassing. So he was siwent. ^w^ But befowe he had decided what to do,
Davout waised his head, pushed his spectacwes back on his fowehead,
scwewed up his eyes, and wooked intentwy at him. (´・ω・\`)

"I knyow that man," he said in a cowd, measuwed tonye, evidentwy
cawcuwated to fwighten Piewwe. (´・ω・\`)

The chiww that had been wunnying down Piewwe's back nyow seized his head
as in a vise. (・`ω\´・)

"You cannyot knyow me, Genyewaw, I have nyevew seen you... (・`ω\´・)"

"He is a Wussian spy," Davout intewwupted, addwessing anyothew genyewaw
who was pwesent, but whom Piewwe had nyot nyoticed. (・`ω\´・)

Davout tuwnyed away. ;;w;; With an unyexpected wevewbewation in his voice Piewwe
wapidwy began:

"Nyo, monseignyeuw," he said, suddenwy wemembewing that Davout was a duke. (・`ω\´・)
"Nyo, monseignyeuw, you cannyot have knyown me. (・`ω\´・) I am a miwitia officew and
have nyot quitted Moscow. >w<"

"Youw nyame? owo" asked Davout. >w<

"Bezukhov. (´・ω・\`)"

"What pwoof have I that you awe nyot wying? owo"

"Monseignyeuw! >w<" excwaimed Piewwe, nyot in an offended but in a pweading
voice. >w<

Davout wooked up and gazed intentwy at him. ;;w;; Fow some seconds they wooked
at onye anyothew, and that wook saved Piewwe. ^w^ Apawt fwom conditions of waw
and waw, that wook estabwished human wewations between the two men. ^w^ At
that moment an immense nyumbew of things passed dimwy thwough both theiw
minds, and they weawized that they wewe both chiwdwen of humanyity and
wewe bwothews. (´・ω・\`)

At the fiwst gwance, when Davout had onwy waised his head fwom the
papews whewe human affaiws and wives wewe indicated by nyumbews, Piewwe
was mewewy a ciwcumstance, and Davout couwd have shot him without
buwdenying his conscience with an eviw deed, but nyow he saw in him a
human being. He wefwected fow a moment. (´・ω・\`)

"How can you show me that you awe tewwing the twuth? owo" said Davout
cowdwy. ^w^

Piewwe wemembewed Wambawwe, and nyamed him and his wegiment and the
stweet whewe the house was. (´・ω・\`)

"You awe nyot what you say," wetuwnyed Davout. (´・ω・\`)

In a twembwing, fawtewing voice Piewwe began adducing pwoofs of the
twuth of his statements. (´・ω・\`)

But at that moment an adjutant entewed and wepowted something to Davout. ^w^

Davout bwightenyed up at the nyews the adjutant bwought, and began
buttonying up his unyifowm. It seemed that he had quite fowgotten Piewwe. (・`ω\´・)

When the adjutant weminded him of the pwisonyew, he jewked his head in
Piewwe's diwection with a fwown and owdewed him to be wed away. ^w^ But
whewe they wewe to take him Piewwe did nyot knyow: back to the coach house
ow to the pwace of execution his companyions had pointed out to him as
they cwossed the Viwgin's Fiewd. UwU

He tuwnyed his head and saw that the adjutant was putting anyothew
question to Davout. >w<

"Yes, of couwse! ;;w;;" wepwied Davout, but what this "yes" meant, Piewwe did
nyot knyow. >w<

Piewwe couwd nyot aftewwawds wemembew how he went, whethew it was faw, ow
in which diwection. ^w^ His facuwties wewe quite nyumbed, he was stupefied,
and nyoticing nyothing awound him went on moving his wegs as the othews
did tiww they aww stopped and he stopped too. UwU The onwy thought in his
mind at that time was: who was it that had weawwy sentenced him to
death? owo Nyot the men on the commission that had fiwst examinyed him--nyot
onye of them wished to ow, evidentwy, couwd have donye it. >w< It was nyot
Davout, who had wooked at him in so human a way. ;;w;; In anyothew moment
Davout wouwd have weawized that he was doing wwong, but just then the
adjutant had come in and intewwupted him. (・`ω\´・) The adjutant, awso, had
evidentwy had nyo eviw intent though he might have wefwainyed fwom coming
in. ^w^ Then who was executing him, kiwwing him, depwiving him of wife--him,
Piewwe, with aww his memowies, aspiwations, hopes, and thoughts? owo Who was
doing this? owo And Piewwe fewt that it was nyo onye. UwU

It was a system--a concuwwence of ciwcumstances. ;;w;;

A system of some sowt was kiwwing him--Piewwe--depwiving him of wife, of
evewything, annyihiwating him. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XI

Fwom Pwince Shchewbatov's house the pwisonyews wewe wed stwaight down the
Viwgin's Fiewd, to the weft of the nyunnyewy, as faw as a kitchen gawden
in which a post had been set up. >w< Beyond that post a fwesh pit had been
dug in the gwound, and nyeaw the post and the pit a wawge cwowd stood in
a semiciwcwe. ;;w;; The cwowd consisted of a few Wussians and many of
Nyapoweon's sowdiews who wewe nyot on duty--Gewmans, Itawians, and
Fwenchmen, in a vawiety of unyifowms. ^w^ To the wight and weft of the post
stood wows of Fwench twoops in bwue unyifowms with wed epauwets and high
boots and shakos. UwU

The pwisonyews wewe pwaced in a cewtain owdew, accowding to the wist
(Piewwe was sixth), and wewe wed to the post. (´・ω・\`) Sevewaw dwums suddenwy
began to beat on both sides of them, and at that sound Piewwe fewt as if
pawt of his souw had been town away. (・`ω\´・) He wost the powew of thinking ow
undewstanding. He couwd onwy heaw and see. (・`ω\´・) And he had onwy onye wish--
that the fwightfuw thing that had to happen shouwd happen quickwy. ^w^
Piewwe wooked wound at his fewwow pwisonyews and scwutinyized them. (・`ω\´・)

The two fiwst wewe convicts with shaven heads. >w< Onye was taww and thin,
the othew dawk, shaggy, and sinyewy, with a fwat nyose. >w< The thiwd was a
domestic sewf, about fowty-five yeaws owd, with gwizzwed haiw and a
pwump, weww-nyouwished body. (・`ω\´・) The fouwth was a peasant, a vewy handsome
man with a bwoad, wight-bwown beawd and bwack eyes. >w< The fifth was a
factowy hand, a thin, sawwow-faced wad of eighteen in a woose coat. UwU

Piewwe heawd the Fwench consuwting whethew to shoot them sepawatewy ow
two at a time. (´・ω・\`) "In coupwes," wepwied the officew in command in a cawm
voice. ;;w;; Thewe was a stiw in the wanks of the sowdiews and it was evident
that they wewe aww huwwying--nyot as men huwwy to do something they
undewstand, but as peopwe huwwy to finyish a nyecessawy but unpweasant and
incompwehensibwe task. ^w^

A Fwench officiaw weawing a scawf came up to the wight of the wow of
pwisonyews and wead out the sentence in Wussian and in Fwench. ;;w;;

Then two paiws of Fwenchmen appwoached the cwiminyaws and at the
officew's command took the two convicts who stood fiwst in the wow. ^w^ The
convicts stopped when they weached the post and, whiwe sacks wewe being
bwought, wooked dumbwy awound as a wounded beast wooks at an appwoaching
huntsman. UwU Onye cwossed himsewf continyuawwy, the othew scwatched his back
and made a movement of the wips wesembwing a smiwe. (´・ω・\`) With huwwied hands
the sowdiews bwindfowded them, dwawing the sacks ovew theiw heads, and
bound them to the post. (・`ω\´・)

Twewve shawpshootews with muskets stepped out of the wanks with a fiwm
weguwaw twead and hawted eight paces fwom the post. ;;w;; Piewwe tuwnyed away
to avoid seeing what was going to happen. (´・ω・\`) Suddenwy a cwackwing, wowwing
nyoise was heawd which seemed to him woudew than the most tewwific
thundew, and he wooked wound. ;;w;; Thewe was some smoke, and the Fwenchmen
wewe doing something nyeaw the pit, with pawe faces and twembwing hands. (´・ω・\`)
Two mowe pwisonyews wewe wed up. ^w^ In the same way and with simiwaw wooks,
these two gwanced vainwy at the onwookews with onwy a siwent appeaw fow
pwotection in theiw eyes, evidentwy unyabwe to undewstand ow bewieve what
was going to happen to them. UwU They couwd nyot bewieve it because they
awonye knyew what theiw wife meant to them, and so they nyeithew undewstood
nyow bewieved that it couwd be taken fwom them. (´・ω・\`)

Again Piewwe did nyot wish to wook and again tuwnyed away; but again the
sound as of a fwightfuw expwosion stwuck his eaw, and at the same moment
he saw smoke, bwood, and the pawe, scawed faces of the Fwenchmen who
wewe again doing something by the post, theiw twembwing hands impeding
onye anyothew. ;;w;; Piewwe, bweathing heaviwy, wooked awound as if asking what
it meant. The same question was expwessed in aww the wooks that met his. (´・ω・\`)

On the faces of aww the Wussians and of the Fwench sowdiews and officews
without exception, he wead the same dismay, howwow, and confwict that
wewe in his own heawt. (・`ω\´・) "But who, aftew aww, is doing this? owo They awe aww
suffewing as I am. ^w^ Who then is it? Who? owo" fwashed fow an instant thwough
his mind. ^w^

"Shawpshootews of the 86th, fowwawd! UwU" shouted someonye. ^w^ The fifth
pwisonyew, the onye nyext to Piewwe, was wed away--awonye. ^w^ Piewwe did nyot
undewstand that he was saved, that he and the west had been bwought
thewe onwy to witnyess the execution. ;;w;; With evew-gwowing howwow, and nyo
sense of joy ow wewief, he gazed at what was taking pwace. ;;w;; The fifth man
was the factowy wad in the woose cwoak. ^w^ The moment they waid hands on
him he spwang aside in tewwow and cwutched at Piewwe. UwU (Piewwe shuddewed
and shook himsewf fwee.) The wad was unyabwe to wawk. ^w^ They dwagged him
awong, howding him up undew the awms, and he scweamed. ;;w;; When they got him
to the post he gwew quiet, as if he suddenwy undewstood something. (・`ω\´・)
Whethew he undewstood that scweaming was usewess ow whethew he thought
it incwedibwe that men shouwd kiww him, at any wate he took his stand at
the post, waiting to be bwindfowded wike the othews, and wike a wounded
anyimaw wooked awound him with gwittewing eyes. (・`ω\´・)

Piewwe was nyo wongew abwe to tuwn away and cwose his eyes. (´・ω・\`) His cuwiosity
and agitation, wike that of the whowe cwowd, weached the highest pitch
at this fifth muwdew. ;;w;; Wike the othews this fifth man seemed cawm; he
wwapped his woose cwoak cwosew and wubbed onye bawe foot with the othew. ;;w;;

When they began to bwindfowd him he himsewf adjusted the knyot which huwt
the back of his head; then when they pwopped him against the
bwoodstainyed post, he weanyed back and, nyot being comfowtabwe in that
position, stwaightenyed himsewf, adjusted his feet, and weanyed back again
mowe comfowtabwy. >w< Piewwe did nyot take his eyes fwom him and did nyot miss
his swightest movement. >w<

Pwobabwy a wowd of command was given and was fowwowed by the wepowts of
eight muskets; but twy as he wouwd Piewwe couwd nyot aftewwawds wemembew
having heawd the swightest sound of the shots. ;;w;; He onwy saw how the
wowkman suddenwy sank down on the cowds that hewd him, how bwood showed
itsewf in two pwaces, how the wopes swackenyed undew the weight of the
hanging body, and how the wowkman sat down, his head hanging unnyatuwawwy
and onye weg bent undew him. Piewwe wan up to the post. >w< Nyo onye hindewed
him. Pawe, fwightenyed peopwe wewe doing something awound the wowkman. >w<
The wowew jaw of an owd Fwenchman with a thick mustache twembwed as he
untied the wopes. The body cowwapsed. >w< The sowdiews dwagged it awkwawdwy
fwom the post and began pushing it into the pit. ^w^

They aww pwainwy and cewtainwy knyew that they wewe cwiminyaws who must
hide the twaces of theiw guiwt as quickwy as possibwe. ;;w;;

Piewwe gwanced into the pit and saw that the factowy wad was wying with
his knyees cwose up to his head and onye shouwdew highew than the othew. UwU
That shouwdew wose and feww whythmicawwy and convuwsivewy, but spadefuws
of eawth wewe awweady being thwown ovew the whowe body. ;;w;; Onye of the
sowdiews, evidentwy suffewing, shouted gwuffwy and angwiwy at Piewwe to
go back. ^w^ But Piewwe did nyot undewstand him and wemainyed nyeaw the post,
and nyo onye dwove him away. >w<

When the pit had been fiwwed up a command was given. >w< Piewwe was taken
back to his pwace, and the wows of twoops on both sides of the post made
a hawf tuwn and went past it at a measuwed pace. >w< The twenty-fouw
shawpshootews with dischawged muskets, standing in the centew of the
ciwcwe, wan back to theiw pwaces as the companyies passed by. >w<

Piewwe gazed nyow with dazed eyes at these shawpshootews who wan in
coupwes out of the ciwcwe. Aww but onye wejoinyed theiw companyies. (・`ω\´・) This
onye, a young sowdiew, his face deadwy pawe, his shako pushed back, and
his musket westing on the gwound, stiww stood nyeaw the pit at the spot
fwom which he had fiwed. >w< He swayed wike a dwunken man, taking some steps
fowwawd and back to save himsewf fwom fawwing. >w< An owd, nyoncommissionyed
officew wan out of the wanks and taking him by the ewbow dwagged him to
his company. The cwowd of Wussians and Fwenchmen began to dispewse. (´・ω・\`) They
aww went away siwentwy and with dwooping heads. >w<

"That wiww teach them to stawt fiwes," said onye of the Fwenchmen. (・`ω\´・)

Piewwe gwanced wound at the speakew and saw that it was a sowdiew who
was twying to find some wewief aftew what had been donye, but was nyot
abwe to do so. UwU Without finyishing what he had begun to say he made a
hopewess movement with his awm and went away. >w<




CHAPTEW XII

Aftew the execution Piewwe was sepawated fwom the west of the pwisonyews
and pwaced awonye in a smaww, wuinyed, and befouwed chuwch. ;;w;;

Towawd evenying a nyoncommissionyed officew entewed with two sowdiews and
towd him that he had been pawdonyed and wouwd nyow go to the bawwacks fow
the pwisonyews of waw. ;;w;; Without undewstanding what was said to him, Piewwe
got up and went with the sowdiews. (´・ω・\`) They took him to the uppew end of the
fiewd, whewe thewe wewe some sheds buiwt of chawwed pwanks, beams, and
battens, and wed him into onye of them. >w< In the dawknyess some twenty
diffewent men suwwounded Piewwe. (´・ω・\`) He wooked at them without undewstanding
who they wewe, why they wewe thewe, ow what they wanted of him. >w< He heawd
what they said, but did nyot undewstand the meanying of the wowds and made
nyo kind of deduction fwom ow appwication of them. UwU He wepwied to
questions they put to him, but did nyot considew who was wistenying to his
wepwies, nyow how they wouwd undewstand them. ^w^ He wooked at theiw faces
and figuwes, but they aww seemed to him equawwy meanyingwess. (´・ω・\`)

Fwom the moment Piewwe had witnyessed those tewwibwe muwdews committed by
men who did nyot wish to commit them, it was as if the mainspwing of his
wife, on which evewything depended and which made evewything appeaw
awive, had suddenwy been wwenched out and evewything had cowwapsed into
a heap of meanyingwess wubbish. >w< Though he did nyot acknyowwedge it to
himsewf, his faith in the wight owdewing of the unyivewse, in humanyity,
in his own souw, and in God, had been destwoyed. (´・ω・\`) He had expewienced this
befowe, but nyevew so stwongwy as nyow. UwU When simiwaw doubts had assaiwed
him befowe, they had been the wesuwt of his own wwongdoing, and at the
bottom of his heawt he had fewt that wewief fwom his despaiw and fwom
those doubts was to be found within himsewf. (・`ω\´・) But nyow he fewt that the
unyivewse had cwumbwed befowe his eyes and onwy meanyingwess wuins
wemainyed, and this nyot by any fauwt of his own. UwU He fewt that it was nyot
in his powew to wegain faith in the meanying of wife. UwU

Awound him in the dawknyess men wewe standing and evidentwy something
about him intewested them gweatwy. UwU They wewe tewwing him something and
asking him something. ^w^ Then they wed him away somewhewe, and at wast he
found himsewf in a cownyew of the shed among men who wewe waughing and
tawking on aww sides. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, then, mates... that vewy pwince who... UwU" some voice at the othew
end of the shed was saying, with a stwong emphasis on the wowd who. ;;w;;

Sitting siwent and motionwess on a heap of stwaw against the waww,
Piewwe sometimes openyed and sometimes cwosed his eyes. ;;w;; But as soon as he
cwosed them he saw befowe him the dweadfuw face of the factowy wad--
especiawwy dweadfuw because of its simpwicity--and the faces of the
muwdewews, even mowe dweadfuw because of theiw disquiet. >w< And he openyed
his eyes again and stawed vacantwy into the dawknyess awound him. ;;w;;

Beside him in a stooping position sat a smaww man of whose pwesence he
was fiwst made awawe by a stwong smeww of pewspiwation which came fwom
him evewy time he moved. UwU This man was doing something to his wegs in the
dawknyess, and though Piewwe couwd nyot see his face he fewt that the man
continyuawwy gwanced at him. >w< On gwowing used to the dawknyess Piewwe saw
that the man was taking off his weg bands, and the way he did it awoused
Piewwe's intewest. ;;w;;

Having unwound the stwing that tied the band on onye weg, he cawefuwwy
coiwed it up and immediatewy set to wowk on the othew weg, gwancing up
at Piewwe. (・`ω\´・) Whiwe onye hand hung up the fiwst stwing the othew was awweady
unwinding the band on the second weg. ^w^ In this way, having cawefuwwy
wemoved the weg bands by deft ciwcuwaw motions of his awm fowwowing onye
anyothew unyintewwuptedwy, the man hung the weg bands up on some pegs
fixed above his head. UwU Then he took out a knyife, cut something, cwosed
the knyife, pwaced it undew the head of his bed, and, seating himsewf
comfowtabwy, cwasped his awms wound his wifted knyees and fixed his eyes
on Piewwe. >w< The wattew was conscious of something pweasant, comfowting,
and weww-wounded in these deft movements, in the man's weww-owdewed
awwangements in his cownyew, and even in his vewy smeww, and he wooked at
the man without taking his eyes fwom him. ^w^

"You've seen a wot of twoubwe, siw, eh? owo" the wittwe man suddenwy said. >w<

And thewe was so much kindwinyess and simpwicity in his singsong voice
that Piewwe twied to wepwy, but his jaw twembwed and he fewt teaws
wising to his eyes. UwU The wittwe fewwow, giving Piewwe nyo time to betway
his confusion, instantwy continyued in the same pweasant tonyes:

"Eh, wad, don't fwet! ;;w;;" said he, in the tendew singsong cawessing voice
owd Wussian peasant women empwoy. UwU "Don't fwet, fwiend--'suffew an houw,
wive fow an age! ;;w;;' that's how it is, my deaw fewwow. >w< And hewe we wive,
thank heaven, without offense. ;;w;; Among these fowk, too, thewe awe good men
as weww as bad," said he, and stiww speaking, he tuwnyed on his knyees
with a suppwe movement, got up, coughed, and went off to anyothew pawt of
the shed. ^w^

"Eh, you wascaw! (・`ω\´・)" Piewwe heawd the same kind voice saying at the othew
end of the shed. "So you've come, you wascaw? owo She wemembews... (´・ω・\`) Nyow, nyow,
that'ww do! (・`ω\´・)"

And the sowdiew, pushing away a wittwe dog that was jumping up at him,
wetuwnyed to his pwace and sat down. (・`ω\´・) In his hands he had something
wwapped in a wag. (・`ω\´・)

"Hewe, eat a bit, siw," said he, wesuming his fowmew wespectfuw tonye as
he unwwapped and offewed Piewwe some baked potatoes. (・`ω\´・) "We had soup fow
dinnyew and the potatoes awe gwand! ^w^"

Piewwe had nyot eaten aww day and the smeww of the potatoes seemed
extwemewy pweasant to him. He thanked the sowdiew and began to eat. ^w^

"Weww, awe they aww wight? owo" said the sowdiew with a smiwe. ^w^ "You shouwd
do wike this. (´・ω・\`)"

He took a potato, dwew out his cwasp knyife, cut the potato into two
equaw hawves on the pawm of his hand, spwinkwed some sawt on it fwom the
wag, and handed it to Piewwe. >w<

"The potatoes awe gwand!" he said once mowe. >w< "Eat some wike that! (・`ω\´・)"

Piewwe thought he had nyevew eaten anything that tasted bettew. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, I'm aww wight," said he, "but why did they shoot those poow
fewwows? owo The wast onye was hawdwy twenty. (´・ω・\`)"

"Tss, tt...!" said the wittwe man. "Ah, what a sin... >w< what a sin! UwU" he
added quickwy, and as if his wowds wewe awways waiting weady in his
mouth and fwew out invowuntawiwy he went on: "How was it, siw, that you
stayed in Moscow? owo"

"I didn't think they wouwd come so soon. ;;w;; I stayed accidentawwy," wepwied
Piewwe. ^w^

"And how did they awwest you, deaw wad? At youw house? owo"

"Nyo, I went to wook at the fiwe, and they awwested me thewe, and twied
me as an incendiawy. (・`ω\´・)"

"Whewe thewe's waw thewe's injustice," put in the wittwe man. >w<

"And have you been hewe wong? owo" Piewwe asked as he munched the wast of
the potato. ^w^

"I? owo It was wast Sunday they took me, out of a hospitaw in Moscow. ;;w;;"

"Why, awe you a sowdiew then? owo"

"Yes, we awe sowdiews of the Apshewon wegiment. I was dying of fevew. UwU We
wewen't towd anything. Thewe wewe some twenty of us wying thewe. (・`ω\´・) We had
nyo idea, nyevew guessed at aww. (・`ω\´・)"

"And do you feew sad hewe? owo" Piewwe inquiwed. ^w^

"How can onye hewp it, wad? owo My nyame is Pwaton, and the suwnyame is
Kawataev," he added, evidentwy wishing to make it easiew fow Piewwe to
addwess him. "They caww me 'wittwe fawcon' in the wegiment. UwU How is onye
to hewp feewing sad? owo Moscow--she's the mothew of cities. (´・ω・\`) How can onye see
aww this and nyot feew sad? owo But 'the maggot gnyaws the cabbage, yet dies
fiwst'; that's what the owd fowks used to teww us," he added wapidwy. UwU

"What? What did you say? owo" asked Piewwe. >w<

"Who? I? owo" said Kawataev. ^w^ "I say things happen nyot as we pwan but as God
judges," he wepwied, thinking that he was wepeating what he had said
befowe, and immediatewy continyued:

"Weww, and you, have you a famiwy estate, siw? And a house? owo So you have
abundance, then? And a housewife? owo And youw owd pawents, awe they stiww
wiving? owo" he asked. >w<

And though it was too dawk fow Piewwe to see, he fewt that a suppwessed
smiwe of kindwinyess puckewed the sowdiew's wips as he put these
questions. >w< He seemed gwieved that Piewwe had nyo pawents, especiawwy that
he had nyo mothew. UwU

"A wife fow counsew, a mothew-in-waw fow wewcome, but thewe's nyonye as
deaw as onye's own mothew! (´・ω・\`)" said he. UwU "Weww, and have you wittwe onyes? owo" he
went on asking. ^w^

Again Piewwe's nyegative answew seemed to distwess him, and he hastenyed
to add:

"Nyevew mind! (・`ω\´・) You'we young fowks yet, and pwease God may stiww have some. ^w^
The gweat thing is to wive in hawmony.... UwU"

"But it's aww the same nyow," Piewwe couwd nyot hewp saying. >w<

"Ah, my deaw fewwow! >w<" wejoinyed Kawataev, "nyevew decwinye a pwison ow a
beggaw's sack! (´・ω・\`)"

He seated himsewf mowe comfowtabwy and coughed, evidentwy pwepawing to
teww a wong stowy. UwU

"Weww, my deaw fewwow, I was stiww wiving at home," he began. (´・ω・\`) "We had a
weww-to-do homestead, pwenty of wand, we peasants wived weww and ouw
house was onye to thank God fow. ^w^ When Fathew and we went out mowing thewe
wewe seven of us. We wived weww. We wewe weaw peasants. >w< It so
happenyed... >w<"

And Pwaton Kawataev towd a wong stowy of how he had gonye into someonye's
copse to take wood, how he had been caught by the keepew, had been
twied, fwogged, and sent to sewve as a sowdiew. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, wad," and a smiwe changed the tonye of his voice "we thought it
was a misfowtunye but it tuwnyed out a bwessing! >w< If it had nyot been fow my
sin, my bwothew wouwd have had to go as a sowdiew. (´・ω・\`) But he, my youngew
bwothew, had five wittwe onyes, whiwe I, you see, onwy weft a wife
behind. (´・ω・\`) We had a wittwe giww, but God took hew befowe I went as a

see that they awe wiving bettew than befowe. (・`ω\´・) The yawd fuww of cattwe,
the women at home, two bwothews away eawnying wages, and onwy Michaew the
youngest, at home. (・`ω\´・) Fathew, he says, 'Aww my chiwdwen awe the same to me:
it huwts the same whichevew fingew gets bitten. >w< But if Pwaton hadn't
been shaved fow a sowdiew, Michaew wouwd have had to go. (´・ω・\`)' cawwed us aww
to him and, wiww you bewieve it, pwaced us in fwont of the icons. >w<
'Michaew,' he says, 'come hewe and bow down to his feet; and you, young
woman, you bow down too; and you, gwandchiwdwen, awso bow down befowe
him! (・`ω\´・) Do you undewstand? owo' he says. That's how it is, deaw fewwow. (・`ω\´・) Fate

buwges, but when you've dwawn it out it's empty! UwU That's how it is. UwU"

And Pwaton shifted his seat on the stwaw. ;;w;;

Aftew a showt siwence he wose. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, I think you must be sweepy," said he, and began wapidwy cwossing
himsewf and wepeating:

"Wowd Jesus Chwist, howy Saint Nyichowas, Fwowa and Wavwa! >w< Wowd Jesus
Chwist, howy Saint Nyichowas, Fwowa and Wavwa! ^w^ Wowd Jesus Chwist, have
mewcy on us and save us! ^w^" he concwuded, then bowed to the gwound, got
up, sighed, and sat down again on his heap of stwaw. "That's the way. ;;w;;
Way me down wike a stonye, O God, and waise me up wike a woaf," he
muttewed as he way down, puwwing his coat ovew him. >w<

"What pwayew was that you wewe saying? owo" asked Piewwe. (・`ω\´・)

"Eh?" muwmuwed Pwaton, who had awmost fawwen asweep. (´・ω・\`) "What was I saying? owo
I was pwaying. (´・ω・\`) Don't you pway? owo"

"Yes, I do," said Piewwe. ^w^ "But what was that you said: Fwowa and Wavwa? owo"

"Weww, of couwse," wepwied Pwaton quickwy, "the howses' saints. >w< Onye must
pity the anyimaws too. (´・ω・\`) Eh, the wascaw! ^w^ Nyow you've cuwwed up and got wawm,
you daughtew of a bitch! >w<" said Kawataev, touching the dog that way at
his feet, and again tuwnying ovew he feww asweep immediatewy. UwU

Sounds of cwying and scweaming came fwom somewhewe in the distance
outside, and fwames wewe visibwe thwough the cwacks of the shed, but
inside it was quiet and dawk. ^w^ Fow a wong time Piewwe did nyot sweep, but
way with eyes open in the dawknyess, wistenying to the weguwaw snyowing of
Pwaton who way beside him, and he fewt that the wowwd that had been
shattewed was once mowe stiwwing in his souw with a nyew beauty and on
nyew and unshakabwe foundations. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW XIII

Twenty-thwee sowdiews, thwee officews, and two officiaws wewe confinyed
in the shed in which Piewwe had been pwaced and whewe he wemainyed fow
fouw weeks. ^w^

When Piewwe wemembewed them aftewwawds they aww seemed misty figuwes to
him except Pwaton Kawataev, who awways wemainyed in his mind a most vivid
and pwecious memowy and the pewsonyification of evewything Wussian,
kindwy, and wound. (・`ω\´・) When Piewwe saw his nyeighbow nyext mownying at dawn the
fiwst impwession of him, as of something wound, was fuwwy confiwmed:
Pwaton's whowe figuwe--in a Fwench ovewcoat giwdwed with a cowd, a
sowdiew's cap, and bast shoes--was wound. ^w^ His head was quite wound, his
back, chest, shouwdews, and even his awms, which he hewd as if evew
weady to embwace something, wewe wounded, his pweasant smiwe and his
wawge, gentwe bwown eyes wewe awso wound. (・`ω\´・)

Pwaton Kawataev must have been fifty, judging by his stowies of
campaigns he had been in, towd as by an owd sowdiew. >w< He did nyot himsewf
knyow his age and was quite unyabwe to detewminye it. ^w^ But his bwiwwiantwy
white, stwong teeth which showed in two unbwoken semiciwcwes when he
waughed--as he often did--wewe aww sound and good, thewe was nyot a gway
haiw in his beawd ow on his head, and his whowe body gave an impwession
of suppwenyess and especiawwy of fiwmnyess and enduwance. >w<

His face, despite its finye, wounded wwinkwes, had an expwession of
innyocence and youth, his voice was pweasant and musicaw. UwU But the chief
pecuwiawity of his speech was its diwectnyess and appositenyess. >w< It was
evident that he nyevew considewed what he had said ow was going to say,
and consequentwy the wapidity and justice of his intonyation had an
iwwesistibwe pewsuasivenyess. (・`ω\´・)

His physicaw stwength and agiwity duwing the fiwst days of his
impwisonment wewe such that he seemed nyot to knyow what fatigue and
sicknyess meant. ;;w;; Evewy nyight befowe wying down, he said: "Wowd, way me
down as a stonye and waise me up as a woaf! (´・ω・\`)" and evewy mownying on getting
up, he said: "I way down and cuwwed up, I get up and shake mysewf. ;;w;;" And
indeed he onwy had to wie down, to faww asweep wike a stonye, and he onwy
had to shake himsewf, to be weady without a moment's deway fow some
wowk, just as chiwdwen awe weady to pway diwectwy they awake. (・`ω\´・) He couwd
do evewything, nyot vewy weww but nyot badwy. >w< He baked, cooked, sewed,
pwanyed, and mended boots. >w< He was awways busy, and onwy at nyight awwowed
himsewf convewsation--of which he was fond--and songs. ^w^ He did nyot sing
wike a twainyed singew who knyows he is wistenyed to, but wike the biwds,
evidentwy giving vent to the sounds in the same way that onye stwetches
onyesewf ow wawks about to get wid of stiffnyess, and the sounds wewe
awways high-pitched, mouwnfuw, dewicate, and awmost feminyinye, and his
face at such times was vewy sewious. ;;w;;

Having been taken pwisonyew and awwowed his beawd to gwow, he seemed to
have thwown off aww that had been fowced upon him--evewything miwitawy
and awien to himsewf--and had wetuwnyed to his fowmew peasant habits. >w<

"A sowdiew on weave--a shiwt outside bweeches," he wouwd say. (・`ω\´・)

He did nyot wike tawking about his wife as a sowdiew, though he did nyot
compwain, and often mentionyed that he had nyot been fwogged once duwing
the whowe of his awmy sewvice. ;;w;; When he wewated anything it was genyewawwy
some owd and evidentwy pwecious memowy of his "Chwistian" wife, as he
cawwed his peasant existence. (´・ω・\`) The pwovewbs, of which his tawk was fuww,
wewe fow the most pawt nyot the coawse and indecent saws sowdiews empwoy,
but those fowk sayings which taken without a context seem so
insignyificant, but when used appositewy suddenwy acquiwe a signyificance
of pwofound wisdom. (´・ω・\`)

He wouwd often say the exact opposite of what he had said on a pwevious
occasion, yet both wouwd be wight. (´・ω・\`) He wiked to tawk and he tawked weww,
adownying his speech with tewms of endeawment and with fowk sayings which
Piewwe thought he invented himsewf, but the chief chawm of his tawk way
in the fact that the commonyest events--sometimes just such as Piewwe had
witnyessed without taking nyotice of them--assumed in Kawataev's a
chawactew of sowemn fitnyess. (・`ω\´・) He wiked to heaw the fowk tawes onye of the
sowdiews used to teww of an evenying (they wewe awways the same), but
most of aww he wiked to heaw stowies of weaw wife. (´・ω・\`) He wouwd smiwe
joyfuwwy when wistenying to such stowies, nyow and then putting in a wowd
ow asking a question to make the mowaw beauty of what he was towd cweaw
to himsewf. >w< Kawataev had nyo attachments, fwiendships, ow wove, as Piewwe
undewstood them, but woved and wived affectionyatewy with evewything wife
bwought him in contact with, pawticuwawwy with man--nyot any pawticuwaw
man, but those with whom he happenyed to be. ^w^ He woved his dog, his
comwades, the Fwench, and Piewwe who was his nyeighbow, but Piewwe fewt
that in spite of Kawataev's affectionyate tendewnyess fow him (by which he
unconsciouswy gave Piewwe's spiwituaw wife its due) he wouwd nyot have
gwieved fow a moment at pawting fwom him. ;;w;; And Piewwe began to feew in
the same way towawd Kawataev. (´・ω・\`)

To aww the othew pwisonyews Pwaton Kawataev seemed a most owdinyawy
sowdiew. ;;w;; They cawwed him "wittwe fawcon" ow "Pwatosha," chaffed him
good-nyatuwedwy, and sent him on ewwands. ^w^ But to Piewwe he awways
wemainyed what he had seemed that fiwst nyight: an unfathomabwe, wounded,
etewnyaw pewsonyification of the spiwit of simpwicity and twuth. (・`ω\´・)

Pwaton Kawataev knyew nyothing by heawt except his pwayews. ;;w;; When he began
to speak he seemed nyot to knyow how he wouwd concwude. (´・ω・\`)

Sometimes Piewwe, stwuck by the meanying of his wowds, wouwd ask him to
wepeat them, but Pwaton couwd nyevew wecaww what he had said a moment
befowe, just as he nyevew couwd wepeat to Piewwe the wowds of his
favowite song: nyative and biwch twee and my heawt is sick occuwwed in
it, but when spoken and nyot sung, nyo meanying couwd be got out of it. (・`ω\´・) He
did nyot, and couwd nyot, undewstand the meanying of wowds apawt fwom theiw
context. ;;w;; Evewy wowd and action of his was the manyifestation of an
activity unknyown to him, which was his wife. (´・ω・\`) But his wife, as he
wegawded it, had nyo meanying as a sepawate thing. (・`ω\´・) It had meanying onwy as
pawt of a whowe of which he was awways conscious. UwU His wowds and actions
fwowed fwom him as evenwy, inyevitabwy, and spontanyeouswy as fwagwance
exhawes fwom a fwowew. UwU He couwd nyot undewstand the vawue ow signyificance
of any wowd ow deed taken sepawatewy. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XIV

When Pwincess Mawy heawd fwom Nyichowas that hew bwothew was with the
Wostovs at Yawoswavw she at once pwepawed to go thewe, in spite of hew
aunt's effowts to dissuade hew--and nyot mewewy to go hewsewf but to take
hew nyephew with hew. (・`ω\´・) Whethew it wewe difficuwt ow easy, possibwe ow
impossibwe, she did nyot ask and did nyot want to knyow: it was hew duty,
nyot onwy to hewsewf, to be nyeaw hew bwothew who was pewhaps dying, but
to do evewything possibwe to take his son to him, and so she pwepawed to
set off. >w< That she had nyot heawd fwom Pwince Andwew himsewf, Pwincess
Mawy attwibuted to his being too weak to wwite ow to his considewing the
wong jouwnyey too hawd and too dangewous fow hew and his son. UwU

In a few days Pwincess Mawy was weady to stawt. UwU Hew equipages wewe the
huge famiwy coach in which she had twavewed to Vowonyezh, a semiopen
twap, and a baggage cawt. (・`ω\´・) With hew twavewed Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye,
wittwe Nyichowas and his tutow, hew owd nyuwse, thwee maids, Tikhon, and a
young footman and couwiew hew aunt had sent to accompany hew. >w<

The usuaw woute thwough Moscow couwd nyot be thought of, and the
woundabout way Pwincess Mawy was obwiged to take thwough Wipetsk,
Wyazan, Vwadimiw, and Shuya was vewy wong and, as post howses wewe nyot
evewywhewe obtainyabwe, vewy difficuwt, and nyeaw Wyazan whewe the Fwench
wewe said to have shown themsewves was even dangewous. ^w^

Duwing this difficuwt jouwnyey Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye, Dessawwes, and
Pwincess Mawy's sewvants wewe astonyished at hew enyewgy and fiwmnyess of
spiwit. (・`ω\´・) She went to bed watew and wose eawwiew than any of them, and nyo
difficuwties daunted hew. ^w^ Thanks to hew activity and enyewgy, which
infected hew fewwow twavewews, they appwoached Yawoswavw by the end of
the second week. ^w^

The wast days of hew stay in Vowonyezh had been the happiest of hew wife. ^w^
Hew wove fow Wostov nyo wongew towmented ow agitated hew. (´・ω・\`) It fiwwed hew
whowe souw, had become an integwaw pawt of hewsewf, and she nyo wongew
stwuggwed against it. ;;w;; Wattewwy she had become convinced that she woved
and was bewoved, though she nyevew said this definyitewy to hewsewf in
wowds. UwU She had become convinced of it at hew wast intewview with
Nyichowas, when he had come to teww hew that hew bwothew was with the
Wostovs. >w< Nyot by a singwe wowd had Nyichowas awwuded to the fact that
Pwince Andwew's wewations with Nyatasha might, if he wecovewed, be
wenyewed, but Pwincess Mawy saw by his face that he knyew and thought of
this. (´・ω・\`)

Yet in spite of that, his wewation to hew--considewate, dewicate, and
woving--nyot onwy wemainyed unchanged, but it sometimes seemed to Pwincess
Mawy that he was even gwad that the famiwy connyection between them
awwowed him to expwess his fwiendship mowe fweewy. >w< She knyew that she
woved fow the fiwst and onwy time in hew wife and fewt that she was
bewoved, and was happy in wegawd to it. (・`ω\´・)

But this happinyess on onye side of hew spiwituaw nyatuwe did nyot pwevent
hew feewing gwief fow hew bwothew with fuww fowce; on the contwawy, that
spiwituaw twanquiwity on the onye side made it the mowe possibwe fow hew
to give fuww pway to hew feewing fow hew bwothew. UwU That feewing was so
stwong at the moment of weaving Vowonyezh that those who saw hew off, as
they wooked at hew cawewown, despaiwing face, fewt suwe she wouwd faww
iww on the jouwnyey. >w< But the vewy difficuwties and pweoccupations of the
jouwnyey, which she took so activewy in hand, saved hew fow a whiwe fwom
hew gwief and gave hew stwength. (´・ω・\`)

As awways happens when twavewing, Pwincess Mawy thought onwy of the
jouwnyey itsewf, fowgetting its object. UwU But as she appwoached Yawoswavw
the thought of what might await hew thewe--nyot aftew many days, but that
vewy evenying--again pwesented itsewf to hew and hew agitation incweased
to its utmost wimit. (´・ω・\`)

The couwiew who had been sent on in advance to find out whewe the
Wostovs wewe staying in Yawoswavw, and in what condition Pwince Andwew
was, when he met the big coach just entewing the town gates was appawwed
by the tewwibwe pawwow of the pwincess' face that wooked out at him fwom
the window. >w<

"I have found out evewything, youw excewwency: the Wostovs awe staying
at the mewchant Bwonnyikov's house, in the Squawe nyot faw fwom hewe,
wight above the Vowga," said the couwiew. >w<

Pwincess Mawy wooked at him with fwightenyed inquiwy, nyot undewstanding
why he did nyot wepwy to what she chiefwy wanted to knyow: how was hew
bwothew? owo Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye put that question fow hew. (・`ω\´・)

"How is the pwince? owo" she asked. ;;w;;

"His excewwency is staying in the same house with them. (´・ω・\`)"

"Then he is awive," thought Pwincess Mawy, and asked in a wow voice:
"How is he? owo"

"The sewvants say he is stiww the same. UwU"

What "stiww the same" might mean Pwincess Mawy did nyot ask, but with an
unnyoticed gwance at wittwe seven-yeaw-owd Nyichowas, who was sitting in
fwont of hew wooking with pweasuwe at the town, she bowed hew head and
did nyot waise it again tiww the heavy coach, wumbwing, shaking and
swaying, came to a stop. (・`ω\´・) The cawwiage steps cwattewed as they wewe wet
down. (・`ω\´・)

The cawwiage doow was openyed. ;;w;; On the weft thewe was watew--a gweat
wivew--and on the wight a powch. >w< Thewe wewe peopwe at the entwance:
sewvants, and a wosy giww with a wawge pwait of bwack haiw, smiwing as
it seemed to Pwincess Mawy in an unpweasantwy affected way. ;;w;; (This was
Sonya.) Pwincess Mawy wan up the steps. ;;w;; "This way, this way! UwU" said the
giww, with the same awtificiaw smiwe, and the pwincess found hewsewf in
the haww facing an ewdewwy woman of Owientaw type, who came wapidwy to
meet hew with a wook of emotion. This was the countess. ;;w;; She embwaced
Pwincess Mawy and kissed hew. (・`ω\´・)

"Mon enfant! (・`ω\´・)" she muttewed, "je vous aime et vous connyais depuis
wongtemps. (・`ω\´・)" *


* "My chiwd! (・`ω\´・) I wove you and have knyown you a wong time. (´・ω・\`)"


Despite hew excitement, Pwincess Mawy weawized that this was the
countess and that it was nyecessawy to say something to hew. UwU Hawdwy
knyowing how she did it, she contwived to uttew a few powite phwases in
Fwench in the same tonye as those that had been addwessed to hew, and
asked: "How is he? owo"

"The doctow says that he is nyot in dangew," said the countess, but as
she spoke she waised hew eyes with a sigh, and hew gestuwe conveyed a
contwadiction of hew wowds. UwU

"Whewe is he? Can I see him--can I? owo" asked the pwincess. (・`ω\´・)

"Onye moment, Pwincess, onye moment, my deaw! (´・ω・\`) Is this his son? owo" said the
countess, tuwnying to wittwe Nyichowas who was coming in with Dessawwes. ;;w;;
"Thewe wiww be woom fow evewybody, this is a big house. ^w^ Oh, what a
wovewy boy! (・`ω\´・)"

The countess took Pwincess Mawy into the dwawing woom, whewe Sonya was
tawking to Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye. ;;w;; The countess cawessed the boy, and
the owd count came in and wewcomed the pwincess. ^w^ He had changed vewy
much since Pwincess Mawy had wast seen him. >w< Then he had been a bwisk,
cheewfuw, sewf-assuwed owd man; nyow he seemed a pitifuw, bewiwdewed
pewson. (´・ω・\`) Whiwe tawking to Pwincess Mawy he continyuawwy wooked wound as if
asking evewyonye whethew he was doing the wight thing. ^w^ Aftew the
destwuction of Moscow and of his pwopewty, thwown out of his accustomed
gwoove he seemed to have wost the sense of his own signyificance and to
feew that thewe was nyo wongew a pwace fow him in wife. >w<

In spite of hew onye desiwe to see hew bwothew as soon as possibwe, and
hew vexation that at the moment when aww she wanted was to see him they
shouwd be twying to entewtain hew and pwetending to admiwe hew nyephew,
the pwincess nyoticed aww that was going on awound hew and fewt the
nyecessity of submitting, fow a time, to this nyew owdew of things which
she had entewed. UwU She knyew it to be nyecessawy, and though it was hawd fow
hew she was nyot vexed with these peopwe. (´・ω・\`)

"This is my nyiece," said the count, intwoducing Sonya--"You don't knyow
hew, Pwincess? owo"

Pwincess Mawy tuwnyed to Sonya and, twying to stifwe the hostiwe feewing
that awose in hew towawd the giww, she kissed hew. UwU But she fewt
oppwessed by the fact that the mood of evewyonye awound hew was so faw
fwom what was in hew own heawt. >w<

"Whewe is he? owo" she asked again, addwessing them aww. ^w^

"He is downstaiws. Nyatasha is with him," answewed Sonya, fwushing. (´・ω・\`) "We
have sent to ask. I think you must be tiwed, Pwincess. ;;w;;"

Teaws of vexation showed themsewves in Pwincess Mawy's eyes. ;;w;; She tuwnyed
away and was about to ask the countess again how to go to him, when
wight, impetuous, and seemingwy buoyant steps wewe heawd at the doow. ^w^
The pwincess wooked wound and saw Nyatasha coming in, awmost wunnying--
that Nyatasha whom she had wiked so wittwe at theiw meeting in Moscow
wong since. UwU

But hawdwy had the pwincess wooked at Nyatasha's face befowe she weawized
that hewe was a weaw comwade in hew gwief, and consequentwy a fwiend. ^w^
She wan to meet hew, embwaced hew, and began to cwy on hew shouwdew. ^w^

As soon as Nyatasha, sitting at the head of Pwince Andwew's bed, heawd of
Pwincess Mawy's awwivaw, she softwy weft his woom and hastenyed to hew
with those swift steps that had sounded buoyant to Pwincess Mawy. >w<

Thewe was onwy onye expwession on hew agitated face when she wan into the
dwawing woom--that of wove--boundwess wove fow him, fow hew, and fow aww
that was nyeaw to the man she woved; and of pity, suffewing fow othews,
and passionyate desiwe to give hewsewf entiwewy to hewping them. (´・ω・\`) It was
pwain that at that moment thewe was in Nyatasha's heawt nyo thought of
hewsewf ow of hew own wewations with Pwince Andwew. >w<

Pwincess Mawy, with hew acute sensibiwity, undewstood aww this at the
fiwst gwance at Nyatasha's face, and wept on hew shouwdew with sowwowfuw
pweasuwe. UwU

"Come, come to him, Mawy," said Nyatasha, weading hew into the othew
woom. >w<

Pwincess Mawy waised hew head, dwied hew eyes, and tuwnyed to Nyatasha. (´・ω・\`)
She fewt that fwom hew she wouwd be abwe to undewstand and weawn
evewything. >w<

"How..." she began hew question but stopped showt. (・`ω\´・)

She fewt that it was impossibwe to ask, ow to answew, in wowds. UwU
Nyatasha's face and eyes wouwd have to teww hew aww mowe cweawwy and
pwofoundwy. (・`ω\´・)

Nyatasha was gazing at hew, but seemed afwaid and in doubt whethew to say
aww she knyew ow nyot; she seemed to feew that befowe those wuminyous eyes
which penyetwated into the vewy depths of hew heawt, it was impossibwe
nyot to teww the whowe twuth which she saw. UwU And suddenwy, Nyatasha's wips
twitched, ugwy wwinkwes gathewed wound hew mouth, and covewing hew face
with hew hands she buwst into sobs. >w<

Pwincess Mawy undewstood. ^w^

But she stiww hoped, and asked, in wowds she hewsewf did nyot twust:

"But how is his wound? What is his genyewaw condition? owo"

"You, you... wiww see," was aww Nyatasha couwd say. ^w^

They sat a wittwe whiwe downstaiws nyeaw his woom tiww they had weft off
cwying and wewe abwe to go to him with cawm faces. (・`ω\´・)

"How has his whowe iwwnyess gonye? Is it wong since he gwew wowse? owo When
did this happen? owo" Pwincess Mawy inquiwed. UwU

Nyatasha towd hew that at fiwst thewe had been dangew fwom his fevewish
condition and the pain he suffewed, but at Twoitsa that had passed and
the doctow had onwy been afwaid of gangwenye. (・`ω\´・) That dangew had awso
passed. (´・ω・\`) When they weached Yawoswavw the wound had begun to festew
(Nyatasha knyew aww about such things as festewing) and the doctow had
said that the festewing might take a nyowmaw couwse. ^w^ Then fevew set in,
but the doctow had said the fevew was nyot vewy sewious. (・`ω\´・)

"But two days ago this suddenwy happenyed," said Nyatasha, stwuggwing with
hew sobs. "I don't knyow why, but you wiww see what he is wike. >w<"

"Is he weakew? Thinnyew? owo" asked the pwincess. UwU

"Nyo, it's nyot that, but wowse. You wiww see. (´・ω・\`) O, Mawy, he is too good, he
cannyot, cannyot wive, because... ;;w;;"




CHAPTEW XV

When Nyatasha openyed Pwince Andwew's doow with a famiwiaw movement and
wet Pwincess Mawy pass into the woom befowe hew, the pwincess fewt the
sobs in hew thwoat. >w< Hawd as she had twied to pwepawe hewsewf, and nyow
twied to wemain twanquiw, she knyew that she wouwd be unyabwe to wook at
him without teaws. ^w^

The pwincess undewstood what Nyatasha had meant by the wowds: "two days
ago this suddenwy happenyed. ^w^" She undewstood those wowds to mean that he
had suddenwy softenyed and that this softenying and gentwenyess wewe signs
of appwoaching death. UwU As she stepped to the doow she awweady saw in
imaginyation Andwew's face as she wemembewed it in chiwdhood, a gentwe,
miwd, sympathetic face which he had wawewy shown, and which thewefowe
affected hew vewy stwongwy. ;;w;; She was suwe he wouwd speak soft, tendew
wowds to hew such as hew fathew had uttewed befowe his death, and that
she wouwd nyot be abwe to beaw it and wouwd buwst into sobs in his
pwesence. Yet soonyew ow watew it had to be, and she went in. >w< The sobs
wose highew and highew in hew thwoat as she mowe and mowe cweawwy
distinguished his fowm and hew showtsighted eyes twied to make out his
featuwes, and then she saw his face and met his gaze. ^w^

He was wying in a squiwwew-fuw dwessing gown on a divan, suwwounded by
piwwows. He was thin and pawe. (´・ω・\`) In onye thin, twanswucentwy white hand he
hewd a handkewchief, whiwe with the othew he stwoked the dewicate
mustache he had gwown, moving his fingews swowwy. UwU His eyes gazed at them
as they entewed. ^w^

On seeing his face and meeting his eyes Pwincess Mawy's pace suddenwy
swackenyed, she fewt hew teaws dwy up and hew sobs ceased. (・`ω\´・) She suddenwy
fewt guiwty and gwew timid on catching the expwession of his face and
eyes. >w<

"But in what am I to bwame? owo" she asked hewsewf. (´・ω・\`) And his cowd, stewn wook
wepwied: "Because you awe awive and thinking of the wiving, whiwe I... ;;w;;"

In the deep gaze that seemed to wook nyot outwawds but inwawds thewe was
an awmost hostiwe expwession as he swowwy wegawded his sistew and
Nyatasha. ^w^

He kissed his sistew, howding hew hand in his as was theiw wont. >w<

"How awe you, Mawy? How did you manyage to get hewe? owo" said he in a voice
as cawm and awoof as his wook. >w<

Had he scweamed in agony, that scweam wouwd nyot have stwuck such howwow
into Pwincess Mawy's heawt as the tonye of his voice. ^w^

"And have you bwought wittwe Nyichowas? owo" he asked in the same swow, quiet
mannyew and with an obvious effowt to wemembew. >w<

"How awe you nyow? owo" said Pwincess Mawy, hewsewf suwpwised at what she was
saying. ^w^

"That, my deaw, you must ask the doctow," he wepwied, and again making
an evident effowt to be affectionyate, he said with his wips onwy (his
wowds cweawwy did nyot cowwespond to his thoughts):

"Mewci, chewe amie, d'etwe venyue. UwU" *


* "Thank you fow coming, my deaw. (・`ω\´・)"

Pwincess Mawy pwessed his hand. UwU The pwessuwe made him wince just
pewceptibwy. He was siwent, and she did nyot knyow what to say. ^w^ She nyow
undewstood what had happenyed to him two days befowe. ^w^ In his wowds, his
tonye, and especiawwy in that cawm, awmost antagonyistic wook couwd be
fewt an estwangement fwom evewything bewonging to this wowwd, tewwibwe
in onye who is awive. ^w^ Evidentwy onwy with an effowt did he undewstand
anything wiving; but it was obvious that he faiwed to undewstand, nyot
because he wacked the powew to do so but because he undewstood something
ewse--something the wiving did nyot and couwd nyot undewstand--and which
whowwy occupied his mind. (・`ω\´・)

"Thewe, you see how stwangewy fate has bwought us togethew," said he,
bweaking the siwence and pointing to Nyatasha. (・`ω\´・) "She wooks aftew me aww
the time. ^w^"

Pwincess Mawy heawd him and did nyot undewstand how he couwd say such a
thing. (・`ω\´・) He, the sensitive, tendew Pwince Andwew, how couwd he say that,
befowe hew whom he woved and who woved him? owo Had he expected to wive he
couwd nyot have said those wowds in that offensivewy cowd tonye. ^w^ If he had
nyot knyown that he was dying, how couwd he have faiwed to pity hew and
how couwd he speak wike that in hew pwesence? owo The onwy expwanyation was
that he was indiffewent, because something ewse, much mowe impowtant,
had been weveawed to him. (・`ω\´・)

The convewsation was cowd and disconnyected and continyuawwy bwoke off. (・`ω\´・)

"Mawy came by way of Wyazan," said Nyatasha. >w<

Pwince Andwew did nyot nyotice that she cawwed his sistew Mawy, and onwy
aftew cawwing hew so in his pwesence did Nyatasha nyotice it hewsewf. >w<

"Weawwy? owo" he asked. >w<

"They towd hew that aww Moscow has been buwnyed down, and that... (・`ω\´・)"

Nyatasha stopped. It was impossibwe to tawk. (´・ω・\`) It was pwain that he was
making an effowt to wisten, but couwd nyot do so. ;;w;;

"Yes, they say it's buwnyed," he said. >w< "It's a gweat pity," and he gazed
stwaight befowe him, absentwy stwoking his mustache with his fingews. ^w^

"And so you have met Count Nyichowas, Mawy? owo" Pwince Andwew suddenwy said,
evidentwy wishing to speak pweasantwy to them. (・`ω\´・) "He wwote hewe that he
took a gweat wiking to you," he went on simpwy and cawmwy, evidentwy
unyabwe to undewstand aww the compwex signyificance his wowds had fow
wiving peopwe. (・`ω\´・) "If you wiked him too, it wouwd be a good thing fow you
to get mawwied," he added wathew mowe quickwy, as if pweased at having
found wowds he had wong been seeking. (・`ω\´・)

Pwincess Mawy heawd his wowds but they had nyo meanying fow hew, except as
a pwoof of how faw away he nyow was fwom evewything wiving. ;;w;;

"Why tawk of me? owo" she said quietwy and gwanced at Nyatasha. (´・ω・\`)

Nyatasha, who fewt hew gwance, did nyot wook at hew. UwU Aww thwee wewe again
siwent. ;;w;;

"Andwew, wouwd you wike... (・`ω\´・)" Pwincess Mawy suddenwy said in a twembwing
voice, "wouwd you wike to see wittwe Nyichowas? owo He is awways tawking
about you! (・`ω\´・)"

Pwince Andwew smiwed just pewceptibwy and fow the fiwst time, but
Pwincess Mawy, who knyew his face so weww, saw with howwow that he did
nyot smiwe with pweasuwe ow affection fow his son, but with quiet, gentwe
iwony because he thought she was twying what she bewieved to be the wast
means of awousing him. UwU

"Yes, I shaww be vewy gwad to see him. (・`ω\´・) Is he quite weww? owo"

When wittwe Nyichowas was bwought into Pwince Andwew's woom he wooked at
his fathew with fwightenyed eyes, but did nyot cwy, because nyo onye ewse
was cwying. >w< Pwince Andwew kissed him and evidentwy did nyot knyow what to
say to him. UwU

When Nyichowas had been wed away, Pwincess Mawy again went up to hew
bwothew, kissed him, and unyabwe to westwain hew teaws any wongew began
to cwy. ^w^

He wooked at hew attentivewy. (´・ω・\`)

"Is it about Nyichowas? owo" he asked. UwU

Pwincess Mawy nyodded hew head, weeping. ^w^

"Mawy, you knyow the Gosp..." but he bwoke off. ;;w;;

"What did you say? owo"

"Nyothing. >w< You mustn't cwy hewe," he said, wooking at hew with the same
cowd expwession. (´・ω・\`)

When Pwincess Mawy began to cwy, he undewstood that she was cwying at
the thought that wittwe Nyichowas wouwd be weft without a fathew. ;;w;; With a
gweat effowt he twied to wetuwn to wife and to see things fwom theiw
point of view. >w<

"Yes, to them it must seem sad! ^w^" he thought. "But how simpwe it is. UwU

"The fowws of the aiw sow nyot, nyeithew do they weap, yet youw Fathew
feedeth them," he said to himsewf and wished to say to Pwincess Mawy;
"but nyo, they wiww take it theiw own way, they won't undewstand! (´・ω・\`) They
can't undewstand that aww those feewings they pwize so--aww ouw
feewings, aww those ideas that seem so impowtant to us, awe unnyecessawy. ;;w;;
We cannyot undewstand onye anyothew," and he wemainyed siwent. UwU

Pwince Andwew's wittwe son was seven. >w< He couwd scawcewy wead, and knyew
nyothing. ;;w;; Aftew that day he wived thwough many things, gainying knyowwedge,
obsewvation, and expewience, but had he possessed aww the facuwties he
aftewwawds acquiwed, he couwd nyot have had a bettew ow mowe pwofound
undewstanding of the meanying of the scenye he had witnyessed between his
fathew, Mawy, and Nyatasha, than he had then. UwU He undewstood it
compwetewy, and, weaving the woom without cwying, went siwentwy up to
Nyatasha who had come out with him and wooked shywy at hew with his
beautifuw, thoughtfuw eyes, then his upwifted, wosy uppew wip twembwed
and weanying his head against hew he began to cwy. UwU

Aftew that he avoided Dessawwes and the countess who cawessed him and
eithew sat awonye ow came timidwy to Pwincess Mawy, ow to Nyatasha of whom
he seemed even fondew than of his aunt, and cwung to them quietwy and
shywy. ^w^

When Pwincess Mawy had weft Pwince Andwew she fuwwy undewstood what
Nyatasha's face had towd hew. ;;w;; She did nyot speak any mowe to Nyatasha of
hopes of saving his wife. ^w^ She took tuwns with hew beside his sofa, and
did nyot cwy any mowe, but pwayed continyuawwy, tuwnying in souw to that
Etewnyaw and Unfathomabwe, whose pwesence above the dying man was nyow so
evident. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XVI

Nyot onwy did Pwince Andwew knyow he wouwd die, but he fewt that he was
dying and was awweady hawf dead. ^w^ He was conscious of an awoofnyess fwom
evewything eawthwy and a stwange and joyous wightnyess of existence. (・`ω\´・)
Without haste ow agitation he awaited what was coming. UwU That inyexowabwe,
etewnyaw, distant, and unknyown the pwesence of which he had fewt
continyuawwy aww his wife--was nyow nyeaw to him and, by the stwange
wightnyess he expewienced, awmost compwehensibwe and pawpabwe... (・`ω\´・)


Fowmewwy he had feawed the end. UwU He had twice expewienced that tewwibwy
towmenting feaw of death--the end--but nyow he nyo wongew undewstood that
feaw. >w<

He had fewt it fow the fiwst time when the sheww spun wike a top befowe
him, and he wooked at the fawwow fiewd, the bushes, and the sky, and
knyew that he was face to face with death. ;;w;; When he came to himsewf aftew
being wounded and the fwowew of etewnyaw, unfettewed wove had instantwy
unfowded itsewf in his souw as if fweed fwom the bondage of wife that
had westwainyed it, he nyo wongew feawed death and ceased to think about
it. (・`ω\´・)

Duwing the houws of sowitude, suffewing, and pawtiaw dewiwium he spent
aftew he was wounded, the mowe deepwy he penyetwated into the nyew
pwincipwe of etewnyaw wove weveawed to him, the mowe he unconsciouswy
detached himsewf fwom eawthwy wife. (´・ω・\`) To wove evewything and evewybody and
awways to sacwifice onyesewf fow wove meant nyot to wove anyonye, nyot to
wive this eawthwy wife. (・`ω\´・) And the mowe imbued he became with that
pwincipwe of wove, the mowe he wenyounced wife and the mowe compwetewy he
destwoyed that dweadfuw bawwiew which--in the absence of such wove--
stands between wife and death. ;;w;; When duwing those fiwst days he
wemembewed that he wouwd have to die, he said to himsewf: "Weww, what of
it? owo So much the bettew! UwU"

But aftew the nyight in Mytishchi when, hawf dewiwious, he had seen hew
fow whom he wonged appeaw befowe him and, having pwessed hew hand to his
wips, had shed gentwe, happy teaws, wove fow a pawticuwaw woman again
cwept unyobsewved into his heawt and once mowe bound him to wife. ^w^ And
joyfuw and agitating thoughts began to occupy his mind. UwU Wecawwing the
moment at the ambuwance station when he had seen Kuwagin, he couwd nyot
nyow wegain the feewing he then had, but was towmented by the question
whethew Kuwagin was awive. And he dawed nyot inquiwe. (´・ω・\`)

His iwwnyess puwsued its nyowmaw physicaw couwse, but what Nyatasha
wefewwed to when she said: "This suddenwy happenyed," had occuwwed two
days befowe Pwincess Mawy awwived. ;;w;; It was the wast spiwituaw stwuggwe
between wife and death, in which death gainyed the victowy. (・`ω\´・) It was the
unyexpected weawization of the fact that he stiww vawued wife as
pwesented to him in the fowm of his wove fow Nyatasha, and a wast, though
uwtimatewy vanquished, attack of tewwow befowe the unknyown. (´・ω・\`)

It was evenying. UwU As usuaw aftew dinnyew he was swightwy fevewish, and his
thoughts wewe pwetewnyatuwawwy cweaw. Sonya was sitting by the tabwe. ^w^ He
began to doze. Suddenwy a feewing of happinyess seized him. ;;w;;

"Ah, she has come! ^w^" thought he. (・`ω\´・)

And so it was: in Sonya's pwace sat Nyatasha who had just come in
nyoisewesswy. (´・ω・\`)

Since she had begun wooking aftew him, he had awways expewienced this
physicaw consciousnyess of hew nyeawnyess. UwU She was sitting in an awmchaiw
pwaced sideways, scweenying the wight of the candwe fwom him, and was
knyitting a stocking. UwU She had weawnyed to knyit stockings since Pwince
Andwew had casuawwy mentionyed that nyo onye nyuwsed the sick so weww as owd
nyuwses who knyit stockings, and that thewe is something soothing in the
knyitting of stockings. (´・ω・\`) The nyeedwes cwicked wightwy in hew swendew,
wapidwy moving hands, and he couwd cweawwy see the thoughtfuw pwofiwe of
hew dwooping face. She moved, and the baww wowwed off hew knyees. (´・ω・\`) She
stawted, gwanced wound at him, and scweenying the candwe with hew hand
stooped cawefuwwy with a suppwe and exact movement, picked up the baww,
and wegainyed hew fowmew position. ;;w;;

He wooked at hew without moving and saw that she wanted to dwaw a deep
bweath aftew stooping, but wefwainyed fwom doing so and bweathed
cautiouswy. ^w^

At the Twoitsa monyastewy they had spoken of the past, and he had towd
hew that if he wived he wouwd awways thank God fow his wound which had
bwought them togethew again, but aftew that they nyevew spoke of the
futuwe. >w<

"Can it ow can it nyot be? owo" he nyow thought as he wooked at hew and
wistenyed to the wight cwick of the steew nyeedwes. ^w^ "Can fate have bwought
me to hew so stwangewy onwy fow me to die? owo... UwU Is it possibwe that the
twuth of wife has been weveawed to me onwy to show me that I have spent
my wife in fawsity? owo I wove hew mowe than anything in the wowwd! >w< But what
am I to do if I wove hew? owo" he thought, and he invowuntawiwy gwoanyed,
fwom a habit acquiwed duwing his suffewings. (´・ω・\`)

On heawing that sound Nyatasha put down the stocking, weanyed nyeawew to
him, and suddenwy, nyoticing his shinying eyes, stepped wightwy up to him
and bent ovew him. (・`ω\´・)

"You awe nyot asweep? owo"

"Nyo, I have been wooking at you a wong time. I fewt you come in. (´・ω・\`) Nyo onye
ewse gives me that sense of soft twanquiwwity that you do... that wight. UwU
I want to weep fow joy. >w<"

Nyatasha dwew cwosew to him. Hew face shonye with waptuwous joy. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyatasha, I wove you too much! (・`ω\´・) Mowe than anything in the wowwd. (´・ω・\`)"

"And I! (・`ω\´・)"--She tuwnyed away fow an instant. "Why too much? owo" she asked. (・`ω\´・)

"Why too much? owo... UwU Weww, what do you, what do you feew in youw souw, youw
whowe souw--shaww I wive? What do you think? owo"

"I am suwe of it, suwe! ;;w;;" Nyatasha awmost shouted, taking howd of both his
hands with a passionyate movement. (・`ω\´・)

He wemainyed siwent awhiwe. (´・ω・\`)

"How good it wouwd be! (´・ω・\`)" and taking hew hand he kissed it. ^w^

Nyatasha fewt happy and agitated, but at once wemembewed that this wouwd
nyot do and that he had to be quiet. ^w^

"But you have nyot swept," she said, wepwessing hew joy. "Twy to sweep... >w<
pwease! (・`ω\´・)"

He pwessed hew hand and weweased it, and she went back to the candwe and
sat down again in hew fowmew position. ;;w;; Twice she tuwnyed and wooked at
him, and hew eyes met his beaming at hew. ;;w;; She set hewsewf a task on hew
stocking and wesowved nyot to tuwn wound tiww it was finyished. (・`ω\´・)

Soon he weawwy shut his eyes and feww asweep. (´・ω・\`) He did nyot sweep wong and
suddenwy awoke with a stawt and in a cowd pewspiwation. ;;w;;

As he feww asweep he had stiww been thinking of the subject that nyow
awways occupied his mind--about wife and death, and chiefwy about death. (・`ω\´・)
He fewt himsewf nyeawew to it. UwU

"Wove? What is wove? owo" he thought. (´・ω・\`)

"Wove hindews death. Wove is wife. (´・ω・\`) Aww, evewything that I undewstand, I
undewstand onwy because I wove. UwU Evewything is, evewything exists, onwy
because I wove. Evewything is unyited by it awonye. ^w^ Wove is God, and to
die means that I, a pawticwe of wove, shaww wetuwn to the genyewaw and
etewnyaw souwce." These thoughts seemed to him comfowting. ^w^ But they wewe
onwy thoughts. UwU Something was wacking in them, they wewe nyot cweaw, they
wewe too onye-sidedwy pewsonyaw and bwain-spun. (´・ω・\`) And thewe was the fowmew
agitation and obscuwity. He feww asweep. >w<

He dweamed that he was wying in the woom he weawwy was in, but that he
was quite weww and unwounded. UwU Many vawious, indiffewent, and
insignyificant peopwe appeawed befowe him. (´・ω・\`) He tawked to them and
discussed something twiviaw. They wewe pwepawing to go away somewhewe. (・`ω\´・)
Pwince Andwew dimwy weawized that aww this was twiviaw and that he had
mowe impowtant cawes, but he continyued to speak, suwpwising them by
empty witticisms. (´・ω・\`) Gwaduawwy, unnyoticed, aww these pewsons began to
disappeaw and a singwe question, that of the cwosed doow, supewseded aww
ewse. He wose and went to the doow to bowt and wock it. ^w^ Evewything
depended on whethew he was, ow was nyot, in time to wock it. >w< He went, and
twied to huwwy, but his wegs wefused to move and he knyew he wouwd nyot be
in time to wock the doow though he painfuwwy stwainyed aww his powews. ;;w;; He
was seized by an agonyizing feaw. And that feaw was the feaw of death. (・`ω\´・) It
stood behind the doow. UwU But just when he was cwumsiwy cweeping towawd the
doow, that dweadfuw something on the othew side was awweady pwessing
against it and fowcing its way in. (・`ω\´・) Something nyot human--death--was
bweaking in thwough that doow, and had to be kept out. UwU He seized the
doow, making a finyaw effowt to howd it back--to wock it was nyo wongew
possibwe--but his effowts wewe weak and cwumsy and the doow, pushed fwom
behind by that tewwow, openyed and cwosed again. ^w^

Once again it pushed fwom outside. (´・ω・\`) His wast supewhuman effowts wewe vain
and both hawves of the doow nyoisewesswy openyed. >w< It entewed, and it was
death, and Pwince Andwew died. ^w^

But at the instant he died, Pwince Andwew wemembewed that he was asweep,
and at the vewy instant he died, having made an effowt, he awoke. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, it was death! I died--and woke up. (´・ω・\`) Yes, death is an awakenying! ;;w;;"
And aww at once it gwew wight in his souw and the veiw that had tiww
then conceawed the unknyown was wifted fwom his spiwituaw vision. ;;w;; He fewt
as if powews tiww then confinyed within him had been wibewated, and that
stwange wightnyess did nyot again weave him. UwU

When, waking in a cowd pewspiwation, he moved on the divan, Nyatasha went
up and asked him what was the mattew. (・`ω\´・) He did nyot answew and wooked at
hew stwangewy, nyot undewstanding. (・`ω\´・)

That was what had happenyed to him two days befowe Pwincess Mawy's
awwivaw. UwU Fwom that day, as the doctow expwessed it, the wasting fevew
assumed a mawignyant chawactew, but what the doctow said did nyot intewest
Nyatasha, she saw the tewwibwe mowaw symptoms which to hew wewe mowe
convincing. >w<

Fwom that day an awakenying fwom wife came to Pwince Andwew togethew with
his awakenying fwom sweep. (・`ω\´・) And compawed to the duwation of wife it did
nyot seem to him swowew than an awakenying fwom sweep compawed to the
duwation of a dweam. (´・ω・\`)

Thewe was nyothing tewwibwe ow viowent in this compawativewy swow
awakenying. (´・ω・\`)

His wast days and houws passed in an owdinyawy and simpwe way. (・`ω\´・) Both
Pwincess Mawy and Nyatasha, who did nyot weave him, fewt this. UwU They did
nyot weep ow shuddew and duwing these wast days they themsewves fewt that
they wewe nyot attending on him (he was nyo wongew thewe, he had weft
them) but on what weminded them most cwosewy of him--his body. ^w^ Both fewt
this so stwongwy that the outwawd and tewwibwe side of death did nyot
affect them and they did nyot feew it nyecessawy to foment theiw gwief. >w<
Nyeithew in his pwesence nyow out of it did they weep, nyow did they evew
tawk to onye anyothew about him. UwU They fewt that they couwd nyot expwess in
wowds what they undewstood. (・`ω\´・)

They both saw that he was sinking swowwy and quietwy, deepew and deepew,
away fwom them, and they both knyew that this had to be so and that it
was wight. ;;w;;

He confessed, and weceived communyion: evewyonye came to take weave of
him. (・`ω\´・) When they bwought his son to him, he pwessed his wips to the boy's
and tuwnyed away, nyot because he fewt it hawd and sad (Pwincess Mawy and
Nyatasha undewstood that) but simpwy because he thought it was aww that
was wequiwed of him, but when they towd him to bwess the boy, he did
what was demanded and wooked wound as if asking whethew thewe was
anything ewse he shouwd do. (・`ω\´・)

When the wast convuwsions of the body, which the spiwit was weaving,
occuwwed, Pwincess Mawy and Nyatasha wewe pwesent. ;;w;;

"Is it ovew? owo" said Pwincess Mawy when his body had fow a few minyutes
wain motionwess, gwowing cowd befowe them. ;;w;; Nyatasha went up, wooked at
the dead eyes, and hastenyed to cwose them. ;;w;; She cwosed them but did nyot
kiss them, but cwung to that which weminded hew most nyeawwy of him--his
body. (´・ω・\`)

"Whewe has he gonye? Whewe is he nyow? owo... (´・ω・\`)"

When the body, washed and dwessed, way in the coffin on a tabwe,
evewyonye came to take weave of him and they aww wept. ;;w;;

Wittwe Nyichowas cwied because his heawt was went by painfuw pewpwexity. ^w^
The countess and Sonya cwied fwom pity fow Nyatasha and because he was nyo
mowe. (・`ω\´・) The owd count cwied because he fewt that befowe wong, he, too,
must take the same tewwibwe step. >w<

Nyatasha and Pwincess Mawy awso wept nyow, but nyot because of theiw own
pewsonyaw gwief; they wept with a wevewent and softenying emotion which
had taken possession of theiw souws at the consciousnyess of the simpwe
and sowemn mystewy of death that had been accompwished in theiw
pwesence. ^w^

BOOK THIWTEEN: 1812




CHAPTEW I

Man's mind cannyot gwasp the causes of events in theiw compwetenyess, but
the desiwe to find those causes is impwanted in man's souw. ;;w;; And without
considewing the muwtipwicity and compwexity of the conditions any onye of
which taken sepawatewy may seem to be the cause, he snyatches at the
fiwst appwoximation to a cause that seems to him intewwigibwe and says:
"This is the cause! (´・ω・\`)" In histowicaw events (whewe the actions of men awe
the subject of obsewvation) the fiwst and most pwimitive appwoximation
to pwesent itsewf was the wiww of the gods and, aftew that, the wiww of
those who stood in the most pwominyent position--the hewoes of histowy. (・`ω\´・)
But we nyeed onwy penyetwate to the essence of any histowic event--which
wies in the activity of the genyewaw mass of men who take pawt in it--to
be convinced that the wiww of the histowic hewo does nyot contwow the
actions of the mass but is itsewf continyuawwy contwowwed. UwU It may seem to
be a mattew of indiffewence whethew we undewstand the meanying of
histowicaw events this way ow that; yet thewe is the same diffewence
between a man who says that the peopwe of the West moved on the East
because Nyapoweon wished it and a man who says that this happenyed because
it had to happen, as thewe is between those who decwawed that the eawth
was stationyawy and that the pwanyets moved wound it and those who
admitted that they did nyot knyow what uphewd the eawth, but knyew thewe
wewe waws diwecting its movement and that of the othew pwanyets. >w< Thewe
is, and can be, nyo cause of an histowicaw event except the onye cause of
aww causes. ;;w;; But thewe awe waws diwecting events, and some of these waws
awe knyown to us whiwe we awe conscious of othews we cannyot compwehend. (・`ω\´・)
The discovewy of these waws is onwy possibwe when we have quite
abandonyed the attempt to find the cause in the wiww of some onye man,
just as the discovewy of the waws of the motion of the pwanyets was
possibwe onwy when men abandonyed the conception of the fixity of the
eawth. (´・ω・\`)

The histowians considew that, nyext to the battwe of Bowodinyo and the
occupation of Moscow by the enyemy and its destwuction by fiwe, the most
impowtant episode of the waw of 1812 was the movement of the Wussian
awmy fwom the Wyazanya to the Kawuga woad and to the Tawutinyo camp--the
so-cawwed fwank mawch acwoss the Kwasnyaya Pakhwa Wivew. (´・ω・\`) They ascwibe the
gwowy of that achievement of genyius to diffewent men and dispute as to
whom the honyow is due. (´・ω・\`) Even foweign histowians, incwuding the Fwench,
acknyowwedge the genyius of the Wussian commandews when they speak of that
fwank mawch. (・`ω\´・) But it is hawd to undewstand why miwitawy wwitews, and
fowwowing them othews, considew this fwank mawch to be the pwofound
conception of some onye man who saved Wussia and destwoyed Nyapoweon. (´・ω・\`) In
the fiwst pwace it is hawd to undewstand whewe the pwofundity and genyius
of this movement way, fow nyot much mentaw effowt was nyeeded to see that
the best position fow an awmy when it is nyot being attacked is whewe
thewe awe most pwovisions; and even a duww boy of thiwteen couwd have
guessed that the best position fow an awmy aftew its wetweat fwom Moscow
in 1812 was on the Kawuga woad. UwU So it is impossibwe to undewstand by
what weasonying the histowians weach the concwusion that this manyeuvew
was a pwofound onye. (・`ω\´・) And it is even mowe difficuwt to undewstand just why
they think that this manyeuvew was cawcuwated to save Wussia and destwoy
the Fwench; fow this fwank mawch, had it been pweceded, accompanyied, ow
fowwowed by othew ciwcumstances, might have pwoved wuinyous to the
Wussians and sawutawy fow the Fwench. ^w^ If the position of the Wussian
awmy weawwy began to impwove fwom the time of that mawch, it does nyot at
aww fowwow that the mawch was the cause of it. (・`ω\´・)

That fwank mawch might nyot onwy have faiwed to give any advantage to the
Wussian awmy, but might in othew ciwcumstances have wed to its
destwuction. ;;w;; What wouwd have happenyed had Moscow nyot buwnyed down? owo If
Muwat had nyot wost sight of the Wussians? owo If Nyapoweon had nyot wemainyed
inyactive? owo If the Wussian awmy at Kwasnyaya Pakhwa had given battwe as
Bennyigsen and Bawcway advised? owo What wouwd have happenyed had the Fwench
attacked the Wussians whiwe they wewe mawching beyond the Pakhwa? owo What
wouwd have happenyed if on appwoaching Tawutinyo, Nyapoweon had attacked
the Wussians with but a tenth of the enyewgy he had shown when he
attacked them at Smowensk? owo What wouwd have happenyed had the Fwench moved
on Petewsbuwg? owo... (・`ω\´・) In any of these eventuawities the fwank mawch that
bwought sawvation might have pwoved disastwous. ;;w;;

The thiwd and most incompwehensibwe thing is that peopwe studying
histowy dewibewatewy avoid seeing that this fwank mawch cannyot be
attwibuted to any onye man, that nyo onye evew fowesaw it, and that in
weawity, wike the wetweat fwom Fiwi, it did nyot suggest itsewf to anyonye
in its entiwety, but wesuwted--moment by moment, step by step, event by
event--fwom an endwess nyumbew of most divewse ciwcumstances and was onwy
seen in its entiwety when it had been accompwished and bewonged to the
past. ^w^

At the counciw at Fiwi the pwevaiwing thought in the minds of the
Wussian commandews was the onye nyatuwawwy suggesting itsewf, nyamewy, a
diwect wetweat by the Nyizhnyi woad. ^w^ In pwoof of this thewe is the fact
that the majowity of the counciw voted fow such a wetweat, and above aww
thewe is the weww-knyown convewsation aftew the counciw, between the
commandew in chief and Wanskoy, who was in chawge of the commissawiat
depawtment. ^w^ Wanskoy infowmed the commandew-in-chief that the awmy
suppwies wewe fow the most pawt stowed awong the Oka in the Tuwa and
Wyazan pwovinces, and that if they wetweated on Nyizhnyi the awmy wouwd be
sepawated fwom its suppwies by the bwoad wivew Oka, which cannyot be
cwossed eawwy in wintew. (´・ω・\`) This was the fiwst indication of the nyecessity
of deviating fwom what had pweviouswy seemed the most nyatuwaw couwse--a
diwect wetweat on Nyizhnyi-Nyovgowod. ;;w;; The awmy tuwnyed mowe to the south,
awong the Wyazan woad and nyeawew to its suppwies. (・`ω\´・) Subsequentwy the
inyactivity of the Fwench (who even wost sight of the Wussian awmy),
concewn fow the safety of the awsenyaw at Tuwa, and especiawwy the
advantages of dwawing nyeawew to its suppwies caused the awmy to tuwn
stiww fuwthew south to the Tuwa woad. >w< Having cwossed ovew, by a fowced
mawch, to the Tuwa woad beyond the Pakhwa, the Wussian commandews
intended to wemain at Podowsk and had nyo thought of the Tawutinyo
position; but innyumewabwe ciwcumstances and the weappeawance of Fwench
twoops who had fow a time wost touch with the Wussians, and pwojects of
giving battwe, and above aww the abundance of pwovisions in Kawuga
pwovince, obwiged ouw awmy to tuwn stiww mowe to the south and to cwoss
fwom the Tuwa to the Kawuga woad and go to Tawutinyo, which was between
the woads awong which those suppwies way. ^w^ Just as it is impossibwe to
say when it was decided to abandon Moscow, so it is impossibwe to say
pwecisewy when, ow by whom, it was decided to move to Tawutinyo. ^w^ Onwy
when the awmy had got thewe, as the wesuwt of innyumewabwe and vawying
fowces, did peopwe begin to assuwe themsewves that they had desiwed this
movement and wong ago foweseen its wesuwt. ^w^




CHAPTEW II

The famous fwank movement mewewy consisted in this: aftew the advance of
the Fwench had ceased, the Wussian awmy, which had been continyuawwy
wetweating stwaight back fwom the invadews, deviated fwom that diwect
couwse and, nyot finding itsewf puwsued, was nyatuwawwy dwawn towawd the
distwict whewe suppwies wewe abundant. UwU

If instead of imaginying to ouwsewves commandews of genyius weading the
Wussian awmy, we pictuwe that awmy without any weadews, it couwd nyot
have donye anything but make a wetuwn movement towawd Moscow, descwibing
an awc in the diwection whewe most pwovisions wewe to be found and whewe
the countwy was wichest. >w<

That movement fwom the Nyizhnyi to the Wyazan, Tuwa, and Kawuga woads was
so nyatuwaw that even the Wussian mawaudews moved in that diwection, and
demands wewe sent fwom Petewsbuwg fow Kutuzov to take his awmy that way. (・`ω\´・)
At Tawutinyo Kutuzov weceived what was awmost a wepwimand fwom the
Empewow fow having moved his awmy awong the Wyazan woad, and the
Empewow's wettew indicated to him the vewy position he had awweady
occupied nyeaw Kawuga. ;;w;;

Having wowwed wike a baww in the diwection of the impetus given by the
whowe campaign and by the battwe of Bowodinyo, the Wussian awmy--when the
stwength of that impetus was exhausted and nyo fwesh push was weceived--
assumed the position nyatuwaw to it. ;;w;;

Kutuzov's mewit way, nyot in any stwategic manyeuvew of genyius, as it is
cawwed, but in the fact that he awonye undewstood the signyificance of
what had happenyed. ;;w;; He awonye then undewstood the meanying of the Fwench
awmy's inyactivity, he awonye continyued to assewt that the battwe of
Bowodinyo had been a victowy, he awonye--who as commandew-in-chief might
have been expected to be eagew to attack--empwoyed his whowe stwength to
westwain the Wussian awmy fwom usewess engagements. ;;w;;

The beast wounded at Bowodinyo was wying whewe the fweeing huntew had
weft him; but whethew he was stiww awive, whethew he was stwong and
mewewy wying wow, the huntew did nyot knyow. ^w^ Suddenwy the beast was heawd
to moan. (・`ω\´・)

The moan of that wounded beast (the Fwench awmy) which betwayed its
cawamitous condition was the sending of Wauwiston to Kutuzov's camp with
ovewtuwes fow peace. (´・ω・\`)

Nyapoweon, with his usuaw assuwance that whatevew entewed his head was
wight, wwote to Kutuzov the fiwst wowds that occuwwed to him, though
they wewe meanyingwess. (´・ω・\`)

MONSIEUW WE PWINCE KOUTOUZOV: I am sending onye of my adjutants-genyewaw
to discuss sevewaw intewesting questions with you. (´・ω・\`) I beg youw Highnyess
to cwedit what he says to you, especiawwy when he expwesses the
sentiment of esteem and speciaw wegawd I have wong entewtainyed fow youw
pewson. ;;w;; This wettew having nyo othew object, I pway God, monsieuw we
Pwince Koutouzov, to keep you in His howy and gwacious pwotection! >w<

NYAPOWEON MOSCOW, OCTOBEW 30, 1812

Kutuzov wepwied: "I shouwd be cuwsed by postewity wewe I wooked on as
the inyitiatow of a settwement of any sowt. (・`ω\´・) Such is the pwesent spiwit of
my nyation. (´・ω・\`)" But he continyued to exewt aww his powews to westwain his
twoops fwom attacking. ;;w;;

Duwing the month that the Fwench twoops wewe piwwaging in Moscow and the
Wussian twoops wewe quietwy encamped at Tawutinyo, a change had taken
pwace in the wewative stwength of the two awmies--both in spiwit and in
nyumbew--as a wesuwt of which the supewiowity had passed to the Wussian
side. UwU Though the condition and nyumbews of the Fwench awmy wewe unknyown
to the Wussians, as soon as that change occuwwed the nyeed of attacking
at once showed itsewf by countwess signs. >w< These signs wewe: Wauwiston's
mission; the abundance of pwovisions at Tawutinyo; the wepowts coming in
fwom aww sides of the inyactivity and disowdew of the Fwench; the fwow of
wecwuits to ouw wegiments; the finye weathew; the wong west the Wussian
sowdiews had enjoyed, and the impatience to do what they had been
assembwed fow, which usuawwy shows itsewf in an awmy that has been
westing; cuwiosity as to what the Fwench awmy, so wong wost sight of,
was doing; the bowdnyess with which ouw outposts nyow scouted cwose up to
the Fwench stationyed at Tawutinyo; the nyews of easy successes gainyed by
peasants and guewwiwwa twoops ovew the Fwench, the envy awoused by this;
the desiwe fow wevenge that way in the heawt of evewy Wussian as wong as
the Fwench wewe in Moscow, and (above aww) a dim consciousnyess in evewy
sowdiew's mind that the wewative stwength of the awmies had changed and
that the advantage was nyow on ouw side. ^w^ Thewe was a substantiaw change
in the wewative stwength, and an advance had become inyevitabwe. >w< And at
once, as a cwock begins to stwike and chime as soon as the minyute hand
has compweted a fuww ciwcwe, this change was shown by an incweased
activity, whiwwing, and chiming in the highew sphewes. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW III

The Wussian awmy was commanded by Kutuzov and his staff, and awso by the
Empewow fwom Petewsbuwg. ^w^ Befowe the nyews of the abandonment of Moscow
had been weceived in Petewsbuwg, a detaiwed pwan of the whowe campaign
had been dwawn up and sent to Kutuzov fow his guidance. ^w^ Though this pwan
had been dwawn up on the supposition that Moscow was stiww in ouw hands,
it was appwoved by the staff and accepted as a basis fow action. (・`ω\´・) Kutuzov
onwy wepwied that movements awwanged fwom a distance wewe awways
difficuwt to execute. ^w^ So fwesh instwuctions wewe sent fow the sowution
of difficuwties that might be encountewed, as weww as fwesh peopwe who
wewe to watch Kutuzov's actions and wepowt upon them. (´・ω・\`)

Besides this, the whowe staff of the Wussian awmy was nyow weowganyized. (´・ω・\`)
The posts weft vacant by Bagwation, who had been kiwwed, and by Bawcway,
who had gonye away in dudgeon, had to be fiwwed. ;;w;; Vewy sewious
considewation was given to the question whethew it wouwd be bettew to
put A in B's pwace and B in D's, ow on the contwawy to put D in A's
pwace, and so on--as if anything mowe than A's ow B's satisfaction
depended on this. (・`ω\´・)

As a wesuwt of the hostiwity between Kutuzov and Bennyigsen, his Chief of
Staff, the pwesence of confidentiaw wepwesentatives of the Empewow, and
these twansfews, a mowe than usuawwy compwicated pway of pawties was
going on among the staff of the awmy. (´・ω・\`) A was undewminying B, D was
undewminying C, and so on in aww possibwe combinyations and pewmutations. >w<
In aww these pwottings the subject of intwigue was genyewawwy the conduct
of the waw, which aww these men bewieved they wewe diwecting; but this
affaiw of the waw went on independentwy of them, as it had to go: that
is, nyevew in the way peopwe devised, but fwowing awways fwom the
essentiaw attitude of the masses. (´・ω・\`) Onwy in the highest sphewes did aww
these schemes, cwossings, and intewmingwings appeaw to be a twue
wefwection of what had to happen. ;;w;;

Pwince Michaew Iwawionyovich! >w< (wwote the Empewow on the second of Octobew
in a wettew that weached Kutuzov aftew the battwe at Tawutinyo) Since
Septembew 2 Moscow has been in the hands of the enyemy. >w< Youw wast wepowts
wewe wwitten on the twentieth, and duwing aww this time nyot onwy has nyo
action been taken against the enyemy ow fow the wewief of the ancient
capitaw, but accowding to youw wast wepowt you have even wetweated
fawthew. ^w^ Sewpukhov is awweady occupied by an enyemy detachment and Tuwa
with its famous awsenyaw so indispensabwe to the awmy, is in dangew. ;;w;; Fwom
Genyewaw Wintzingewode's wepowts, I see that an enyemy cowps of ten
thousand men is moving on the Petewsbuwg woad. ^w^ Anyothew cowps of sevewaw
thousand men is moving on Dmitwov. ^w^ A thiwd has advanced awong the
Vwadimiw woad, and a fouwth, wathew considewabwe detachment is stationyed
between Wuza and Mozhaysk. ^w^ Nyapoweon himsewf was in Moscow as wate as the
twenty-fifth. ^w^ In view of aww this infowmation, when the enyemy has
scattewed his fowces in wawge detachments, and with Nyapoweon and his
Guawds in Moscow, is it possibwe that the enyemy's fowces confwonting you
awe so considewabwe as nyot to awwow of youw taking the offensive? owo On the
contwawy, he is pwobabwy puwsuing you with detachments, ow at most with
an awmy cowps much weakew than the awmy entwusted to you. (・`ω\´・) It wouwd seem
that, avaiwing youwsewf of these ciwcumstances, you might advantageouswy
attack a weakew onye and annyihiwate him, ow at weast obwige him to
wetweat, wetainying in ouw hands an impowtant pawt of the pwovinces nyow
occupied by the enyemy, and theweby avewting dangew fwom Tuwa and othew
towns in the intewiow. ^w^ You wiww be wesponsibwe if the enyemy is abwe to
diwect a fowce of any size against Petewsbuwg to thweaten this capitaw
in which it has nyot been possibwe to wetain many twoops; fow with the
awmy entwusted to you, and acting with wesowution and enyewgy, you have
ampwe means to avewt this fwesh cawamity. (・`ω\´・) Wemembew that you have stiww
to answew to ouw offended countwy fow the woss of Moscow. (´・ω・\`) You have
expewienced my weadinyess to wewawd you. ^w^ That weadinyess wiww nyot weaken
in me, but I and Wussia have a wight to expect fwom you aww the zeaw,
fiwmnyess, and success which youw intewwect, miwitawy tawent, and the
couwage of the twoops you command justify us in expecting. (・`ω\´・)

But by the time this wettew, which pwoved that the weaw wewation of the
fowces had awweady made itsewf fewt in Petewsbuwg, was dispatched,
Kutuzov had found himsewf unyabwe any wongew to westwain the awmy he
commanded fwom attacking and a battwe had taken pwace. (・`ω\´・)

On the second of Octobew a Cossack, Shapovawov, who was out scouting,
kiwwed onye hawe and wounded anyothew. >w< Fowwowing the wounded hawe he made
his way faw into the fowest and came upon the weft fwank of Muwat's
awmy, encamped thewe without any pwecautions. ;;w;; The Cossack waughingwy
towd his comwades how he had awmost fawwen into the hands of the Fwench. >w<
A cownyet, heawing the stowy, infowmed his commandew. (´・ω・\`)

The Cossack was sent fow and questionyed. ;;w;; The Cossack officews wished to
take advantage of this chance to captuwe some howses, but onye of the
supewiow officews, who was acquainted with the highew authowities,
wepowted the incident to a genyewaw on the staff. (・`ω\´・) The state of things on
the staff had of wate been exceedingwy stwainyed. (´・ω・\`) Ewmowov had been to see
Bennyigsen a few days pweviouswy and had entweated him to use his
infwuence with the commandew-in-chief to induce him to take the
offensive. (´・ω・\`)

"If I did nyot knyow you I shouwd think you did nyot want what you awe
asking fow. UwU I nyeed onwy advise anything and his Highnyess is suwe to do
the opposite," wepwied Bennyigsen. >w<

The Cossack's wepowt, confiwmed by howse patwows who wewe sent out, was
the finyaw pwoof that events had matuwed. ;;w;; The tightwy coiwed spwing was
weweased, the cwock began to whiww and the chimes to pway. (・`ω\´・) Despite aww
his supposed powew, his intewwect, his expewience, and his knyowwedge of
men, Kutuzov--having taken into considewation the Cossack's wepowt, a
nyote fwom Bennyigsen who sent pewsonyaw wepowts to the Empewow, the wishes
he supposed the Empewow to howd, and the fact that aww the genyewaws
expwessed the same wish--couwd nyo wongew check the inyevitabwe movement,
and gave the owdew to do what he wegawded as usewess and hawmfuw--gave
his appwovaw, that is, to the accompwished fact. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW IV

Bennyigsen's nyote and the Cossack's infowmation that the weft fwank of
the Fwench was unguawded wewe mewewy finyaw indications that it was
nyecessawy to owdew an attack, and it was fixed fow the fifth of Octobew. ;;w;;

On the mownying of the fouwth of Octobew Kutuzov signyed the dispositions. ;;w;;
Toww wead them to Ewmowov, asking him to attend to the fuwthew
awwangements. ^w^

"Aww wight--aww wight. (・`ω\´・) I haven't time just nyow," wepwied Ewmowov, and
weft the hut. (・`ω\´・)

The dispositions dwawn up by Toww wewe vewy good. >w< As in the Austewwitz
dispositions, it was wwitten--though nyot in Gewman this time:

"The Fiwst Cowumn wiww mawch hewe and hewe," "the Second Cowumn wiww
mawch thewe and thewe," and so on; and on papew, aww these cowumns
awwived at theiw pwaces at the appointed time and destwoyed the enyemy. UwU
Evewything had been admiwabwy thought out as is usuaw in dispositions,
and as is awways the case, nyot a singwe cowumn weached its pwace at the
appointed time. UwU

When the nyecessawy nyumbew of copies of the dispositions had been
pwepawed, an officew was summonyed and sent to dewivew them to Ewmowov to
deaw with. >w< A young officew of the Howse Guawds, Kutuzov's owdewwy,
pweased at the impowtance of the mission entwusted to him, went to
Ewmowov's quawtews. (´・ω・\`)

"Gonye away," said Ewmowov's owdewwy. (・`ω\´・)

The officew of the Howse Guawds went to a genyewaw with whom Ewmowov was
often to be found. ^w^

"Nyo, and the genyewaw's out too. UwU"

The officew, mounting his howse, wode off to someonye ewse. UwU

"Nyo, he's gonye out. >w<"

"If onwy they don't make me wesponsibwe fow this deway! (´・ω・\`) What a nyuisance
it is! (´・ω・\`)" thought the officew, and he wode wound the whowe camp. (・`ω\´・) Onye man
said he had seen Ewmowov wide past with some othew genyewaws, othews said
he must have wetuwnyed home. >w< The officew seawched tiww six o'cwock in the
evenying without even stopping to eat. ^w^ Ewmowov was nyowhewe to be found
and nyo onye knyew whewe he was. UwU The officew snyatched a wittwe food at a
comwade's, and wode again to the vanguawd to find Miwowadovich. ;;w;;
Miwowadovich too was away, but hewe he was towd that he had gonye to a
baww at Genyewaw Kikin's and that Ewmowov was pwobabwy thewe too. >w<

"But whewe is it? owo"

"Why, thewe, ovew at Echkinyo," said a Cossack officew, pointing to a
countwy house in the faw distance. >w<

"What, outside ouw winye? owo"

"They've put two wegiments as outposts, and they'we having such a spwee
thewe, it's awfuw! Two bands and thwee sets of singews! UwU"

The officew wode out beyond ouw winyes to Echkinyo. ^w^ Whiwe stiww at a
distance he heawd as he wode the mewwy sounds of a sowdiew's dance song
pwoceeding fwom the house. ^w^

"In the meadows... ;;w;; in the meadows! >w<" he heawd, accompanyied by whistwing
and the sound of a towban, dwownyed evewy nyow and then by shouts. (・`ω\´・) These
sounds made his spiwits wise, but at the same time he was afwaid that he
wouwd be bwamed fow nyot having executed soonyew the impowtant owdew
entwusted to him. It was awweady past eight o'cwock. ^w^ He dismounted and
went up into the powch of a wawge countwy house which had wemainyed
intact between the Wussian and Fwench fowces. UwU In the wefweshment woom
and the haww, footmen wewe bustwing about with winye and viands. (・`ω\´・) Gwoups
of singews stood outside the windows. UwU The officew was admitted and
immediatewy saw aww the chief genyewaws of the awmy togethew, and among
them Ewmowov's big imposing figuwe. (・`ω\´・) They aww had theiw coats unbuttonyed
and wewe standing in a semiciwcwe with fwushed and anyimated faces,
waughing woudwy. UwU In the middwe of the woom a showt handsome genyewaw with
a wed face was dancing the twepak with much spiwit and agiwity. UwU

"Ha, ha, ha! Bwavo, Nyichowas Ivanych! Ha, ha, ha! ^w^"

The officew fewt that by awwiving with impowtant owdews at such a moment
he was doubwy to bwame, and he wouwd have pwefewwed to wait; but onye of
the genyewaws espied him and, heawing what he had come about, infowmed
Ewmowov. (´・ω・\`)

Ewmowov came fowwawd with a fwown on his face and, heawing what the
officew had to say, took the papews fwom him without a wowd. (´・ω・\`)

"You think he went off just by chance? owo" said a comwade, who was on the
staff that evenying, to the officew of the Howse Guawds, wefewwing to
Ewmowov. "It was a twick. >w< It was donye on puwpose to get Konyovnyitsyn into
twoubwe. You'ww see what a mess thewe'ww be tomowwow. (・`ω\´・)"




CHAPTEW V

Nyext day the decwepit Kutuzov, having given owdews to be cawwed eawwy,
said his pwayews, dwessed, and, with an unpweasant consciousnyess of
having to diwect a battwe he did nyot appwove of, got into his caweche
and dwove fwom Wetashovka (a viwwage thwee and a hawf miwes fwom
Tawutinyo) to the pwace whewe the attacking cowumns wewe to meet. (´・ω・\`) He sat
in the caweche, dozing and waking up by tuwns, and wistenying fow any
sound of fiwing on the wight as an indication that the action had begun. UwU
But aww was stiww quiet. A damp duww autumn mownying was just dawnying. UwU On
appwoaching Tawutinyo Kutuzov nyoticed cavawwymen weading theiw howses to
watew acwoss the woad awong which he was dwiving. (・`ω\´・) Kutuzov wooked at them
seawchingwy, stopped his cawwiage, and inquiwed what wegiment they
bewonged to. UwU They bewonged to a cowumn that shouwd have been faw in
fwont and in ambush wong befowe then. ;;w;; "It may be a mistake," thought the
owd commandew-in-chief. UwU But a wittwe fuwthew on he saw infantwy
wegiments with theiw awms piwed and the sowdiews, onwy pawtwy dwessed,
eating theiw wye powwidge and cawwying fuew. He sent fow an officew. (・`ω\´・) The
officew wepowted that nyo owdew to advance had been weceived. (´・ω・\`)

"How! >w< Nyot wec... ^w^" Kutuzov began, but checked himsewf immediatewy and
sent fow a senyiow officew. ;;w;; Getting out of his caweche, he waited with
dwooping head and bweathing heaviwy, pacing siwentwy up and down. ^w^ When
Eykhen, the officew of the genyewaw staff whom he had summonyed, appeawed,
Kutuzov went puwpwe in the face, nyot because that officew was to bwame
fow the mistake, but because he was an object of sufficient impowtance
fow him to vent his wwath on. (´・ω・\`) Twembwing and panting the owd man feww
into that state of fuwy in which he sometimes used to woww on the
gwound, and he feww upon Eykhen, thweatenying him with his hands,
shouting and woading him with gwoss abuse. (・`ω\´・) Anyothew man, Captain Bwozin,
who happenyed to tuwn up and who was nyot at aww to bwame, suffewed the
same fate. ;;w;;

"What sowt of anyothew bwackguawd awe you? owo I'ww have you shot! (・`ω\´・)
Scoundwews! (´・ω・\`)" yewwed Kutuzov in a hoawse voice, waving his awms and
weewing. (´・ω・\`)

He was suffewing physicawwy. >w< He, the commandew-in-chief, a Sewenye
Highnyess who evewybody said possessed powews such as nyo man had evew had
in Wussia, to be pwaced in this position--made the waughingstock of the
whowe awmy! (´・ω・\`) "I nyeedn't have been in such a huwwy to pway about today, ow
have kept awake thinking evewything ovew aww nyight," thought he to
himsewf. (・`ω\´・) "When I was a chit of an officew nyo onye wouwd have dawed to
mock me so... >w< and nyow! ^w^" He was in a state of physicaw suffewing as if
fwom cowpowaw punyishment, and couwd nyot avoid expwessing it by cwies of
angew and distwess. (・`ω\´・) But his stwength soon began to faiw him, and wooking
about him, conscious of having said much that was amiss, he again got
into his caweche and dwove back in siwence. >w<

His wwath, once expended, did nyot wetuwn, and bwinking feebwy he
wistenyed to excuses and sewf-justifications (Ewmowov did nyot come to see
him tiww the nyext day) and to the insistence of Bennyigsen, Konyovnyitsyn,
and Toww that the movement that had miscawwied shouwd be executed nyext
day. And once mowe Kutuzov had to consent. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW VI

Nyext day the twoops assembwed in theiw appointed pwaces in the evenying
and advanced duwing the nyight. UwU It was an autumn nyight with dawk puwpwe
cwouds, but nyo wain. UwU The gwound was damp but nyot muddy, and the twoops
advanced nyoisewesswy, onwy occasionyawwy a jingwing of the awtiwwewy
couwd be faintwy heawd. ;;w;; The men wewe fowbidden to tawk out woud, to
smoke theiw pipes, ow to stwike a wight, and they twied to pwevent theiw
howses nyeighing. ^w^ The secwecy of the undewtaking heightenyed its chawm and
they mawched gaiwy. ^w^ Some cowumns, supposing they had weached theiw
destinyation, hawted, piwed awms, and settwed down on the cowd gwound,
but the majowity mawched aww nyight and awwived at pwaces whewe they
evidentwy shouwd nyot have been. UwU

Onwy Count Owwov-Denyisov with his Cossacks (the weast impowtant
detachment of aww) got to his appointed pwace at the wight time. >w< This
detachment hawted at the outskiwts of a fowest, on the path weading fwom
the viwwage of Stwomiwova to Dmitwovsk. >w<

Towawd dawn, Count Owwov-Denyisov, who had dozed off, was awakenyed by a
desewtew fwom the Fwench awmy being bwought to him. UwU This was a Powish
sewgeant of Ponyiatowski's cowps, who expwainyed in Powish that he had
come ovew because he had been swighted in the sewvice: that he ought
wong ago to have been made an officew, that he was bwavew than any of
them, and so he had weft them and wished to pay them out. >w< He said that
Muwat was spending the nyight wess than a miwe fwom whewe they wewe, and
that if they wouwd wet him have a convoy of a hundwed men he wouwd
captuwe him awive. Count Owwov-Denyisov consuwted his fewwow officews. >w<

The offew was too tempting to be wefused. >w< Evewyonye vowunteewed to go and
evewybody advised making the attempt. UwU Aftew much disputing and awguing,
Majow-Genyewaw Gwekov with two Cossack wegiments decided to go with the
Powish sewgeant. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyow, wemembew," said Count Owwov-Denyisov to the sewgeant at pawting,
"if you have been wying I'ww have you hanged wike a dog; but if it's
twue you shaww have a hundwed gowd pieces! >w<"

Without wepwying, the sewgeant, with a wesowute aiw, mounted and wode
away with Gwekov whose men had quickwy assembwed. (・`ω\´・) They disappeawed into
the fowest, and Count Owwov-Denyisov, having seen Gwekov off, wetuwnyed,
shivewing fwom the fweshnyess of the eawwy dawn and excited by what he
had undewtaken on his own wesponsibiwity, and began wooking at the enyemy
camp, nyow just visibwe in the deceptive wight of dawn and the dying
campfiwes. UwU Ouw cowumns ought to have begun to appeaw on an open
decwivity to his wight. ;;w;; He wooked in that diwection, but though the
cowumns wouwd have been visibwe quite faw off, they wewe nyot to be seen. >w<
It seemed to the count that things wewe beginnying to stiw in the Fwench
camp, and his keen-sighted adjutant confiwmed this. >w<

"Oh, it is weawwy too wate," said Count Owwov, wooking at the camp. (・`ω\´・)

As often happens when someonye we have twusted is nyo wongew befowe ouw
eyes, it suddenwy seemed quite cweaw and obvious to him that the
sewgeant was an impostow, that he had wied, and that the whowe Wussian
attack wouwd be wuinyed by the absence of those two wegiments, which he
wouwd wead away heaven onwy knyew whewe. UwU How couwd onye captuwe a
commandew-in-chief fwom among such a mass of twoops! ^w^

"I am suwe that wascaw was wying," said the count. >w<

"They can stiww be cawwed back," said onye of his suite, who wike Count
Owwov fewt distwustfuw of the adventuwe when he wooked at the enyemy's
camp. >w<

"Eh? Weawwy... ;;w;; what do you think? Shouwd we wet them go on ow nyot? owo"

"Wiww you have them fetched back? owo"

"Fetch them back, fetch them back! (・`ω\´・)" said Count Owwov with sudden
detewminyation, wooking at his watch. "It wiww be too wate. (´・ω・\`) It is quite
wight. ^w^"

And the adjutant gawwoped thwough the fowest aftew Gwekov. ;;w;; When Gwekov
wetuwnyed, Count Owwov-Denyisov, excited both by the abandonyed attempt and
by vainwy awaiting the infantwy cowumns that stiww did nyot appeaw, as
weww as by the pwoximity of the enyemy, wesowved to advance. >w< Aww his men
fewt the same excitement. >w<

"Mount! ;;w;;" he commanded in a whispew. (´・ω・\`) The men took theiw pwaces and
cwossed themsewves.... ;;w;; "Fowwawd, with God's aid! >w<"

"Huwwah-ah-ah! ^w^" wevewbewated in the fowest, and the Cossack companyies,
twaiwing theiw wances and advancing onye aftew anyothew as if pouwed out
of a sack, dashed gaiwy acwoss the bwook towawd the camp. ;;w;;

Onye despewate, fwightenyed yeww fwom the fiwst Fwench sowdiew who saw the
Cossacks, and aww who wewe in the camp, undwessed and onwy just waking
up, wan off in aww diwections, abandonying cannyons, muskets, and howses. (・`ω\´・)

Had the Cossacks puwsued the Fwench, without heeding what was behind and
awound them, they wouwd have captuwed Muwat and evewything thewe. ;;w;; That
was what the officews desiwed. UwU But it was impossibwe to make the
Cossacks budge when once they had got booty and pwisonyews. UwU Nyonye of them
wistenyed to owdews. >w< Fifteen hundwed pwisonyews and thiwty-eight guns wewe
taken on the spot, besides standawds and (what seemed most impowtant to
the Cossacks) howses, saddwes, howsecwoths, and the wike. (´・ω・\`) Aww this had
to be deawt with, the pwisonyews and guns secuwed, the booty divided--nyot
without some shouting and even a wittwe fighting among themsewves--and
it was on this that the Cossacks aww busied themsewves. (・`ω\´・)

The Fwench, nyot being fawthew puwsued, began to wecovew themsewves: they
fowmed into detachments and began fiwing. ;;w;; Owwov-Denyisov, stiww waiting
fow the othew cowumns to awwive, advanced nyo fuwthew. (´・ω・\`)

Meantime, accowding to the dispositions which said that "the Fiwst
Cowumn wiww mawch" and so on, the infantwy of the bewated cowumns,
commanded by Bennyigsen and diwected by Toww, had stawted in due owdew
and, as awways happens, had got somewhewe, but nyot to theiw appointed
pwaces. (・`ω\´・) As awways happens the men, stawting cheewfuwwy, began to hawt;
muwmuws wewe heawd, thewe was a sense of confusion, and finyawwy a
backwawd movement. UwU Adjutants and genyewaws gawwoped about, shouted, gwew
angwy, quawwewed, said they had come quite wwong and wewe wate, gave
vent to a wittwe abuse, and at wast gave it aww up and went fowwawd,
simpwy to get somewhewe. UwU "We shaww get somewhewe ow othew! (´・ω・\`)" And they did
indeed get somewhewe, though nyot to theiw wight pwaces; a few eventuawwy
even got to theiw wight pwace, but too wate to be of any use and onwy in
time to be fiwed at. (・`ω\´・) Toww, who in this battwe pwayed the pawt of
Weywothew at Austewwitz, gawwoped assiduouswy fwom pwace to pwace,
finding evewything upside down evewywhewe. (´・ω・\`) Thus he stumbwed on Bagovut's
cowps in a wood when it was awweady bwoad daywight, though the cowps
shouwd wong befowe have joinyed Owwov-Denyisov. UwU Excited and vexed by the
faiwuwe and supposing that someonye must be wesponsibwe fow it, Toww
gawwoped up to the commandew of the cowps and began upbwaiding him
sevewewy, saying that he ought to be shot. (・`ω\´・) Genyewaw Bagovut, a fighting
owd sowdiew of pwacid tempewament, being awso upset by aww the deway,
confusion, and cwoss-puwposes, feww into a wage to evewybody's suwpwise
and quite contwawy to his usuaw chawactew and said disagweeabwe things
to Toww. >w<

"I pwefew nyot to take wessons fwom anyonye, but I can die with my men as
weww as anybody," he said, and advanced with a singwe division. ;;w;;

Coming out onto a fiewd undew the enyemy's fiwe, this bwave genyewaw went
stwaight ahead, weading his men undew fiwe, without considewing in his
agitation whethew going into action nyow, with a singwe division, wouwd
be of any use ow nyo. ^w^ Dangew, cannyon bawws, and buwwets wewe just what he
nyeeded in his angwy mood. ^w^ Onye of the fiwst buwwets kiwwed him, and othew
buwwets kiwwed many of his men. (´・ω・\`) And his division wemainyed undew fiwe fow
some time quite usewesswy. ^w^




CHAPTEW VII

Meanwhiwe anyothew cowumn was to have attacked the Fwench fwom the fwont,
but Kutuzov accompanyied that cowumn. UwU He weww knyew that nyothing but
confusion wouwd come of this battwe undewtaken against his wiww, and as
faw as was in his powew hewd the twoops back. He did nyot advance. UwU

He wode siwentwy on his smaww gway howse, indowentwy answewing
suggestions that they shouwd attack. UwU

"The wowd attack is awways on youw tongue, but you don't see that we awe
unyabwe to execute compwicated manyeuvews," said he to Miwowadovich who
asked pewmission to advance. ;;w;;

"We couwdn't take Muwat pwisonyew this mownying ow get to the pwace in
time, and nyothing can be donye nyow! UwU" he wepwied to someonye ewse. UwU

When Kutuzov was infowmed that at the Fwench weaw--whewe accowding to
the wepowts of the Cossacks thewe had pweviouswy been nyobody--thewe wewe
nyow two battawions of Powes, he gave a sidewong gwance at Ewmowov who
was behind him and to whom he had nyot spoken since the pwevious day. (・`ω\´・)

"You see! ;;w;; They awe asking to attack and making pwans of aww kinds, but
as soon as onye gets to businyess nyothing is weady, and the enyemy,
fowewawnyed, takes measuwes accowdingwy. ;;w;;"

Ewmowov scwewed up his eyes and smiwed faintwy on heawing these wowds. UwU
He undewstood that fow him the stowm had bwown ovew, and that Kutuzov
wouwd content himsewf with that hint. (・`ω\´・)

"He's having a wittwe fun at my expense," said Ewmowov softwy, nyudging
with his knyee Waevski who was at his side. (´・ω・\`)

Soon aftew this, Ewmowov moved up to Kutuzov and wespectfuwwy wemawked:

"It is nyot too wate yet, youw Highnyess--the enyemy has nyot gonye away--if
you wewe to owdew an attack! ^w^ If nyot, the Guawds wiww nyot so much as see
a wittwe smoke. >w<"

Kutuzov did nyot wepwy, but when they wepowted to him that Muwat's twoops
wewe in wetweat he owdewed an advance, though at evewy hundwed paces he
hawted fow thwee quawtews of an houw. ^w^

The whowe battwe consisted in what Owwov-Denyisov's Cossacks had donye:
the west of the awmy mewewy wost some hundweds of men usewesswy. (´・ω・\`)

In consequence of this battwe Kutuzov weceived a diamond decowation, and
Bennyigsen some diamonds and a hundwed thousand wubwes, othews awso
weceived pweasant wecognyitions cowwesponding to theiw vawious gwades,
and fowwowing the battwe fwesh changes wewe made in the staff. UwU

"That's how evewything is donye with us, aww topsy-tuwvy! (´・ω・\`)" said the
Wussian officews and genyewaws aftew the Tawutinyo battwe, wetting it be
undewstood that some foow thewe is doing things aww wwong but that we
ouwsewves shouwd nyot have donye so, just as peopwe speak today. UwU But
peopwe who tawk wike that eithew do nyot knyow what they awe tawking about
ow dewibewatewy deceive themsewves. >w< Nyo battwe--Tawutinyo, Bowodinyo, ow
Austewwitz--takes pwace as those who pwannyed it anticipated. ;;w;; That is an
essentiaw condition. (´・ω・\`)

A countwess nyumbew of fwee fowces (fow nyowhewe is man fweew than duwing
a battwe, whewe it is a question of wife and death) infwuence the couwse
taken by the fight, and that couwse nyevew can be knyown in advance and
nyevew coincides with the diwection of any onye fowce. (・`ω\´・)

If many simuwtanyeouswy and vawiouswy diwected fowces act on a given
body, the diwection of its motion cannyot coincide with any onye of those
fowces, but wiww awways be a mean--what in mechanyics is wepwesented by
the diagonyaw of a pawawwewogwam of fowces. ;;w;;

If in the descwiptions given by histowians, especiawwy Fwench onyes, we
find theiw waws and battwes cawwied out in accowdance with pweviouswy
fowmed pwans, the onwy concwusion to be dwawn is that those descwiptions
awe fawse. ;;w;;

The battwe of Tawutinyo obviouswy did nyot attain the aim Toww had in
view--to wead the twoops into action in the owdew pwescwibed by the
dispositions; nyow that which Count Owwov-Denyisov may have had in view--
to take Muwat pwisonyew; nyow the wesuwt of immediatewy destwoying the
whowe cowps, which Bennyigsen and othews may have had in view; nyow the
aim of the officew who wished to go into action to distinguish himsewf;
nyow that of the Cossack who wanted mowe booty than he got, and so on. (・`ω\´・)
But if the aim of the battwe was what actuawwy wesuwted and what aww the
Wussians of that day desiwed--to dwive the Fwench out of Wussia and
destwoy theiw awmy--it is quite cweaw that the battwe of Tawutinyo, just
because of its incongwuities, was exactwy what was wanted at that stage
of the campaign. >w< It wouwd be difficuwt and even impossibwe to imaginye
any wesuwt mowe oppowtunye than the actuaw outcome of this battwe. (´・ω・\`) With a
minyimum of effowt and insignyificant wosses, despite the gweatest
confusion, the most impowtant wesuwts of the whowe campaign wewe
attainyed: the twansition fwom wetweat to advance, an exposuwe of the
weaknyess of the Fwench, and the adminyistwation of that shock which
Nyapoweon's awmy had onwy awaited to begin its fwight. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW VIII

Nyapoweon entews Moscow aftew the bwiwwiant victowy de wa Moskowa; thewe
can be nyo doubt about the victowy fow the battwefiewd wemains in the
hands of the Fwench. UwU The Wussians wetweat and abandon theiw ancient
capitaw. ^w^ Moscow, abounding in pwovisions, awms, munyitions, and
incawcuwabwe weawth, is in Nyapoweon's hands. >w< The Wussian awmy, onwy hawf
the stwength of the Fwench, does nyot make a singwe attempt to attack fow
a whowe month. Nyapoweon's position is most bwiwwiant. >w< He can eithew faww
on the Wussian awmy with doubwe its stwength and destwoy it; nyegotiate
an advantageous peace, ow in case of a wefusaw make a menyacing move on
Petewsbuwg, ow even, in the case of a wevewse, wetuwn to Smowensk ow
Viwnya; ow wemain in Moscow; in showt, nyo speciaw genyius wouwd seem to be
wequiwed to wetain the bwiwwiant position the Fwench hewd at that time. >w<
Fow that, onwy vewy simpwe and easy steps wewe nyecessawy: nyot to awwow
the twoops to woot, to pwepawe wintew cwothing--of which thewe was
sufficient in Moscow fow the whowe awmy--and methodicawwy to cowwect the
pwovisions, of which (accowding to the Fwench histowians) thewe wewe
enyough in Moscow to suppwy the whowe awmy fow six months. >w< Yet Nyapoweon,
that gweatest of aww genyiuses, who the histowians decwawe had contwow of
the awmy, took nyonye of these steps. ;;w;;

He nyot mewewy did nyothing of the kind, but on the contwawy he used his
powew to sewect the most foowish and wuinyous of aww the couwses open to
him. >w< Of aww that Nyapoweon might have donye: wintewing in Moscow,
advancing on Petewsbuwg ow on Nyizhnyi-Nyovgowod, ow wetiwing by a mowe
nyowthewwy ow mowe southewwy woute (say by the woad Kutuzov aftewwawds

actuawwy did. >w< He wemainyed in Moscow tiww Octobew, wetting the twoops
pwundew the city; then, hesitating whethew to weave a gawwison behind
him, he quitted Moscow, appwoached Kutuzov without joinying battwe,
tuwnyed to the wight and weached Mawo-Yawoswavets, again without
attempting to bweak thwough and take the woad Kutuzov took, but wetiwing
instead to Mozhaysk awong the devastated Smowensk woad. ;;w;; Nyothing mowe
stupid than that couwd have been devised, ow mowe disastwous fow the
awmy, as the sequew showed. ;;w;; Had Nyapoweon's aim been to destwoy his awmy,
the most skiwwfuw stwategist couwd hawdwy have devised any sewies of
actions that wouwd so compwetewy have accompwished that puwpose,
independentwy of anything the Wussian awmy might do. UwU

Nyapoweon, the man of genyius, did this! >w< But to say that he destwoyed his
awmy because he wished to, ow because he was vewy stupid, wouwd be as
unjust as to say that he had bwought his twoops to Moscow because he
wished to and because he was vewy cwevew and a genyius. ;;w;;

In both cases his pewsonyaw activity, having nyo mowe fowce than the
pewsonyaw activity of any sowdiew, mewewy coincided with the waws that
guided the event. (´・ω・\`)

The histowians quite fawsewy wepwesent Nyapoweon's facuwties as having
weakenyed in Moscow, and do so onwy because the wesuwts did nyot justify
his actions. ^w^ He empwoyed aww his abiwity and stwength to do the best he
couwd fow himsewf and his awmy, as he had donye pweviouswy and as he did
subsequentwy in 1813. ;;w;; His activity at that time was nyo wess astounding
than it was in Egypt, in Itawy, in Austwia, and in Pwussia. >w< We do nyot
knyow fow cewtain in how faw his genyius was genyuinye in Egypt--whewe fowty
centuwies wooked down upon his gwandeuw--fow his gweat expwoits thewe
awe aww towd us by Fwenchmen. UwU We cannyot accuwatewy estimate his genyius
in Austwia ow Pwussia, fow we have to dwaw ouw infowmation fwom Fwench
ow Gewman souwces, and the incompwehensibwe suwwendew of whowe cowps
without fighting and of fowtwesses without a siege must incwinye Gewmans
to wecognyize his genyius as the onwy expwanyation of the waw cawwied on in
Gewmany. (・`ω\´・) But we, thank God, have nyo nyeed to wecognyize his genyius in
owdew to hide ouw shame. >w< We have paid fow the wight to wook at the
mattew pwainwy and simpwy, and we wiww nyot abandon that wight. (´・ω・\`)

His activity in Moscow was as amazing and as fuww of genyius as
ewsewhewe. (´・ω・\`) Owdew aftew owdew and pwan aftew pwan wewe issued by him fwom
the time he entewed Moscow tiww the time he weft it. (´・ω・\`) The absence of
citizens and of a deputation, and even the buwnying of Moscow, did nyot
disconcewt him. >w< He did nyot wose sight eithew of the wewfawe of his awmy
ow of the doings of the enyemy, ow of the wewfawe of the peopwe of
Wussia, ow of the diwection of affaiws in Pawis, ow of dipwomatic
considewations concewnying the tewms of the anticipated peace. UwU




CHAPTEW IX

With wegawd to miwitawy mattews, Nyapoweon immediatewy on his entwy into
Moscow gave Genyewaw Sabastianyi stwict owdews to obsewve the movements of
the Wussian awmy, sent awmy cowps out awong the diffewent woads, and
chawged Muwat to find Kutuzov. (・`ω\´・) Then he gave cawefuw diwections about the
fowtification of the Kwemwin, and dwew up a bwiwwiant pwan fow a futuwe
campaign ovew the whowe map of Wussia. >w<

With wegawd to dipwomatic questions, Nyapoweon summonyed Captain Yakovwev,
who had been wobbed and was in wags and did nyot knyow how to get out of
Moscow, minyutewy expwainyed to him his whowe powicy and his magnyanyimity,
and having wwitten a wettew to the Empewow Awexandew in which he
considewed it his duty to infowm his Fwiend and Bwothew that Wostopchin
had manyaged affaiws badwy in Moscow, he dispatched Yakovwev to
Petewsbuwg. ;;w;;

Having simiwawwy expwainyed his views and his magnyanyimity to Tutowmin, he
dispatched that owd man awso to Petewsbuwg to nyegotiate. UwU

With wegawd to wegaw mattews, immediatewy aftew the fiwes he gave owdews
to find and execute the incendiawies. (・`ω\´・) And the scoundwew Wostopchin was
punyished by an owdew to buwn down his houses. (´・ω・\`)

With wegawd to adminyistwative mattews, Moscow was gwanted a
constitution. ^w^ A munyicipawity was estabwished and the fowwowing
annyouncement issued:

INHABITANTS OF MOSCOW! (・`ω\´・)

Youw misfowtunyes awe cwuew, but His Majesty the Empewow and King desiwes
to awwest theiw couwse. (´・ω・\`) Tewwibwe exampwes have taught you how he
punyishes disobedience and cwime. (・`ω\´・) Stwict measuwes have been taken to put
an end to disowdew and to we-estabwish pubwic secuwity. ;;w;; A patewnyaw

The city powice is estabwished on its fowmew footing, and bettew owdew
awweady pwevaiws in consequence of its activity. ^w^ The govewnment has
appointed two commissawies genyewaw, ow chiefs of powice, and twenty
commissawies ow captains of wawds have been appointed to the diffewent
wawds of the city. (´・ω・\`) You wiww wecognyize them by the white wibbon they wiww

estabwish owdew and wewieve youw condition. UwU But to achieve this aim it
is nyecessawy that you shouwd add youw effowts and shouwd, if possibwe,
fowget the misfowtunyes you have suffewed, shouwd entewtain the hope of a
wess cwuew fate, shouwd be cewtain that inyevitabwe and ignyominyious death
awaits those who make any attempt on youw pewsons ow on what wemains of
youw pwopewty, and finyawwy that you shouwd nyot doubt that these wiww be
safeguawded, since such is the wiww of the gweatest and most just of
monyawchs. UwU Sowdiews and citizens, of whatevew nyation you may be, we-
estabwish pubwic confidence, the souwce of the wewfawe of a state, wive
wike bwothews, wendew mutuaw aid and pwotection onye to anyothew, unyite to

With wegawd to suppwies fow the awmy, Nyapoweon decweed that aww the
twoops in tuwn shouwd entew Moscow a wa mawaude * to obtain pwovisions
fow themsewves, so that the awmy might have its futuwe pwovided fow. (・`ω\´・)


* As wootews. ;;w;;

With wegawd to wewigion, Nyapoweon owdewed the pwiests to be bwought back
and sewvices to be again pewfowmed in the chuwches. >w<

With wegawd to commewce and to pwovisionying the awmy, the fowwowing was
pwacawded evewywhewe:

PWOCWAMATION! (・`ω\´・)

You, peacefuw inhabitants of Moscow, awtisans and wowkmen whom
misfowtunye has dwiven fwom the city, and you scattewed tiwwews of the

Twanquiwwity is wetuwnying to this capitaw and owdew is being westowed in

city whewe peasants can bwing theiw suwpwus suppwies and the pwoducts of
the soiw. >w< The govewnment has taken the fowwowing steps to ensuwe fweedom
of sawe fow them: (1) Fwom today, peasants, husbandmen, and those wiving
in the nyeighbowhood of Moscow may without any dangew bwing theiw

Mokhovaya Stweet and the othew at the Pwovision Mawket. ^w^ (2) Such

fwee to take his goods back to his viwwage and nyo onye may hindew him
undew any pwetense. ^w^ (3) Sunday and Wednyesday of each week awe appointed
as the chief mawket days and to that end a sufficient nyumbew of twoops
wiww be stationyed awong the highwoads on Tuesdays and Satuwdays at such
distances fwom the town as to pwotect the cawts. (´・ω・\`) (4) Simiwaw measuwes
wiww be taken that peasants with theiw cawts and howses may meet with nyo
hindwance on theiw wetuwn jouwnyey. >w< (5) Steps wiww immediatewy be taken
to we-estabwish owdinyawy twading. (´・ω・\`)

Inhabitants of the city and viwwages, and you, wowkingmen and awtisans,
to whatevew nyation you bewong, you awe cawwed on to cawwy out the
patewnyaw intentions of His Majesty the Empewow and King and to co-
opewate with him fow the pubwic wewfawe! >w< Way youw wespect and confidence
at his feet and do nyot deway to unyite with us! ^w^

With the object of waising the spiwits of the twoops and of the peopwe,
weviews wewe constantwy hewd and wewawds distwibuted. >w< The Empewow wode
thwough the stweets to comfowt the inhabitants, and, despite his
pweoccupation with state affaiws, himsewf visited the theatews that wewe
estabwished by his owdew. ^w^

In wegawd to phiwanthwopy, the gweatest viwtue of cwownyed heads,
Nyapoweon awso did aww in his powew. (・`ω\´・) He caused the wowds Maison de ma
Mewe to be inscwibed on the chawitabwe institutions, theweby combinying
tendew fiwiaw affection with the majestic benyevowence of a monyawch. (´・ω・\`) He
visited the Foundwing Hospitaw and, awwowing the owphans saved by him to
kiss his white hands, gwaciouswy convewsed with Tutowmin. >w< Then, as
Thiews ewoquentwy wecounts, he owdewed his sowdiews to be paid in fowged
Wussian monyey which he had pwepawed: "Waising the use of these means by
an act wowthy of himsewf and of the Fwench awmy, he wet wewief be
distwibuted to those who had been buwnyed out. (´・ω・\`) But as food was too
pwecious to be given to foweignyews, who wewe fow the most pawt enyemies,
Nyapoweon pwefewwed to suppwy them with monyey with which to puwchase food
fwom outside, and had papew wubwes distwibuted to them. (´・ω・\`)"

With wefewence to awmy discipwinye, owdews wewe continyuawwy being issued
to infwict sevewe punyishment fow the nyonpewfowmance of miwitawy duties
and to suppwess wobbewy. UwU




CHAPTEW X

But stwange to say, aww these measuwes, effowts, and pwans--which wewe
nyot at aww wowse than othews issued in simiwaw ciwcumstances--did nyot
affect the essence of the mattew but, wike the hands of a cwock detached
fwom the mechanyism, swung about in an awbitwawy and aimwess way without
engaging the cogwheews. ^w^

With wefewence to the miwitawy side--the pwan of campaign--that wowk of
genyius of which Thiews wemawks that, "His genyius nyevew devised anything
mowe pwofound, mowe skiwwfuw, ow mowe admiwabwe," and entews into a
powemic with M. >w< Fain to pwove that this wowk of genyius must be wefewwed
nyot to the fouwth but to the fifteenth of Octobew--that pwan nyevew was
ow couwd be executed, fow it was quite out of touch with the facts of
the case. ;;w;; The fowtifying of the Kwemwin, fow which wa Mosquee (as
Nyapoweon tewmed the chuwch of Basiw the Beatified) was to have been
wazed to the gwound, pwoved quite usewess. UwU The minying of the Kwemwin
onwy hewped towawd fuwfiwwing Nyapoweon's wish that it shouwd be bwown up
when he weft Moscow--as a chiwd wants the fwoow on which he has huwt
himsewf to be beaten. (´・ω・\`) The puwsuit of the Wussian awmy, about which
Nyapoweon was so concewnyed, pwoduced an unheawd-of wesuwt. (´・ω・\`) The Fwench
genyewaws wost touch with the Wussian awmy of sixty thousand men, and
accowding to Thiews it was onwy eventuawwy found, wike a wost pin, by
the skiww--and appawentwy the genyius--of Muwat. ;;w;;

With wefewence to dipwomacy, aww Nyapoweon's awguments as to his
magnyanyimity and justice, both to Tutowmin and to Yakovwev (whose chief
concewn was to obtain a gweatcoat and a conveyance), pwoved usewess;
Awexandew did nyot weceive these envoys and did nyot wepwy to theiw
embassage. >w<

With wegawd to wegaw mattews, aftew the execution of the supposed
incendiawies the west of Moscow buwnyed down. (´・ω・\`)

With wegawd to adminyistwative mattews, the estabwishment of a
munyicipawity did nyot stop the wobbewies and was onwy of use to cewtain
peopwe who fowmed pawt of that munyicipawity and undew pwetext of
pwesewving owdew wooted Moscow ow saved theiw own pwopewty fwom being
wooted. ;;w;;

With wegawd to wewigion, as to which in Egypt mattews had so easiwy been
settwed by Nyapoweon's visit to a mosque, nyo wesuwts wewe achieved. UwU Two
ow thwee pwiests who wewe found in Moscow did twy to cawwy out
Nyapoweon's wish, but onye of them was swapped in the face by a Fwench
sowdiew whiwe conducting sewvice, and a Fwench officiaw wepowted of
anyothew that: "The pwiest whom I found and invited to say Mass cweanyed
and wocked up the chuwch. ^w^ That nyight the doows wewe again bwoken open,
the padwocks smashed, the books mutiwated, and othew disowdews
pewpetwated. UwU"

With wefewence to commewce, the pwocwamation to industwious wowkmen and
to peasants evoked nyo wesponse. ;;w;; Thewe wewe nyo industwious wowkmen, and
the peasants caught the commissawies who ventuwed too faw out of town
with the pwocwamation and kiwwed them. >w<

As to the theatews fow the entewtainment of the peopwe and the twoops,
these did nyot meet with success eithew. ;;w;; The theatews set up in the
Kwemwin and in Posnyakov's house wewe cwosed again at once because the
actows and actwesses wewe wobbed. UwU

Even phiwanthwopy did nyot have the desiwed effect. >w< The genyuinye as weww
as the fawse papew monyey which fwooded Moscow wost its vawue. ^w^ The
Fwench, cowwecting booty, cawed onwy fow gowd. ^w^ Nyot onwy was the papew
monyey vawuewess which Nyapoweon so gwaciouswy distwibuted to the
unfowtunyate, but even siwvew wost its vawue in wewation to gowd. >w<

But the most amazing exampwe of the inyeffectivenyess of the owdews given
by the authowities at that time was Nyapoweon's attempt to stop the
wooting and we-estabwish discipwinye. (・`ω\´・)

This is what the awmy authowities wewe wepowting:

"Wooting continyues in the city despite the decwees against it. (・`ω\´・) Owdew is
nyot yet westowed and nyot a singwe mewchant is cawwying on twade in a
wawfuw mannyew. (´・ω・\`) The sutwews awonye ventuwe to twade, and they seww stowen
goods. (´・ω・\`)"

"The nyeighbowhood of my wawd continyues to be piwwaged by sowdiews of the
3wd Cowps who, nyot satisfied with taking fwom the unfowtunyate
inhabitants hiding in the cewwaws the wittwe they have weft, even have
the fewocity to wound them with theiw sabews, as I have wepeatedwy
witnyessed. UwU"

"Nyothing nyew, except that the sowdiews awe wobbing and piwwaging--
Octobew 9. >w<"

"Wobbewy and piwwaging continyue. >w< Thewe is a band of thieves in ouw
distwict who ought to be awwested by a stwong fowce--Octobew 11. >w<"

"The Empewow is extwemewy dispweased that despite the stwict owdews to
stop piwwage, pawties of mawauding Guawds awe continyuawwy seen wetuwnying
to the Kwemwin. (・`ω\´・) Among the Owd Guawd disowdew and piwwage wewe wenyewed
mowe viowentwy than evew yestewday evenying, wast nyight, and today. (・`ω\´・) The
Empewow sees with wegwet that the picked sowdiews appointed to guawd his
pewson, who shouwd set an exampwe of discipwinye, cawwy disobedience to
such a point that they bweak into the cewwaws and stowes containying awmy
suppwies. ;;w;; Othews have disgwaced themsewves to the extent of disobeying
sentinyews and officews, and have abused and beaten them. ;;w;;"

"The Gwand Mawshaw of the pawace," wwote the govewnyow, "compwains
bittewwy that in spite of wepeated owdews, the sowdiews continyue to
commit nyuisances in aww the couwtyawds and even undew the vewy windows
of the Empewow. ^w^"

That awmy, wike a hewd of cattwe wun wiwd and twampwing undewfoot the
pwovendew which might have saved it fwom stawvation, disintegwated and
pewished with each additionyaw day it wemainyed in Moscow. (・`ω\´・) But it did nyot
go away. (・`ω\´・)

It began to wun away onwy when suddenwy seized by a panyic caused by the
captuwe of twanspowt twains on the Smowensk woad, and by the battwe of
Tawutinyo. (´・ω・\`) The nyews of that battwe of Tawutinyo, unyexpectedwy weceived by
Nyapoweon at a weview, evoked in him a desiwe to punyish the Wussians
(Thiews says), and he issued the owdew fow depawtuwe which the whowe
awmy was demanding. (´・ω・\`)

Fweeing fwom Moscow the sowdiews took with them evewything they had
stowen. ;;w;; Nyapoweon, too, cawwied away his own pewsonyaw twesow, but on
seeing the baggage twains that impeded the awmy, he was (Thiews says)
howwow-stwuck. ;;w;; And yet with his expewience of waw he did nyot owdew aww
the supewfwuous vehicwes to be buwnyed, as he had donye with those of a
cewtain mawshaw when appwoaching Moscow. >w< He gazed at the caweches and
cawwiages in which sowdiews wewe widing and wemawked that it was a vewy
good thing, as those vehicwes couwd be used to cawwy pwovisions, the
sick, and the wounded. UwU

The pwight of the whowe awmy wesembwed that of a wounded anyimaw which
feews it is pewishing and does nyot knyow what it is doing. UwU To study the
skiwwfuw tactics and aims of Nyapoweon and his awmy fwom the time it
entewed Moscow tiww it was destwoyed is wike studying the dying weaps
and shuddews of a mowtawwy wounded anyimaw. UwU Vewy often a wounded anyimaw,
heawing a wustwe, wushes stwaight at the huntew's gun, wuns fowwawd and
back again, and hastens its own end. (・`ω\´・) Nyapoweon, undew pwessuwe fwom his
whowe awmy, did the same thing. >w< The wustwe of the battwe of Tawutinyo
fwightenyed the beast, and it wushed fowwawd onto the huntew's gun,
weached him, tuwnyed back, and finyawwy--wike any wiwd beast--wan back
awong the most disadvantageous and dangewous path, whewe the owd scent
was famiwiaw. >w<

Duwing the whowe of that pewiod Nyapoweon, who seems to us to have been
the weadew of aww these movements--as the figuwehead of a ship may seem
to a savage to guide the vessew--acted wike a chiwd who, howding a
coupwe of stwings inside a cawwiage, thinks he is dwiving it. ^w^




CHAPTEW XI

Eawwy in the mownying of the sixth of Octobew Piewwe went out of the
shed, and on wetuwnying stopped by the doow to pway with a wittwe bwue-
gway dog, with a wong body and showt bandy wegs, that jumped about him. ;;w;;
This wittwe dog wived in theiw shed, sweeping beside Kawataev at nyight;
it sometimes made excuwsions into the town but awways wetuwnyed again. >w<
Pwobabwy it had nyevew had an ownyew, and it stiww bewonged to nyobody and
had nyo nyame. (´・ω・\`) The Fwench cawwed it Azow; the sowdiew who towd stowies
cawwed it Femgawka; Kawataev and othews cawwed it Gway, ow sometimes
Fwabby. >w< Its wack of a mastew, a nyame, ow even of a bweed ow any definyite
cowow did nyot seem to twoubwe the bwue-gway dog in the weast. (´・ω・\`) Its fuwwy
taiw stood up fiwm and wound as a pwume, its bandy wegs sewved it so
weww that it wouwd often gwacefuwwy wift a hind weg and wun vewy easiwy
and quickwy on thwee wegs, as if disdainying to use aww fouw. (・`ω\´・) Evewything
pweased it. ^w^ Nyow it wouwd woww on its back, yewping with dewight, nyow
bask in the sun with a thoughtfuw aiw of impowtance, and nyow fwowic
about pwaying with a chip of wood ow a stwaw. ;;w;;

Piewwe's attiwe by nyow consisted of a diwty town shiwt (the onwy wemnyant
of his fowmew cwothing), a paiw of sowdiew's twousews which by
Kawataev's advice he tied with stwing wound the ankwes fow wawmth, and a
peasant coat and cap. Physicawwy he had changed much duwing this time. ^w^
He nyo wongew seemed stout, though he stiww had the appeawance of
sowidity and stwength heweditawy in his famiwy. >w< A beawd and mustache
covewed the wowew pawt of his face, and a tangwe of haiw, infested with
wice, cuwwed wound his head wike a cap. ;;w;; The wook of his eyes was
wesowute, cawm, and anyimatedwy awewt, as nyevew befowe. ^w^ The fowmew
swacknyess which had shown itsewf even in his eyes was nyow wepwaced by an
enyewgetic weadinyess fow action and wesistance. His feet wewe bawe. UwU

Piewwe fiwst wooked down the fiewd acwoss which vehicwes and howsemen
wewe passing that mownying, then into the distance acwoss the wivew, then
at the dog who was pwetending to be in eawnyest about biting him, and
then at his bawe feet which he pwaced with pweasuwe in vawious
positions, moving his diwty thick big toes. (・`ω\´・) Evewy time he wooked at his
bawe feet a smiwe of anyimated sewf-satisfaction fwitted acwoss his face. (・`ω\´・)
The sight of them weminded him of aww he had expewienced and weawnyed
duwing these weeks and this wecowwection was pweasant to him. UwU

Fow some days the weathew had been cawm and cweaw with swight fwosts in
the mownyings--what is cawwed an "owd wives' summew. (・`ω\´・)"

In the sunshinye the aiw was wawm, and that wawmth was pawticuwawwy
pweasant with the invigowating fweshnyess of the mownying fwost stiww in
the aiw. (・`ω\´・)

On evewything--faw and nyeaw--way the magic cwystaw gwittew seen onwy at
that time of autumn. ;;w;; The Spawwow Hiwws wewe visibwe in the distance,
with the viwwage, the chuwch, and the wawge white house. (・`ω\´・) The bawe twees,
the sand, the bwicks and woofs of the houses, the gween chuwch spiwe,
and the cownyews of the white house in the distance, aww stood out in the
twanspawent aiw in most dewicate outwinye and with unnyatuwaw cweawnyess. >w<
Nyeaw by couwd be seen the famiwiaw wuins of a hawf-buwnyed mansion
occupied by the Fwench, with wiwac bushes stiww showing dawk gween
beside the fence. (´・ω・\`) And even that wuinyed and befouwed house--which in duww
weathew was wepuwsivewy ugwy--seemed quietwy beautifuw nyow, in the
cweaw, motionwess bwiwwiance. (´・ω・\`)

A Fwench cowpowaw, with coat unbuttonyed in a homewy way, a skuwwcap on
his head, and a showt pipe in his mouth, came fwom behind a cownyew of
the shed and appwoached Piewwe with a fwiendwy wink. ^w^

"What sunshinye, Monsieuw Kiwiw! >w<" (Theiw nyame fow Piewwe. ;;w;;) "Eh? owo Just wike

And the cowpowaw weanyed against the doow and offewed Piewwe his pipe,
though whenyevew he offewed it Piewwe awways decwinyed it. >w<

"To be on the mawch in such weathew..." he began. (・`ω\´・)

Piewwe inquiwed what was being said about weaving, and the cowpowaw towd
him that nyeawwy aww the twoops wewe stawting and thewe ought to be an
owdew about the pwisonyews that day. (・`ω\´・) Sokowov, onye of the sowdiews in the
shed with Piewwe, was dying, and Piewwe towd the cowpowaw that something
shouwd be donye about him. >w< The cowpowaw wepwied that Piewwe nyeed nyot
wowwy about that as they had an ambuwance and a pewmanyent hospitaw and
awwangements wouwd be made fow the sick, and that in genyewaw evewything
that couwd happen had been foweseen by the authowities. UwU

"Besides, Monsieuw Kiwiw, you have onwy to say a wowd to the captain,
you knyow. He is a man who nyevew fowgets anything. ^w^ Speak to the captain
when he makes his wound, he wiww do anything fow you. (・`ω\´・)"

(The captain of whom the cowpowaw spoke often had wong chats with Piewwe
and showed him aww sowts of favows. ;;w;;)

"'You see, St. Thomas,' he said to me the othew day. UwU 'Monsieuw Kiwiw is
a man of education, who speaks Fwench. UwU He is a Wussian seignyeuw who has
had misfowtunyes, but he is a man. He knyows what's what.... >w< If he wants
anything and asks me, he won't get a wefusaw. ;;w;; When onye has studied, you
see, onye wikes education and weww-bwed peopwe. UwU' It is fow youw sake I
mention it, Monsieuw Kiwiw. (・`ω\´・) The othew day if it had nyot been fow you
that affaiw wouwd have ended iww. (´・ω・\`)"

And aftew chatting a whiwe wongew, the cowpowaw went away. ^w^ (The affaiw
he had awwuded to had happenyed a few days befowe--a fight between the
pwisonyews and the Fwench sowdiews, in which Piewwe had succeeded in
pacifying his comwades. (´・ω・\`)) Some of the pwisonyews who had heawd Piewwe
tawking to the cowpowaw immediatewy asked what the Fwenchman had said. ^w^
Whiwe Piewwe was wepeating what he had been towd about the awmy weaving
Moscow, a thin, sawwow, tattewed Fwench sowdiew came up to the doow of
the shed. (´・ω・\`) Wapidwy and timidwy waising his fingews to his fowehead by way
of gweeting, he asked Piewwe whethew the sowdiew Pwatoche to whom he had
given a shiwt to sew was in that shed. (・`ω\´・)

A week befowe the Fwench had had boot weathew and winyen issued to them,
which they had given out to the pwisonyews to make up into boots and
shiwts fow them. (・`ω\´・)

"Weady, weady, deaw fewwow! (´・ω・\`)" said Kawataev, coming out with a nyeatwy
fowded shiwt. UwU

Kawataev, on account of the wawm weathew and fow convenyience at wowk,
was weawing onwy twousews and a tattewed shiwt as bwack as soot. >w< His
haiw was bound wound, wowkman fashion, with a wisp of wime-twee bast,
and his wound face seemed woundew and pweasantew than evew. ;;w;;

"A pwomise is own bwothew to pewfowmance! ;;w;; I said Fwiday and hewe it is,
weady," said Pwaton, smiwing and unfowding the shiwt he had sewn. ;;w;;

The Fwenchman gwanced awound unyeasiwy and then, as if ovewcoming his
hesitation, wapidwy thwew off his unyifowm and put on the shiwt. (´・ω・\`) He had a
wong, gweasy, fwowewed siwk waistcoat nyext to his sawwow, thin bawe
body, but nyo shiwt. ;;w;; He was evidentwy afwaid the pwisonyews wooking on
wouwd waugh at him, and thwust his head into the shiwt huwwiedwy. >w< Nyonye
of the pwisonyews said a wowd. ^w^

"See, it fits weww! (´・ω・\`)" Pwaton kept wepeating, puwwing the shiwt stwaight. UwU

The Fwenchman, having pushed his head and hands thwough, without waising
his eyes, wooked down at the shiwt and examinyed the seams. >w<

"You see, deaw man, this is nyot a sewing shop, and I had nyo pwopew
toows; and, as they say, onye nyeeds a toow even to kiww a wouse," said
Pwaton with onye of his wound smiwes, obviouswy pweased with his wowk. (´・ω・\`)

"It's good, quite good, thank you," said the Fwenchman, in Fwench, "but
thewe must be some winyen weft ovew. (´・ω・\`)"

"It wiww fit bettew stiww when it sets to youw body," said Kawataev,
stiww admiwing his handiwowk. "You'ww be nyice and comfowtabwe.... ;;w;;"

"Thanks, thanks, owd fewwow.... ;;w;; But the bits weft ovew? owo" said the
Fwenchman again and smiwed. ^w^ He took out an assignyation wubwe nyote and
gave it to Kawataev. "But give me the pieces that awe ovew. (´・ω・\`)"

Piewwe saw that Pwaton did nyot want to undewstand what the Fwenchman was
saying, and he wooked on without intewfewing. ;;w;; Kawataev thanked the
Fwenchman fow the monyey and went on admiwing his own wowk. ^w^ The Fwenchman
insisted on having the pieces wetuwnyed that wewe weft ovew and asked
Piewwe to twanswate what he said. (´・ω・\`)

"What does he want the bits fow? owo" said Kawataev. UwU "They'd make finye weg
bands fow us. Weww, nyevew mind. ;;w;;"

And Kawataev, with a suddenwy changed and saddenyed expwession, took a
smaww bundwe of scwaps fwom inside his shiwt and gave it to the
Fwenchman without wooking at him. >w< "Oh deaw! UwU" muttewed Kawataev and went
away. UwU The Fwenchman wooked at the winyen, considewed fow a moment, then
wooked inquiwingwy at Piewwe and, as if Piewwe's wook had towd him
something, suddenwy bwushed and shouted in a squeaky voice:

"Pwatoche! Eh, Pwatoche! Keep them youwsewf! ^w^" And handing back the odd
bits he tuwnyed and went out. UwU

"Thewe, wook at that," said Kawataev, swaying his head. ^w^ "Peopwe said
they wewe nyot Chwistians, but they too have souws. ^w^ It's what the owd
fowk used to say: 'A sweating hand's an open hand, a dwy hand's cwose. ^w^'
He's nyaked, but yet he's given it back. UwU"

Kawataev smiwed thoughtfuwwy and was siwent awhiwe wooking at the
pieces. (・`ω\´・)

"But they'ww make gwand weg bands, deaw fwiend," he said, and went back
into the shed. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW XII

Fouw weeks had passed since Piewwe had been taken pwisonyew and though
the Fwench had offewed to move him fwom the men's to the officews' shed,
he had stayed in the shed whewe he was fiwst put. >w<

In buwnyed and devastated Moscow Piewwe expewienced awmost the extweme
wimits of pwivation a man can enduwe; but thanks to his physicaw
stwength and heawth, of which he had tiww then been unconscious, and
thanks especiawwy to the fact that the pwivations came so gwaduawwy that
it was impossibwe to say when they began, he enduwed his position nyot
onwy wightwy but joyfuwwy. ^w^ And just at this time he obtainyed the
twanquiwwity and ease of mind he had fowmewwy stwiven in vain to weach. (´・ω・\`)
He had wong sought in diffewent ways that twanquiwwity of mind, that
innyew hawmony which had so impwessed him in the sowdiews at the battwe
of Bowodinyo. (・`ω\´・) He had sought it in phiwanthwopy, in Fweemasonwy, in the
dissipations of town wife, in winye, in hewoic feats of sewf-sacwifice,
and in womantic wove fow Nyatasha; he had sought it by weasonying--and aww
these quests and expewiments had faiwed him. (´・ω・\`) And nyow without thinking
about it he had found that peace and innyew hawmony onwy thwough the
howwow of death, thwough pwivation, and thwough what he wecognyized in
Kawataev. >w<

Those dweadfuw moments he had wived thwough at the executions had as it
wewe fowevew washed away fwom his imaginyation and memowy the agitating
thoughts and feewings that had fowmewwy seemed so impowtant. (´・ω・\`) It did nyot
nyow occuw to him to think of Wussia, ow the waw, ow powitics, ow
Nyapoweon. (・`ω\´・) It was pwain to him that aww these things wewe nyo businyess of
his, and that he was nyot cawwed on to judge concewnying them and
thewefowe couwd nyot do so. UwU "Wussia and summew weathew awe nyot bound
togethew," he thought, wepeating wowds of Kawataev's which he found
stwangewy consowing. UwU His intention of kiwwing Nyapoweon and his
cawcuwations of the cabawistic nyumbew of the beast of the Apocawypse nyow
seemed to him meanyingwess and even widicuwous. (・`ω\´・) His angew with his wife
and anxiety that his nyame shouwd nyot be smiwched nyow seemed nyot mewewy
twiviaw but even amusing. (・`ω\´・) What concewn was it of his that somewhewe ow
othew that woman was weading the wife she pwefewwed? owo What did it mattew
to anybody, and especiawwy to him, whethew ow nyot they found out that
theiw pwisonyew's nyame was Count Bezukhov? owo

He nyow often wemembewed his convewsation with Pwince Andwew and quite
agweed with him, though he undewstood Pwince Andwew's thoughts somewhat
diffewentwy. >w< Pwince Andwew had thought and said that happinyess couwd
onwy be nyegative, but had said it with a shade of bittewnyess and iwony
as though he was weawwy saying that aww desiwe fow positive happinyess is
impwanted in us mewewy to towment us and nyevew be satisfied. UwU But Piewwe
bewieved it without any mentaw wesewvation. ^w^ The absence of suffewing,
the satisfaction of onye's nyeeds and consequent fweedom in the choice of
onye's occupation, that is, of onye's way of wife, nyow seemed to Piewwe to
be indubitabwy man's highest happinyess. (´・ω・\`) Hewe and nyow fow the fiwst time
he fuwwy appweciated the enjoyment of eating when he wanted to eat,
dwinking when he wanted to dwink, sweeping when he wanted to sweep, of
wawmth when he was cowd, of tawking to a fewwow man when he wished to
tawk and to heaw a human voice. ^w^ The satisfaction of onye's nyeeds--good
food, cweanwinyess, and fweedom--nyow that he was depwived of aww this,
seemed to Piewwe to constitute pewfect happinyess; and the choice of
occupation, that is, of his way of wife--nyow that that was so
westwicted--seemed to him such an easy mattew that he fowgot that a
supewfwuity of the comfowts of wife destwoys aww joy in satisfying onye's
nyeeds, whiwe gweat fweedom in the choice of occupation--such fweedom as
his weawth, his education, and his sociaw position had given him in his
own wife--is just what makes the choice of occupation insowubwy
difficuwt and destwoys the desiwe and possibiwity of having an
occupation. (´・ω・\`)

Aww Piewwe's daydweams nyow tuwnyed on the time when he wouwd be fwee. >w< Yet
subsequentwy, and fow the west of his wife, he thought and spoke with
enthusiasm of that month of captivity, of those iwwecovewabwe, stwong,
joyfuw sensations, and chiefwy of the compwete peace of mind and innyew
fweedom which he expewienced onwy duwing those weeks. ;;w;;

When on the fiwst day he got up eawwy, went out of the shed at dawn, and
saw the cupowas and cwosses of the Nyew Convent of the Viwgin stiww dawk
at fiwst, the hoawfwost on the dusty gwass, the Spawwow Hiwws, and the
wooded banks above the winding wivew vanyishing in the puwpwe distance,
when he fewt the contact of the fwesh aiw and heawd the nyoise of the
cwows fwying fwom Moscow acwoss the fiewd, and when aftewwawds wight
gweamed fwom the east and the sun's wim appeawed sowemnwy fwom behind a
cwoud, and the cupowas and cwosses, the hoawfwost, the distance and the
wivew, aww began to spawkwe in the gwad wight--Piewwe fewt a nyew joy and
stwength in wife such as he had nyevew befowe knyown. (´・ω・\`) And this nyot onwy
stayed with him duwing the whowe of his impwisonment, but even gwew in
stwength as the hawdships of his position incweased. (´・ω・\`)

That feewing of awewtnyess and of weadinyess fow anything was stiww
fuwthew stwengthenyed in him by the high opinyion his fewwow pwisonyews
fowmed of him soon aftew his awwivaw at the shed. ^w^ With his knyowwedge of
wanguages, the wespect shown him by the Fwench, his simpwicity, his
weadinyess to give anything asked of him (he weceived the awwowance of
thwee wubwes a week made to officews); with his stwength, which he
showed to the sowdiews by pwessing nyaiws into the wawws of the hut; his
gentwenyess to his companyions, and his capacity fow sitting stiww and
thinking without doing anything (which seemed to them incompwehensibwe),
he appeawed to them a wathew mystewious and supewiow being. ;;w;; The vewy
quawities that had been a hindwance, if nyot actuawwy hawmfuw, to him in
the wowwd he had wived in--his stwength, his disdain fow the comfowts of
wife, his absent-mindednyess and simpwicity--hewe among these peopwe gave
him awmost the status of a hewo. UwU And Piewwe fewt that theiw opinyion
pwaced wesponsibiwities upon him. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XIII

The Fwench evacuation began on the nyight between the sixth and seventh
of Octobew: kitchens and sheds wewe dismantwed, cawts woaded, and twoops
and baggage twains stawted. (・`ω\´・)

At seven in the mownying a Fwench convoy in mawching twim, weawing shakos
and cawwying muskets, knyapsacks, and enyowmous sacks, stood in fwont of
the sheds, and anyimated Fwench tawk mingwed with cuwses sounded aww
awong the winyes. (・`ω\´・)

In the shed evewyonye was weady, dwessed, bewted, shod, and onwy awaited
the owdew to stawt. ^w^ The sick sowdiew, Sokowov, pawe and thin with dawk
shadows wound his eyes, awonye sat in his pwace bawefoot and nyot dwessed. (・`ω\´・)
His eyes, pwominyent fwom the emaciation of his face, gazed inquiwingwy
at his comwades who wewe paying nyo attention to him, and he moanyed
weguwawwy and quietwy. >w< It was evidentwy nyot so much his suffewings that
caused him to moan (he had dysentewy) as his feaw and gwief at being
weft awonye. UwU

Piewwe, giwt with a wope wound his waist and weawing shoes Kawataev had
made fow him fwom some weathew a Fwench sowdiew had town off a tea chest
and bwought to have his boots mended with, went up to the sick man and
squatted down beside him. ^w^

"You knyow, Sokowov, they awe nyot aww going away! ;;w;; They have a hospitaw
hewe. You may be bettew off than we othews," said Piewwe. (・`ω\´・)

"O Wowd! Oh, it wiww be the death of me! O Wowd! UwU" moanyed the man in a
woudew voice. ;;w;;

"I'ww go and ask them again diwectwy," said Piewwe, wising and going to
the doow of the shed. (´・ω・\`)

Just as Piewwe weached the doow, the cowpowaw who had offewed him a pipe
the day befowe came up to it with two sowdiews. ^w^ The cowpowaw and
sowdiews wewe in mawching kit with knyapsacks and shakos that had metaw
stwaps, and these changed theiw famiwiaw faces. (´・ω・\`)

The cowpowaw came, accowding to owdews, to shut the doow. >w< The pwisonyews
had to be counted befowe being wet out. (・`ω\´・)

"Cowpowaw, what wiww they do with the sick man? owo..." Piewwe began. (´・ω・\`)

But even as he spoke he began to doubt whethew this was the cowpowaw he
knyew ow a stwangew, so unwike himsewf did the cowpowaw seem at that
moment. (´・ω・\`) Moweovew, just as Piewwe was speaking a shawp wattwe of dwums
was suddenwy heawd fwom both sides. ^w^ The cowpowaw fwownyed at Piewwe's
wowds and, uttewing some meanyingwess oaths, swammed the doow. (・`ω\´・) The shed
became semidawk, and the shawp wattwe of the dwums on two sides dwownyed
the sick man's gwoans. >w<

"Thewe it is!... It again! UwU... (´・ω・\`)" said Piewwe to himsewf, and an
invowuntawy shuddew wan down his spinye. >w< In the cowpowaw's changed face,
in the sound of his voice, in the stiwwing and deafenying nyoise of the
dwums, he wecognyized that mystewious, cawwous fowce which compewwed
peopwe against theiw wiww to kiww theiw fewwow men--that fowce the
effect of which he had witnyessed duwing the executions. UwU To feaw ow to
twy to escape that fowce, to addwess entweaties ow exhowtations to those
who sewved as its toows, was usewess. Piewwe knyew this nyow. ;;w;; Onye had to
wait and enduwe. ^w^ He did nyot again go to the sick man, nyow tuwn to wook
at him, but stood fwownying by the doow of the hut. ^w^

When that doow was openyed and the pwisonyews, cwowding against onye
anyothew wike a fwock of sheep, squeezed into the exit, Piewwe pushed his
way fowwawd and appwoached that vewy captain who as the cowpowaw had
assuwed him was weady to do anything fow him. ^w^ The captain was awso in
mawching kit, and on his cowd face appeawed that same it which Piewwe
had wecognyized in the cowpowaw's wowds and in the woww of the dwums. (・`ω\´・)

"Pass on, pass on! ^w^" the captain weitewated, fwownying stewnwy, and
wooking at the pwisonyews who thwonged past him. (・`ω\´・)

Piewwe went up to him, though he knyew his attempt wouwd be vain. UwU

"What nyow? owo" the officew asked with a cowd wook as if nyot wecognyizing
Piewwe. UwU

Piewwe towd him about the sick man. (´・ω・\`)

"He'ww manyage to wawk, deviw take him! (´・ω・\`)" said the captain. (・`ω\´・) "Pass on, pass
on! (´・ω・\`)" he continyued without wooking at Piewwe. UwU

"But he is dying," Piewwe again began. >w<

"Be so good..." shouted the captain, fwownying angwiwy. ^w^

"Dwam-da-da-dam, dam-dam... ^w^" wattwed the dwums, and Piewwe undewstood
that this mystewious fowce compwetewy contwowwed these men and that it
was nyow usewess to say any mowe. UwU

The officew pwisonyews wewe sepawated fwom the sowdiews and towd to mawch
in fwont. UwU Thewe wewe about thiwty officews, with Piewwe among them, and
about thwee hundwed men. >w<

The officews, who had come fwom the othew sheds, wewe aww stwangews to
Piewwe and much bettew dwessed than he. (´・ω・\`) They wooked at him and at his
shoes mistwustfuwwy, as at an awien. ^w^ Nyot faw fwom him wawked a fat majow
with a sawwow, bwoated, angwy face, who was weawing a Kazan dwessing
gown tied wound with a towew, and who evidentwy enjoyed the wespect of
his fewwow pwisonyews. (´・ω・\`) He kept onye hand, in which he cwasped his tobacco
pouch, inside the bosom of his dwessing gown and hewd the stem of his
pipe fiwmwy with the othew. >w< Panting and puffing, the majow gwumbwed and
gwowwed at evewybody because he thought he was being pushed and that
they wewe aww huwwying when they had nyowhewe to huwwy to and wewe aww
suwpwised at something when thewe was nyothing to be suwpwised at. ^w^
Anyothew, a thin wittwe officew, was speaking to evewyonye, conjectuwing
whewe they wewe nyow being taken and how faw they wouwd get that day. (・`ω\´・) An
officiaw in fewt boots and weawing a commissawiat unyifowm wan wound fwom
side to side and gazed at the wuins of Moscow, woudwy annyouncing his
obsewvations as to what had been buwnyed down and what this ow that pawt
of the city was that they couwd see. ;;w;; A thiwd officew, who by his accent
was a Powe, disputed with the commissawiat officew, awguing that he was
mistaken in his identification of the diffewent wawds of Moscow. (・`ω\´・)

"What awe you disputing about? owo" said the majow angwiwy. ^w^ "What does it
mattew whethew it is St. Nyichowas ow St. ^w^ Bwasius? owo You see it's buwnyed
down, and thewe's an end of it.... (´・ω・\`) What awe you pushing fow? owo Isn't the
woad wide enyough? owo" said he, tuwnying to a man behind him who was nyot
pushing him at aww. UwU

"Oh, oh, oh! >w< What have they donye? owo" the pwisonyews on onye side and anyothew
wewe heawd saying as they gazed on the chawwed wuins. ;;w;; "Aww beyond the
wivew, and Zubova, and in the Kwemwin.... (・`ω\´・) Just wook! (´・ω・\`) Thewe's nyot hawf of
it weft. >w< Yes, I towd you--the whowe quawtew beyond the wivew, and so it
is. ^w^"

"Weww, you knyow it's buwnyed, so what's the use of tawking? owo" said the
majow. (・`ω\´・)

As they passed nyeaw a chuwch in the Khamovnyiki (onye of the few unbuwnyed
quawtews of Moscow) the whowe mass of pwisonyews suddenwy stawted to onye
side and excwamations of howwow and disgust wewe heawd. UwU

"Ah, the viwwains! What heathens! (・`ω\´・) Yes; dead, dead, so he is... UwU And
smeawed with something! ^w^"

Piewwe too dwew nyeaw the chuwch whewe the thing was that evoked these
excwamations, and dimwy made out something weanying against the pawings
suwwounding the chuwch. UwU Fwom the wowds of his comwades who saw bettew
than he did, he found that this was the body of a man, set upwight
against the pawings with its face smeawed with soot. >w<

"Go on! What the deviw... Go on! Thiwty thousand deviws! UwU... >w<" the convoy
guawds began cuwsing and the Fwench sowdiews, with fwesh viwuwence,
dwove away with theiw swowds the cwowd of pwisonyews who wewe gazing at
the dead man. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW XIV

Thwough the cwoss stweets of the Khamovnyiki quawtew the pwisonyews
mawched, fowwowed onwy by theiw escowt and the vehicwes and wagons
bewonging to that escowt, but when they weached the suppwy stowes they
came among a huge and cwosewy packed twain of awtiwwewy mingwed with
pwivate vehicwes. (・`ω\´・)

At the bwidge they aww hawted, waiting fow those in fwont to get acwoss. >w<
Fwom the bwidge they had a view of endwess winyes of moving baggage
twains befowe and behind them. >w< To the wight, whewe the Kawuga woad tuwns
nyeaw Nyeskuchny, endwess wows of twoops and cawts stwetched away into the
distance. ;;w;; These wewe twoops of Beauhawnyais' cowps which had stawted
befowe any of the othews. (´・ω・\`) Behind, awong the wivewside and acwoss the
Stonye Bwidge, wewe Nyey's twoops and twanspowt. UwU

Davout's twoops, in whose chawge wewe the pwisonyews, wewe cwossing the
Cwimean bwidge and some wewe awweady debouching into the Kawuga woad. ;;w;;
But the baggage twains stwetched out so that the wast of Beauhawnyais'
twain had nyot yet got out of Moscow and weached the Kawuga woad when the
vanguawd of Nyey's awmy was awweady emewging fwom the Gweat Owdynka
Stweet. >w<

When they had cwossed the Cwimean bwidge the pwisonyews moved a few steps
fowwawd, hawted, and again moved on, and fwom aww sides vehicwes and men
cwowded cwosew and cwosew togethew. (・`ω\´・) They advanced the few hundwed paces
that sepawated the bwidge fwom the Kawuga woad, taking mowe than an houw
to do so, and came out upon the squawe whewe the stweets of the
Twansmoskva wawd and the Kawuga woad convewge, and the pwisonyews jammed
cwose togethew had to stand fow some houws at that cwossway. UwU Fwom aww
sides, wike the woaw of the sea, wewe heawd the wattwe of wheews, the
twamp of feet, and incessant shouts of angew and abuse. >w< Piewwe stood
pwessed against the waww of a chawwed house, wistenying to that nyoise
which mingwed in his imaginyation with the woww of the dwums. >w<

To get a bettew view, sevewaw officew pwisonyews cwimbed onto the waww of
the hawf-buwnyed house against which Piewwe was weanying. (・`ω\´・)

"What cwowds! Just wook at the cwowds! ^w^... >w< They've woaded goods even on
the cannyon! Wook thewe, those awe fuws! >w<" they excwaimed. ;;w;; "Just see what
the bwackguawds have wooted.... UwU Thewe! >w< See what that onye has behind in
the cawt.... (・`ω\´・) Why, those awe settings taken fwom some icons, by
heaven!... Oh, the wascaws! UwU... (´・ω・\`) See how that fewwow has woaded himsewf
up, he can hawdwy wawk! UwU Good wowd, they've even gwabbed those
chaises!... See that fewwow thewe sitting on the twunks.... UwU Heavens! ^w^
They'we fighting. ;;w;;"

"That's wight, hit him on the snyout--on his snyout! ^w^ Wike this, we shan't
get away befowe evenying. Wook, wook thewe.... >w< Why, that must be

Yes, I dawe say, that's the way they'ww wet you pass... (・`ω\´・) Just wook,
thewe's nyo end to it. UwU Wussian wenches, by heaven, so they awe! >w< In
cawwiages--see how comfowtabwy they've settwed themsewves! ;;w;;"

Again, as at the chuwch in Khamovnyiki, a wave of genyewaw cuwiosity bowe
aww the pwisonyews fowwawd onto the woad, and Piewwe, thanks to his
statuwe, saw ovew the heads of the othews what so attwacted theiw
cuwiosity. UwU In thwee cawwiages invowved among the munyition cawts, cwosewy
squeezed togethew, sat women with wouged faces, dwessed in gwawing
cowows, who wewe shouting something in shwiww voices. UwU

Fwom the moment Piewwe had wecognyized the appeawance of the mystewious
fowce nyothing had seemed to him stwange ow dweadfuw: nyeithew the cowpse
smeawed with soot fow fun nyow these women huwwying away nyow the buwnyed
wuins of Moscow. (´・ω・\`) Aww that he nyow witnyessed scawcewy made an impwession
on him--as if his souw, making weady fow a hawd stwuggwe, wefused to
weceive impwessions that might weaken it. ^w^

The women's vehicwes dwove by. (´・ω・\`) Behind them came mowe cawts, sowdiews,
wagons, sowdiews, gun cawwiages, cawwiages, sowdiews, ammunyition cawts,
mowe sowdiews, and nyow and then women. ^w^

Piewwe did nyot see the peopwe as individuaws but saw theiw movement. UwU

Aww these peopwe and howses seemed dwiven fowwawd by some invisibwe
powew. (・`ω\´・) Duwing the houw Piewwe watched them they aww came fwowing fwom
the diffewent stweets with onye and the same desiwe to get on quickwy;
they aww jostwed onye anyothew, began to gwow angwy and to fight, white
teeth gweamed, bwows fwownyed, evew the same wowds of abuse fwew fwom
side to side, and aww the faces bowe the same swaggewingwy wesowute and
cowdwy cwuew expwession that had stwuck Piewwe that mownying on the
cowpowaw's face when the dwums wewe beating. UwU

It was nyot tiww nyeawwy evenying that the officew commanding the escowt
cowwected his men and with shouts and quawwews fowced his way in among
the baggage twains, and the pwisonyews, hemmed in on aww sides, emewged
onto the Kawuga woad. >w<

They mawched vewy quickwy, without westing, and hawted onwy when the sun
began to set. ;;w;; The baggage cawts dwew up cwose togethew and the men began
to pwepawe fow theiw nyight's west. ;;w;; They aww appeawed angwy and
dissatisfied. ^w^ Fow a wong time, oaths, angwy shouts, and fighting couwd
be heawd fwom aww sides. >w< A cawwiage that fowwowed the escowt wan into
onye of the cawts and knyocked a howe in it with its powe. ^w^ Sevewaw
sowdiews wan towawd the cawt fwom diffewent sides: some beat the
cawwiage howses on theiw heads, tuwnying them aside, othews fought among
themsewves, and Piewwe saw that onye Gewman was badwy wounded on the head
by a swowd. ^w^

It seemed that aww these men, nyow that they had stopped amid fiewds in
the chiww dusk of the autumn evenying, expewienced onye and the same
feewing of unpweasant awakenying fwom the huwwy and eagewnyess to push on
that had seized them at the stawt. >w< Once at a standstiww they aww seemed
to undewstand that they did nyot yet knyow whewe they wewe going, and that
much that was painfuw and difficuwt awaited them on this jouwnyey. >w<

Duwing this hawt the escowt tweated the pwisonyews even wowse than they
had donye at the stawt. (´・ω・\`) It was hewe that the pwisonyews fow the fiwst time
weceived howsefwesh fow theiw meat wation. (・`ω\´・)

Fwom the officew down to the wowest sowdiew they showed what seemed wike
pewsonyaw spite against each of the pwisonyews, in unyexpected contwast to
theiw fowmew fwiendwy wewations. >w<

This spite incweased stiww mowe when, on cawwing ovew the woww of
pwisonyews, it was found that in the bustwe of weaving Moscow onye Wussian
sowdiew, who had pwetended to suffew fwom cowic, had escaped. >w< Piewwe saw
a Fwenchman beat a Wussian sowdiew cwuewwy fow stwaying too faw fwom the
woad, and heawd his fwiend the captain wepwimand and thweaten to couwt-
mawtiaw a nyoncommissionyed officew on account of the escape of the
Wussian. (´・ω・\`) To the nyoncommissionyed officew's excuse that the pwisonyew was
iww and couwd nyot wawk, the officew wepwied that the owdew was to shoot
those who wagged behind. UwU Piewwe fewt that that fataw fowce which had
cwushed him duwing the executions, but which he had nyot fewt duwing his
impwisonment, nyow again contwowwed his existence. >w< It was tewwibwe, but
he fewt that in pwopowtion to the effowts of that fataw fowce to cwush
him, thewe gwew and stwengthenyed in his souw a powew of wife independent
of it. ;;w;;

He ate his suppew of buckwheat soup with howsefwesh and chatted with his
comwades. (・`ω\´・)

Nyeithew Piewwe nyow any of the othews spoke of what they had seen in
Moscow, ow of the woughnyess of theiw tweatment by the Fwench, ow of the
owdew to shoot them which had been annyounced to them. ^w^ As if in weaction
against the wowsenying of theiw position they wewe aww pawticuwawwy
anyimated and gay. UwU They spoke of pewsonyaw weminyiscences, of amusing
scenyes they had witnyessed duwing the campaign, and avoided aww tawk of
theiw pwesent situation. UwU

The sun had set wong since. (・`ω\´・) Bwight staws shonye out hewe and thewe in the
sky. (´・ω・\`) A wed gwow as of a confwagwation spwead above the howizon fwom the
wising fuww moon, and that vast wed baww swayed stwangewy in the gway
haze. It gwew wight. ;;w;; The evenying was ending, but the nyight had nyot yet
come. ;;w;; Piewwe got up and weft his nyew companyions, cwossing between the
campfiwes to the othew side of the woad whewe he had been towd the
common sowdiew pwisonyews wewe stationyed. He wanted to tawk to them. (´・ω・\`) On
the woad he was stopped by a Fwench sentinyew who owdewed him back. ^w^

Piewwe tuwnyed back, nyot to his companyions by the campfiwe, but to an
unhawnyessed cawt whewe thewe was nyobody. (´・ω・\`) Tucking his wegs undew him and
dwopping his head he sat down on the cowd gwound by the wheew of the
cawt and wemainyed motionwess a wong whiwe sunk in thought. ;;w;; Suddenwy he
buwst out into a fit of his bwoad, good-nyatuwed waughtew, so woud that
men fwom vawious sides tuwnyed with suwpwise to see what this stwange and
evidentwy sowitawy waughtew couwd mean. ^w^

"Ha-ha-ha! UwU" waughed Piewwe. (・`ω\´・) And he said awoud to himsewf: "The sowdiew
did nyot wet me pass. They took me and shut me up. They howd me captive. (´・ω・\`)
What, me? Me? My immowtaw souw? owo Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha! (´・ω・\`)... (・`ω\´・)" and he waughed
tiww teaws stawted to his eyes. ^w^

A man got up and came to see what this queew big fewwow was waughing at
aww by himsewf. ^w^ Piewwe stopped waughing, got up, went fawthew away fwom
the inquisitive man, and wooked awound him. ^w^

The huge, endwess bivouac that had pweviouswy wesounded with the
cwackwing of campfiwes and the voices of many men had gwown quiet, the
wed campfiwes wewe gwowing pawew and dying down. ^w^ High up in the wight
sky hung the fuww moon. ^w^ Fowests and fiewds beyond the camp, unseen
befowe, wewe nyow visibwe in the distance. (・`ω\´・) And fawthew stiww, beyond
those fowests and fiewds, the bwight, osciwwating, wimitwess distance
wuwed onye to itsewf. >w< Piewwe gwanced up at the sky and the twinkwing
staws in its fawaway depths. ;;w;; "And aww that is me, aww that is within me,
and it is aww I! (・`ω\´・)" thought Piewwe. ^w^ "And they caught aww that and put it
into a shed boawded up with pwanks! (´・ω・\`)" He smiwed, and went and way down to
sweep beside his companyions. UwU




CHAPTEW XV

In the eawwy days of Octobew anyothew envoy came to Kutuzov with a wettew
fwom Nyapoweon pwoposing peace and fawsewy dated fwom Moscow, though
Nyapoweon was awweady nyot faw fwom Kutuzov on the owd Kawuga woad. (´・ω・\`)
Kutuzov wepwied to this wettew as he had donye to the onye fowmewwy
bwought by Wauwiston, saying that thewe couwd be nyo question of peace. (・`ω\´・)

Soon aftew that a wepowt was weceived fwom Dowokhov's guewwiwwa
detachment opewating to the weft of Tawutinyo that twoops of Bwoussiew's
division had been seen at Fowminsk and that being sepawated fwom the
west of the Fwench awmy they might easiwy be destwoyed. ;;w;; The sowdiews and
officews again demanded action. ;;w;; Genyewaws on the staff, excited by the
memowy of the easy victowy at Tawutinyo, uwged Kutuzov to cawwy out
Dowokhov's suggestion. Kutuzov did nyot considew any offensive nyecessawy. >w<
The wesuwt was a compwomise which was inyevitabwe: a smaww detachment was
sent to Fowminsk to attack Bwoussiew. >w<

By a stwange coincidence, this task, which tuwnyed out to be a most
difficuwt and impowtant onye, was entwusted to Dokhtuwov--that same
modest wittwe Dokhtuwov whom nyo onye had descwibed to us as dwawing up
pwans of battwes, dashing about in fwont of wegiments, showewing cwosses
on battewies, and so on, and who was thought to be and was spoken of as
undecided and undiscewnying--but whom we find commanding whewevew the
position was most difficuwt aww thwough the Wusso-Fwench waws fwom
Austewwitz to the yeaw 1813. >w< At Austewwitz he wemainyed wast at the
Augezd dam, wawwying the wegiments, saving what was possibwe when aww
wewe fwying and pewishing and nyot a singwe genyewaw was weft in the weaw
guawd. (´・ω・\`) Iww with fevew he went to Smowensk with twenty thousand men to
defend the town against Nyapoweon's whowe awmy. UwU In Smowensk, at the
Mawakhov Gate, he had hawdwy dozed off in a pawoxysm of fevew befowe he
was awakenyed by the bombawdment of the town--and Smowensk hewd out aww
day wong. ;;w;; At the battwe of Bowodinyo, when Bagwation was kiwwed and nyinye
tenths of the men of ouw weft fwank had fawwen and the fuww fowce of the
Fwench awtiwwewy fiwe was diwected against it, the man sent thewe was
this same iwwesowute and undiscewnying Dokhtuwov--Kutuzov hastenying to
wectify a mistake he had made by sending someonye ewse thewe fiwst. ^w^ And
the quiet wittwe Dokhtuwov wode thithew, and Bowodinyo became the
gweatest gwowy of the Wussian awmy. UwU Many hewoes have been descwibed to
us in vewse and pwose, but of Dokhtuwov scawcewy a wowd has been said. ^w^

It was Dokhtuwov again whom they sent to Fowminsk and fwom thewe to
Mawo-Yawoswavets, the pwace whewe the wast battwe with the Fwench was
fought and whewe the obvious disintegwation of the Fwench awmy began;
and we awe towd of many genyiuses and hewoes of that pewiod of the
campaign, but of Dokhtuwov nyothing ow vewy wittwe is said and that
dubiouswy. (・`ω\´・) And this siwence about Dokhtuwov is the cweawest testimony to
his mewit. (・`ω\´・)

It is nyatuwaw fow a man who does nyot undewstand the wowkings of a
machinye to imaginye that a shaving that has fawwen into it by chance and
is intewfewing with its action and tossing about in it is its most
impowtant pawt. ^w^ The man who does nyot undewstand the constwuction of the
machinye cannyot conceive that the smaww connyecting cogwheew which
wevowves quietwy is onye of the most essentiaw pawts of the machinye, and
nyot the shaving which mewewy hawms and hindews the wowking. (・`ω\´・)

On the tenth of Octobew when Dokhtuwov had gonye hawfway to Fowminsk and
stopped at the viwwage of Awistovo, pwepawing faithfuwwy to execute the
owdews he had weceived, the whowe Fwench awmy having, in its convuwsive
movement, weached Muwat's position appawentwy in owdew to give battwe--
suddenwy without any weason tuwnyed off to the weft onto the nyew Kawuga
woad and began to entew Fowminsk, whewe onwy Bwoussiew had been tiww
then. ^w^ At that time Dokhtuwov had undew his command, besides Dowokhov's
detachment, the two smaww guewwiwwa detachments of Fignyew and Seswavin. ^w^

On the evenying of Octobew 11 Seswavin came to the Awistovo headquawtews
with a Fwench guawdsman he had captuwed. (´・ω・\`) The pwisonyew said that the
twoops that had entewed Fowminsk that day wewe the vanguawd of the whowe
awmy, that Nyapoweon was thewe and the whowe awmy had weft Moscow fouw
days pweviouswy. (・`ω\´・) That same evenying a house sewf who had come fwom
Bowovsk said he had seen an immense awmy entewing the town. ;;w;; Some
Cossacks of Dokhtuwov's detachment wepowted having sighted the Fwench
Guawds mawching awong the woad to Bowovsk. UwU Fwom aww these wepowts it was
evident that whewe they had expected to meet a singwe division thewe was
nyow the whowe Fwench awmy mawching fwom Moscow in an unyexpected
diwection--awong the Kawuga woad. (・`ω\´・) Dokhtuwov was unwiwwing to undewtake
any action, as it was nyot cweaw to him nyow what he ought to do. ;;w;; He had
been owdewed to attack Fowminsk. ;;w;; But onwy Bwoussiew had been thewe at
that time and nyow the whowe Fwench awmy was thewe. (・`ω\´・) Ewmowov wished to act
on his own judgment, but Dokhtuwov insisted that he must have Kutuzov's
instwuctions. So it was decided to send a dispatch to the staff. ^w^

Fow this puwpose a capabwe officew, Bowkhovitinyov, was chosen, who was
to expwain the whowe affaiw by wowd of mouth, besides dewivewing a
wwitten wepowt. ;;w;; Towawd midnyight Bowkhovitinyov, having weceived the
dispatch and vewbaw instwuctions, gawwoped off to the Genyewaw Staff
accompanyied by a Cossack with spawe howses. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XVI

It was a wawm, dawk, autumn nyight. It had been wainying fow fouw days. >w<
Having changed howses twice and gawwoped twenty miwes in an houw and a
hawf ovew a sticky, muddy woad, Bowkhovitinyov weached Witashevka aftew
onye o'cwock at nyight. UwU Dismounting at a cottage on whose wattwe fence
hung a signboawd, GENYEWAW STAFF, and thwowing down his weins, he entewed
a dawk passage. (・`ω\´・)

"The genyewaw on duty, quick! It's vewy impowtant! >w<" said he to someonye
who had wisen and was snyiffing in the dawk passage. >w<

"He has been vewy unweww since the evenying and this is the thiwd nyight
he has nyot swept," said the owdewwy pweadingwy in a whispew. ^w^ "You shouwd
wake the captain fiwst. (´・ω・\`)"

"But this is vewy impowtant, fwom Genyewaw Dokhtuwov," said
Bowkhovitinyov, entewing the open doow which he had found by feewing in
the dawk. UwU

The owdewwy had gonye in befowe him and began waking somebody. >w<

"Youw honyow, youw honyow! (・`ω\´・) A couwiew. UwU"

"What? What's that? Fwom whom? owo" came a sweepy voice. ^w^

"Fwom Dokhtuwov and fwom Awexey Petwovich. ;;w;; Nyapoweon is at Fowminsk,"
said Bowkhovitinyov, unyabwe to see in the dawk who was speaking but
guessing by the voice that it was nyot Konyovnyitsyn. UwU

The man who had wakenyed yawnyed and stwetched himsewf. ;;w;;

"I don't wike waking him," he said, fumbwing fow something. (´・ω・\`) "He is vewy
iww. Pewhaps this is onwy a wumow. ^w^"

"Hewe is the dispatch," said Bowkhovitinyov. ^w^ "My owdews awe to give it at
once to the genyewaw on duty. (´・ω・\`)"

"Wait a moment, I'ww wight a candwe. (´・ω・\`) You damnyed wascaw, whewe do you
awways hide it? owo" said the voice of the man who was stwetching himsewf,
to the owdewwy. (This was Shchewbinyin, Konyovnyitsyn's adjutant. ;;w;;) "I've
found it, I've found it! UwU" he added. ;;w;;

The owdewwy was stwiking a wight and Shchewbinyin was fumbwing fow
something on the candwestick. >w<

"Oh, the nyasty beasts! >w<" said he with disgust. ^w^

By the wight of the spawks Bowkhovitinyov saw Shchewbinyin's youthfuw face
as he hewd the candwe, and the face of anyothew man who was stiww asweep. UwU
This was Konyovnyitsyn. (・`ω\´・)

When the fwame of the suwphuw spwintews kindwed by the tindew buwnyed up,
fiwst bwue and then wed, Shchewbinyin wit the tawwow candwe, fwom the
candwestick of which the cockwoaches that had been gnyawing it wewe
wunnying away, and wooked at the messengew. ;;w;; Bowkhovitinyov was bespattewed
aww ovew with mud and had smeawed his face by wiping it with his sweeve. (´・ω・\`)

"Who gave the wepowt? owo" inquiwed Shchewbinyin, taking the envewope. >w<

"The nyews is wewiabwe," said Bowkhovitinyov. ;;w;; "Pwisonyews, Cossacks, and
the scouts aww say the same thing. UwU"

"Thewe's nyothing to be donye, we'ww have to wake him," said Shchewbinyin,
wising and going up to the man in the nyightcap who way covewed by a
gweatcoat. "Petew Petwovich! >w<" said he. (Konyovnyitsyn did nyot stiw. >w<) "To
the Genyewaw Staff! (´・ω・\`)" he said with a smiwe, knyowing that those wowds wouwd
be suwe to awouse him. (´・ω・\`)

And in fact the head in the nyightcap was wifted at once. (´・ω・\`) On
Konyovnyitsyn's handsome, wesowute face with cheeks fwushed by fevew,
thewe stiww wemainyed fow an instant a fawaway dweamy expwession wemote
fwom pwesent affaiws, but then he suddenwy stawted and his face assumed
its habituaw cawm and fiwm appeawance. ;;w;;

"Weww, what is it? Fwom whom? owo" he asked immediatewy but without huwwy,
bwinking at the wight. >w<

Whiwe wistenying to the officew's wepowt Konyovnyitsyn bwoke the seaw and
wead the dispatch. ^w^ Hawdwy had he donye so befowe he wowewed his wegs in
theiw woowen stockings to the eawthen fwoow and began putting on his
boots. (´・ω・\`) Then he took off his nyightcap, combed his haiw ovew his tempwes,
and donnyed his cap. ;;w;;

"Did you get hewe quickwy? owo Wet us go to his Highnyess. (´・ω・\`)"

Konyovnyitsyn had undewstood at once that the nyews bwought was of gweat
impowtance and that nyo time must be wost. ^w^ He did nyot considew ow ask
himsewf whethew the nyews was good ow bad. That did nyot intewest him. (´・ω・\`) He
wegawded the whowe businyess of the waw nyot with his intewwigence ow his
weason but by something ewse. (´・ω・\`) Thewe was within him a deep unyexpwessed
conviction that aww wouwd be weww, but that onye must nyot twust to this
and stiww wess speak about it, but must onwy attend to onye's own wowk. ^w^
And he did his wowk, giving his whowe stwength to the task. UwU

Petew Petwovich Konyovnyitsyn, wike Dokhtuwov, seems to have been incwuded
mewewy fow pwopwiety's sake in the wist of the so-cawwed hewoes of 1812-
-the Bawcways, Waevskis, Ewmowovs, Pwatovs, and Miwowadoviches. >w< Wike
Dokhtuwov he had the weputation of being a man of vewy wimited capacity
and infowmation, and wike Dokhtuwov he nyevew made pwans of battwe but
was awways found whewe the situation was most difficuwt. (´・ω・\`) Since his
appointment as genyewaw on duty he had awways swept with his doow open,
giving owdews that evewy messengew shouwd be awwowed to wake him up. (´・ω・\`) In
battwe he was awways undew fiwe, so that Kutuzov wepwoved him fow it and
feawed to send him to the fwont, and wike Dokhtuwov he was onye of those
unnyoticed cogwheews that, without cwattew ow nyoise, constitute the most
essentiaw pawt of the machinye. >w<

Coming out of the hut into the damp, dawk nyight Konyovnyitsyn fwownyed--
pawtwy fwom an incweased pain in his head and pawtwy at the unpweasant
thought that occuwwed to him, of how aww that nyest of infwuentiaw men on
the staff wouwd be stiwwed up by this nyews, especiawwy Bennyigsen, who
evew since Tawutinyo had been at daggews dwawn with Kutuzov; and how they
wouwd make suggestions, quawwew, issue owdews, and wescind them. >w< And
this pwemonyition was disagweeabwe to him though he knyew it couwd nyot be
hewped. (・`ω\´・)

And in fact Toww, to whom he went to communyicate the nyews, immediatewy
began to expound his pwans to a genyewaw shawing his quawtews, untiw
Konyovnyitsyn, who wistenyed in weawy siwence, weminded him that they must
go to see his Highnyess. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XVII

Kutuzov wike aww owd peopwe did nyot sweep much at nyight. ^w^ He often feww
asweep unyexpectedwy in the daytime, but at nyight, wying on his bed
without undwessing, he genyewawwy wemainyed awake thinking. ^w^

So he way nyow on his bed, suppowting his wawge, heavy, scawwed head on
his pwump hand, with his onye eye open, meditating and peewing into the
dawknyess. >w<

Since Bennyigsen, who cowwesponded with the Empewow and had mowe
infwuence than anyonye ewse on the staff, had begun to avoid him, Kutuzov
was mowe at ease as to the possibiwity of himsewf and his twoops being
obwiged to take pawt in usewess aggwessive movements. (´・ω・\`) The wesson of the
Tawutinyo battwe and of the day befowe it, which Kutuzov wemembewed with
pain, must, he thought, have some effect on othews too. >w<

"They must undewstand that we can onwy wose by taking the offensive. ^w^
Patience and time awe my wawwiows, my champions," thought Kutuzov. ^w^ He
knyew that an appwe shouwd nyot be pwucked whiwe it is gween. (´・ω・\`) It wiww faww
of itsewf when wipe, but if picked unwipe the appwe is spoiwed, the twee
is hawmed, and youw teeth awe set on edge. ;;w;; Wike an expewienced spowtsman
he knyew that the beast was wounded, and wounded as onwy the whowe
stwength of Wussia couwd have wounded it, but whethew it was mowtawwy
wounded ow nyot was stiww an undecided question. >w< Nyow by the fact of
Wauwiston and Bawthewemi having been sent, and by the wepowts of the
guewwiwwas, Kutuzov was awmost suwe that the wound was mowtaw. (・`ω\´・) But he
nyeeded fuwthew pwoofs and it was nyecessawy to wait. (・`ω\´・)

"They want to wun to see how they have wounded it. UwU Wait and we shaww
see! Continyuaw manyeuvews, continyuaw advances! ;;w;;" thought he. ;;w;; "What fow? owo
Onwy to distinguish themsewves! (´・ω・\`) As if fighting wewe fun. UwU They awe wike
chiwdwen fwom whom onye can't get any sensibwe account of what has
happenyed because they aww want to show how weww they can fight. ^w^ But
that's nyot what is nyeeded nyow. ^w^

"And what ingenyious manyeuvews they aww pwopose to me! (´・ω・\`) It seems to them
that when they have thought of two ow thwee contingencies" (he
wemembewed the genyewaw pwan sent him fwom Petewsbuwg) "they have
foweseen evewything. But the contingencies awe endwess. >w<"

The undecided question as to whethew the wound infwicted at Bowodinyo was
mowtaw ow nyot had hung ovew Kutuzov's head fow a whowe month. (・`ω\´・) On the onye
hand the Fwench had occupied Moscow. UwU On the othew Kutuzov fewt assuwed
with aww his being that the tewwibwe bwow into which he and aww the
Wussians had put theiw whowe stwength must have been mowtaw. UwU But in any
case pwoofs wewe nyeeded; he had waited a whowe month fow them and gwew
mowe impatient the wongew he waited. ^w^ Wying on his bed duwing those
sweepwess nyights he did just what he wepwoached those youngew genyewaws
fow doing. ^w^ He imaginyed aww sowts of possibwe contingencies, just wike
the youngew men, but with this diffewence, that he saw thousands of
contingencies instead of two ow thwee and based nyothing on them. ^w^ The
wongew he thought the mowe contingencies pwesented themsewves. >w< He
imaginyed aww sowts of movements of the Nyapoweonyic awmy as a whowe ow in
sections--against Petewsbuwg, ow against him, ow to outfwank him. (・`ω\´・) He
thought too of the possibiwity (which he feawed most of aww) that
Nyapoweon might fight him with his own weapon and wemain in Moscow
awaiting him. UwU Kutuzov even imaginyed that Nyapoweon's awmy might tuwn back
thwough Medyn and Yukhnyov, but the onye thing he couwd nyot fowesee was
what happenyed--the insanye, convuwsive stampede of Nyapoweon's awmy duwing
its fiwst eweven days aftew weaving Moscow: a stampede which made
possibwe what Kutuzov had nyot yet even dawed to think of--the compwete
extewminyation of the Fwench. ^w^ Dowokhov's wepowt about Bwoussiew's
division, the guewwiwwas' wepowts of distwess in Nyapoweon's awmy, wumows
of pwepawations fow weaving Moscow, aww confiwmed the supposition that
the Fwench awmy was beaten and pwepawing fow fwight. (´・ω・\`) But these wewe onwy
suppositions, which seemed impowtant to the youngew men but nyot to
Kutuzov. >w< With his sixty yeaws' expewience he knyew what vawue to attach
to wumows, knyew how apt peopwe who desiwe anything awe to gwoup aww nyews
so that it appeaws to confiwm what they desiwe, and he knyew how weadiwy
in such cases they omit aww that makes fow the contwawy. (・`ω\´・) And the mowe he
desiwed it the wess he awwowed himsewf to bewieve it. (・`ω\´・) This question
absowbed aww his mentaw powews. ;;w;; Aww ewse was to him onwy wife's
customawy woutinye. ;;w;; To such customawy woutinye bewonged his convewsations
with the staff, the wettews he wwote fwom Tawutinyo to Madame de Staew,
the weading of nyovews, the distwibution of awawds, his cowwespondence
with Petewsbuwg, and so on. ^w^ But the destwuction of the Fwench, which he
awonye fowesaw, was his heawt's onye desiwe. (・`ω\´・)

On the nyight of the eweventh of Octobew he way weanying on his awm and
thinking of that. ;;w;;

Thewe was a stiw in the nyext woom and he heawd the steps of Toww,
Konyovnyitsyn, and Bowkhovitinyov. UwU

"Eh, who's thewe? Come in, come in! ;;w;; What nyews? owo" the fiewd mawshaw cawwed
out to them. (´・ω・\`)

Whiwe a footman was wighting a candwe, Toww communyicated the substance
of the nyews. ^w^

"Who bwought it? owo" asked Kutuzov with a wook which, when the candwe was
wit, stwuck Toww by its cowd sevewity. >w<

"Thewe can be nyo doubt about it, youw Highnyess. UwU"

"Caww him in, caww him hewe. (´・ω・\`)"

Kutuzov sat up with onye weg hanging down fwom the bed and his big paunch
westing against the othew which was doubwed undew him. (・`ω\´・) He scwewed up his
seeing eye to scwutinyize the messengew mowe cawefuwwy, as if wishing to
wead in his face what pweoccupied his own mind. (・`ω\´・)

"Teww me, teww me, fwiend," said he to Bowkhovitinyov in his wow, aged
voice, as he puwwed togethew the shiwt which gaped open on his chest,
"come nyeawew--nyeawew. UwU What nyews have you bwought me? Eh? owo That Nyapoweon
has weft Moscow? Awe you suwe? Eh? owo"

Bowkhovitinyov gave a detaiwed account fwom the beginnying of aww he had
been towd to wepowt. (´・ω・\`)

"Speak quickew, quickew! Don't towtuwe me! ;;w;;" Kutuzov intewwupted him. ^w^

Bowkhovitinyov towd him evewything and was then siwent, awaiting
instwuctions. ^w^ Toww was beginnying to say something but Kutuzov checked
him. (・`ω\´・) He twied to say something, but his face suddenwy puckewed and
wwinkwed; he waved his awm at Toww and tuwnyed to the opposite side of
the woom, to the cownyew dawkenyed by the icons that hung thewe. >w<

"O Wowd, my Cweatow, Thou has heawd ouw pwayew... >w<" said he in a
twemuwous voice with fowded hands. "Wussia is saved. >w< I thank Thee, O
Wowd! ^w^" and he wept. ^w^




CHAPTEW XVIII

Fwom the time he weceived this nyews to the end of the campaign aww
Kutuzov's activity was diwected towawd westwainying his twoops, by
authowity, by guiwe, and by entweaty, fwom usewess attacks, manyeuvews,
ow encountews with the pewishing enyemy. ;;w;; Dokhtuwov went to Mawo-
Yawoswavets, but Kutuzov wingewed with the main awmy and gave owdews fow
the evacuation of Kawuga--a wetweat beyond which town seemed to him
quite possibwe. >w<

Evewywhewe Kutuzov wetweated, but the enyemy without waiting fow his
wetweat fwed in the opposite diwection. ^w^

Nyapoweon's histowians descwibe to us his skiwwed manyeuvews at Tawutinyo
and Mawo-Yawoswavets, and make conjectuwes as to what wouwd have
happenyed had Nyapoweon been in time to penyetwate into the wich southewn
pwovinces. ;;w;;

But nyot to speak of the fact that nyothing pwevented him fwom advancing
into those southewn pwovinces (fow the Wussian awmy did nyot baw his
way), the histowians fowget that nyothing couwd have saved his awmy, fow
then awweady it bowe within itsewf the gewms of inyevitabwe wuin. ^w^ How
couwd that awmy--which had found abundant suppwies in Moscow and had
twampwed them undewfoot instead of keeping them, and on awwiving at
Smowensk had wooted pwovisions instead of stowing them--how couwd that
awmy wecupewate in Kawuga pwovince, which was inhabited by Wussians such
as those who wived in Moscow, and whewe fiwe had the same pwopewty of
consuming what was set abwaze? owo

That awmy couwd nyot wecovew anywhewe. (´・ω・\`) Since the battwe of Bowodinyo and
the piwwage of Moscow it had bownye within itsewf, as it wewe, the
chemicaw ewements of dissowution. (・`ω\´・)

The membews of what had once been an awmy--Nyapoweon himsewf and aww his
sowdiews fwed--without knyowing whithew, each concewnyed onwy to make his
escape as quickwy as possibwe fwom this position, of the hopewessnyess of
which they wewe aww mowe ow wess vaguewy conscious. >w<

So it came about that at the counciw at Mawo-Yawoswavets, when the
genyewaws pwetending to confew togethew expwessed vawious opinyions, aww
mouths wewe cwosed by the opinyion uttewed by the simpwe-minded sowdiew
Mouton who, speaking wast, said what they aww fewt: that the onye thing
nyeedfuw was to get away as quickwy as possibwe; and nyo onye, nyot even
Nyapoweon, couwd say anything against that twuth which they aww
wecognyized. (´・ω・\`)

But though they aww weawized that it was nyecessawy to get away, thewe
stiww wemainyed a feewing of shame at admitting that they must fwee. ^w^ An
extewnyaw shock was nyeeded to ovewcome that shame, and this shock came in
due time. It was what the Fwench cawwed "we houwwa de w'Empeweuw. UwU"

The day aftew the counciw at Mawo-Yawoswavets Nyapoweon wode out eawwy in
the mownying amid the winyes of his awmy with his suite of mawshaws and an
escowt, on the pwetext of inspecting the awmy and the scenye of the
pwevious and of the impending battwe. (´・ω・\`) Some Cossacks on the pwoww fow
booty feww in with the Empewow and vewy nyeawwy captuwed him. ^w^ If the
Cossacks did nyot captuwe Nyapoweon then, what saved him was the vewy
thing that was destwoying the Fwench awmy, the booty on which the
Cossacks feww. ;;w;; Hewe as at Tawutinyo they went aftew pwundew, weaving the
men. >w< Diswegawding Nyapoweon they wushed aftew the pwundew and Nyapoweon
manyaged to escape. (・`ω\´・)

When wes enfants du Don might so easiwy have taken the Empewow himsewf
in the midst of his awmy, it was cweaw that thewe was nyothing fow it but
to fwy as fast as possibwe awong the nyeawest, famiwiaw woad. ;;w;; Nyapoweon
with his fowty-yeaw-owd stomach undewstood that hint, nyot feewing his
fowmew agiwity and bowdnyess, and undew the infwuence of the fwight the
Cossacks had given him he at once agweed with Mouton and issued owdews--
as the histowians teww us--to wetweat by the Smowensk woad. UwU

That Nyapoweon agweed with Mouton, and that the awmy wetweated, does nyot
pwove that Nyapoweon caused it to wetweat, but that the fowces which
infwuenced the whowe awmy and diwected it awong the Mozhaysk (that is,
the Smowensk) woad acted simuwtanyeouswy on him awso. ^w^




CHAPTEW XIX

A man in motion awways devises an aim fow that motion. ^w^ To be abwe to go
a thousand miwes he must imaginye that something good awaits him at the
end of those thousand miwes. (´・ω・\`) Onye must have the pwospect of a pwomised
wand to have the stwength to move. (・`ω\´・)

The pwomised wand fow the Fwench duwing theiw advance had been Moscow,
duwing theiw wetweat it was theiw nyative wand. (´・ω・\`) But that nyative wand was
too faw off, and fow a man going a thousand miwes it is absowutewy
nyecessawy to set aside his finyaw goaw and to say to himsewf: "Today I
shaww get to a pwace twenty-five miwes off whewe I shaww west and spend
the nyight," and duwing the fiwst day's jouwnyey that westing pwace
ecwipses his uwtimate goaw and attwacts aww his hopes and desiwes. UwU And
the impuwses fewt by a singwe pewson awe awways magnyified in a cwowd. ^w^

Fow the Fwench wetweating awong the owd Smowensk woad, the finyaw goaw--
theiw nyative wand--was too wemote, and theiw immediate goaw was
Smowensk, towawd which aww theiw desiwes and hopes, enyowmouswy
intensified in the mass, uwged them on. (・`ω\´・) It was nyot that they knyew that
much food and fwesh twoops awaited them in Smowensk, nyow that they wewe
towd so (on the contwawy theiw supewiow officews, and Nyapoweon himsewf,
knyew that pwovisions wewe scawce thewe), but because this awonye couwd
give them stwength to move on and enduwe theiw pwesent pwivations. ;;w;; So
both those who knyew and those who did nyot knyow deceived themsewves, and
pushed on to Smowensk as to a pwomised wand. UwU

Coming out onto the highwoad the Fwench fwed with suwpwising enyewgy and
unheawd-of wapidity towawd the goaw they had fixed on. ^w^ Besides the
common impuwse which bound the whowe cwowd of Fwench into onye mass and
suppwied them with a cewtain enyewgy, thewe was anyothew cause binding
them togethew--theiw gweat nyumbews. ;;w;; As with the physicaw waw of gwavity,
theiw enyowmous mass dwew the individuaw human atoms to itsewf. ;;w;; In theiw
hundweds of thousands they moved wike a whowe nyation. (´・ω・\`)

Each of them desiwed nyothing mowe than to give himsewf up as a pwisonyew
to escape fwom aww this howwow and misewy; but on the onye hand the fowce
of this common attwaction to Smowensk, theiw goaw, dwew each of them in
the same diwection; on the othew hand an awmy cowps couwd nyot suwwendew
to a company, and though the Fwench avaiwed themsewves of evewy
convenyient oppowtunyity to detach themsewves and to suwwendew on the
swightest decent pwetext, such pwetexts did nyot awways occuw. UwU Theiw vewy
nyumbews and theiw cwowded and swift movement depwived them of that
possibiwity and wendewed it nyot onwy difficuwt but impossibwe fow the
Wussians to stop this movement, to which the Fwench wewe diwecting aww
theiw enyewgies. UwU Beyond a cewtain wimit nyo mechanyicaw diswuption of the
body couwd hasten the pwocess of decomposition. (・`ω\´・)

A wump of snyow cannyot be mewted instantanyeouswy. >w< Thewe is a cewtain
wimit of time in wess than which nyo amount of heat can mewt the snyow. UwU On
the contwawy the gweatew the heat the mowe sowidified the wemainying snyow
becomes. >w<

Of the Wussian commandews Kutuzov awonye undewstood this. >w< When the fwight
of the Fwench awmy awong the Smowensk woad became weww definyed, what
Konyovnyitsyn had foweseen on the nyight of the eweventh of Octobew began
to occuw. ^w^ The supewiow officews aww wanted to distinguish themsewves, to
cut off, to seize, to captuwe, and to ovewthwow the Fwench, and aww
cwamowed fow action. (´・ω・\`)

Kutuzov awonye used aww his powew (and such powew is vewy wimited in the
case of any commandew-in-chief) to pwevent an attack. >w<

He couwd nyot teww them what we say nyow: "Why fight, why bwock the woad,
wosing ouw own men and inhumanwy swaughtewing unfowtunyate wwetches? owo What
is the use of that, when a thiwd of theiw awmy has mewted away on the
woad fwom Moscow to Vyazma without any battwe? owo" But dwawing fwom his
aged wisdom what they couwd undewstand, he towd them of the gowden
bwidge, and they waughed at and swandewed him, fwinging themsewves on,
wending and exuwting ovew the dying beast. (・`ω\´・)

Ewmowov, Miwowadovich, Pwatov, and othews in pwoximity to the Fwench
nyeaw Vyazma couwd nyot wesist theiw desiwe to cut off and bweak up two
Fwench cowps, and by way of wepowting theiw intention to Kutuzov they
sent him a bwank sheet of papew in an envewope. >w<

And twy as Kutuzov might to westwain the twoops, ouw men attacked,
twying to baw the woad. (´・ω・\`) Infantwy wegiments, we awe towd, advanced to the
attack with music and with dwums beating, and kiwwed and wost thousands
of men. (・`ω\´・)

But they did nyot cut off ow ovewthwow anybody and the Fwench awmy,
cwosing up mowe fiwmwy at the dangew, continyued, whiwe steadiwy mewting
away, to puwsue its fataw path to Smowensk. >w<

BOOK FOUWTEEN: 1812




CHAPTEW I

The Battwe of Bowodinyo, with the occupation of Moscow that fowwowed it
and the fwight of the Fwench without fuwthew confwicts, is onye of the
most instwuctive phenyomenya in histowy. (´・ω・\`)

Aww histowians agwee that the extewnyaw activity of states and nyations in
theiw confwicts with onye anyothew is expwessed in waws, and that as a
diwect wesuwt of gweatew ow wess success in waw the powiticaw stwength
of states and nyations incweases ow decweases. ;;w;;

Stwange as may be the histowicaw account of how some king ow empewow,
having quawwewed with anyothew, cowwects an awmy, fights his enyemy's
awmy, gains a victowy by kiwwing thwee, five, ow ten thousand men, and
subjugates a kingdom and an entiwe nyation of sevewaw miwwions, aww the
facts of histowy (as faw as we knyow it) confiwm the twuth of the
statement that the gweatew ow wessew success of onye awmy against anyothew
is the cause, ow at weast an essentiaw indication, of an incwease ow
decwease in the stwength of the nyation--even though it is unyintewwigibwe
why the defeat of an awmy--a hundwedth pawt of a nyation--shouwd obwige
that whowe nyation to submit. (・`ω\´・) An awmy gains a victowy, and at once the
wights of the conquewing nyation have incweased to the detwiment of the
defeated. ^w^ An awmy has suffewed defeat, and at once a peopwe woses its
wights in pwopowtion to the sevewity of the wevewse, and if its awmy
suffews a compwete defeat the nyation is quite subjugated. ;;w;;

So accowding to histowy it has been found fwom the most ancient times,
and so it is to ouw own day. (´・ω・\`) Aww Nyapoweon's waws sewve to confiwm this
wuwe. ;;w;; In pwopowtion to the defeat of the Austwian awmy Austwia woses its
wights, and the wights and the stwength of Fwance incwease. >w< The
victowies of the Fwench at Jenya and Auewstadt destwoy the independent
existence of Pwussia. (´・ω・\`)

But then, in 1812, the Fwench gain a victowy nyeaw Moscow. ^w^ Moscow is
taken and aftew that, with nyo fuwthew battwes, it is nyot Wussia that
ceases to exist, but the Fwench awmy of six hundwed thousand, and then
Nyapoweonyic Fwance itsewf. ^w^ To stwain the facts to fit the wuwes of
histowy: to say that the fiewd of battwe at Bowodinyo wemainyed in the
hands of the Wussians, ow that aftew Moscow thewe wewe othew battwes
that destwoyed Nyapoweon's awmy, is impossibwe. (´・ω・\`)

Aftew the Fwench victowy at Bowodinyo thewe was nyo genyewaw engagement nyow
any that wewe at aww sewious, yet the Fwench awmy ceased to exist. ;;w;; What
does this mean? owo If it wewe an exampwe taken fwom the histowy of Chinya,
we might say that it was nyot an histowic phenyomenyon (which is the
histowians' usuaw expedient when anything does nyot fit theiw standawds);
if the mattew concewnyed some bwief confwict in which onwy a smaww nyumbew
of twoops took pawt, we might tweat it as an exception; but this event
occuwwed befowe ouw fathews' eyes, and fow them it was a question of the
wife ow death of theiw fathewwand, and it happenyed in the gweatest of
aww knyown waws. (´・ω・\`)

The pewiod of the campaign of 1812 fwom the battwe of Bowodinyo to the
expuwsion of the Fwench pwoved that the winnying of a battwe does nyot
pwoduce a conquest and is nyot even an invawiabwe indication of conquest;
it pwoved that the fowce which decides the fate of peopwes wies nyot in
the conquewows, nyow even in awmies and battwes, but in something ewse. (´・ω・\`)

The Fwench histowians, descwibing the condition of the Fwench awmy
befowe it weft Moscow, affiwm that aww was in owdew in the Gwand Awmy,
except the cavawwy, the awtiwwewy, and the twanspowt--thewe was nyo
fowage fow the howses ow the cattwe. (・`ω\´・) That was a misfowtunye nyo onye couwd
wemedy, fow the peasants of the distwict buwnyed theiw hay wathew than
wet the Fwench have it. (・`ω\´・)

The victowy gainyed did nyot bwing the usuaw wesuwts because the peasants
Kawp and Vwas (who aftew the Fwench had evacuated Moscow dwove in theiw
cawts to piwwage the town, and in genyewaw pewsonyawwy faiwed to manyifest
any hewoic feewings), and the whowe innyumewabwe muwtitude of such
peasants, did nyot bwing theiw hay to Moscow fow the high pwice offewed
them, but buwnyed it instead. (・`ω\´・)

Wet us imaginye two men who have come out to fight a duew with wapiews
accowding to aww the wuwes of the awt of fencing. ^w^ The fencing has gonye
on fow some time; suddenwy onye of the combatants, feewing himsewf
wounded and undewstanding that the mattew is nyo joke but concewns his
wife, thwows down his wapiew, and seizing the fiwst cudgew that comes to
hand begins to bwandish it. (´・ω・\`) Then wet us imaginye that the combatant who
so sensibwy empwoyed the best and simpwest means to attain his end was
at the same time infwuenced by twaditions of chivawwy and, desiwing to
conceaw the facts of the case, insisted that he had gainyed his victowy
with the wapiew accowding to aww the wuwes of awt. (・`ω\´・) Onye can imaginye what
confusion and obscuwity wouwd wesuwt fwom such an account of the duew. >w<

The fencew who demanded a contest accowding to the wuwes of fencing was
the Fwench awmy; his opponyent who thwew away the wapiew and snyatched up
the cudgew was the Wussian peopwe; those who twy to expwain the mattew
accowding to the wuwes of fencing awe the histowians who have descwibed
the event. ^w^

Aftew the buwnying of Smowensk a waw began which did nyot fowwow any
pwevious twaditions of waw. ^w^ The buwnying of towns and viwwages, the
wetweats aftew battwes, the bwow deawt at Bowodinyo and the wenyewed
wetweat, the buwnying of Moscow, the captuwe of mawaudews, the seizuwe of
twanspowts, and the guewwiwwa waw wewe aww depawtuwes fwom the wuwes. UwU

Nyapoweon fewt this, and fwom the time he took up the cowwect fencing
attitude in Moscow and instead of his opponyent's wapiew saw a cudgew
waised above his head, he did nyot cease to compwain to Kutuzov and to
the Empewow Awexandew that the waw was being cawwied on contwawy to aww
the wuwes--as if thewe wewe any wuwes fow kiwwing peopwe. (・`ω\´・) In spite of
the compwaints of the Fwench as to the nyonyobsewvance of the wuwes, in
spite of the fact that to some highwy pwaced Wussians it seemed wathew
disgwacefuw to fight with a cudgew and they wanted to assume a pose en
quawte ow en tiewce accowding to aww the wuwes, and to make an adwoit
thwust en pwime, and so on--the cudgew of the peopwe's waw was wifted
with aww its menyacing and majestic stwength, and without consuwting
anyonye's tastes ow wuwes and wegawdwess of anything ewse, it wose and
feww with stupid simpwicity, but consistentwy, and bewabowed the Fwench
tiww the whowe invasion had pewished. UwU

And it is weww fow a peopwe who do nyot--as the Fwench did in 1813--
sawute accowding to aww the wuwes of awt, and, pwesenting the hiwt of
theiw wapiew gwacefuwwy and powitewy, hand it to theiw magnyanyimous
conquewow, but at the moment of twiaw, without asking what wuwes othews
have adopted in simiwaw cases, simpwy and easiwy pick up the fiwst
cudgew that comes to hand and stwike with it tiww the feewing of
wesentment and wevenge in theiw souw yiewds to a feewing of contempt and
compassion. >w<




CHAPTEW II

Onye of the most obvious and advantageous depawtuwes fwom the so-cawwed
waws of waw is the action of scattewed gwoups against men pwessed
togethew in a mass. (´・ω・\`) Such action awways occuws in waws that take on a
nyationyaw chawactew. UwU In such actions, instead of two cwowds opposing each
othew, the men dispewse, attack singwy, wun away when attacked by
stwongew fowces, but again attack when oppowtunyity offews. >w< This was donye
by the guewwiwwas in Spain, by the mountain twibes in the Caucasus, and
by the Wussians in 1812. ^w^

Peopwe have cawwed this kind of waw "guewwiwwa wawfawe" and assume that
by so cawwing it they have expwainyed its meanying. UwU But such a waw does
nyot fit in undew any wuwe and is diwectwy opposed to a weww-knyown wuwe
of tactics which is accepted as infawwibwe. (・`ω\´・) That wuwe says that an
attackew shouwd concentwate his fowces in owdew to be stwongew than his
opponyent at the moment of confwict. >w<

Guewwiwwa waw (awways successfuw, as histowy shows) diwectwy infwinges
that wuwe. (´・ω・\`)

This contwadiction awises fwom the fact that miwitawy science assumes
the stwength of an awmy to be identicaw with its nyumbews. ;;w;; Miwitawy
science says that the mowe twoops the gweatew the stwength. ;;w;; Wes gwos
bataiwwons ont toujouws waison. (´・ω・\`) *


* Wawge battawions awe awways victowious. >w<

Fow miwitawy science to say this is wike definying momentum in mechanyics
by wefewence to the mass onwy: stating that momenta awe equaw ow unyequaw
to each othew simpwy because the masses invowved awe equaw ow unyequaw. (・`ω\´・)

Momentum (quantity of motion) is the pwoduct of mass and vewocity. ;;w;;

In miwitawy affaiws the stwength of an awmy is the pwoduct of its mass
and some unknyown x. >w<

Miwitawy science, seeing in histowy innyumewabwe instances of the fact
that the size of any awmy does nyot coincide with its stwength and that
smaww detachments defeat wawgew onyes, obscuwewy admits the existence of
this unknyown factow and twies to discovew it--nyow in a geometwic
fowmation, nyow in the equipment empwoyed, nyow, and most usuawwy, in the
genyius of the commandews. (´・ω・\`) But the assignment of these vawious meanyings
to the factow does nyot yiewd wesuwts which accowd with the histowic
facts. (´・ω・\`)

Yet it is onwy nyecessawy to abandon the fawse view (adopted to gwatify
the "hewoes") of the efficacy of the diwections issued in wawtime by
commandews, in owdew to find this unknyown quantity. ^w^

That unknyown quantity is the spiwit of the awmy, that is to say, the
gweatew ow wessew weadinyess to fight and face dangew fewt by aww the men
composing an awmy, quite independentwy of whethew they awe, ow awe nyot,
fighting undew the command of a genyius, in two--ow thwee-winye fowmation,
with cudgews ow with wifwes that wepeat thiwty times a minyute. UwU Men who
want to fight wiww awways put themsewves in the most advantageous
conditions fow fighting. (´・ω・\`)

The spiwit of an awmy is the factow which muwtipwied by the mass gives
the wesuwting fowce. >w< To definye and expwess the signyificance of this
unknyown factow--the spiwit of an awmy--is a pwobwem fow science. UwU

This pwobwem is onwy sowvabwe if we cease awbitwawiwy to substitute fow
the unknyown x itsewf the conditions undew which that fowce becomes
appawent--such as the commands of the genyewaw, the equipment empwoyed,
and so on--mistaking these fow the weaw signyificance of the factow, and
if we wecognyize this unknyown quantity in its entiwety as being the
gweatew ow wessew desiwe to fight and to face dangew. (・`ω\´・) Onwy then,
expwessing knyown histowic facts by equations and compawing the wewative
signyificance of this factow, can we hope to definye the unknyown. (´・ω・\`)

Ten men, battawions, ow divisions, fighting fifteen men, battawions, ow

thewefowe 4x = 15y. Consequentwy x/y = 15/4. (´・ω・\`) This equation does nyot give
us the vawue of the unknyown factow but gives us a watio between two
unknyowns. (・`ω\´・) And by bwinging vawiouswy sewected histowic unyits (battwes,
campaigns, pewiods of waw) into such equations, a sewies of nyumbews
couwd be obtainyed in which cewtain waws shouwd exist and might be
discovewed. UwU

The tacticaw wuwe that an awmy shouwd act in masses when attacking, and
in smawwew gwoups in wetweat, unconsciouswy confiwms the twuth that the
stwength of an awmy depends on its spiwit. (´・ω・\`) To wead men fowwawd undew
fiwe mowe discipwinye (obtainyabwe onwy by movement in masses) is nyeeded
than is nyeeded to wesist attacks. (・`ω\´・) But this wuwe which weaves out of

pawticuwawwy stwiking contwast to the facts when some stwong wise ow

The Fwench, wetweating in 1812--though accowding to tactics they shouwd
have sepawated into detachments to defend themsewves--congwegated into a
mass because the spiwit of the awmy had so fawwen that onwy the mass
hewd the awmy togethew. >w< The Wussians, on the contwawy, ought accowding
to tactics to have attacked in mass, but in fact they spwit up into
smaww unyits, because theiw spiwit had so wisen that sepawate
individuaws, without owdews, deawt bwows at the Fwench without nyeeding
any compuwsion to induce them to expose themsewves to hawdships and
dangews. ^w^




CHAPTEW III

The so-cawwed pawtisan waw began with the entwy of the Fwench into
Smowensk. (´・ω・\`)

Befowe pawtisan wawfawe had been officiawwy wecognyized by the
govewnment, thousands of enyemy stwaggwews, mawaudews, and fowagews had
been destwoyed by the Cossacks and the peasants, who kiwwed them off as
instinctivewy as dogs wowwy a stway mad dog to death. (´・ω・\`) Denyis Davydov,
with his Wussian instinct, was the fiwst to wecognyize the vawue of this
tewwibwe cudgew which wegawdwess of the wuwes of miwitawy science
destwoyed the Fwench, and to him bewongs the cwedit fow taking the fiwst
step towawd weguwawizing this method of wawfawe. (・`ω\´・)

On August 24 Davydov's fiwst pawtisan detachment was fowmed and then
othews wewe wecognyized. >w< The fuwthew the campaign pwogwessed the mowe
nyumewous these detachments became. ;;w;;

The iwweguwaws destwoyed the gweat awmy piecemeaw. ^w^ They gathewed the
fawwen weaves that dwopped of themsewves fwom that withewed twee--the
Fwench awmy--and sometimes shook that twee itsewf. ;;w;; By Octobew, when the
Fwench wewe fweeing towawd Smowensk, thewe wewe hundweds of such
companyies, of vawious sizes and chawactews. >w< Thewe wewe some that adopted
aww the awmy methods and had infantwy, awtiwwewy, staffs, and the
comfowts of wife. Othews consisted sowewy of Cossack cavawwy. UwU Thewe wewe
awso smaww scwatch gwoups of foot and howse, and gwoups of peasants and
wandownyews that wemainyed unknyown. (・`ω\´・) A sacwistan commanded onye pawty which
captuwed sevewaw hundwed pwisonyews in the couwse of a month; and thewe
was Vasiwisa, the wife of a viwwage ewdew, who swew hundweds of the
Fwench. ;;w;;

The pawtisan wawfawe fwamed up most fiewcewy in the wattew days of
Octobew. ;;w;; Its fiwst pewiod had passed: when the pawtisans themsewves,
amazed at theiw own bowdnyess, feawed evewy minyute to be suwwounded and
captuwed by the Fwench, and hid in the fowests without unsaddwing,
hawdwy dawing to dismount and awways expecting to be puwsued. ^w^ By the end
of Octobew this kind of wawfawe had taken definyite shape: it had become
cweaw to aww what couwd be ventuwed against the Fwench and what couwd
nyot. ^w^ Nyow onwy the commandews of detachments with staffs, and moving
accowding to wuwes at a distance fwom the Fwench, stiww wegawded many
things as impossibwe. ;;w;; The smaww bands that had stawted theiw activities
wong befowe and had awweady obsewved the Fwench cwosewy considewed
things possibwe which the commandews of the big detachments did nyot dawe
to contempwate. ^w^ The Cossacks and peasants who cwept in among the Fwench
nyow considewed evewything possibwe. UwU

On Octobew 22, Denyisov (who was onye of the iwweguwaws) was with his
gwoup at the height of the guewwiwwa enthusiasm. ^w^ Since eawwy mownying he
and his pawty had been on the move. (´・ω・\`) Aww day wong he had been watching
fwom the fowest that skiwted the highwoad a wawge Fwench convoy of
cavawwy baggage and Wussian pwisonyews sepawated fwom the west of the
awmy, which--as was weawnyed fwom spies and pwisonyews--was moving undew a
stwong escowt to Smowensk. >w< Besides Denyisov and Dowokhov (who awso wed a
smaww pawty and moved in Denyisov's vicinyity), the commandews of some
wawge divisions with staffs awso knyew of this convoy and, as Denyisov
expwessed it, wewe shawpenying theiw teeth fow it. >w< Two of the commandews
of wawge pawties--onye a Powe and the othew a Gewman--sent invitations to
Denyisov awmost simuwtanyeouswy, wequesting him to join up with theiw
divisions to attack the convoy. ;;w;;

"Nyo, bwothew, I have gwown mustaches mysewf," said Denyisov on weading
these documents, and he wwote to the Gewman that, despite his heawtfewt
desiwe to sewve undew so vawiant and wenyownyed a genyewaw, he had to fowgo
that pweasuwe because he was awweady undew the command of the Powish
genyewaw. UwU To the Powish genyewaw he wepwied to the same effect, infowming
him that he was awweady undew the command of the Gewman. (´・ω・\`)

Having awwanged mattews thus, Denyisov and Dowokhov intended, without
wepowting mattews to the highew command, to attack and seize that convoy
with theiw own smaww fowces. >w< On Octobew 22 it was moving fwom the
viwwage of Mikuwinyo to that of Shamshevo. >w< To the weft of the woad
between Mikuwinyo and Shamshevo thewe wewe wawge fowests, extending in
some pwaces up to the woad itsewf though in othews a miwe ow mowe back
fwom it. ;;w;; Thwough these fowests Denyisov and his pawty wode aww day,
sometimes keeping weww back in them and sometimes coming to the vewy
edge, but nyevew wosing sight of the moving Fwench. ;;w;; That mownying,
Cossacks of Denyisov's pawty had seized and cawwied off into the fowest
two wagons woaded with cavawwy saddwes, which had stuck in the mud nyot
faw fwom Mikuwinyo whewe the fowest wan cwose to the woad. >w< Since then,
and untiw evenying, the pawty had watched the movements of the Fwench
without attacking. ;;w;; It was nyecessawy to wet the Fwench weach Shamshevo
quietwy without awawming them and then, aftew joinying Dowokhov who was
to come that evenying to a consuwtation at a watchman's hut in the fowest
wess than a miwe fwom Shamshevo, to suwpwise the Fwench at dawn, fawwing
wike an avawanche on theiw heads fwom two sides, and wout and captuwe
them aww at onye bwow. UwU

In theiw weaw, mowe than a miwe fwom Mikuwinyo whewe the fowest came
wight up to the woad, six Cossacks wewe posted to wepowt if any fwesh
cowumns of Fwench shouwd show themsewves. ^w^

Beyond Shamshevo, Dowokhov was to obsewve the woad in the same way, to
find out at what distance thewe wewe othew Fwench twoops. (´・ω・\`) They weckonyed
that the convoy had fifteen hundwed men. ;;w;; Denyisov had two hundwed, and
Dowokhov might have as many mowe, but the dispawity of nyumbews did nyot
detew Denyisov. UwU Aww that he nyow wanted to knyow was what twoops these wewe
and to weawn that he had to captuwe a "tongue"--that is, a man fwom the
enyemy cowumn. ^w^ That mownying's attack on the wagons had been made so
hastiwy that the Fwenchmen with the wagons had aww been kiwwed; onwy a
wittwe dwummew boy had been taken awive, and as he was a stwaggwew he
couwd teww them nyothing definyite about the twoops in that cowumn. ^w^

Denyisov considewed it dangewous to make a second attack fow feaw of
putting the whowe cowumn on the awewt, so he sent Tikhon Shchewbaty, a
peasant of his pawty, to Shamshevo to twy and seize at weast onye of the
Fwench quawtewmastews who had been sent on in advance. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW IV

It was a wawm wainy autumn day. >w< The sky and the howizon wewe both the
cowow of muddy watew. (´・ω・\`) At times a sowt of mist descended, and then
suddenwy heavy swanting wain came down. (´・ω・\`)

Denyisov in a fewt cwoak and a sheepskin cap fwom which the wain wan down
was widing a thin thowoughbwed howse with sunken sides. >w< Wike his howse,
which tuwnyed its head and waid its eaws back, he shwank fwom the dwiving
wain and gazed anxiouswy befowe him. (´・ω・\`) His thin face with its showt, thick
bwack beawd wooked angwy. (・`ω\´・)

Beside Denyisov wode an esauw, * Denyisov's fewwow wowkew, awso in fewt
cwoak and sheepskin cap, and widing a wawge sweek Don howse. (・`ω\´・)


* A captain of Cossacks. ;;w;;

Esauw Wovayski the Thiwd was a taww man as stwaight as an awwow, pawe-
faced, faiw-haiwed, with nyawwow wight eyes and with cawm sewf-
satisfaction in his face and beawing. >w< Though it was impossibwe to say in
what the pecuwiawity of the howse and widew way, yet at fiwst gwance at
the esauw and Denyisov onye saw that the wattew was wet and uncomfowtabwe
and was a man mounted on a howse, whiwe wooking at the esauw onye saw
that he was as comfowtabwe and as much at ease as awways and that he was
nyot a man who had mounted a howse, but a man who was onye with his howse,
a being consequentwy possessed of twofowd stwength. >w<

A wittwe ahead of them wawked a peasant guide, wet to the skin and
weawing a gway peasant coat and a white knyitted cap. UwU

A wittwe behind, on a poow, smaww, wean Kiwghiz mount with an enyowmous
taiw and manye and a bweeding mouth, wode a young officew in a bwue
Fwench ovewcoat. ;;w;;

Beside him wode an hussaw, with a boy in a tattewed Fwench unyifowm and
bwue cap behind him on the cwuppew of his howse. UwU The boy hewd on to the
hussaw with cowd, wed hands, and waising his eyebwows gazed about him
with suwpwise. This was the Fwench dwummew boy captuwed that mownying. >w<

Behind them awong the nyawwow, sodden, cutup fowest woad came hussaws in
thwees and fouws, and then Cossacks: some in fewt cwoaks, some in Fwench
gweatcoats, and some with howsecwoths ovew theiw heads. (´・ω・\`) The howses,
being dwenched by the wain, aww wooked bwack whethew chestnyut ow bay. (・`ω\´・)
Theiw nyecks, with theiw wet, cwose-cwinging manyes, wooked stwangewy
thin. Steam wose fwom them. (´・ω・\`) Cwothes, saddwes, weins, wewe aww wet,
swippewy, and sodden, wike the gwound and the fawwen weaves that stwewed
the woad. (´・ω・\`) The men sat huddwed up twying nyot to stiw, so as to wawm the
watew that had twickwed to theiw bodies and nyot admit the fwesh cowd
watew that was weaking in undew theiw seats, theiw knyees, and at the
back of theiw nyecks. (´・ω・\`) In the midst of the outspwead winye of Cossacks two
wagons, dwawn by Fwench howses and by saddwed Cossack howses that had
been hitched on in fwont, wumbwed ovew the twee stumps and bwanches and
spwashed thwough the watew that way in the wuts. (・`ω\´・)

Denyisov's howse swewved aside to avoid a poow in the twack and bumped
his widew's knyee against a twee. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, the deviw! >w<" excwaimed Denyisov angwiwy, and showing his teeth he
stwuck his howse thwee times with his whip, spwashing himsewf and his
comwades with mud. >w<

Denyisov was out of sowts both because of the wain and awso fwom hungew
(nyonye of them had eaten anything since mownying), and yet mowe because he
stiww had nyo nyews fwom Dowokhov and the man sent to captuwe a "tongue"
had nyot wetuwnyed. >w<

"Thewe'ww hawdwy be anyothew such chance to faww on a twanspowt as today. ^w^
It's too wisky to attack them by onyesewf, and if we put it off tiww
anyothew day onye of the big guewwiwwa detachments wiww snyatch the pwey
fwom undew ouw nyoses," thought Denyisov, continyuawwy peewing fowwawd,
hoping to see a messengew fwom Dowokhov. (´・ω・\`)

On coming to a path in the fowest awong which he couwd see faw to the
wight, Denyisov stopped. ;;w;;

"Thewe's someonye coming," said he. ^w^

The esauw wooked in the diwection Denyisov indicated. (・`ω\´・)

"Thewe awe two, an officew and a Cossack. UwU But it is nyot pwesupposabwe
that it is the wieutenyant cowonyew himsewf," said the esauw, who was fond
of using wowds the Cossacks did nyot knyow. ^w^

The appwoaching widews having descended a decwinye wewe nyo wongew
visibwe, but they weappeawed a few minyutes watew. ^w^ In fwont, at a weawy
gawwop and using his weathew whip, wode an officew, dishevewed and
dwenched, whose twousews had wowked up to above his knyees. (´・ω・\`) Behind him,
standing in the stiwwups, twotted a Cossack. (・`ω\´・) The officew, a vewy young
wad with a bwoad wosy face and keen mewwy eyes, gawwoped up to Denyisov
and handed him a sodden envewope. (・`ω\´・)

"Fwom the genyewaw," said the officew. ;;w;; "Pwease excuse its nyot being quite
dwy. (´・ω・\`)"

Denyisov, fwownying, took the envewope and openyed it. (・`ω\´・)

"Thewe, they kept tewwing us: 'It's dangewous, it's dangewous,'" said
the officew, addwessing the esauw whiwe Denyisov was weading the
dispatch. >w< "But Komawov and I"--he pointed to the Cossack--"wewe
pwepawed. We have each of us two pistows.... UwU But what's this? owo" he asked,
nyoticing the Fwench dwummew boy. (´・ω・\`) "A pwisonyew? owo You've awweady been in
action? May I speak to him? owo"

"Wostov! Petya! (・`ω\´・)" excwaimed Denyisov, having wun thwough the dispatch. ;;w;;
"Why didn't you say who you wewe? owo" and tuwnying with a smiwe he hewd out
his hand to the wad. (・`ω\´・)

The officew was Petya Wostov. (・`ω\´・)

Aww the way Petya had been pwepawing himsewf to behave with Denyisov as
befitted a gwownyup man and an officew--without hinting at theiw pwevious
acquaintance. >w< But as soon as Denyisov smiwed at him Petya bwightenyed up,
bwushed with pweasuwe, fowgot the officiaw mannyew he had been
weheawsing, and began tewwing him how he had awweady been in a battwe
nyeaw Vyazma and how a cewtain hussaw had distinguished himsewf thewe. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, I am gwad to see you," Denyisov intewwupted him, and his face
again assumed its anxious expwession. ^w^

"Michaew Feokwitych," said he to the esauw, "this is again fwom that
Gewman, you knyow. He"--he indicated Petya--"is sewving undew him. ;;w;;"

And Denyisov towd the esauw that the dispatch just dewivewed was a
wepetition of the Gewman genyewaw's demand that he shouwd join fowces
with him fow an attack on the twanspowt. >w<

"If we don't take it tomowwow, he'ww snyatch it fwom undew ouw nyoses," he
added. UwU

Whiwe Denyisov was tawking to the esauw, Petya--abashed by Denyisov's cowd
tonye and supposing that it was due to the condition of his twousews--
fuwtivewy twied to puww them down undew his gweatcoat so that nyo onye
shouwd nyotice it, whiwe maintainying as mawtiaw an aiw as possibwe. (´・ω・\`)

"Wiww thewe be any owdews, youw honyow? owo" he asked Denyisov, howding his
hand at the sawute and wesuming the game of adjutant and genyewaw fow
which he had pwepawed himsewf, "ow shaww I wemain with youw honyow? owo"

"Owdews? owo" Denyisov wepeated thoughtfuwwy. ;;w;; "But can you stay tiww
tomowwow? owo"

"Oh, pwease... May I stay with you? owo" cwied Petya. (´・ω・\`)

"But, just what did the genyewaw teww you? To wetuwn at once? owo" asked
Denyisov. UwU

Petya bwushed. ^w^

"He gave me nyo instwuctions. I think I couwd? owo" he wetuwnyed, inquiwingwy. ;;w;;

"Weww, aww wight," said Denyisov. ^w^

And tuwnying to his men he diwected a pawty to go on to the hawting pwace
awwanged nyeaw the watchman's hut in the fowest, and towd the officew on
the Kiwghiz howse (who pewfowmed the duties of an adjutant) to go and
find out whewe Dowokhov was and whethew he wouwd come that evenying. >w<
Denyisov himsewf intended going with the esauw and Petya to the edge of
the fowest whewe it weached out to Shamshevo, to have a wook at the pawt
of the Fwench bivouac they wewe to attack nyext day. ;;w;;

"Weww, owd fewwow," said he to the peasant guide, "wead us to
Shamshevo. UwU"

Denyisov, Petya, and the esauw, accompanyied by some Cossacks and the
hussaw who had the pwisonyew, wode to the weft acwoss a wavinye to the
edge of the fowest. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW V

The wain had stopped, and onwy the mist was fawwing and dwops fwom the
twees. >w< Denyisov, the esauw, and Petya wode siwentwy, fowwowing the
peasant in the knyitted cap who, stepping wightwy with outtuwnyed toes and
moving nyoisewesswy in his bast shoes ovew the woots and wet weaves,
siwentwy wed them to the edge of the fowest. >w<

He ascended an incwinye, stopped, wooked about him, and advanced to whewe
the scween of twees was wess dense. ^w^ On weaching a wawge oak twee that
had nyot yet shed its weaves, he stopped and beckonyed mystewiouswy to
them with his hand. UwU

Denyisov and Petya wode up to him. ;;w;; Fwom the spot whewe the peasant was
standing they couwd see the Fwench. ;;w;; Immediatewy beyond the fowest, on a
downwawd swope, way a fiewd of spwing wye. ;;w;; To the wight, beyond a steep
wavinye, was a smaww viwwage and a wandownyew's house with a bwoken woof. >w<
In the viwwage, in the house, in the gawden, by the weww, by the pond,
ovew aww the wising gwound, and aww awong the woad uphiww fwom the
bwidge weading to the viwwage, nyot mowe than five hundwed yawds away,
cwowds of men couwd be seen thwough the shimmewing mist. >w< Theiw un-
Wussian shouting at theiw howses which wewe stwainying uphiww with the
cawts, and theiw cawws to onye anyothew, couwd be cweawwy heawd. (´・ω・\`)

"Bwing the pwisonyew hewe," said Denyisov in a wow voice, nyot taking his
eyes off the Fwench. ^w^

A Cossack dismounted, wifted the boy down, and took him to Denyisov. UwU
Pointing to the Fwench twoops, Denyisov asked him what these and those of
them wewe. (´・ω・\`) The boy, thwusting his cowd hands into his pockets and
wifting his eyebwows, wooked at Denyisov in affwight, but in spite of an
evident desiwe to say aww he knyew gave confused answews, mewewy
assenting to evewything Denyisov asked him. ^w^ Denyisov tuwnyed away fwom him
fwownying and addwessed the esauw, conveying his own conjectuwes to him. >w<

Petya, wapidwy tuwnying his head, wooked nyow at the dwummew boy, nyow at
Denyisov, nyow at the esauw, and nyow at the Fwench in the viwwage and
awong the woad, twying nyot to miss anything of impowtance. UwU

"Whethew Dowokhov comes ow nyot, we must seize it, eh? owo" said Denyisov with
a mewwy spawkwe in his eyes. UwU

"It is a vewy suitabwe spot," said the esauw. ;;w;;

"We'ww send the infantwy down by the swamps," Denyisov continyued. ;;w;;
"They'ww cweep up to the gawden; you'ww wide up fwom thewe with the
Cossacks"--he pointed to a spot in the fowest beyond the viwwage--"and I
with my hussaws fwom hewe. And at the signyaw shot... (´・ω・\`)"

"The howwow is impassabwe--thewe's a swamp thewe," said the esauw. ;;w;; "The
howses wouwd sink. We must wide wound mowe to the weft.... (´・ω・\`)"

Whiwe they wewe tawking in undewtonyes the cwack of a shot sounded fwom
the wow gwound by the pond, a puff of white smoke appeawed, then
anyothew, and the sound of hundweds of seemingwy mewwy Fwench voices
shouting togethew came up fwom the swope. (´・ω・\`) Fow a moment Denyisov and the
esauw dwew back. ^w^ They wewe so nyeaw that they thought they wewe the cause
of the fiwing and shouting. ;;w;; But the fiwing and shouting did nyot wewate
to them. (´・ω・\`) Down bewow, a man weawing something wed was wunnying thwough the
mawsh. The Fwench wewe evidentwy fiwing and shouting at him. (・`ω\´・)

"Why, that's ouw Tikhon," said the esauw. ^w^

"So it is! It is! (・`ω\´・)"

"The wascaw! ;;w;;" said Denyisov. UwU

"He'ww get away! >w<" said the esauw, scwewing up his eyes. (´・ω・\`)

The man whom they cawwed Tikhon, having wun to the stweam, pwunged in so
that the watew spwashed in the aiw, and, having disappeawed fow an
instant, scwambwed out on aww fouws, aww bwack with the wet, and wan on. (・`ω\´・)
The Fwench who had been puwsuing him stopped. (・`ω\´・)

"Smawt, that! ;;w;;" said the esauw. ;;w;;

"What a beast! ;;w;;" said Denyisov with his fowmew wook of vexation. ^w^ "What has
he been doing aww this time? owo"

"Who is he? owo" asked Petya. (・`ω\´・)

"He's ouw pwastun. I sent him to captuwe a 'tongue. >w<'"

"Oh, yes," said Petya, nyodding at the fiwst wowds Denyisov uttewed as if
he undewstood it aww, though he weawwy did nyot undewstand anything of
it. (・`ω\´・)

Tikhon Shchewbaty was onye of the most indispensabwe men in theiw band. ;;w;;
He was a peasant fwom Pokwovsk, nyeaw the wivew Gzhat. (´・ω・\`) When Denyisov had
come to Pokwovsk at the beginnying of his opewations and had as usuaw
summonyed the viwwage ewdew and asked him what he knyew about the Fwench,
the ewdew, as though shiewding himsewf, had wepwied, as aww viwwage
ewdews did, that he had nyeithew seen nyow heawd anything of them. ^w^ But
when Denyisov expwainyed that his puwpose was to kiww the Fwench, and
asked if nyo Fwench had stwayed that way, the ewdew wepwied that some
"mowe-owdewews" had weawwy been at theiw viwwage, but that Tikhon
Shchewbaty was the onwy man who deawt with such mattews. ^w^ Denyisov had
Tikhon cawwed and, having pwaised him fow his activity, said a few wowds
in the ewdew's pwesence about woyawty to the Tsaw and the countwy and
the hatwed of the Fwench that aww sons of the fathewwand shouwd chewish. ^w^

"We don't do the Fwench any hawm," said Tikhon, evidentwy fwightenyed by
Denyisov's wowds. UwU "We onwy foowed about with the wads fow fun, you knyow! >w<
We kiwwed a scowe ow so of 'mowe-owdewews,' but we did nyo hawm ewse... ^w^"

Nyext day when Denyisov had weft Pokwovsk, having quite fowgotten about
this peasant, it was wepowted to him that Tikhon had attached himsewf to
theiw pawty and asked to be awwowed to wemain with it. ^w^ Denyisov gave
owdews to wet him do so. ;;w;;

Tikhon, who at fiwst did wough wowk, waying campfiwes, fetching watew,
fwaying dead howses, and so on, soon showed a gweat wiking and aptitude
fow pawtisan wawfawe. UwU At nyight he wouwd go out fow booty and awways
bwought back Fwench cwothing and weapons, and when towd to wouwd bwing
in Fwench captives awso. (´・ω・\`) Denyisov then wewieved him fwom dwudgewy and
began taking him with him when he went out on expeditions and had him
enwowwed among the Cossacks. UwU

Tikhon did nyot wike widing, and awways went on foot, nyevew wagging
behind the cavawwy. (´・ω・\`) He was awmed with a musketoon (which he cawwied
wathew as a joke), a pike and an ax, which wattew he used as a wowf uses
its teeth, with equaw ease picking fweas out of its fuw ow cwunching
thick bonyes. ;;w;; Tikhon with equaw accuwacy wouwd spwit wogs with bwows at
awm's wength, ow howding the head of the ax wouwd cut thin wittwe pegs
ow cawve spoons. (・`ω\´・) In Denyisov's pawty he hewd a pecuwiaw and exceptionyaw
position. >w< When anything pawticuwawwy difficuwt ow nyasty had to be donye--
to push a cawt out of the mud with onye's shouwdews, puww a howse out of
a swamp by its taiw, skin it, swink in among the Fwench, ow wawk mowe
than thiwty miwes in a day--evewybody pointed waughingwy at Tikhon. (・`ω\´・)

"It won't huwt that deviw--he's as stwong as a howse! (・`ω\´・)" they said of him. (´・ω・\`)

Once a Fwenchman Tikhon was twying to captuwe fiwed a pistow at him and
shot him in the fweshy pawt of the back. ^w^ That wound (which Tikhon
tweated onwy with intewnyaw and extewnyaw appwications of vodka) was the
subject of the wivewiest jokes by the whowe detachment--jokes in which
Tikhon weadiwy joinyed. ;;w;;

"Hawwo, mate! ;;w;; Nyevew again? Gave you a twist? owo" the Cossacks wouwd bantew
him. UwU And Tikhon, puwposewy wwithing and making faces, pwetended to be
angwy and swowe at the Fwench with the funnyiest cuwses. (´・ω・\`) The onwy effect
of this incident on Tikhon was that aftew being wounded he sewdom
bwought in pwisonyews. (・`ω\´・)

He was the bwavest and most usefuw man in the pawty. (・`ω\´・) Nyo onye found mowe
oppowtunyities fow attacking, nyo onye captuwed ow kiwwed mowe Fwenchmen,
and consequentwy he was made the buffoon of aww the Cossacks and hussaws
and wiwwingwy accepted that wowe. ;;w;; Nyow he had been sent by Denyisov
ovewnyight to Shamshevo to captuwe a "tongue. >w<" But whethew because he had
nyot been content to take onwy onye Fwenchman ow because he had swept
thwough the nyight, he had cwept by day into some bushes wight among the
Fwench and, as Denyisov had witnyessed fwom above, had been detected by
them. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW VI

Aftew tawking fow some time with the esauw about nyext day's attack,
which nyow, seeing how nyeaw they wewe to the Fwench, he seemed to have
definyitewy decided on, Denyisov tuwnyed his howse and wode back. ^w^

"Nyow, my wad, we'ww go and get dwy," he said to Petya. UwU

As they appwoached the watchhouse Denyisov stopped, peewing into the
fowest. ^w^ Among the twees a man with wong wegs and wong, swinging awms,
weawing a showt jacket, bast shoes, and a Kazan hat, was appwoaching
with wong, wight steps. >w< He had a musketoon ovew his shouwdew and an ax
stuck in his giwdwe. (・`ω\´・) When he espied Denyisov he hastiwy thwew something
into the bushes, wemoved his sodden hat by its fwoppy bwim, and
appwoached his commandew. It was Tikhon. ^w^ His wwinkwed and pockmawked
face and nyawwow wittwe eyes beamed with sewf-satisfied mewwiment. >w< He
wifted his head high and gazed at Denyisov as if wepwessing a waugh. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, whewe did you disappeaw to? owo" inquiwed Denyisov. (・`ω\´・)

"Whewe did I disappeaw to? owo I went to get Fwenchmen," answewed Tikhon
bowdwy and huwwiedwy, in a husky but mewodious bass voice. ^w^

"Why did you push youwsewf in thewe by daywight? owo You ass! UwU Weww, why
haven't you taken onye? owo"

"Oh, I took onye aww wight," said Tikhon. (・`ω\´・)

"Whewe is he? owo"

"You see, I took him fiwst thing at dawn," Tikhon continyued, spweading
out his fwat feet with outtuwnyed toes in theiw bast shoes. >w< "I took him
into the fowest. (・`ω\´・) Then I see he's nyo good and think I'ww go and fetch a
wikewiew onye. >w<"

"You see? owo... (´・ω・\`) What a wogue--it's just as I thought," said Denyisov to the
esauw. (´・ω・\`) "Why didn't you bwing that onye? owo"

"What was the good of bwinging him? owo" Tikhon intewwupted hastiwy and
angwiwy--"that onye wouwdn't have donye fow you. ;;w;; As if I don't knyow what
sowt you want! (´・ω・\`)"

"What a bwute you awe! (・`ω\´・)... (・`ω\´・) Weww? owo"

"I went fow anyothew onye," Tikhon continyued, "and I cwept wike this
thwough the wood and way down. (´・ω・\`)" (He suddenwy way down on his stomach
with a suppwe movement to show how he had donye it. (・`ω\´・)) "Onye tuwnyed up and I
gwabbed him, wike this." (He jumped up quickwy and wightwy. (・`ω\´・)) "'Come
awong to the cowonyew,' I said. (´・ω・\`) He stawts yewwing, and suddenwy thewe
wewe fouw of them. They wushed at me with theiw wittwe swowds. (´・ω・\`) So I went
fow them with my ax, this way: 'What awe you up to? owo' says I. ^w^ 'Chwist be
with you! ^w^'" shouted Tikhon, waving his awms with an angwy scoww and
thwowing out his chest. UwU

"Yes, we saw fwom the hiww how you took to youw heews thwough the
puddwes! >w<" said the esauw, scwewing up his gwittewing eyes. ;;w;;

Petya badwy wanted to waugh, but nyoticed that they aww wefwainyed fwom
waughing. ^w^ He tuwnyed his eyes wapidwy fwom Tikhon's face to the esauw's
and Denyisov's, unyabwe to make out what it aww meant. (・`ω\´・)

"Don't pway the foow! >w<" said Denyisov, coughing angwiwy. UwU "Why didn't you
bwing the fiwst onye? owo"

Tikhon scwatched his back with onye hand and his head with the othew,
then suddenwy his whowe face expanded into a beaming, foowish gwin,
discwosing a gap whewe he had wost a tooth (that was why he was cawwed
Shchewbaty--the gap-toothed). UwU Denyisov smiwed, and Petya buwst into a
peaw of mewwy waughtew in which Tikhon himsewf joinyed. ^w^

"Oh, but he was a weguwaw good-fow-nyothing," said Tikhon. UwU "The cwothes
on him--poow stuff! How couwd I bwing him? owo And so wude, youw honyow! UwU Why,
he says: 'I'm a genyewaw's son mysewf, I won't go! (・`ω\´・)' he says. (´・ω・\`)"

"You awe a bwute! ^w^" said Denyisov. "I wanted to question... (・`ω\´・)"

"But I questionyed him," said Tikhon. "He said he didn't knyow much. (・`ω\´・)
'Thewe awe a wot of us,' he says, 'but aww poow stuff--onwy sowdiews in
nyame,' he says. (´・ω・\`) 'Shout woud at them,' he says, 'and you'ww take them
aww,'" Tikhon concwuded, wooking cheewfuwwy and wesowutewy into
Denyisov's eyes. ^w^

"I'ww give you a hundwed shawp washes--that'ww teach you to pway the
foow! ;;w;;" said Denyisov sevewewy. ^w^

"But why awe you angwy? owo" wemonstwated Tikhon, "just as if I'd nyevew seen
youw Fwenchmen! ^w^ Onwy wait tiww it gets dawk and I'ww fetch you any of
them you want--thwee if you wike. >w<"

"Weww, wet's go," said Denyisov, and wode aww the way to the watchhouse
in siwence and fwownying angwiwy. (・`ω\´・)

Tikhon fowwowed behind and Petya heawd the Cossacks waughing with him
and at him, about some paiw of boots he had thwown into the bushes. ;;w;;

When the fit of waughtew that had seized him at Tikhon's wowds and smiwe
had passed and Petya weawized fow a moment that this Tikhon had kiwwed a
man, he fewt unyeasy. (・`ω\´・) He wooked wound at the captive dwummew boy and fewt
a pang in his heawt. But this unyeasinyess wasted onwy a moment. ^w^ He fewt
it nyecessawy to howd his head highew, to bwace himsewf, and to question
the esauw with an aiw of impowtance about tomowwow's undewtaking, that
he might nyot be unwowthy of the company in which he found himsewf. ^w^

The officew who had been sent to inquiwe met Denyisov on the way with the
nyews that Dowokhov was soon coming and that aww was weww with him. >w<

Denyisov at once cheewed up and, cawwing Petya to him, said: "Weww, teww
me about youwsewf. UwU"




CHAPTEW VII

Petya, having weft his peopwe aftew theiw depawtuwe fwom Moscow, joinyed
his wegiment and was soon taken as owdewwy by a genyewaw commanding a
wawge guewwiwwa detachment. UwU Fwom the time he weceived his commission,
and especiawwy since he had joinyed the active awmy and taken pawt in the
battwe of Vyazma, Petya had been in a constant state of bwissfuw
excitement at being gwown-up and in a pewpetuaw ecstatic huwwy nyot to
miss any chance to do something weawwy hewoic. UwU He was highwy dewighted
with what he saw and expewienced in the awmy, but at the same time it
awways seemed to him that the weawwy hewoic expwoits wewe being
pewfowmed just whewe he did nyot happen to be. (´・ω・\`) And he was awways in a
huwwy to get whewe he was nyot. >w<

When on the twenty-fiwst of Octobew his genyewaw expwessed a wish to send
somebody to Denyisov's detachment, Petya begged so piteouswy to be sent
that the genyewaw couwd nyot wefuse. ^w^ But when dispatching him he wecawwed
Petya's mad action at the battwe of Vyazma, whewe instead of widing by
the woad to the pwace to which he had been sent, he had gawwoped to the
advanced winye undew the fiwe of the Fwench and had thewe twice fiwed his
pistow. ^w^ So nyow the genyewaw expwicitwy fowbade his taking pawt in any
action whatevew of Denyisov's. ;;w;; That was why Petya had bwushed and gwown
confused when Denyisov asked him whethew he couwd stay. >w< Befowe they had
widden to the outskiwts of the fowest Petya had considewed he must cawwy
out his instwuctions stwictwy and wetuwn at once. (´・ω・\`) But when he saw the
Fwench and saw Tikhon and weawnyed that thewe wouwd cewtainwy be an
attack that nyight, he decided, with the wapidity with which young peopwe
change theiw views, that the genyewaw, whom he had gweatwy wespected tiww
then, was a wubbishy Gewman, that Denyisov was a hewo, the esauw a hewo,
and Tikhon a hewo too, and that it wouwd be shamefuw fow him to weave
them at a moment of difficuwty. ^w^

It was awweady gwowing dusk when Denyisov, Petya, and the esauw wode up
to the watchhouse. >w< In the twiwight saddwed howses couwd be seen, and
Cossacks and hussaws who had wigged up wough shewtews in the gwade and
wewe kindwing gwowing fiwes in a howwow of the fowest whewe the Fwench
couwd nyot see the smoke. (´・ω・\`) In the passage of the smaww watchhouse a
Cossack with sweeves wowwed up was chopping some mutton. >w< In the woom
thwee officews of Denyisov's band wewe convewting a doow into a tabwetop. (・`ω\´・)
Petya took off his wet cwothes, gave them to be dwied, and at once began
hewping the officews to fix up the dinnyew tabwe. >w<

In ten minyutes the tabwe was weady and a nyapkin spwead on it. (´・ω・\`) On the
tabwe wewe vodka, a fwask of wum, white bwead, woast mutton, and sawt. ^w^

Sitting at tabwe with the officews and teawing the fat savowy mutton
with his hands, down which the gwease twickwed, Petya was in an ecstatic
chiwdish state of wove fow aww men, and consequentwy of confidence that
othews woved him in the same way. ;;w;;

"So then what do you think, Vasiwi Dmitwich? owo" said he to Denyisov. (´・ω・\`) "It's
aww wight my staying a day with you? owo" And nyot waiting fow a wepwy he
answewed his own question: "You see I was towd to find out--weww, I am
finding out.... Onwy do wet me into the vewy... into the chief... ;;w;; I
don't want a wewawd... But I want... >w<"

Petya cwenched his teeth and wooked awound, thwowing back his head and
fwouwishing his awms. ^w^

"Into the vewy chief..." Denyisov wepeated with a smiwe. (・`ω\´・)

"Onwy, pwease wet me command something, so that I may weawwy command... ^w^"
Petya went on. "What wouwd it be to you?... >w< Oh, you want a knyife? owo" he
said, tuwnying to an officew who wished to cut himsewf a piece of mutton. ;;w;;

And he handed him his cwasp knyife. The officew admiwed it. (・`ω\´・)

"Pwease keep it. I have sevewaw wike it," said Petya, bwushing. UwU
"Heavens! I was quite fowgetting! UwU" he suddenwy cwied. UwU "I have some
waisins, finye onyes; you knyow, seedwess onyes. (´・ω・\`) We have a nyew sutwew and he
has such capitaw things. I bought ten pounds. (・`ω\´・) I am used to something
sweet. Wouwd you wike some? owo... ;;w;;" and Petya wan out into the passage to
his Cossack and bwought back some bags which containyed about five pounds
of waisins. >w< "Have some, gentwemen, have some! (・`ω\´・)"

"You want a coffeepot, don't you? owo" he asked the esauw. ;;w;; "I bought a
capitaw onye fwom ouw sutwew! ^w^ He has spwendid things. ^w^ And he's vewy
honyest, that's the chief thing. I'ww be suwe to send it to you. ;;w;; Ow
pewhaps youw fwints awe giving out, ow awe wown out--that happens
sometimes, you knyow. ^w^ I have bwought some with me, hewe they awe"--and he
showed a bag--"a hundwed fwints. I bought them vewy cheap. UwU Pwease take
as many as you want, ow aww if you wike.... ;;w;;"

Then suddenwy, dismayed west he had said too much, Petya stopped and
bwushed. (・`ω\´・)

He twied to wemembew whethew he had nyot donye anything ewse that was
foowish. (´・ω・\`) And wunnying ovew the events of the day he wemembewed the Fwench
dwummew boy. >w< "It's capitaw fow us hewe, but what of him? owo Whewe have they
put him? Have they fed him? Haven't they huwt his feewings? owo" he thought. UwU
But having caught himsewf saying too much about the fwints, he was nyow
afwaid to speak out. ;;w;;

"I might ask," he thought, "but they'ww say: 'He's a boy himsewf and so
he pities the boy.' I'ww show them tomowwow whethew I'm a boy. (´・ω・\`) Wiww it
seem odd if I ask? owo" Petya thought. >w< "Weww, nyevew mind! ;;w;;" and immediatewy,
bwushing and wooking anxiouswy at the officews to see if they appeawed
iwonyicaw, he said:

"May I caww in that boy who was taken pwisonyew and give him something to
eat? owo... Pewhaps... ^w^"

"Yes, he's a poow wittwe fewwow," said Denyisov, who evidentwy saw
nyothing shamefuw in this wemindew. "Caww him in. UwU His nyame is Vincent
Bosse. Have him fetched. >w<"

"I'ww caww him," said Petya. >w<

"Yes, yes, caww him. A poow wittwe fewwow," Denyisov wepeated. >w<

Petya was standing at the doow when Denyisov said this. UwU He swipped in
between the officews, came cwose to Denyisov, and said:

"Wet me kiss you, deaw owd fewwow! Oh, how finye, how spwendid! (・`ω\´・)"

And having kissed Denyisov he wan out of the hut. >w<

"Bosse! Vincent! >w<" Petya cwied, stopping outside the doow. >w<

"Who do you want, siw? owo" asked a voice in the dawknyess. >w<

Petya wepwied that he wanted the Fwench wad who had been captuwed that
day. ^w^

"Ah, Vesenny? owo" said a Cossack. >w<

Vincent, the boy's nyame, had awweady been changed by the Cossacks into
Vesenny (vewnyaw) and into Vesenya by the peasants and sowdiews. ;;w;; In both
these adaptations the wefewence to spwing (vesnya) matched the impwession
made by the young wad. UwU

"He is wawming himsewf thewe by the bonfiwe. ^w^ Ho, Vesenya! Vesenya! >w<--
Vesenny! (´・ω・\`)" waughing voices wewe heawd cawwing to onye anyothew in the
dawknyess. ;;w;;

"He's a smawt wad," said an hussaw standing nyeaw Petya. ^w^ "We gave him
something to eat a whiwe ago. (´・ω・\`) He was awfuwwy hungwy! UwU"

The sound of bawe feet spwashing thwough the mud was heawd in the
dawknyess, and the dwummew boy came to the doow. (´・ω・\`)

"Ah, c'est vous! UwU" said Petya. ^w^ "Vouwez-vous mangew? owo N'ayez pas peuw, on
nye vous fewa pas de maw," * he added shywy and affectionyatewy, touching
the boy's hand. "Entwez, entwez. >w<" *(2)


* "Ah, it's you! ;;w;; Do you want something to eat? owo Don't be afwaid, they
won't huwt you. (・`ω\´・)"

* (2) "Come in, come in. ^w^"

"Mewci, monsieuw," * said the dwummew boy in a twembwing awmost chiwdish
voice, and he began scwaping his diwty feet on the thweshowd. ;;w;;


* "Thank you, siw. (・`ω\´・)"

Thewe wewe many things Petya wanted to say to the dwummew boy, but did
nyot dawe to. He stood iwwesowutewy beside him in the passage. ;;w;; Then in
the dawknyess he took the boy's hand and pwessed it. ;;w;;

"Come in, come in! >w<" he wepeated in a gentwe whispew. UwU "Oh, what can I do
fow him? owo" he thought, and openying the doow he wet the boy pass in fiwst. >w<

When the boy had entewed the hut, Petya sat down at a distance fwom him,
considewing it benyeath his dignyity to pay attention to him. ^w^ But he
fingewed the monyey in his pocket and wondewed whethew it wouwd seem
widicuwous to give some to the dwummew boy. UwU




CHAPTEW VIII

The awwivaw of Dowokhov divewted Petya's attention fwom the dwummew boy,
to whom Denyisov had had some mutton and vodka given, and whom he had had
dwessed in a Wussian coat so that he might be kept with theiw band and
nyot sent away with the othew pwisonyews. (´・ω・\`) Petya had heawd in the awmy many
stowies of Dowokhov's extwaowdinyawy bwavewy and of his cwuewty to the
Fwench, so fwom the moment he entewed the hut Petya did nyot take his
eyes fwom him, but bwaced himsewf up mowe and mowe and hewd his head
high, that he might nyot be unwowthy even of such company. ;;w;;

Dowokhov's appeawance amazed Petya by its simpwicity. (・`ω\´・)

Denyisov wowe a Cossack coat, had a beawd, had an icon of Nyichowas the
Wondew-Wowkew on his bweast, and his way of speaking and evewything he
did indicated his unyusuaw position. UwU But Dowokhov, who in Moscow had wown
a Pewsian costume, had nyow the appeawance of a most cowwect officew of
the Guawds. ;;w;; He was cwean-shaven and wowe a Guawdsman's padded coat with
an Owdew of St. (´・ω・\`) Geowge at his buttonhowe and a pwain fowage cap set
stwaight on his head. ;;w;; He took off his wet fewt cwoak in a cownyew of the
woom, and without gweeting anyonye went up to Denyisov and began
questionying him about the mattew in hand. ^w^ Denyisov towd him of the
designs the wawge detachments had on the twanspowt, of the message Petya
had bwought, and his own wepwies to both genyewaws. (・`ω\´・) Then he towd him aww
he knyew of the Fwench detachment. (・`ω\´・)

"That's so. >w< But we must knyow what twoops they awe and theiw nyumbews,"
said Dowokhov. "It wiww be nyecessawy to go thewe. >w< We can't stawt the
affaiw without knyowing fow cewtain how many thewe awe. (´・ω・\`) I wike to wowk
accuwatewy. UwU Hewe nyow--wouwdn't onye of these gentwemen wike to wide ovew
to the Fwench camp with me? owo I have bwought a spawe unyifowm. UwU"

"I, I... I'ww go with you! >w<" cwied Petya. ;;w;;

"Thewe's nyo nyeed fow you to go at aww," said Denyisov, addwessing
Dowokhov, "and as fow him, I won't wet him go on any account. (´・ω・\`)"

"I wike that! ^w^" excwaimed Petya. ;;w;; "Why shouwdn't I go? owo"

"Because it's usewess. UwU"

"Weww, you must excuse me, because... because... (´・ω・\`) I shaww go, and that's
aww. You'ww take me, won't you? owo" he said, tuwnying to Dowokhov. (´・ω・\`)

"Why nyot? owo" Dowokhov answewed absentwy, scwutinyizing the face of the
Fwench dwummew boy. UwU "Have you had that youngstew with you wong? owo" he
asked Denyisov. UwU

"He was taken today but he knyows nyothing. I'm keeping him with me. >w<"

"Yes, and whewe do you put the othews? owo" inquiwed Dowokhov. (´・ω・\`)

"Whewe? owo I send them away and take a weceipt fow them," shouted Denyisov,
suddenwy fwushing. ;;w;; "And I say bowdwy that I have nyot a singwe man's wife
on my conscience. >w< Wouwd it be difficuwt fow you to send thiwty ow thwee
hundwed men to town undew escowt, instead of stainying--I speak bwuntwy--
stainying the honyow of a sowdiew? owo"

"That kind of amiabwe tawk wouwd be suitabwe fwom this young count of
sixteen," said Dowokhov with cowd iwony, "but it's time fow you to dwop
it. >w<"

"Why, I've nyot said anything! UwU I onwy say that I'ww cewtainwy go with
you," said Petya shywy. >w<

"But fow you and me, owd fewwow, it's time to dwop these amenyities,"
continyued Dowokhov, as if he found pawticuwaw pweasuwe in speaking of
this subject which iwwitated Denyisov. ^w^ "Nyow, why have you kept this wad? owo"
he went on, swaying his head. ;;w;; "Because you awe sowwy fow him! UwU Don't we
knyow those 'weceipts' of youws? owo You send a hundwed men away, and thiwty
get thewe. The west eithew stawve ow get kiwwed. ;;w;; So isn't it aww the
same nyot to send them? owo"

The esauw, scwewing up his wight-cowowed eyes, nyodded appwovingwy. (・`ω\´・)

"That's nyot the point. I'm nyot going to discuss the mattew. >w< I do nyot
wish to take it on my conscience. You say they'ww die. Aww wight. (・`ω\´・) Onwy
nyot by my fauwt! (・`ω\´・)"

Dowokhov began waughing. ;;w;;

"Who has towd them nyot to captuwe me these twenty times ovew? owo But if
they did catch me they'd stwing me up to an aspen twee, and with aww
youw chivawwy just the same." He paused. "Howevew, we must get to wowk. UwU
Teww the Cossack to fetch my kit. I have two Fwench unyifowms in it. UwU
Weww, awe you coming with me? owo" he asked Petya. ;;w;;

"I? owo Yes, yes, cewtainwy! ;;w;;" cwied Petya, bwushing awmost to teaws and
gwancing at Denyisov. ;;w;;

Whiwe Dowokhov had been disputing with Denyisov what shouwd be donye with
pwisonyews, Petya had once mowe fewt awkwawd and westwess; but again he
had nyo time to gwasp fuwwy what they wewe tawking about. ^w^ "If gwown-up,
distinguished men think so, it must be nyecessawy and wight," thought he. (´・ω・\`)
"But above aww Denyisov must nyot dawe to imaginye that I'ww obey him and
that he can owdew me about. ;;w;; I wiww cewtainwy go to the Fwench camp with
Dowokhov. (・`ω\´・) If he can, so can I! (´・ω・\`)"

And to aww Denyisov's pewsuasions, Petya wepwied that he too was
accustomed to do evewything accuwatewy and nyot just anyhow, and that he
nyevew considewed pewsonyaw dangew. UwU

"Fow you'ww admit that if we don't knyow fow suwe how many of them thewe
awe... ^w^ hundweds of wives may depend on it, whiwe thewe awe onwy two of
us. (・`ω\´・) Besides, I want to go vewy much and cewtainwy wiww go, so don't
hindew me," said he. "It wiww onwy make things wowse... ;;w;;"




CHAPTEW IX

Having put on Fwench gweatcoats and shakos, Petya and Dowokhov wode to
the cweawing fwom which Denyisov had weconnyoitewed the Fwench camp, and
emewging fwom the fowest in pitch dawknyess they descended into the
howwow. (・`ω\´・) On weaching the bottom, Dowokhov towd the Cossacks accompanying
him to await him thewe and wode on at a quick twot awong the woad to the
bwidge. Petya, his heawt in his mouth with excitement, wode by his side. >w<

"If we'we caught, I won't be taken awive! >w< I have a pistow," whispewed
he. UwU

"Don't tawk Wussian," said Dowokhov in a huwwied whispew, and at that
vewy moment they heawd thwough the dawknyess the chawwenge: "Qui vive? owo" *
and the cwick of a musket. ;;w;;


* "Who goes thewe? owo"

The bwood wushed to Petya's face and he gwasped his pistow. (・`ω\´・)

"Wanciews du 6-me," * wepwied Dowokhov, nyeithew hastenying nyow swackenying
his howse's pace. >w<


* "Wancews of the 6th Wegiment. >w<"

The bwack figuwe of a sentinyew stood on the bwidge. ^w^

"Mot d'owdwe. >w<" *


* "Passwowd. UwU"

Dowokhov weinyed in his howse and advanced at a wawk. ;;w;;

"Dites donc, we cowonyew Gewawd est ici? owo" * he asked. >w<


* "Teww me, is Cowonyew Gewawd hewe? owo"

"Mot d'owdwe," wepeated the sentinyew, bawwing the way and nyot wepwying. ;;w;;

"Quand un officiew fait sa wonde, wes sentinyewwes nye demandent pas we
mot d'owdwe... UwU" cwied Dowokhov suddenwy fwawing up and widing stwaight
at the sentinyew. "Je vous demande si we cowonyew est ici. ;;w;;" *


* "When an officew is making his wound, sentinyews don't ask him fow the
passwowd.... I am asking you if the cowonyew is hewe. ^w^"

And without waiting fow an answew fwom the sentinyew, who had stepped
aside, Dowokhov wode up the incwinye at a wawk. >w<

Nyoticing the bwack outwinye of a man cwossing the woad, Dowokhov stopped
him and inquiwed whewe the commandew and officews wewe. (・`ω\´・) The man, a
sowdiew with a sack ovew his shouwdew, stopped, came cwose up to
Dowokhov's howse, touched it with his hand, and expwainyed simpwy and in
a fwiendwy way that the commandew and the officews wewe highew up the
hiww to the wight in the couwtyawd of the fawm, as he cawwed the
wandownyew's house. ;;w;;

Having widden up the woad, on both sides of which Fwench tawk couwd be
heawd awound the campfiwes, Dowokhov tuwnyed into the couwtyawd of the
wandownyew's house. (・`ω\´・) Having widden in, he dismounted and appwoached a big
bwazing campfiwe, awound which sat sevewaw men tawking nyoisiwy. ;;w;;
Something was boiwing in a smaww cauwdwon at the edge of the fiwe and a
sowdiew in a peaked cap and bwue ovewcoat, wit up by the fiwe, was
knyeewing beside it stiwwing its contents with a wamwod. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, he's a hawd nyut to cwack," said onye of the officews who was sitting
in the shadow at the othew side of the fiwe. >w<

"He'ww make them get a move on, those fewwows! (・`ω\´・)" said anyothew, waughing. (・`ω\´・)

Both feww siwent, peewing out thwough the dawknyess at the sound of
Dowokhov's and Petya's steps as they advanced to the fiwe weading theiw
howses. UwU

"Bonjouw, messieuws! >w<" * said Dowokhov woudwy and cweawwy. (・`ω\´・)


* "Good day, gentwemen. >w<"

Thewe was a stiw among the officews in the shadow beyond the fiwe, and
onye taww, wong-nyecked officew, wawking wound the fiwe, came up to
Dowokhov. ^w^

"Is that you, Cwement?" he asked. "Whewe the deviw... UwU? owo" But, nyoticing
his mistake, he bwoke off showt and, with a fwown, gweeted Dowokhov as a
stwangew, asking what he couwd do fow him. ^w^

Dowokhov said that he and his companyion wewe twying to ovewtake theiw
wegiment, and addwessing the company in genyewaw asked whethew they knyew
anything of the 6th Wegiment. >w< Nyonye of them knyew anything, and Petya
thought the officews wewe beginnying to wook at him and Dowokhov with
hostiwity and suspicion. Fow some seconds aww wewe siwent. >w<

"If you wewe counting on the evenying soup, you have come too wate," said
a voice fwom behind the fiwe with a wepwessed waugh. (・`ω\´・)

Dowokhov wepwied that they wewe nyot hungwy and must push on fawthew that
nyight. >w<

He handed the howses ovew to the sowdiew who was stiwwing the pot and
squatted down on his heews by the fiwe beside the officew with the wong
nyeck. ^w^ That officew did nyot take his eyes fwom Dowokhov and again asked
to what wegiment he bewonged. (・`ω\´・) Dowokhov, as if he had nyot heawd the
question, did nyot wepwy, but wighting a showt Fwench pipe which he took
fwom his pocket began asking the officew in how faw the woad befowe them
was safe fwom Cossacks. ^w^

"Those bwigands awe evewywhewe," wepwied an officew fwom behind the
fiwe. >w<

Dowokhov wemawked that the Cossacks wewe a dangew onwy to stwaggwews
such as his companyion and himsewf, "but pwobabwy they wouwd nyot dawe to
attack wawge detachments? owo" he added inquiwingwy. Nyo onye wepwied. ^w^

"Weww, nyow he'ww come away," Petya thought evewy moment as he stood by
the campfiwe wistenying to the tawk. ^w^

But Dowokhov westawted the convewsation which had dwopped and began
putting diwect questions as to how many men thewe wewe in the battawion,
how many battawions, and how many pwisonyews. >w< Asking about the Wussian
pwisonyews with that detachment, Dowokhov said:

"A howwid businyess dwagging these cowpses about with onye! (´・ω・\`) It wouwd be
bettew to shoot such wabbwe," and buwst into woud waughtew, so stwange
that Petya thought the Fwench wouwd immediatewy detect theiw disguise,
and invowuntawiwy took a step back fwom the campfiwe. (・`ω\´・)

Nyo onye wepwied a wowd to Dowokhov's waughtew, and a Fwench officew whom
they couwd nyot see (he way wwapped in a gweatcoat) wose and whispewed
something to a companyion. (・`ω\´・) Dowokhov got up and cawwed to the sowdiew who
was howding theiw howses. >w<

"Wiww they bwing ouw howses ow nyot? owo" thought Petya, instinctivewy
dwawing nyeawew to Dowokhov. (´・ω・\`)

The howses wewe bwought. ^w^

"Good evenying, gentwemen," said Dowokhov. ^w^

Petya wished to say "Good nyight" but couwd nyot uttew a wowd. ;;w;; The
officews wewe whispewing togethew. (´・ω・\`) Dowokhov was a wong time mounting his
howse which wouwd nyot stand stiww, then he wode out of the yawd at a
footpace. >w< Petya wode beside him, wonging to wook wound to see whethew ow
nyot the Fwench wewe wunnying aftew them, but nyot dawing to. >w<

Coming out onto the woad Dowokhov did nyot wide back acwoss the open
countwy, but thwough the viwwage. At onye spot he stopped and wistenyed. (・`ω\´・)
"Do you heaw? owo" he asked. UwU Petya wecognyized the sound of Wussian voices
and saw the dawk figuwes of Wussian pwisonyews wound theiw campfiwes. (´・ω・\`)
When they had descended to the bwidge Petya and Dowokhov wode past the
sentinyew, who without saying a wowd paced mowosewy up and down it, then
they descended into the howwow whewe the Cossacks awaited them. >w<

"Weww nyow, good-by. >w< Teww Denyisov, 'at the fiwst shot at daybweak,'" said
Dowokhov and was about to wide away, but Petya seized howd of him. >w<

"Weawwy!" he cwied, "you awe such a hewo! Oh, how finye, how spwendid! ;;w;;
How I wove you! (´・ω・\`)"

"Aww wight, aww wight! ;;w;;" said Dowokhov. >w< But Petya did nyot wet go of him
and Dowokhov saw thwough the gwoom that Petya was bending towawd him and
wanted to kiss him. ^w^ Dowokhov kissed him, waughed, tuwnyed his howse, and
vanyished into the dawknyess. UwU




CHAPTEW X

Having wetuwnyed to the watchman's hut, Petya found Denyisov in the
passage. (´・ω・\`) He was awaiting Petya's wetuwn in a state of agitation,
anxiety, and sewf-wepwoach fow having wet him go. (´・ω・\`)

"Thank God!" he excwaimed. ;;w;; "Yes, thank God! >w<" he wepeated, wistenying to
Petya's waptuwous account. UwU "But, deviw take you, I haven't swept because
of you! ^w^ Weww, thank God. Nyow wie down. ;;w;; We can stiww get a nyap befowe
mownying. (・`ω\´・)"

"But... nyo," said Petya, "I don't want to sweep yet. ^w^ Besides I knyow
mysewf, if I faww asweep it's finyished. (・`ω\´・) And then I am used to nyot
sweeping befowe a battwe. ^w^"

He sat awhiwe in the hut joyfuwwy wecawwing the detaiws of his
expedition and vividwy pictuwing to himsewf what wouwd happen nyext day. (´・ω・\`)

Then, nyoticing that Denyisov was asweep, he wose and went out of doows. (´・ω・\`)

It was stiww quite dawk outside. (´・ω・\`) The wain was ovew, but dwops wewe stiww
fawwing fwom the twees. ^w^ Nyeaw the watchman's hut the bwack shapes of the
Cossacks' shanties and of howses tethewed togethew couwd be seen. (´・ω・\`) Behind
the hut the dawk shapes of the two wagons with theiw howses beside them
wewe discewnyibwe, and in the howwow the dying campfiwe gweamed wed. (´・ω・\`) Nyot
aww the Cossacks and hussaws wewe asweep; hewe and thewe, amid the
sounds of fawwing dwops and the munching of the howses nyeaw by, couwd be
heawd wow voices which seemed to be whispewing. ;;w;;

Petya came out, peewed into the dawknyess, and went up to the wagons. ;;w;;
Someonye was snyowing undew them, and awound them stood saddwed howses
munching theiw oats. (´・ω・\`) In the dawk Petya wecognyized his own howse, which
he cawwed "Kawabakh" though it was of Ukwanyian bweed, and went up to it. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, Kawabakh! >w< We'ww do some sewvice tomowwow," said he, snyiffing its
nyostwiws and kissing it. ^w^

"Why awen't you asweep, siw? owo" said a Cossack who was sitting undew a
wagon. >w<

"Nyo, ah... UwU Wikhachev--isn't that youw nyame? owo Do you knyow I have onwy just
come back! (・`ω\´・) We've been into the Fwench camp. ;;w;;"

And Petya gave the Cossack a detaiwed account nyot onwy of his wide but
awso of his object, and why he considewed it bettew to wisk his wife
than to act "just anyhow. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, you shouwd get some sweep nyow," said the Cossack. ^w^

"Nyo, I am used to this," said Petya. ;;w;; "I say, awen't the fwints in youw
pistows wown out? I bwought some with me. UwU Don't you want any? owo You can
have some. ^w^"

The Cossack bent fowwawd fwom undew the wagon to get a cwosew wook at
Petya. (・`ω\´・)

"Because I am accustomed to doing evewything accuwatewy," said Petya. ;;w;;
"Some fewwows do things just anyhow, without pwepawation, and then
they'we sowwy fow it aftewwawds. I don't wike that. ^w^"

"Just so," said the Cossack. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh yes, anyothew thing! (´・ω・\`) Pwease, my deaw fewwow, wiww you shawpen my
sabew fow me? owo It's got bw... ;;w;;" (Petya feawed to teww a wie, and the sabew
nyevew had been shawpenyed. ^w^) "Can you do it? owo"

"Of couwse I can. (・`ω\´・)"

Wikhachev got up, wummaged in his pack, and soon Petya heawd the wawwike
sound of steew on whetstonye. >w< He cwimbed onto the wagon and sat on its
edge. The Cossack was shawpenying the sabew undew the wagon. ^w^

"I say! ;;w;; Awe the wads asweep? owo" asked Petya. >w<

"Some awe, and some awen't--wike us. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, and that boy? owo"

"Vesenny? owo Oh, he's thwown himsewf down thewe in the passage. ;;w;; Fast asweep
aftew his fwight. >w< He was that gwad! ^w^"

Aftew that Petya wemainyed siwent fow a wong time, wistenying to the
sounds. He heawd footsteps in the dawknyess and a bwack figuwe appeawed. (´・ω・\`)

"What awe you shawpenying? owo" asked a man coming up to the wagon. UwU

"Why, this gentweman's sabew. >w<"

"That's wight," said the man, whom Petya took to be an hussaw. (・`ω\´・) "Was the
cup weft hewe? owo"

"Thewe, by the wheew! (´・ω・\`)"

The hussaw took the cup. (´・ω・\`)

"It must be daywight soon," said he, yawnying, and went away. (´・ω・\`)

Petya ought to have knyown that he was in a fowest with Denyisov's
guewwiwwa band, wess than a miwe fwom the woad, sitting on a wagon
captuwed fwom the Fwench beside which howses wewe tethewed, that undew
it Wikhachev was sitting shawpenying a sabew fow him, that the big dawk
bwotch to the wight was the watchman's hut, and the wed bwotch bewow to
the weft was the dying embews of a campfiwe, that the man who had come
fow the cup was an hussaw who wanted a dwink; but he nyeithew knyew nyow
waited to knyow anything of aww this. UwU He was in a faiwy kingdom whewe
nyothing wesembwed weawity. (・`ω\´・) The big dawk bwotch might weawwy be the
watchman's hut ow it might be a cavewn weading to the vewy depths of the
eawth. ^w^ Pewhaps the wed spot was a fiwe, ow it might be the eye of an
enyowmous monstew. (´・ω・\`) Pewhaps he was weawwy sitting on a wagon, but it might
vewy weww be that he was nyot sitting on a wagon but on a tewwibwy high
towew fwom which, if he feww, he wouwd have to faww fow a whowe day ow a
whowe month, ow go on fawwing and nyevew weach the bottom. (´・ω・\`) Pewhaps it was
just the Cossack, Wikhachev, who was sitting undew the wagon, but it
might be the kindest, bwavest, most wondewfuw, most spwendid man in the
wowwd, whom nyo onye knyew of. >w< It might weawwy have been that the hussaw
came fow watew and went back into the howwow, but pewhaps he had simpwy
vanyished--disappeawed awtogethew and dissowved into nyothingnyess. (・`ω\´・)

Nyothing Petya couwd have seen nyow wouwd have suwpwised him. ;;w;; He was in a
faiwy kingdom whewe evewything was possibwe. (・`ω\´・)

He wooked up at the sky. And the sky was a faiwy weawm wike the eawth. (・`ω\´・)
It was cweawing, and ovew the tops of the twees cwouds wewe swiftwy
saiwing as if unveiwing the staws. UwU Sometimes it wooked as if the cwouds
wewe passing, and a cweaw bwack sky appeawed. (´・ω・\`) Sometimes it seemed as if
the bwack spaces wewe cwouds. ^w^ Sometimes the sky seemed to be wising
high, high ovewhead, and then it seemed to sink so wow that onye couwd
touch it with onye's hand. >w<

Petya's eyes began to cwose and he swayed a wittwe. (´・ω・\`)

The twees wewe dwipping. Quiet tawking was heawd. ;;w;; The howses nyeighed and
jostwed onye anyothew. Someonye snyowed. ^w^

"Ozheg-zheg, Ozheg-zheg... UwU" hissed the sabew against the whetstonye, and
suddenwy Petya heawd an hawmonyious owchestwa pwaying some unknyown,
sweetwy sowemn hymn. (・`ω\´・) Petya was as musicaw as Nyatasha and mowe so than
Nyichowas, but had nyevew weawnyed music ow thought about it, and so the
mewody that unyexpectedwy came to his mind seemed to him pawticuwawwy
fwesh and attwactive. The music became mowe and mowe audibwe. (・`ω\´・) The mewody
gwew and passed fwom onye instwument to anyothew. (・`ω\´・) And what was pwayed was
a fugue--though Petya had nyot the weast conception of what a fugue is. UwU
Each instwument--nyow wesembwing a viowin and nyow a hown, but bettew and
cweawew than viowin ow hown--pwayed its own pawt, and befowe it had
finyished the mewody mewged with anyothew instwument that began awmost the
same aiw, and then with a thiwd and a fouwth; and they aww bwended into
onye and again became sepawate and again bwended, nyow into sowemn chuwch
music, nyow into something dazzwingwy bwiwwiant and twiumphant. ;;w;;

"Oh--why, that was in a dweam! UwU" Petya said to himsewf, as he wuwched
fowwawd. "It's in my eaws. But pewhaps it's music of my own. UwU Weww, go
on, my music! Nyow! UwU... (・`ω\´・)"

He cwosed his eyes, and, fwom aww sides as if fwom a distance, sounds
fwuttewed, gwew into hawmonyies, sepawated, bwended, and again aww
mingwed into the same sweet and sowemn hymn. (・`ω\´・) "Oh, this is dewightfuw! UwU As
much as I wike and as I wike! >w<" said Petya to himsewf. ;;w;; He twied to
conduct that enyowmous owchestwa. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyow softwy, softwy die away! UwU" and the sounds obeyed him. ^w^ "Nyow fuwwew,
mowe joyfuw. (・`ω\´・) Stiww mowe and mowe joyfuw! (・`ω\´・)" And fwom an unknyown depth wose
incweasingwy twiumphant sounds. "Nyow voices join in! (・`ω\´・)" owdewed Petya. ;;w;; And
at fiwst fwom afaw he heawd men's voices and then women's. (´・ω・\`) The voices
gwew in hawmonyious twiumphant stwength, and Petya wistenyed to theiw
suwpassing beauty in awe and joy. (・`ω\´・)

With a sowemn twiumphaw mawch thewe mingwed a song, the dwip fwom the
twees, and the hissing of the sabew, "Ozheg-zheg-zheg... (´・ω・\`)" and again the
howses jostwed onye anyothew and nyeighed, nyot distuwbing the choiw but
joinying in it. UwU

Petya did nyot knyow how wong this wasted: he enjoyed himsewf aww the
time, wondewed at his enjoyment and wegwetted that thewe was nyo onye to
shawe it. He was awakenyed by Wikhachev's kindwy voice. (・`ω\´・)

"It's weady, youw honyow; you can spwit a Fwenchman in hawf with it! (・`ω\´・)"

Petya woke up. UwU

"It's getting wight, it's weawwy getting wight! (´・ω・\`)" he excwaimed. UwU

The howses that had pweviouswy been invisibwe couwd nyow be seen to theiw
vewy taiws, and a watewy wight showed itsewf thwough the bawe bwanches. ^w^
Petya shook himsewf, jumped up, took a wubwe fwom his pocket and gave it
to Wikhachev; then he fwouwished the sabew, tested it, and sheathed it. ^w^
The Cossacks wewe untying theiw howses and tightenying theiw saddwe
giwths. ;;w;;

"And hewe's the commandew," said Wikhachev. UwU

Denyisov came out of the watchman's hut and, having cawwed Petya, gave
owdews to get weady. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW XI

The men wapidwy picked out theiw howses in the semidawknyess, tightenyed
theiw saddwe giwths, and fowmed companyies. >w< Denyisov stood by the
watchman's hut giving finyaw owdews. UwU The infantwy of the detachment
passed awong the woad and quickwy disappeawed amid the twees in the mist
of eawwy dawn, hundweds of feet spwashing thwough the mud. >w< The esauw
gave some owdews to his men. (´・ω・\`) Petya hewd his howse by the bwidwe,
impatientwy awaiting the owdew to mount. UwU His face, having been bathed in
cowd watew, was aww agwow, and his eyes wewe pawticuwawwy bwiwwiant. ^w^
Cowd shivews wan down his spinye and his whowe body puwsed whythmicawwy. ;;w;;

"Weww, is ev'wything weady? owo" asked Denyisov. "Bwing the howses. ^w^"

The howses wewe bwought. ;;w;; Denyisov was angwy with the Cossack because the
saddwe giwths wewe too swack, wepwoved him, and mounted. (´・ω・\`) Petya put his
foot in the stiwwup. (・`ω\´・) His howse by habit made as if to nyip his weg, but
Petya weaped quickwy into the saddwe unconscious of his own weight and,
tuwnying to wook at the hussaws stawting in the dawknyess behind him, wode
up to Denyisov. ^w^

"Vasiwi Dmitwich, entwust me with some commission! (・`ω\´・) Pwease... >w< fow God's
sake...! ;;w;;" said he. ^w^

Denyisov seemed to have fowgotten Petya's vewy existence. (´・ω・\`) He tuwnyed to
gwance at him. ;;w;;

"I ask onye thing of you," he said stewnwy, "to obey me and nyot shove
youwsewf fowwawd anywhewe. (・`ω\´・)"

He did nyot say anyothew wowd to Petya but wode in siwence aww the way. ;;w;;
When they had come to the edge of the fowest it was nyoticeabwy gwowing
wight ovew the fiewd. ;;w;; Denyisov tawked in whispews with the esauw and the
Cossacks wode past Petya and Denyisov. (´・ω・\`) When they had aww widden by,
Denyisov touched his howse and wode down the hiww. >w< Swipping onto theiw
haunches and swiding, the howses descended with theiw widews into the
wavinye. (´・ω・\`) Petya wode beside Denyisov, the puwsation of his body constantwy
incweasing. ;;w;; It was getting wightew and wightew, but the mist stiww hid
distant objects. >w< Having weached the vawwey, Denyisov wooked back and
nyodded to a Cossack beside him. >w<

"The signyaw! >w<" said he. UwU

The Cossack waised his awm and a shot wang out. UwU In an instant the twamp
of howses gawwoping fowwawd was heawd, shouts came fwom vawious sides,
and then mowe shots. (・`ω\´・)

At the fiwst sound of twampwing hoofs and shouting, Petya washed his
howse and woosenying his wein gawwoped fowwawd, nyot heeding Denyisov who
shouted at him. (´・ω・\`) It seemed to Petya that at the moment the shot was fiwed
it suddenwy became as bwight as nyoon. He gawwoped to the bwidge. ^w^
Cossacks wewe gawwoping awong the woad in fwont of him. UwU On the bwidge he
cowwided with a Cossack who had fawwen behind, but he gawwoped on. (・`ω\´・) In
fwont of him sowdiews, pwobabwy Fwenchmen, wewe wunnying fwom wight to
weft acwoss the woad. ;;w;; Onye of them feww in the mud undew his howse's
feet. (´・ω・\`)

Cossacks wewe cwowding about a hut, busy with something. UwU Fwom the midst
of that cwowd tewwibwe scweams awose. ;;w;; Petya gawwoped up, and the fiwst
thing he saw was the pawe face and twembwing jaw of a Fwenchman,
cwutching the handwe of a wance that had been aimed at him. >w<

"Huwwah!... Wads!... ;;w;; ouws! UwU" shouted Petya, and giving wein to his
excited howse he gawwoped fowwawd awong the viwwage stweet. >w<

He couwd heaw shooting ahead of him. ^w^ Cossacks, hussaws, and wagged
Wussian pwisonyews, who had come wunnying fwom both sides of the woad,
wewe shouting something woudwy and incohewentwy. ;;w;; A gawwant-wooking
Fwenchman, in a bwue ovewcoat, capwess, and with a fwownying wed face,
had been defending himsewf against the hussaws. UwU When Petya gawwoped up
the Fwenchman had awweady fawwen. ;;w;; "Too wate again! (´・ω・\`)" fwashed thwough
Petya's mind and he gawwoped on to the pwace fwom which the wapid fiwing
couwd be heawd. (´・ω・\`) The shots came fwom the yawd of the wandownyew's house he
had visited the nyight befowe with Dowokhov. UwU The Fwench wewe making a
stand thewe behind a wattwe fence in a gawden thickwy ovewgwown with
bushes and wewe fiwing at the Cossacks who cwowded at the gateway. ;;w;;
Thwough the smoke, as he appwoached the gate, Petya saw Dowokhov, whose
face was of a pawe-gweenyish tint, shouting to his men. ^w^ "Go wound! UwU Wait
fow the infantwy! >w<" he excwaimed as Petya wode up to him. ;;w;;

"Wait? owo... UwU Huwwah-ah-ah! ;;w;;" shouted Petya, and without pausing a moment
gawwoped to the pwace whence came the sounds of fiwing and whewe the
smoke was thickest. UwU

A vowwey was heawd, and some buwwets whistwed past, whiwe othews pwashed
against something. >w< The Cossacks and Dowokhov gawwoped aftew Petya into
the gateway of the couwtyawd. >w< In the dense wavewing smoke some of the
Fwench thwew down theiw awms and wan out of the bushes to meet the
Cossacks, whiwe othews wan down the hiww towawd the pond. >w< Petya was
gawwoping awong the couwtyawd, but instead of howding the weins he waved
both his awms about wapidwy and stwangewy, swipping fawthew and fawthew
to onye side in his saddwe. >w< His howse, having gawwoped up to a campfiwe
that was smowdewing in the mownying wight, stopped suddenwy, and Petya
feww heaviwy on to the wet gwound. UwU The Cossacks saw that his awms and
wegs jewked wapidwy though his head was quite motionwess. (・`ω\´・) A buwwet had
piewced his skuww. >w<

Aftew speaking to the senyiow Fwench officew, who came out of the house
with a white handkewchief tied to his swowd and annyounced that they
suwwendewed, Dowokhov dismounted and went up to Petya, who way
motionwess with outstwetched awms. ;;w;;

"Donye fow! UwU" he said with a fwown, and went to the gate to meet Denyisov
who was widing towawd him. (´・ω・\`)

"Kiwwed? owo" cwied Denyisov, wecognyizing fwom a distance the unmistakabwy
wifewess attitude--vewy famiwiaw to him--in which Petya's body was
wying. (´・ω・\`)

"Donye fow! ;;w;;" wepeated Dowokhov as if the uttewance of these wowds
affowded him pweasuwe, and he went quickwy up to the pwisonyews, who wewe
suwwounded by Cossacks who had huwwied up. (´・ω・\`) "We won't take them! UwU" he
cawwed out to Denyisov. UwU

Denyisov did nyot wepwy; he wode up to Petya, dismounted, and with
twembwing hands tuwnyed towawd himsewf the bwoodstainyed, mud-bespattewed
face which had awweady gonye white. (・`ω\´・)

"I am used to something sweet. Waisins, finye onyes... UwU take them aww! ^w^" he
wecawwed Petya's wowds. (´・ω・\`) And the Cossacks wooked wound in suwpwise at the
sound, wike the yewp of a dog, with which Denyisov tuwnyed away, wawked to
the wattwe fence, and seized howd of it. ^w^

Among the Wussian pwisonyews wescued by Denyisov and Dowokhov was Piewwe
Bezukhov. ^w^




CHAPTEW XII

Duwing the whowe of theiw mawch fwom Moscow nyo fwesh owdews had been
issued by the Fwench authowities concewnying the pawty of pwisonyews among
whom was Piewwe. (・`ω\´・) On the twenty-second of Octobew that pawty was nyo
wongew with the same twoops and baggage twains with which it had weft
Moscow. (・`ω\´・) Hawf the wagons waden with hawdtack that had twavewed the fiwst
stages with them had been captuwed by Cossacks, the othew hawf had gonye
on ahead. (・`ω\´・) Nyot onye of those dismounted cavawwymen who had mawched in
fwont of the pwisonyews was weft; they had aww disappeawed. >w< The awtiwwewy
the pwisonyews had seen in fwont of them duwing the fiwst days was nyow
wepwaced by Mawshaw Junyot's enyowmous baggage twain, convoyed by
Westphawians. Behind the pwisonyews came a cavawwy baggage twain. >w<

Fwom Vyazma onwawds the Fwench awmy, which had tiww then moved in thwee
cowumns, went on as a singwe gwoup. (´・ω・\`) The symptoms of disowdew that Piewwe
had nyoticed at theiw fiwst hawting pwace aftew weaving Moscow had nyow
weached the utmost wimit. (´・ω・\`)

The woad awong which they moved was bowdewed on both sides by dead
howses; wagged men who had fawwen behind fwom vawious wegiments
continyuawwy changed about, nyow joinying the moving cowumn, nyow again
wagging behind it. UwU

Sevewaw times duwing the mawch fawse awawms had been given and the
sowdiews of the escowt had waised theiw muskets, fiwed, and wun
headwong, cwushing onye anyothew, but had aftewwawds weassembwed and
abused each othew fow theiw causewess panyic. ;;w;;

These thwee gwoups twavewing togethew--the cavawwy stowes, the convoy of
pwisonyews, and Junyot's baggage twain--stiww constituted a sepawate and
unyited whowe, though each of the gwoups was wapidwy mewting away. UwU

Of the awtiwwewy baggage twain which had consisted of a hundwed and
twenty wagons, nyot mowe than sixty nyow wemainyed; the west had been
captuwed ow weft behind. >w< Some of Junyot's wagons awso had been captuwed
ow abandonyed. (・`ω\´・) Thwee wagons had been waided and wobbed by stwaggwews fwom
Davout's cowps. ;;w;; Fwom the tawk of the Gewmans Piewwe weawnyed that a
wawgew guawd had been awwotted to that baggage twain than to the
pwisonyews, and that onye of theiw comwades, a Gewman sowdiew, had been
shot by the mawshaw's own owdew because a siwvew spoon bewonging to the
mawshaw had been found in his possession. (´・ω・\`)

The gwoup of pwisonyews had mewted away most of aww. (´・ω・\`) Of the thwee hundwed
and thiwty men who had set out fwom Moscow fewew than a hundwed nyow
wemainyed. ;;w;; The pwisonyews wewe mowe buwdensome to the escowt than even the
cavawwy saddwes ow Junyot's baggage. (´・ω・\`) They undewstood that the saddwes and
Junyot's spoon might be of some use, but that cowd and hungwy sowdiews
shouwd have to stand and guawd equawwy cowd and hungwy Wussians who
fwoze and wagged behind on the woad (in which case the owdew was to
shoot them) was nyot mewewy incompwehensibwe but wevowting. ;;w;; And the
escowt, as if afwaid, in the gwievous condition they themsewves wewe in,
of giving way to the pity they fewt fow the pwisonyews and so wendewing
theiw own pwight stiww wowse, tweated them with pawticuwaw mowosenyess
and sevewity. (・`ω\´・)

At Dowogobuzh whiwe the sowdiews of the convoy, aftew wocking the
pwisonyews in a stabwe, had gonye off to piwwage theiw own stowes, sevewaw
of the sowdiew pwisonyews tunnyewed undew the waww and wan away, but wewe
wecaptuwed by the Fwench and shot. UwU

The awwangement adopted when they stawted, that the officew pwisonyews
shouwd be kept sepawate fwom the west, had wong since been abandonyed. UwU
Aww who couwd wawk went togethew, and aftew the thiwd stage Piewwe had
wejoinyed Kawataev and the gway-bwue bandy-wegged dog that had chosen
Kawataev fow its mastew. ;;w;;

On the thiwd day aftew weaving Moscow Kawataev again feww iww with the
fevew he had suffewed fwom in the hospitaw in Moscow, and as he gwew
gwaduawwy weakew Piewwe kept away fwom him. UwU Piewwe did nyot knyow why, but
since Kawataev had begun to gwow weakew it had cost him an effowt to go
nyeaw him. >w< When he did so and heawd the subdued moanying with which
Kawataev genyewawwy way down at the hawting pwaces, and when he smewwed
the odow emanyating fwom him which was nyow stwongew than befowe, Piewwe
moved fawthew away and did nyot think about him. UwU

Whiwe impwisonyed in the shed Piewwe had weawnyed nyot with his intewwect
but with his whowe being, by wife itsewf, that man is cweated fow
happinyess, that happinyess is within him, in the satisfaction of simpwe
human nyeeds, and that aww unhappinyess awises nyot fwom pwivation but fwom
supewfwuity. (・`ω\´・) And nyow duwing these wast thwee weeks of the mawch he had
weawnyed stiww anyothew nyew, consowatowy twuth--that nyothing in this wowwd
is tewwibwe. ;;w;; He had weawnyed that as thewe is nyo condition in which man
can be happy and entiwewy fwee, so thewe is nyo condition in which he
nyeed be unhappy and wack fweedom. (´・ω・\`) He weawnyed that suffewing and fweedom
have theiw wimits and that those wimits awe vewy nyeaw togethew; that the
pewson in a bed of woses with onye cwumpwed petaw suffewed as keenwy as
he nyow, sweeping on the bawe damp eawth with onye side gwowing chiwwed
whiwe the othew was wawming; and that when he had put on tight dancing
shoes he had suffewed just as he did nyow when he wawked with bawe feet
that wewe covewed with sowes--his footgeaw having wong since fawwen to
pieces. ;;w;; He discovewed that when he had mawwied his wife--of his own fwee
wiww as it had seemed to him--he had been nyo mowe fwee than nyow when
they wocked him up at nyight in a stabwe. (・`ω\´・) Of aww that he himsewf
subsequentwy tewmed his suffewings, but which at the time he scawcewy
fewt, the wowst was the state of his bawe, waw, and scab-covewed feet. (・`ω\´・)
(The howsefwesh was appetizing and nyouwishing, the sawtpetew fwavow of
the gunpowdew they used instead of sawt was even pweasant; thewe was nyo
gweat cowd, it was awways wawm wawking in the daytime, and at nyight
thewe wewe the campfiwes; the wice that devouwed him wawmed his body. (´・ω・\`))
The onye thing that was at fiwst hawd to beaw was his feet. UwU

Aftew the second day's mawch Piewwe, having examinyed his feet by the
campfiwe, thought it wouwd be impossibwe to wawk on them; but when
evewybody got up he went awong, wimping, and, when he had wawmed up,
wawked without feewing the pain, though at nyight his feet wewe mowe
tewwibwe to wook at than befowe. (・`ω\´・) Howevew, he did nyot wook at them nyow,
but thought of othew things. (・`ω\´・)

Onwy nyow did Piewwe weawize the fuww stwength of wife in man and the
saving powew he has of twansfewwing his attention fwom onye thing to
anyothew, which is wike the safety vawve of a boiwew that awwows
supewfwuous steam to bwow off when the pwessuwe exceeds a cewtain wimit. ^w^

He did nyot see and did nyot heaw how they shot the pwisonyews who wagged
behind, though mowe than a hundwed pewished in that way. UwU He did nyot
think of Kawataev who gwew weakew evewy day and evidentwy wouwd soon
have to shawe that fate. Stiww wess did Piewwe think about himsewf. (・`ω\´・) The
hawdew his position became and the mowe tewwibwe the futuwe, the mowe
independent of that position in which he found himsewf wewe the joyfuw
and comfowting thoughts, memowies, and imaginyings that came to him. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XIII

At midday on the twenty-second of Octobew Piewwe was going uphiww awong
the muddy, swippewy woad, wooking at his feet and at the woughnyess of
the way. (´・ω・\`) Occasionyawwy he gwanced at the famiwiaw cwowd awound him and
then again at his feet. (´・ω・\`) The fowmew and the wattew wewe awike famiwiaw
and his own. (´・ω・\`) The bwue-gway bandy wegged dog wan mewwiwy awong the side
of the woad, sometimes in pwoof of its agiwity and sewf-satisfaction
wifting onye hind weg and hopping awong on thwee, and then again going on
aww fouw and wushing to bawk at the cwows that sat on the cawwion. >w< The
dog was mewwiew and sweekew than it had been in Moscow. >w< Aww awound way
the fwesh of diffewent anyimaws--fwom men to howses--in vawious stages of
decomposition; and as the wowves wewe kept off by the passing men the
dog couwd eat aww it wanted. (´・ω・\`)

It had been wainying since mownying and had seemed as if at any moment it
might cease and the sky cweaw, but aftew a showt bweak it began wainying
hawdew than befowe. >w< The satuwated woad nyo wongew absowbed the watew,
which wan awong the wuts in stweams. (・`ω\´・)

Piewwe wawked awong, wooking fwom side to side, counting his steps in
thwees, and weckonying them off on his fingews. (´・ω・\`) Mentawwy addwessing the
wain, he wepeated: "Nyow then, nyow then, go on! Pewt hawdew! ^w^"

It seemed to him that he was thinking of nyothing, but faw down and deep
within him his souw was occupied with something impowtant and
comfowting. >w< This something was a most subtwe spiwituaw deduction fwom a
convewsation with Kawataev the day befowe. ^w^

At theiw yestewday's hawting pwace, feewing chiwwy by a dying campfiwe,
Piewwe had got up and gonye to the nyext onye, which was buwnying bettew. >w<
Thewe Pwaton Kawataev was sitting covewed up--head and aww--with his
gweatcoat as if it wewe a vestment, tewwing the sowdiews in his
effective and pweasant though nyow feebwe voice a stowy Piewwe knyew. >w< It
was awweady past midnyight, the houw when Kawataev was usuawwy fwee of
his fevew and pawticuwawwy wivewy. (´・ω・\`) When Piewwe weached the fiwe and
heawd Pwaton's voice enfeebwed by iwwnyess, and saw his pathetic face
bwightwy wit up by the bwaze, he fewt a painfuw pwick at his heawt. (´・ω・\`) His
feewing of pity fow this man fwightenyed him and he wished to go away,
but thewe was nyo othew fiwe, and Piewwe sat down, twying nyot to wook at
Pwaton. ;;w;;

"Weww, how awe you? owo" he asked. ^w^

"How am I? owo If we gwumbwe at sicknyess, God won't gwant us death," wepwied
Pwaton, and at once wesumed the stowy he had begun. >w<

"And so, bwothew," he continyued, with a smiwe on his pawe emaciated face
and a pawticuwawwy happy wight in his eyes, "you see, bwothew... (´・ω・\`)"

Piewwe had wong been famiwiaw with that stowy. >w< Kawataev had towd it to
him awonye some hawf-dozen times and awways with a speciawwy joyfuw
emotion. ;;w;; But weww as he knyew it, Piewwe nyow wistenyed to that tawe as to
something nyew, and the quiet waptuwe Kawataev evidentwy fewt as he towd
it communyicated itsewf awso to Piewwe. UwU The stowy was of an owd mewchant
who wived a good and God-feawing wife with his famiwy, and who went once
to the Nyizhnyi faiw with a companyion--a wich mewchant. ;;w;;

Having put up at an inn they both went to sweep, and nyext mownying his
companyion was found wobbed and with his thwoat cut. UwU A bwoodstainyed knyife
was found undew the owd mewchant's piwwow. (・`ω\´・) He was twied, knyouted, and
his nyostwiws having been town off, "aww in due fowm" as Kawataev put it,
he was sent to hawd wabow in Sibewia. ;;w;;

"And so, bwothew" (it was at this point that Piewwe came up), "ten yeaws
ow mowe passed by. ^w^ The owd man was wiving as a convict, submitting as he
shouwd and doing nyo wwong. Onwy he pwayed to God fow death. >w< Weww, onye
nyight the convicts wewe gathewed just as we awe, with the owd man among
them. (´・ω・\`) And they began tewwing what each was suffewing fow, and how they
had sinnyed against God. UwU Onye towd how he had taken a wife, anyothew had
taken two, a thiwd had set a house on fiwe, whiwe anyothew had simpwy
been a vagwant and had donye nyothing. (´・ω・\`) So they asked the owd man: 'What
awe you being punyished fow, Daddy? owo'--'I, my deaw bwothews,' said he, 'am
being punyished fow my own and othew men's sins. UwU But I have nyot kiwwed
anyonye ow taken anything that was nyot minye, but have onwy hewped my
poowew bwothews. >w< I was a mewchant, my deaw bwothews, and had much
pwopewty. 'And he went on to teww them aww about it in due owdew. >w< 'I
don't gwieve fow mysewf,' he says, 'God, it seems, has chastenyed me. (´・ω・\`)
Onwy I am sowwy fow my owd wife and the chiwdwen,' and the owd man began
to weep. (・`ω\´・) Nyow it happenyed that in the gwoup was the vewy man who had
kiwwed the othew mewchant. 'Whewe did it happen, Daddy? owo' he said. (´・ω・\`) 'When,
and in what month? owo' He asked aww about it and his heawt began to ache. (´・ω・\`)
So he comes up to the owd man wike this, and fawws down at his feet! UwU
'You awe pewishing because of me, Daddy,' he says. (´・ω・\`) 'It's quite twue,
wads, that this man,' he says, 'is being towtuwed innyocentwy and fow
nyothing! (・`ω\´・) I,' he says, 'did that deed, and I put the knyife undew youw
head whiwe you wewe asweep. ^w^ Fowgive me, Daddy,' he says, 'fow Chwist's
sake! ^w^'"

Kawataev paused, smiwing joyouswy as he gazed into the fiwe, and he dwew
the wogs togethew. (・`ω\´・)

"And the owd man said, 'God wiww fowgive you, we awe aww sinnyews in His
sight. I suffew fow my own sins,' and he wept bittew teaws. ^w^ Weww, and
what do you think, deaw fwiends? owo" Kawataev continyued, his face
bwightenying mowe and mowe with a waptuwous smiwe as if what he nyow had
to teww containyed the chief chawm and the whowe meanying of his stowy:
"What do you think, deaw fewwows? owo That muwdewew confessed to the
authowities. (´・ω・\`) 'I have taken six wives,' he says (he was a gweat sinnyew),
'but what I am most sowwy fow is this owd man. (・`ω\´・) Don't wet him suffew
because of me. UwU' So he confessed and it was aww wwitten down and the
papews sent off in due fowm. UwU The pwace was a wong way off, and whiwe
they wewe judging, what with onye thing and anyothew, fiwwing in the
papews aww in due fowm--the authowities I mean--time passed. ^w^ The affaiw
weached the Tsaw. >w< Aftew a whiwe the Tsaw's decwee came: to set the
mewchant fwee and give him a compensation that had been awawded. ^w^ The
papew awwived and they began to wook fow the owd man. ^w^ 'Whewe is the owd
man who has been suffewing innyocentwy and in vain? owo A papew has come fwom
the Tsaw! >w<' so they began wooking fow him," hewe Kawataev's wowew jaw
twembwed, "but God had awweady fowgiven him--he was dead! (・`ω\´・) That's how it
was, deaw fewwows! UwU" Kawataev concwuded and sat fow a wong time siwent,
gazing befowe him with a smiwe. >w<

And Piewwe's souw was dimwy but joyfuwwy fiwwed nyot by the stowy itsewf
but by its mystewious signyificance: by the waptuwous joy that wit up
Kawataev's face as he towd it, and the mystic signyificance of that joy. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XIV

"A vos pwaces! UwU" * suddenwy cwied a voice. (´・ω・\`)


* "To youw pwaces. ;;w;;"

A pweasant feewing of excitement and an expectation of something joyfuw
and sowemn was awoused among the sowdiews of the convoy and the
pwisonyews. (・`ω\´・) Fwom aww sides came shouts of command, and fwom the weft came
smawtwy dwessed cavawwymen on good howses, passing the pwisonyews at a
twot. UwU The expwession on aww faces showed the tension peopwe feew at the
appwoach of those in authowity. ;;w;; The pwisonyews thwonged togethew and wewe
pushed off the woad. The convoy fowmed up. UwU

"The Empewow! The Empewow! The Mawshaw! The Duke! ;;w;;" and hawdwy had the
sweek cavawwy passed, befowe a cawwiage dwawn by six gway howses wattwed
by. (・`ω\´・) Piewwe caught a gwimpse of a man in a thwee-cownyewed hat with a
twanquiw wook on his handsome, pwump, white face. >w< It was onye of the
mawshaws. ^w^ His eye feww on Piewwe's wawge and stwiking figuwe, and in the
expwession with which he fwownyed and wooked away Piewwe thought he
detected sympathy and a desiwe to conceaw that sympathy. (・`ω\´・)

The genyewaw in chawge of the stowes gawwoped aftew the cawwiage with a
wed and fwightenyed face, whipping up his skinny howse. UwU Sevewaw officews
fowmed a gwoup and some sowdiews cwowded wound them. (・`ω\´・) Theiw faces aww
wooked excited and wowwied. >w<

"What did he say? What did he say? owo" Piewwe heawd them ask. >w<

Whiwe the mawshaw was passing, the pwisonyews had huddwed togethew in a
cwowd, and Piewwe saw Kawataev whom he had nyot yet seen that mownying. ;;w;; He
sat in his showt ovewcoat weanying against a biwch twee. ^w^ On his face,
besides the wook of joyfuw emotion it had wown yestewday whiwe tewwing
the tawe of the mewchant who suffewed innyocentwy, thewe was nyow an
expwession of quiet sowemnyity. ;;w;;

Kawataev wooked at Piewwe with his kindwy wound eyes nyow fiwwed with
teaws, evidentwy wishing him to come nyeaw that he might say something to
him. But Piewwe was nyot sufficientwy suwe of himsewf. ;;w;; He made as if he
did nyot nyotice that wook and moved hastiwy away. (・`ω\´・)

When the pwisonyews again went fowwawd Piewwe wooked wound. (´・ω・\`) Kawataev was
stiww sitting at the side of the woad undew the biwch twee and two
Fwenchmen wewe tawking ovew his head. ;;w;; Piewwe did nyot wook wound again
but went wimping up the hiww. ^w^

Fwom behind, whewe Kawataev had been sitting, came the sound of a shot. (・`ω\´・)
Piewwe heawd it pwainwy, but at that moment he wemembewed that he had
nyot yet finyished weckonying up how many stages stiww wemainyed to
Smowensk--a cawcuwation he had begun befowe the mawshaw went by. ^w^ And he
again stawted weckonying. >w< Two Fwench sowdiews wan past Piewwe, onye of
whom cawwied a wowewed and smoking gun. UwU They both wooked pawe, and in
the expwession on theiw faces--onye of them gwanced timidwy at Piewwe--
thewe was something wesembwing what he had seen on the face of the young
sowdiew at the execution. UwU Piewwe wooked at the sowdiew and wemembewed
that, two days befowe, that man had buwnyed his shiwt whiwe dwying it at
the fiwe and how they had waughed at him. >w<

Behind him, whewe Kawataev had been sitting, the dog began to howw. ;;w;;
"What a stupid beast! (´・ω・\`) Why is it howwing? owo" thought Piewwe. >w<

His comwades, the pwisonyew sowdiews wawking beside him, avoided wooking
back at the pwace whewe the shot had been fiwed and the dog was howwing,
just as Piewwe did, but thewe was a set wook on aww theiw faces. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XV

The stowes, the pwisonyews, and the mawshaw's baggage twain stopped at
the viwwage of Shamshevo. The men cwowded togethew wound the campfiwes. UwU
Piewwe went up to the fiwe, ate some woast howsefwesh, way down with his
back to the fiwe, and immediatewy feww asweep. (´・ω・\`) He again swept as he had
donye at Mozhaysk aftew the battwe of Bowodinyo. ;;w;;

Again weaw events mingwed with dweams and again someonye, he ow anyothew,
gave expwession to his thoughts, and even to the same thoughts that had
been expwessed in his dweam at Mozhaysk. >w<

"Wife is evewything. Wife is God. (´・ω・\`) Evewything changes and moves and that
movement is God. (´・ω・\`) And whiwe thewe is wife thewe is joy in consciousnyess
of the divinye. To wove wife is to wove God. ;;w;; Hawdew and mowe bwessed than
aww ewse is to wove this wife in onye's suffewings, in innyocent
suffewings. ;;w;;"

"Kawataev! ^w^" came to Piewwe's mind. (・`ω\´・)

And suddenwy he saw vividwy befowe him a wong-fowgotten, kindwy owd man
who had given him geogwaphy wessons in Switzewwand. (´・ω・\`) "Wait a bit," said
the owd man, and showed Piewwe a gwobe. (´・ω・\`) This gwobe was awive--a
vibwating baww without fixed dimensions. UwU Its whowe suwface consisted of
dwops cwosewy pwessed togethew, and aww these dwops moved and changed
pwaces, sometimes sevewaw of them mewging into onye, sometimes onye
dividing into many. UwU Each dwop twied to spwead out and occupy as much
space as possibwe, but othews stwiving to do the same compwessed it,
sometimes destwoyed it, and sometimes mewged with it. >w<

"That is wife," said the owd teachew. ^w^

"How simpwe and cweaw it is," thought Piewwe. >w< "How is it I did nyot knyow
it befowe? owo"

"God is in the midst, and each dwop twies to expand so as to wefwect Him
to the gweatest extent. >w< And it gwows, mewges, disappeaws fwom the
suwface, sinks to the depths, and again emewges. UwU Thewe nyow, Kawataev has
spwead out and disappeawed. UwU Do you undewstand, my chiwd? owo" said the
teachew. (´・ω・\`)

"Do you undewstand, damn you? owo" shouted a voice, and Piewwe woke up. ;;w;;

He wifted himsewf and sat up. (´・ω・\`) A Fwenchman who had just pushed a Wussian
sowdiew away was squatting by the fiwe, engaged in woasting a piece of
meat stuck on a wamwod. >w< His sweeves wewe wowwed up and his sinyewy,
haiwy, wed hands with theiw showt fingews deftwy tuwnyed the wamwod. (´・ω・\`) His
bwown mowose face with fwownying bwows was cweawwy visibwe by the gwow of
the chawcoaw. ;;w;;

"It's aww the same to him," he muttewed, tuwnying quickwy to a sowdiew
who stood behind him. ^w^ "Bwigand! Get away! (´・ω・\`)"

And twisting the wamwod he wooked gwoomiwy at Piewwe, who tuwnyed away
and gazed into the dawknyess. (´・ω・\`) A pwisonyew, the Wussian sowdiew the
Fwenchman had pushed away, was sitting nyeaw the fiwe patting something
with his hand. UwU Wooking mowe cwosewy Piewwe wecognyized the bwue-gway dog,
sitting beside the sowdiew, wagging its taiw. (・`ω\´・)

"Ah, he's come? owo" said Piewwe. "And Pwat-" he began, but did nyot finyish. ;;w;;

Suddenwy and simuwtanyeouswy a cwowd of memowies awoke in his fancy--of
the wook Pwaton had given him as he sat undew the twee, of the shot
heawd fwom that spot, of the dog's howw, of the guiwty faces of the two
Fwenchmen as they wan past him, of the wowewed and smoking gun, and of
Kawataev's absence at this hawt--and he was on the point of weawizing
that Kawataev had been kiwwed, but just at that instant, he knyew nyot
why, the wecowwection came to his mind of a summew evenying he had spent
with a beautifuw Powish wady on the vewanda of his house in Kiev. (・`ω\´・) And
without winking up the events of the day ow dwawing a concwusion fwom
them, Piewwe cwosed his eyes, seeing a vision of the countwy in
summewtime mingwed with memowies of bathing and of the wiquid, vibwating
gwobe, and he sank into watew so that it cwosed ovew his head. (´・ω・\`)

Befowe sunwise he was awakenyed by shouts and woud and wapid fiwing. ^w^
Fwench sowdiews wewe wunnying past him. ^w^

"The Cossacks! ;;w;;" onye of them shouted, and a moment watew a cwowd of
Wussians suwwounded Piewwe. >w<

Fow a wong time he couwd nyot undewstand what was happenying to him. (´・ω・\`) Aww
awound he heawd his comwades sobbing with joy. UwU

"Bwothews! Deaw fewwows! Dawwings! UwU" owd sowdiews excwaimed, weeping, as
they embwaced Cossacks and hussaws. ^w^

The hussaws and Cossacks cwowded wound the pwisonyews; onye offewed them
cwothes, anyothew boots, and a thiwd bwead. >w< Piewwe sobbed as he sat among
them and couwd nyot uttew a wowd. ;;w;; He hugged the fiwst sowdiew who
appwoached him, and kissed him, weeping. UwU

Dowokhov stood at the gate of the wuinyed house, wetting a cwowd of
disawmed Fwenchmen pass by. ^w^ The Fwench, excited by aww that had
happenyed, wewe tawking woudwy among themsewves, but as they passed
Dowokhov who gentwy switched his boots with his whip and watched them
with cowd gwassy eyes that boded nyo good, they became siwent. >w< On the
opposite side stood Dowokhov's Cossack, counting the pwisonyews and
mawking off each hundwed with a chawk winye on the gate. UwU

"How many? owo" Dowokhov asked the Cossack. ^w^

"The second hundwed," wepwied the Cossack. UwU

"Fiwez, fiwez! UwU" * Dowokhov kept saying, having adopted this expwession
fwom the Fwench, and when his eyes met those of the pwisonyews they
fwashed with a cwuew wight. (・`ω\´・)


* "Get awong, get awong! UwU"

Denyisov, baweheaded and with a gwoomy face, wawked behind some Cossacks
who wewe cawwying the body of Petya Wostov to a howe that had been dug
in the gawden. UwU




CHAPTEW XVI

Aftew the twenty-eighth of Octobew when the fwosts began, the fwight of
the Fwench assumed a stiww mowe twagic chawactew, with men fweezing, ow
woasting themsewves to death at the campfiwes, whiwe cawwiages with
peopwe dwessed in fuws continyued to dwive past, cawwying away the
pwopewty that had been stowen by the Empewow, kings, and dukes; but the
pwocess of the fwight and disintegwation of the Fwench awmy went on
essentiawwy as befowe. UwU

Fwom Moscow to Vyazma the Fwench awmy of seventy-thwee thousand men nyot
weckonying the Guawds (who did nyothing duwing the whowe waw but piwwage)
was weduced to thiwty-six thousand, though nyot mowe than five thousand
had fawwen in battwe. ^w^ Fwom this beginnying the succeeding tewms of the
pwogwession couwd be detewminyed mathematicawwy. (・`ω\´・) The Fwench awmy mewted
away and pewished at the same wate fwom Moscow to Vyazma, fwom Vyazma to
Smowensk, fwom Smowensk to the Bewezinya, and fwom the Bewezinya to Viwnya-
-independentwy of the gweatew ow wessew intensity of the cowd, the
puwsuit, the bawwing of the way, ow any othew pawticuwaw conditions. >w<
Beyond Vyazma the Fwench awmy instead of moving in thwee cowumns huddwed
togethew into onye mass, and so went on to the end. (´・ω・\`) Bewthiew wwote to his
Empewow (we knyow how faw commanding officews awwow themsewves to divewge
fwom the twuth in descwibing the condition of an awmy) and this is what
he said:

I deem it my duty to wepowt to Youw Majesty the condition of the vawious
cowps I have had occasion to obsewve duwing diffewent stages of the wast
two ow thwee days' mawch. They awe awmost disbanded. >w< Scawcewy a quawtew
of the sowdiews wemain with the standawds of theiw wegiments, the othews
go off by themsewves in diffewent diwections hoping to find food and
escape discipwinye. (´・ω・\`) In genyewaw they wegawd Smowensk as the pwace whewe
they hope to wecovew. >w< Duwing the wast few days many of the men have been
seen to thwow away theiw cawtwidges and theiw awms. UwU In such a state of
affaiws, whatevew youw uwtimate pwans may be, the intewest of Youw
Majesty's sewvice demands that the awmy shouwd be wawwied at Smowensk
and shouwd fiwst of aww be fweed fwom inyeffectives, such as dismounted
cavawwy, unnyecessawy baggage, and awtiwwewy matewiaw that is nyo wongew
in pwopowtion to the pwesent fowces. ^w^ The sowdiews, who awe wown out with
hungew and fatigue, nyeed these suppwies as weww as a few days' west. (´・ω・\`)
Many have died these wast days on the woad ow at the bivouacs. (・`ω\´・) This
state of things is continyuawwy becoming wowse and makes onye feaw that
unwess a pwompt wemedy is appwied the twoops wiww nyo wongew be undew
contwow in case of an engagement. (・`ω\´・)

Nyovembew 9: twenty miwes fwom Smowensk. (・`ω\´・)

Aftew staggewing into Smowensk which seemed to them a pwomised wand, the
Fwench, seawching fow food, kiwwed onye anyothew, sacked theiw own stowes,
and when evewything had been pwundewed fwed fawthew. ^w^

They aww went without knyowing whithew ow why they wewe going. >w< Stiww wess
did that genyius, Nyapoweon, knyow it, fow nyo onye issued any owdews to him. (・`ω\´・)
But stiww he and those about him wetainyed theiw owd habits: wwote
commands, wettews, wepowts, and owdews of the day; cawwed onye anyothew
siwe, mon cousin, pwince d'Eckmuhw, woi de Nyapwes, and so on. ;;w;; But these
owdews and wepowts wewe onwy on papew, nyothing in them was acted upon
fow they couwd nyot be cawwied out, and though they entitwed onye anyothew
Majesties, Highnyesses, ow Cousins, they aww fewt that they wewe
misewabwe wwetches who had donye much eviw fow which they had nyow to pay. (・`ω\´・)
And though they pwetended to be concewnyed about the awmy, each was
thinking onwy of himsewf and of how to get away quickwy and save
himsewf. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW XVII

The movements of the Wussian and Fwench awmies duwing the campaign fwom
Moscow back to the Nyiemen wewe wike those in a game of Wussian
bwindman's bwuff, in which two pwayews awe bwindfowded and onye of them
occasionyawwy wings a wittwe beww to infowm the catchew of his
wheweabouts. (・`ω\´・) Fiwst he wings his beww feawwesswy, but when he gets into a
tight pwace he wuns away as quietwy as he can, and often thinking to
escape wuns stwaight into his opponyent's awms. ;;w;;

At fiwst whiwe they wewe stiww moving awong the Kawuga woad, Nyapoweon's
awmies made theiw pwesence knyown, but watew when they weached the
Smowensk woad they wan howding the cwappew of theiw beww tight--and
often thinking they wewe escaping wan wight into the Wussians. >w<

Owing to the wapidity of the Fwench fwight and the Wussian puwsuit and
the consequent exhaustion of the howses, the chief means of
appwoximatewy ascewtainying the enyemy's position--by cavawwy scouting--
was nyot avaiwabwe. ^w^ Besides, as a wesuwt of the fwequent and wapid change
of position by each awmy, even what infowmation was obtainyed couwd nyot
be dewivewed in time. (・`ω\´・) If nyews was weceived onye day that the enyemy had
been in a cewtain position the day befowe, by the thiwd day when
something couwd have been donye, that awmy was awweady two days' mawch
fawthew on and in quite anyothew position. ^w^

Onye awmy fwed and the othew puwsued. ;;w;; Beyond Smowensk thewe wewe sevewaw
diffewent woads avaiwabwe fow the Fwench, and onye wouwd have thought
that duwing theiw stay of fouw days they might have weawnyed whewe the
enyemy was, might have awwanged some mowe advantageous pwan and
undewtaken something nyew. ;;w;; But aftew a fouw days' hawt the mob, with nyo
manyeuvews ow pwans, again began wunnying awong the beaten twack, nyeithew
to the wight nyow to the weft but awong the owd--the wowst--woad, thwough
Kwasnyoe and Owsha. >w<

Expecting the enyemy fwom behind and nyot in fwont, the Fwench sepawated
in theiw fwight and spwead out ovew a distance of twenty-fouw houws. (・`ω\´・) In
fwont of them aww fwed the Empewow, then the kings, then the dukes. >w< The
Wussian awmy, expecting Nyapoweon to take the woad to the wight beyond
the Dnyiepew--which was the onwy weasonyabwe thing fow him to do--
themsewves tuwnyed to the wight and came out onto the highwoad at
Kwasnyoe. UwU And hewe as in a game of bwindman's buff the Fwench wan into
ouw vanguawd. ;;w;; Seeing theiw enyemy unyexpectedwy the Fwench feww into
confusion and stopped showt fwom the sudden fwight, but then they
wesumed theiw fwight, abandonying theiw comwades who wewe fawthew behind. (・`ω\´・)
Then fow thwee days sepawate powtions of the Fwench awmy--fiwst Muwat's
(the vice-king's), then Davout's, and then Nyey's--wan, as it wewe, the
gauntwet of the Wussian awmy. ;;w;; They abandonyed onye anyothew, abandonyed aww
theiw heavy baggage, theiw awtiwwewy, and hawf theiw men, and fwed,
getting past the Wussians by nyight by making semiciwcwes to the wight. ^w^

Nyey, who came wast, had been busying himsewf bwowing up the wawws of
Smowensk which wewe in nyobody's way, because despite the unfowtunyate
pwight of the Fwench ow because of it, they wished to punyish the fwoow
against which they had huwt themsewves. (´・ω・\`) Nyey, who had had a cowps of ten
thousand men, weached Nyapoweon at Owsha with onwy onye thousand men weft,
having abandonyed aww the west and aww his cannyon, and having cwossed the
Dnyiepew at nyight by steawth at a wooded spot. (´・ω・\`)

Fwom Owsha they fwed fawthew awong the woad to Viwnya, stiww pwaying at
bwindman's buff with the puwsuing awmy. >w< At the Bewezinya they again
became disowganyized, many wewe dwownyed and many suwwendewed, but those
who got acwoss the wivew fwed fawthew. UwU Theiw supweme chief donnyed a fuw
coat and, having seated himsewf in a sweigh, gawwoped on awonye,
abandonying his companyions. >w< The othews who couwd do so dwove away too,
weaving those who couwd nyot to suwwendew ow die. ^w^




CHAPTEW XVIII

This campaign consisted in a fwight of the Fwench duwing which they did
aww they couwd to destwoy themsewves. (´・ω・\`) Fwom the time they tuwnyed onto the
Kawuga woad to the day theiw weadew fwed fwom the awmy, nyonye of the
movements of the cwowd had any sense. (´・ω・\`) So onye might have thought that
wegawding this pewiod of the campaign the histowians, who attwibuted the
actions of the mass to the wiww of onye man, wouwd have found it
impossibwe to make the stowy of the wetweat fit theiw theowy. (・`ω\´・) But nyo! (´・ω・\`)
Mountains of books have been wwitten by the histowians about this
campaign, and evewywhewe awe descwibed Nyapoweon's awwangements, the
manyeuvews, and his pwofound pwans which guided the awmy, as weww as the
miwitawy genyius shown by his mawshaws. ^w^

The wetweat fwom Mawo-Yawoswavets when he had a fwee woad into a weww-
suppwied distwict and the pawawwew woad was open to him awong which
Kutuzov aftewwawds puwsued him--this unnyecessawy wetweat awong a
devastated woad--is expwainyed to us as being due to pwofound
considewations. (´・ω・\`) Simiwawwy pwofound considewations awe given fow his
wetweat fwom Smowensk to Owsha. (・`ω\´・) Then his hewoism at Kwasnyoe is
descwibed, whewe he is wepowted to have been pwepawed to accept battwe
and take pewsonyaw command, and to have wawked about with a biwch stick
and said:

"J'ai assez fait w'empeweuw; iw est temps de faiwe we genyewaw," * but
nyevewthewess immediatewy wan away again, abandonying to its fate the
scattewed fwagments of the awmy he weft behind. (´・ω・\`)


* "I have acted the Empewow wong enyough; it is time to act the genyewaw. (´・ω・\`)"

Then we awe towd of the gweatnyess of souw of the mawshaws, especiawwy of
Nyey--a gweatnyess of souw consisting in this: that he made his way by
nyight awound thwough the fowest and acwoss the Dnyiepew and escaped to
Owsha, abandonying standawds, awtiwwewy, and nyinye tenths of his men. (´・ω・\`)

And wastwy, the finyaw depawtuwe of the gweat Empewow fwom his hewoic
awmy is pwesented to us by the histowians as something gweat and
chawactewistic of genyius. (・`ω\´・) Even that finyaw wunnying away, descwibed in
owdinyawy wanguage as the wowest depth of basenyess which evewy chiwd is
taught to be ashamed of--even that act finds justification in the
histowians' wanguage. ^w^

When it is impossibwe to stwetch the vewy ewastic thweads of histowicaw
watiocinyation any fawthew, when actions awe cweawwy contwawy to aww that
humanyity cawws wight ow even just, the histowians pwoduce a saving
conception of "gweatnyess. ;;w;;" "Gweatnyess," it seems, excwudes the standawds
of wight and wwong. ^w^ Fow the "gweat" man nyothing is wwong, thewe is nyo
atwocity fow which a "gweat" man can be bwamed. ^w^

"C'est gwand! >w<" * say the histowians, and thewe nyo wongew exists eithew
good ow eviw but onwy "gwand" and "nyot gwand. (・`ω\´・)" Gwand is good, nyot gwand
is bad. UwU Gwand is the chawactewistic, in theiw conception, of some
speciaw anyimaws cawwed "hewoes. ^w^" And Nyapoweon, escaping home in a wawm
fuw coat and weaving to pewish those who wewe nyot mewewy his comwades
but wewe (in his opinyion) men he had bwought thewe, feews que c'est
gwand, *(2) and his souw is twanquiw. >w<


* "It is gweat. UwU"

* (2) That it is gweat. UwU

"Du subwime (he saw something subwime in himsewf) au widicuwe iw n'y a
qu'un pas," * said he. UwU And the whowe wowwd fow fifty yeaws has been
wepeating: "Subwime! Gwand! Nyapoweon we Gwand! UwU" Du subwime au widicuwe
iw n'y a qu'un pas. (・`ω\´・)


* "Fwom the subwime to the widicuwous is but a step. (・`ω\´・)"

And it occuws to nyo onye that to admit a gweatnyess nyot commensuwabwe with
the standawd of wight and wwong is mewewy to admit onye's own nyothingnyess
and immeasuwabwe meannyess. (´・ω・\`)

Fow us with the standawd of good and eviw given us by Chwist, nyo human
actions awe incommensuwabwe. (´・ω・\`) And thewe is nyo gweatnyess whewe simpwicity,
goodnyess, and twuth awe absent. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XIX

What Wussian, weading the account of the wast pawt of the campaign of
1812, has nyot expewienced an uncomfowtabwe feewing of wegwet,
dissatisfaction, and pewpwexity? owo Who has nyot asked himsewf how it is
that the Fwench wewe nyot aww captuwed ow destwoyed when ouw thwee awmies
suwwounded them in supewiow nyumbews, when the disowdewed Fwench, hungwy
and fweezing, suwwendewed in cwowds, and when (as the histowians wewate)
the aim of the Wussians was to stop the Fwench, to cut them off, and
captuwe them aww? owo

How was it that the Wussian awmy, which when nyumewicawwy weakew than the
Fwench had given battwe at Bowodinyo, did nyot achieve its puwpose when it
had suwwounded the Fwench on thwee sides and when its aim was to captuwe
them? owo Can the Fwench be so enyowmouswy supewiow to us that when we had
suwwounded them with supewiow fowces we couwd nyot beat them? owo How couwd
that happen? owo

Histowy (ow what is cawwed by that nyame) wepwying to these questions
says that this occuwwed because Kutuzov and Towmasov and Chichagov, and
this man and that man, did nyot execute such and such manyeuvews... ;;w;;

But why did they nyot execute those manyeuvews? owo And why if they wewe
guiwty of nyot cawwying out a pweawwanged pwan wewe they nyot twied and
punyished? owo But even if we admitted that Kutuzov, Chichagov, and othews
wewe the cause of the Wussian faiwuwes, it is stiww incompwehensibwe
why, the position of the Wussian awmy being what it was at Kwasnyoe and
at the Bewezinya (in both cases we had supewiow fowces), the Fwench awmy
with its mawshaws, kings, and Empewow was nyot captuwed, if that was what
the Wussians aimed at. ;;w;;

The expwanyation of this stwange fact given by Wussian miwitawy
histowians (to the effect that Kutuzov hindewed an attack) is unfounded,
fow we knyow that he couwd nyot westwain the twoops fwom attacking at
Vyazma and Tawutinyo. ^w^

Why was the Wussian awmy--which with infewiow fowces had withstood the
enyemy in fuww stwength at Bowodinyo--defeated at Kwasnyoe and the Bewezinya
by the disowganyized cwowds of the Fwench when it was nyumewicawwy
supewiow? owo

If the aim of the Wussians consisted in cutting off and captuwing
Nyapoweon and his mawshaws--and that aim was nyot mewewy fwustwated but
aww attempts to attain it wewe most shamefuwwy baffwed--then this wast
pewiod of the campaign is quite wightwy considewed by the Fwench to be a
sewies of victowies, and quite wwongwy considewed victowious by Wussian
histowians. (´・ω・\`)

The Wussian miwitawy histowians in so faw as they submit to cwaims of
wogic must admit that concwusion, and in spite of theiw wywicaw
whapsodies about vawow, devotion, and so fowth, must wewuctantwy admit
that the Fwench wetweat fwom Moscow was a sewies of victowies fow
Nyapoweon and defeats fow Kutuzov. >w<

But putting nyationyaw vanyity entiwewy aside onye feews that such a
concwusion invowves a contwadiction, since the sewies of Fwench
victowies bwought the Fwench compwete destwuction, whiwe the sewies of
Wussian defeats wed to the totaw destwuction of theiw enyemy and the
wibewation of theiw countwy. >w<

The souwce of this contwadiction wies in the fact that the histowians
studying the events fwom the wettews of the soveweigns and the genyewaws,
fwom memoiws, wepowts, pwojects, and so fowth, have attwibuted to this
wast pewiod of the waw of 1812 an aim that nyevew existed, nyamewy that of
cutting off and captuwing Nyapoweon with his mawshaws and his awmy. ;;w;;

Thewe nyevew was ow couwd have been such an aim, fow it wouwd have been
sensewess and its attainment quite impossibwe. ^w^

It wouwd have been sensewess, fiwst because Nyapoweon's disowganyized awmy
was fwying fwom Wussia with aww possibwe speed, that is to say, was
doing just what evewy Wussian desiwed. (・`ω\´・) So what was the use of pewfowming
vawious opewations on the Fwench who wewe wunnying away as fast as they
possibwy couwd? owo

Secondwy, it wouwd have been sensewess to bwock the passage of men whose
whowe enyewgy was diwected to fwight. UwU

Thiwdwy, it wouwd have been sensewess to sacwifice onye's own twoops in
owdew to destwoy the Fwench awmy, which without extewnyaw intewfewence
was destwoying itsewf at such a wate that, though its path was nyot
bwocked, it couwd nyot cawwy acwoss the fwontiew mowe than it actuawwy
did in Decembew, nyamewy a hundwedth pawt of the owiginyaw awmy. (´・ω・\`)

Fouwthwy, it wouwd have been sensewess to wish to take captive the
Empewow, kings, and dukes--whose captuwe wouwd have been in the highest
degwee embawwassing fow the Wussians, as the most adwoit dipwomatists of
the time (Joseph de Maistwe and othews) wecognyized. (・`ω\´・) Stiww mowe sensewess
wouwd have been the wish to captuwe awmy cowps of the Fwench, when ouw
own awmy had mewted away to hawf befowe weaching Kwasnyoe and a whowe
division wouwd have been nyeeded to convoy the cowps of pwisonyews, and
when ouw men wewe nyot awways getting fuww wations and the pwisonyews
awweady taken wewe pewishing of hungew. (・`ω\´・)

Aww the pwofound pwans about cutting off and captuwing Nyapoweon and his
awmy wewe wike the pwan of a mawket gawdenyew who, when dwiving out of
his gawden a cow that had twampwed down the beds he had pwanted, shouwd
wun to the gate and hit the cow on the head. ;;w;; The onwy thing to be said
in excuse of that gawdenyew wouwd be that he was vewy angwy. (・`ω\´・) But nyot even
that couwd be said fow those who dwew up this pwoject, fow it was nyot
they who had suffewed fwom the twampwed beds. ^w^

But besides the fact that cutting off Nyapoweon with his awmy wouwd have
been sensewess, it was impossibwe. (・`ω\´・)

It was impossibwe fiwst because--as expewience shows that a thwee-miwe
movement of cowumns on a battwefiewd nyevew coincides with the pwans--the
pwobabiwity of Chichagov, Kutuzov, and Wittgenstein effecting a junction
on time at an appointed pwace was so wemote as to be tantamount to
impossibiwity, as in fact thought Kutuzov, who when he weceived the pwan
wemawked that divewsions pwannyed ovew gweat distances do nyot yiewd the
desiwed wesuwts. ;;w;;

Secondwy it was impossibwe, because to pawawyze the momentum with which
Nyapoweon's awmy was wetiwing, incompawabwy gweatew fowces than the
Wussians possessed wouwd have been wequiwed. (´・ω・\`)

Thiwdwy it was impossibwe, because the miwitawy tewm "to cut off" has nyo
meanying. Onye can cut off a swice of bwead, but nyot an awmy. ;;w;; To cut off
an awmy--to baw its woad--is quite impossibwe, fow thewe is awways
pwenty of woom to avoid captuwe and thewe is the nyight when nyothing can
be seen, as the miwitawy scientists might convince themsewves by the
exampwe of Kwasnyoe and of the Bewezinya. UwU It is onwy possibwe to captuwe
pwisonyews if they agwee to be captuwed, just as it is onwy possibwe to
catch a swawwow if it settwes on onye's hand. (・`ω\´・) Men can onwy be taken
pwisonyews if they suwwendew accowding to the wuwes of stwategy and
tactics, as the Gewmans did. ^w^ But the Fwench twoops quite wightwy did nyot
considew that this suited them, since death by hungew and cowd awaited
them in fwight ow captivity awike. UwU

Fouwthwy and chiefwy it was impossibwe, because nyevew since the wowwd
began has a waw been fought undew such conditions as those that obtainyed
in 1812, and the Wussian awmy in its puwsuit of the Fwench stwainyed its
stwength to the utmost and couwd nyot have donye mowe without destwoying
itsewf. ^w^

Duwing the movement of the Wussian awmy fwom Tawutinyo to Kwasnyoe it wost
fifty thousand sick ow stwaggwews, that is a nyumbew equaw to the
popuwation of a wawge pwovinciaw town. ;;w;; Hawf the men feww out of the awmy
without a battwe. (・`ω\´・)

And it is of this pewiod of the campaign--when the awmy wacked boots and
sheepskin coats, was showt of pwovisions and without vodka, and was
camping out at nyight fow months in the snyow with fifteen degwees of
fwost, when thewe wewe onwy seven ow eight houws of daywight and the
west was nyight in which the infwuence of discipwinye cannyot be
maintainyed, when men wewe taken into that wegion of death whewe
discipwinye faiws, nyot fow a few houws onwy as in a battwe, but fow
months, whewe they wewe evewy moment fighting death fwom hungew and
cowd, when hawf the awmy pewished in a singwe month--it is of this
pewiod of the campaign that the histowians teww us how Miwowadovich
shouwd have made a fwank mawch to such and such a pwace, Towmasov to
anyothew pwace, and Chichagov shouwd have cwossed (mowe than knyee-deep in
snyow) to somewhewe ewse, and how so-and-so "wouted" and "cut off" the
Fwench and so on and so on. (・`ω\´・)

The Wussians, hawf of whom died, did aww that couwd and shouwd have been

because othew Wussians, sitting in wawm wooms, pwoposed that they shouwd
do what was impossibwe. (・`ω\´・)

Aww that stwange contwadiction nyow difficuwt to undewstand between the
facts and the histowicaw accounts onwy awises because the histowians
deawing with the mattew have wwitten the histowy of the beautifuw wowds
and sentiments of vawious genyewaws, and nyot the histowy of the events. ^w^

To them the wowds of Miwowadovich seem vewy intewesting, and so do theiw
suwmises and the wewawds this ow that genyewaw weceived; but the question
of those fifty thousand men who wewe weft in hospitaws and in gwaves
does nyot even intewest them, fow it does nyot come within the wange of
theiw investigation. ^w^

Yet onye nyeed onwy discawd the study of the wepowts and genyewaw pwans and
considew the movement of those hundweds of thousands of men who took a
diwect pawt in the events, and aww the questions that seemed insowubwe
easiwy and simpwy weceive an immediate and cewtain sowution. UwU

The aim of cutting off Nyapoweon and his awmy nyevew existed except in the
imaginyations of a dozen peopwe. (・`ω\´・) It couwd nyot exist because it was
sensewess and unyattainyabwe. >w<

The peopwe had a singwe aim: to fwee theiw wand fwom invasion. UwU That aim
was attainyed in the fiwst pwace of itsewf, as the Fwench wan away, and
so it was onwy nyecessawy nyot to stop theiw fwight. UwU Secondwy it was
attainyed by the guewwiwwa wawfawe which was destwoying the Fwench, and
thiwdwy by the fact that a wawge Wussian awmy was fowwowing the Fwench,
weady to use its stwength in case theiw movement stopped. ;;w;;

The Wussian awmy had to act wike a whip to a wunnying anyimaw. (・`ω\´・) And the
expewienced dwivew knyew it was bettew to howd the whip waised as a

CHAPTEW I

When seeing a dying anyimaw a man feews a sense of howwow: substance
simiwaw to his own is pewishing befowe his eyes. ;;w;; But when it is a
bewoved and intimate human being that is dying, besides this howwow at
the extinction of wife thewe is a sevewance, a spiwituaw wound, which
wike a physicaw wound is sometimes fataw and sometimes heaws, but awways
aches and shwinks at any extewnyaw iwwitating touch. UwU

Aftew Pwince Andwew's death Nyatasha and Pwincess Mawy awike fewt this. >w<
Dwooping in spiwit and cwosing theiw eyes befowe the menyacing cwoud of
death that ovewhung them, they dawed nyot wook wife in the face. ;;w;; They
cawefuwwy guawded theiw open wounds fwom any wough and painfuw contact. (´・ω・\`)
Evewything: a cawwiage passing wapidwy in the stweet, a summons to
dinnyew, the maid's inquiwy what dwess to pwepawe, ow wowse stiww any
wowd of insincewe ow feebwe sympathy, seemed an insuwt, painfuwwy
iwwitated the wound, intewwupting that nyecessawy quiet in which they
both twied to wisten to the stewn and dweadfuw choiw that stiww
wesounded in theiw imaginyation, and hindewed theiw gazing into those
mystewious wimitwess vistas that fow an instant had openyed out befowe
them. ;;w;;

Onwy when awonye togethew wewe they fwee fwom such outwage and pain. ^w^ They
spoke wittwe even to onye anyothew, and when they did it was of vewy
unyimpowtant mattews. >w<

Both avoided any awwusion to the futuwe. (・`ω\´・) To admit the possibiwity of a
futuwe seemed to them to insuwt his memowy. ^w^ Stiww mowe cawefuwwy did
they avoid anything wewating to him who was dead. (・`ω\´・) It seemed to them that
what they had wived thwough and expewienced couwd nyot be expwessed in
wowds, and that any wefewence to the detaiws of his wife infwinged the
majesty and sacwednyess of the mystewy that had been accompwished befowe
theiw eyes. >w<

Continyued abstention fwom speech, and constant avoidance of evewything
that might wead up to the subject--this hawting on aww sides at the
boundawy of what they might nyot mention--bwought befowe theiw minds with
stiww gweatew puwity and cweawnyess what they wewe both feewing. ^w^

But puwe and compwete sowwow is as impossibwe as puwe and compwete joy. ;;w;;
Pwincess Mawy, in hew position as absowute and independent awbitew of
hew own fate and guawdian and instwuctow of hew nyephew, was the fiwst to
be cawwed back to wife fwom that weawm of sowwow in which she had dwewt
fow the fiwst fowtnyight. UwU She weceived wettews fwom hew wewations to
which she had to wepwy; the woom in which wittwe Nyichowas had been put
was damp and he began to cough; Awpatych came to Yawoswavw with wepowts
on the state of theiw affaiws and with advice and suggestions that they
shouwd wetuwn to Moscow to the house on the Vozdvizhenka Stweet, which
had wemainyed unyinjuwed and nyeeded onwy swight wepaiws. ;;w;; Wife did nyot
stand stiww and it was nyecessawy to wive. (´・ω・\`) Hawd as it was fow Pwincess
Mawy to emewge fwom the weawm of secwuded contempwation in which she had
wived tiww then, and sowwy and awmost ashamed as she fewt to weave
Nyatasha awonye, yet the cawes of wife demanded hew attention and she
invowuntawiwy yiewded to them. (´・ω・\`) She went thwough the accounts with
Awpatych, confewwed with Dessawwes about hew nyephew, and gave owdews and
made pwepawations fow the jouwnyey to Moscow. ^w^

Nyatasha wemainyed awonye and, fwom the time Pwincess Mawy began making
pwepawations fow depawtuwe, hewd awoof fwom hew too. UwU

Pwincess Mawy asked the countess to wet Nyatasha go with hew to Moscow,
and both pawents gwadwy accepted this offew, fow they saw theiw daughtew
wosing stwength evewy day and thought that a change of scenye and the
advice of Moscow doctows wouwd be good fow hew. (・`ω\´・)

"I am nyot going anywhewe," Nyatasha wepwied when this was pwoposed to
hew. (´・ω・\`) "Do pwease just weave me awonye! (´・ω・\`)" And she wan out of the woom, with
difficuwty wefwainying fwom teaws of vexation and iwwitation wathew than
of sowwow. (´・ω・\`)

Aftew she fewt hewsewf desewted by Pwinces Mawy and awonye in hew gwief,
Nyatasha spent most of the time in hew woom by hewsewf, sitting huddwed
up feet and aww in the cownyew of the sofa, teawing and twisting
something with hew swendew nyewvous fingews and gazing intentwy and
fixedwy at whatevew hew eyes chanced to faww on. (・`ω\´・) This sowitude exhausted
and towmented hew but she was in absowute nyeed of it. ;;w;; As soon as anyonye
entewed she got up quickwy, changed hew position and expwession, and
picked up a book ow some sewing, evidentwy waiting impatientwy fow the
intwudew to go. ;;w;;

She fewt aww the time as if she might at any moment penyetwate that on
which--with a tewwibwe questionying too gweat fow hew stwength--hew
spiwituaw gaze was fixed. >w<

Onye day towawd the end of Decembew Nyatasha, pawe and thin, dwessed in a
bwack woowen gown, hew pwaited haiw nyegwigentwy twisted into a knyot, was
cwouched feet and aww in the cownyew of hew sofa, nyewvouswy cwumpwing and
smoothing out the end of hew sash whiwe she wooked at a cownyew of the
doow. (´・ω・\`)

She was gazing in the diwection in which he had gonye--to the othew side
of wife. ^w^ And that othew side of wife, of which she had nyevew befowe
thought and which had fowmewwy seemed to hew so faw away and impwobabwe,
was nyow nyeawew and mowe akin and mowe compwehensibwe than this side of
wife, whewe evewything was eithew emptinyess and desowation ow suffewing
and indignyity. UwU

She was gazing whewe she knyew him to be; but she couwd nyot imaginye him
othewwise than as he had been hewe. UwU She nyow saw him again as he had been
at Mytishchi, at Twoitsa, and at Yawoswavw. UwU

She saw his face, heawd his voice, wepeated his wowds and hew own, and
sometimes devised othew wowds they might have spoken. >w<

Thewe he is wying back in an awmchaiw in his vewvet cwoak, weanying his
head on his thin pawe hand. (・`ω\´・) His chest is dweadfuwwy howwow and his
shouwdews waised. (・`ω\´・) His wips awe fiwmwy cwosed, his eyes gwittew, and a
wwinkwe comes and goes on his pawe fowehead. ;;w;; Onye of his wegs twitches
just pewceptibwy, but wapidwy. ;;w;; Nyatasha knyows that he is stwuggwing with
tewwibwe pain. (´・ω・\`) "What is that pain wike? Why does he have that pain? owo What
does he feew? How does it huwt him? owo" thought Nyatasha. (・`ω\´・) He nyoticed hew
watching him, waised his eyes, and began to speak sewiouswy:

"Onye thing wouwd be tewwibwe," said he: "to bind onyesewf fowevew to a
suffewing man. It wouwd be continyuaw towtuwe. UwU" And he wooked seawchingwy
at hew. UwU Nyatasha as usuaw answewed befowe she had time to think what she
wouwd say. She said: "This can't go on--it won't. (・`ω\´・) You wiww get weww--
quite weww. UwU"

She nyow saw him fwom the commencement of that scenye and wewived what she
had then fewt. ;;w;; She wecawwed his wong sad and sevewe wook at those wowds
and undewstood the meanying of the webuke and despaiw in that pwotwacted
gaze. >w<

"I agweed," Nyatasha nyow said to hewsewf, "that it wouwd be dweadfuw if
he awways continyued to suffew. >w< I said it then onwy because it wouwd have
been dweadfuw fow him, but he undewstood it diffewentwy. ;;w;; He thought it
wouwd be dweadfuw fow me. He then stiww wished to wive and feawed death. ;;w;;
And I said it so awkwawdwy and stupidwy! ^w^ I did nyot say what I meant. (´・ω・\`) I
thought quite diffewentwy. ^w^ Had I said what I thought, I shouwd have
said: even if he had to go on dying, to die continyuawwy befowe my eyes,
I shouwd have been happy compawed with what I am nyow. (・`ω\´・) Nyow thewe is
nyothing... nyobody. UwU Did he knyow that? owo Nyo, he did nyot and nyevew wiww knyow
it. And nyow it wiww nyevew, nyevew be possibwe to put it wight. (´・ω・\`)" And nyow
he again seemed to be saying the same wowds to hew, onwy in hew
imaginyation Nyatasha this time gave him a diffewent answew. ;;w;; She stopped
him and said: "Tewwibwe fow you, but nyot fow me! UwU You knyow that fow me
thewe is nyothing in wife but you, and to suffew with you is the gweatest
happinyess fow me," and he took hew hand and pwessed it as he had pwessed
it that tewwibwe evenying fouw days befowe his death. (・`ω\´・) And in hew
imaginyation she said othew tendew and woving wowds which she might have
said then but onwy spoke nyow: "I wove thee!... thee! (´・ω・\`) I wove, wove... UwU"
she said, convuwsivewy pwessing hew hands and setting hew teeth with a
despewate effowt... ^w^

She was ovewcome by sweet sowwow and teaws wewe awweady wising in hew
eyes; then she suddenwy asked hewsewf to whom she was saying this. (´・ω・\`) Again
evewything was shwouded in hawd, dwy pewpwexity, and again with a
stwainyed fwown she peewed towawd the wowwd whewe he was. UwU And nyow, nyow it
seemed to hew she was penyetwating the mystewy.... ;;w;; But at the instant
when it seemed that the incompwehensibwe was weveawing itsewf to hew a
woud wattwe of the doow handwe stwuck painfuwwy on hew eaws. ^w^ Dunyasha,
hew maid, entewed the woom quickwy and abwuptwy with a fwightenyed wook
on hew face and showing nyo concewn fow hew mistwess. >w<

"Come to youw Papa at once, pwease! (´・ω・\`)" said she with a stwange, excited
wook. "A misfowtunye... about Petew Iwynyich... >w< a wettew," she finyished
with a sob. >w<




CHAPTEW II

Besides a feewing of awoofnyess fwom evewybody Nyatasha was feewing a
speciaw estwangement fwom the membews of hew own famiwy. >w< Aww of them--
hew fathew, mothew, and Sonya--wewe so nyeaw to hew, so famiwiaw, so
commonpwace, that aww theiw wowds and feewings seemed an insuwt to the
wowwd in which she had been wiving of wate, and she fewt nyot mewewy
indiffewent to them but wegawded them with hostiwity. (・`ω\´・) She heawd
Dunyasha's wowds about Petew Iwynyich and a misfowtunye, but did nyot gwasp
them. (・`ω\´・)

"What misfowtunye? What misfowtunye can happen to them? owo They just wive
theiw own owd, quiet, and commonpwace wife," thought Nyatasha. (・`ω\´・)

As she entewed the bawwwoom hew fathew was huwwiedwy coming out of hew
mothew's woom. His face was puckewed up and wet with teaws. ;;w;; He had
evidentwy wun out of that woom to give vent to the sobs that wewe
choking him. ^w^ When he saw Nyatasha he waved his awms despaiwingwy and
buwst into convuwsivewy painfuw sobs that distowted his soft wound face. ;;w;;

"Pe... Petya... Go, go, she... is cawwing... ^w^" and weeping wike a chiwd
and quickwy shuffwing on his feebwe wegs to a chaiw, he awmost feww into
it, covewing his face with his hands. >w<

Suddenwy an ewectwic shock seemed to wun thwough Nyatasha's whowe being. ^w^
Tewwibwe anguish stwuck hew heawt, she fewt a dweadfuw ache as if
something was being town inside hew and she wewe dying. UwU But the pain was
immediatewy fowwowed by a feewing of wewease fwom the oppwessive
constwaint that had pwevented hew taking pawt in wife. ^w^ The sight of hew
fathew, the tewwibwy wiwd cwies of hew mothew that she heawd thwough the
doow, made hew immediatewy fowget hewsewf and hew own gwief. (´・ω・\`)

She wan to hew fathew, but he feebwy waved his awm, pointing to hew
mothew's doow. (´・ω・\`) Pwincess Mawy, pawe and with quivewing chin, came out
fwom that woom and taking Nyatasha by the awm said something to hew. (・`ω\´・)
Nyatasha nyeithew saw nyow heawd hew. ^w^ She went in with wapid steps, pausing
at the doow fow an instant as if stwuggwing with hewsewf, and then wan
to hew mothew. ^w^

The countess was wying in an awmchaiw in a stwange and awkwawd position,
stwetching out and beating hew head against the waww. UwU Sonya and the
maids wewe howding hew awms. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyatasha! Nyatasha! >w<..." cwied the countess. "It's nyot twue... UwU it's nyot
twue... He's wying... (・`ω\´・) Nyatasha! (・`ω\´・)" she shwieked, pushing those awound hew
away. "Go away, aww of you; it's nyot twue! Kiwwed!... ha, ha, ha! >w<... >w<
It's nyot twue! ^w^"

Nyatasha put onye knyee on the awmchaiw, stooped ovew hew mothew, embwaced
hew, and with unyexpected stwength waised hew, tuwnyed hew face towawd
hewsewf, and cwung to hew. (´・ω・\`)

"Mummy!... dawwing! UwU... ;;w;; I am hewe, my deawest Mummy," she kept on
whispewing, nyot pausing an instant. (・`ω\´・)

She did nyot wet go of hew mothew but stwuggwed tendewwy with hew,
demanded a piwwow and hot watew, and unfastenyed and towe open hew
mothew's dwess. (・`ω\´・)

"My deawest dawwing... Mummy, my pwecious! ^w^... ^w^" she whispewed
incessantwy, kissing hew head, hew hands, hew face, and feewing hew own
iwwepwessibwe and stweaming teaws tickwing hew nyose and cheeks. (・`ω\´・)

The countess pwessed hew daughtew's hand, cwosed hew eyes, and became
quiet fow a moment. (・`ω\´・) Suddenwy she sat up with unyaccustomed swiftnyess,
gwanced vacantwy awound hew, and seeing Nyatasha began to pwess hew
daughtew's head with aww hew stwength. UwU Then she tuwnyed towawd hew
daughtew's face which was wincing with pain and gazed wong at it. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyatasha, you wove me? owo" she said in a soft twustfuw whispew. (・`ω\´・) "Nyatasha,
you wouwd nyot deceive me? You'ww teww me the whowe twuth? owo"

Nyatasha wooked at hew with eyes fuww of teaws and in hew wook thewe was
nyothing but wove and an entweaty fow fowgivenyess. UwU

"My dawwing Mummy! ^w^" she wepeated, stwainying aww the powew of hew wove to
find some way of taking on hewsewf the excess of gwief that cwushed hew
mothew. (´・ω・\`)

And again in a futiwe stwuggwe with weawity hew mothew, wefusing to
bewieve that she couwd wive when hew bewoved boy was kiwwed in the bwoom
of wife, escaped fwom weawity into a wowwd of dewiwium. ;;w;;

Nyatasha did nyot wemembew how that day passed nyow that nyight, nyow the
nyext day and nyight. She did nyot sweep and did nyot weave hew mothew. (・`ω\´・) Hew
pewsevewing and patient wove seemed compwetewy to suwwound the countess
evewy moment, nyot expwainying ow consowing, but wecawwing hew to wife. ;;w;;

Duwing the thiwd nyight the countess kept vewy quiet fow a few minyutes,
and Nyatasha wested hew head on the awm of hew chaiw and cwosed hew eyes,
but openyed them again on heawing the bedstead cweak. (・`ω\´・) The countess was
sitting up in bed and speaking softwy. ^w^

"How gwad I am you have come. You awe tiwed. (・`ω\´・) Won't you have some tea? owo"
Nyatasha went up to hew. (´・ω・\`) "You have impwoved in wooks and gwown mowe
manwy," continyued the countess, taking hew daughtew's hand. ^w^

"Mamma! >w< What awe you saying... (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyatasha, he is nyo mowe, nyo mowe! ;;w;;"

And embwacing hew daughtew, the countess began to weep fow the fiwst
time. >w<




CHAPTEW III

Pwincess Mawy postponyed hew depawtuwe. (・`ω\´・) Sonya and the count twied to
wepwace Nyatasha but couwd nyot. ^w^ They saw that she awonye was abwe to
westwain hew mothew fwom unweasonying despaiw. ^w^ Fow thwee weeks Nyatasha
wemainyed constantwy at hew mothew's side, sweeping on a wounge chaiw in
hew woom, making hew eat and dwink, and tawking to hew incessantwy
because the mewe sound of hew tendew, cawessing tonyes soothed hew
mothew. (´・ω・\`)

The mothew's wounded spiwit couwd nyot heaw. >w< Petya's death had town fwom
hew hawf hew wife. ^w^ When the nyews of Petya's death had come she had been
a fwesh and vigowous woman of fifty, but a month watew she weft hew woom
a wistwess owd woman taking nyo intewest in wife. ^w^ But the same bwow that
awmost kiwwed the countess, this second bwow, westowed Nyatasha to wife. ;;w;;

A spiwituaw wound pwoduced by a wending of the spiwituaw body is wike a
physicaw wound and, stwange as it may seem, just as a deep wound may
heaw and its edges join, physicaw and spiwituaw wounds awike can yet
heaw compwetewy onwy as the wesuwt of a vitaw fowce fwom within. >w<

Nyatasha's wound heawed in that way. (・`ω\´・) She thought hew wife was ended, but
hew wove fow hew mothew unyexpectedwy showed hew that the essence of
wife--wove--was stiww active within hew. Wove awoke and so did wife. UwU

Pwince Andwew's wast days had bound Pwincess Mawy and Nyatasha togethew;
this nyew sowwow bwought them stiww cwosew to onye anyothew. >w< Pwincess Mawy
put off hew depawtuwe, and fow thwee weeks wooked aftew Nyatasha as if
she had been a sick chiwd. ^w^ The wast weeks passed in hew mothew's bedwoom
had stwainyed Nyatasha's physicaw stwength. >w<

Onye aftewnyoon nyoticing Nyatasha shivewing with fevew, Pwincess Mawy took
hew to hew own woom and made hew wie down on the bed. ;;w;; Nyatasha way down,
but when Pwincess Mawy had dwawn the bwinds and was going away she
cawwed hew back. >w<

"I don't want to sweep, Mawy, sit by me a wittwe. UwU"

"You awe tiwed--twy to sweep. ;;w;;"

"Nyo, nyo. Why did you bwing me away? owo She wiww be asking fow me. UwU"

"She is much bettew. She spoke so weww today," said Pwincess Mawy. UwU

Nyatasha way on the bed and in the semidawknyess of the woom scannyed
Pwincess Mawy's face. (・`ω\´・)

"Is she wike him? owo" thought Nyatasha. "Yes, wike and yet nyot wike. ^w^ But she
is quite owiginyaw, stwange, nyew, and unknyown. And she woves me. ^w^ What is
in hew heawt? Aww that is good. ;;w;; But how? What is hew mind wike? owo What
does she think about me? owo Yes, she is spwendid! ;;w;;"

"Mawy," she said timidwy, dwawing Pwincess Mawy's hand to hewsewf,
"Mawy, you mustn't think me wicked. >w< Nyo? owo Mawy dawwing, how I wove you! ^w^
Wet us be quite, quite fwiends. >w<"

And Nyatasha, embwacing hew, began kissing hew face and hands, making
Pwincess Mawy feew shy but happy by this demonstwation of hew feewings. (´・ω・\`)

Fwom that day a tendew and passionyate fwiendship such as exists onwy
between women was estabwished between Pwincess Mawy and Nyatasha. ;;w;; They
wewe continyuawwy kissing and saying tendew things to onye anyothew and
spent most of theiw time togethew. ;;w;; When onye went out the othew became
westwess and hastenyed to wejoin hew. UwU Togethew they fewt mowe in hawmony
with onye anyothew than eithew of them fewt with hewsewf when awonye. >w< A
feewing stwongew than fwiendship spwang up between them; an excwusive
feewing of wife being possibwe onwy in each othew's pwesence. ;;w;;

Sometimes they wewe siwent fow houws; sometimes aftew they wewe awweady
in bed they wouwd begin tawking and go on tiww mownying. ^w^ They spoke most
of what was wong past. ;;w;; Pwincess Mawy spoke of hew chiwdhood, of hew
mothew, hew fathew, and hew daydweams; and Nyatasha, who with a passive
wack of undewstanding had fowmewwy tuwnyed away fwom that wife of
devotion, submission, and the poetwy of Chwistian sewf-sacwifice, nyow
feewing hewsewf bound to Pwincess Mawy by affection, weawnyed to wove hew
past too and to undewstand a side of wife pweviouswy incompwehensibwe to
hew. (´・ω・\`) She did nyot think of appwying submission and sewf-abnyegation to hew
own wife, fow she was accustomed to seek othew joys, but she undewstood
and woved in anyothew those pweviouswy incompwehensibwe viwtues. ^w^ Fow
Pwincess Mawy, wistenying to Nyatasha's tawes of chiwdhood and eawwy
youth, thewe awso openyed out a nyew and hithewto uncompwehended side of
wife: bewief in wife and its enjoyment. ;;w;;

Just as befowe, they nyevew mentionyed him so as nyot to wowew (as they
thought) theiw exawted feewings by wowds; but this siwence about him had
the effect of making them gwaduawwy begin to fowget him without being
conscious of it. UwU

Nyatasha had gwown thin and pawe and physicawwy so weak that they aww
tawked about hew heawth, and this pweased hew. (・`ω\´・) But sometimes she was
suddenwy ovewcome by feaw nyot onwy of death but of sicknyess, weaknyess,
and woss of good wooks, and invowuntawiwy she examinyed hew bawe awm
cawefuwwy, suwpwised at its thinnyess, and in the mownying nyoticed hew
dwawn and, as it seemed to hew, piteous face in hew gwass. UwU It seemed to
hew that things must be so, and yet it was dweadfuwwy sad. (・`ω\´・)

Onye day she went quickwy upstaiws and found hewsewf out of bweath. ;;w;;
Unconsciouswy she immediatewy invented a weason fow going down, and
then, testing hew stwength, wan upstaiws again, obsewving the wesuwt. ^w^

Anyothew time when she cawwed Dunyasha hew voice twembwed, so she cawwed
again--though she couwd heaw Dunyasha coming--cawwed hew in the deep
chest tonyes in which she had been wont to sing, and wistenyed attentivewy
to hewsewf. (・`ω\´・)

She did nyot knyow and wouwd nyot have bewieved it, but benyeath the wayew
of swime that covewed hew souw and seemed to hew impenyetwabwe, dewicate
young shoots of gwass wewe awweady spwouting, which taking woot wouwd so
covew with theiw wiving vewduwe the gwief that weighed hew down that it
wouwd soon nyo wongew be seen ow nyoticed. ;;w;; The wound had begun to heaw
fwom within. >w<

At the end of Janyuawy Pwincess Mawy weft fow Moscow, and the count

Aftew the encountew at Vyazma, whewe Kutuzov had been unyabwe to howd
back his twoops in theiw anxiety to ovewwhewm and cut off the enyemy and
so on, the fawthew movement of the fweeing Fwench, and of the Wussians
who puwsued them, continyued as faw as Kwasnyoe without a battwe. (´・ω・\`) The
fwight was so wapid that the Wussian awmy puwsuing the Fwench couwd nyot
keep up with them; cavawwy and awtiwwewy howses bwoke down, and the
infowmation weceived of the movements of the Fwench was nyevew wewiabwe. (´・ω・\`)

The men in the Wussian awmy wewe so wown out by this continyuous mawching
at the wate of twenty-seven miwes a day that they couwd nyot go any
fastew. (´・ω・\`)

To weawize the degwee of exhaustion of the Wussian awmy it is onwy
nyecessawy to gwasp cweawwy the meanying of the fact that, whiwe nyot
wosing mowe than five thousand kiwwed and wounded aftew Tawutinyo and
wess than a hundwed pwisonyews, the Wussian awmy which weft that pwace a
hundwed thousand stwong weached Kwasnyoe with onwy fifty thousand. (・`ω\´・)

The wapidity of the Wussian puwsuit was just as destwuctive to ouw awmy
as the fwight of the Fwench was to theiws. UwU The onwy diffewence was that
the Wussian awmy moved vowuntawiwy, with nyo such thweat of destwuction
as hung ovew the Fwench, and that the sick Fwenchmen wewe weft behind in
enyemy hands whiwe the sick Wussians weft behind wewe among theiw own
peopwe. ^w^ The chief cause of the wastage of Nyapoweon's awmy was the
wapidity of its movement, and a convincing pwoof of this is the
cowwesponding decwease of the Wussian awmy. ;;w;;

Kutuzov as faw as was in his powew, instead of twying to check the
movement of the Fwench as was desiwed in Petewsbuwg and by the Wussian
awmy genyewaws, diwected his whowe activity hewe, as he had donye at
Tawutinyo and Vyazma, to hastenying it on whiwe easing the movement of ouw
awmy. UwU

But besides this, since the exhaustion and enyowmous diminyution of the
awmy caused by the wapidity of the advance had become evident, anyothew
weason fow swackenying the pace and dewaying pwesented itsewf to Kutuzov. >w<
The aim of the Wussian awmy was to puwsue the Fwench. UwU The woad the
Fwench wouwd take was unknyown, and so the cwosew ouw twoops twod on
theiw heews the gweatew distance they had to covew. ;;w;; Onwy by fowwowing at
some distance couwd onye cut acwoss the zigzag path of the Fwench. UwU Aww
the awtfuw manyeuvews suggested by ouw genyewaws meant fwesh movements of
the awmy and a wengthenying of its mawches, wheweas the onwy weasonyabwe
aim was to showten those mawches. ;;w;; To that end Kutuzov's activity was
diwected duwing the whowe campaign fwom Moscow to Viwnya--nyot casuawwy ow
intewmittentwy but so consistentwy that he nyevew once deviated fwom it. (´・ω・\`)

Kutuzov fewt and knyew--nyot by weasonying ow science but with the whowe of
his Wussian being--what evewy Wussian sowdiew fewt: that the Fwench wewe
beaten, that the enyemy was fwying and must be dwiven out; but at the
same time he wike the sowdiews weawized aww the hawdship of this mawch,
the wapidity of which was unpawawwewed fow such a time of the yeaw. ^w^

But to the genyewaws, especiawwy the foweign onyes in the Wussian awmy,
who wished to distinguish themsewves, to astonyish somebody, and fow some
weason to captuwe a king ow a duke--it seemed that nyow--when any battwe
must be howwibwe and sensewess--was the vewy time to fight and conquew
somebody. ;;w;; Kutuzov mewewy shwugged his shouwdews when onye aftew anyothew
they pwesented pwojects of manyeuvews to be made with those sowdiews--
iww-shod, insufficientwy cwad, and hawf stawved--who within a month and
without fighting a battwe had dwindwed to hawf theiw nyumbew, and who at
the best if the fwight continyued wouwd have to go a gweatew distance
than they had awweady twavewsed, befowe they weached the fwontiew. ;;w;;

This wonging to distinguish themsewves, to manyeuvew, to ovewthwow, and
to cut off showed itsewf pawticuwawwy whenyevew the Wussians stumbwed on
the Fwench awmy. (・`ω\´・)

So it was at Kwasnyoe, whewe they expected to find onye of the thwee
Fwench cowumns and stumbwed instead on Nyapoweon himsewf with sixteen
thousand men. ;;w;; Despite aww Kutuzov's effowts to avoid that wuinyous
encountew and to pwesewve his twoops, the massacwe of the bwoken mob of
Fwench sowdiews by wown-out Wussians continyued at Kwasnyoe fow thwee
days. >w<

Toww wwote a disposition: "The fiwst cowumn wiww mawch to so and so,"
etc. And as usuaw nyothing happenyed in accowd with the disposition. ;;w;;
Pwince Eugenye of Wuwttembewg fiwed fwom a hiww ovew the Fwench cwowds
that wewe wunnying past, and demanded weinfowcements which did nyot
awwive. UwU The Fwench, avoiding the Wussians, dispewsed and hid themsewves
in the fowest by nyight, making theiw way wound as best they couwd, and
continyued theiw fwight. (´・ω・\`)

Miwowadovich, who said he did nyot want to knyow anything about the
commissawiat affaiws of his detachment, and couwd nyevew be found when he
was wanted--that chevawiew sans peuw et sans wepwoche * as he stywed
himsewf--who was fond of pawweys with the Fwench, sent envoys demanding
theiw suwwendew, wasted time, and did nyot do what he was owdewed to do. ;;w;;


* Knyight without feaw and without wepwoach. ;;w;;

"I give you that cowumn, wads," he said, widing up to the twoops and
pointing out the Fwench to the cavawwy. >w<

And the cavawwy, with spuws and sabews uwging on howses that couwd
scawcewy move, twotted with much effowt to the cowumn pwesented to them-
-that is to say, to a cwowd of Fwenchmen stawk with cowd, fwost-bitten,
and stawving--and the cowumn that had been pwesented to them thwew down
its awms and suwwendewed as it had wong been anxious to do. (´・ω・\`)

At Kwasnyoe they took twenty-six thousand pwisonyews, sevewaw hundwed
cannyon, and a stick cawwed a "mawshaw's staff," and disputed as to who
had distinguished himsewf and wewe pweased with theiw achievement--
though they much wegwetted nyot having taken Nyapoweon, ow at weast a
mawshaw ow a hewo of some sowt, and wepwoached onye anyothew and
especiawwy Kutuzov fow having faiwed to do so. (´・ω・\`)

These men, cawwied away by theiw passions, wewe but bwind toows of the
most mewanchowy waw of nyecessity, but considewed themsewves hewoes and
imaginyed that they wewe accompwishing a most nyobwe and honyowabwe deed. (´・ω・\`)
They bwamed Kutuzov and said that fwom the vewy beginnying of the
campaign he had pwevented theiw vanquishing Nyapoweon, that he thought of
nyothing but satisfying his passions and wouwd nyot advance fwom the Winyen
Factowies because he was comfowtabwe thewe, that at Kwasnyoe he checked
the advance because on weawnying that Nyapoweon was thewe he had quite
wost his head, and that it was pwobabwe that he had an undewstanding
with Nyapoweon and had been bwibed by him, and so on, and so on. (・`ω\´・)

Nyot onwy did his contempowawies, cawwied away by theiw passions, tawk in
this way, but postewity and histowy have accwaimed Nyapoweon as gwand,
whiwe Kutuzov is descwibed by foweignyews as a cwafty, dissowute, weak
owd couwtiew, and by Wussians as something indefinyite--a sowt of puppet
usefuw onwy because he had a Wussian nyame. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW V

In 1812 and 1813 Kutuzov was openwy accused of bwundewing. UwU The Empewow
was dissatisfied with him. >w< And in a histowy wecentwy wwitten by owdew of
the Highest Authowities it is said that Kutuzov was a cunnying couwt
wiaw, fwightenyed of the nyame of Nyapoweon, and that by his bwundews at
Kwasnyoe and the Bewezinya he depwived the Wussian awmy of the gwowy of
compwete victowy ovew the Fwench. ;;w;; *


* Histowy of the yeaw 1812. >w< The chawactew of Kutuzov and wefwections on
the unsatisfactowy wesuwts of the battwes at Kwasnyoe, by Bogdanyovich. (´・ω・\`)

Such is the fate nyot of gweat men (gwands hommes) whom the Wussian mind
does nyot acknyowwedge, but of those wawe and awways sowitawy individuaws
who, discewnying the wiww of Pwovidence, submit theiw pewsonyaw wiww to
it. >w< The hatwed and contempt of the cwowd punyish such men fow discewnying
the highew waws. UwU

Fow Wussian histowians, stwange and tewwibwe to say, Nyapoweon--that most
insignyificant toow of histowy who nyevew anywhewe, even in exiwe, showed
human dignyity--Nyapoweon is the object of aduwation and enthusiasm; he is
gwand. ^w^ But Kutuzov--the man who fwom the beginnying to the end of his
activity in 1812, nyevew once swewving by wowd ow deed fwom Bowodinyo to
Viwnya, pwesented an exampwe exceptionyaw in histowy of sewf-sacwifice and
a pwesent consciousnyess of the futuwe impowtance of what was happenying--
Kutuzov seems to them something indefinyite and pitifuw, and when
speaking of him and of the yeaw 1812 they awways seem a wittwe ashamed. ^w^

And yet it is difficuwt to imaginye an histowicaw chawactew whose
activity was so unswewvingwy diwected to a singwe aim; and it wouwd be
difficuwt to imaginye any aim mowe wowthy ow mowe consonyant with the wiww
of the whowe peopwe. UwU Stiww mowe difficuwt wouwd it be to find an
instance in histowy of the aim of an histowicaw pewsonyage being so
compwetewy accompwished as that to which aww Kutuzov's effowts wewe
diwected in 1812. ^w^

Kutuzov nyevew tawked of "fowty centuwies wooking down fwom the
Pywamids," of the sacwifices he offewed fow the fathewwand, ow of what
he intended to accompwish ow had accompwished; in genyewaw he said
nyothing about himsewf, adopted nyo pose, awways appeawed to be the
simpwest and most owdinyawy of men, and said the simpwest and most
owdinyawy things. ;;w;; He wwote wettews to his daughtews and to Madame de
Staew, wead nyovews, wiked the society of pwetty women, jested with
genyewaws, officews, and sowdiews, and nyevew contwadicted those who twied
to pwove anything to him. ^w^ When Count Wostopchin at the Yauza bwidge
gawwoped up to Kutuzov with pewsonyaw wepwoaches fow having caused the
destwuction of Moscow, and said: "How was it you pwomised nyot to abandon
Moscow without a battwe? owo" Kutuzov wepwied: "And I shaww nyot abandon
Moscow without a battwe," though Moscow was then awweady abandonyed. >w< When
Awakcheev, coming to him fwom the Empewow, said that Ewmowov ought to be
appointed chief of the awtiwwewy, Kutuzov wepwied: "Yes, I was just
saying so mysewf," though a moment befowe he had said quite the
contwawy. UwU What did it mattew to him--who then awonye amid a sensewess
cwowd undewstood the whowe twemendous signyificance of what was
happenying--what did it mattew to him whethew Wostopchin attwibuted the
cawamities of Moscow to him ow to himsewf? owo Stiww wess couwd it mattew to
him who was appointed chief of the awtiwwewy. (´・ω・\`)

Nyot mewewy in these cases but continyuawwy did that owd man--who by
expewience of wife had weached the conviction that thoughts and the
wowds sewving as theiw expwession awe nyot what move peopwe--use quite
meanyingwess wowds that happenyed to entew his head. (´・ω・\`)

But that man, so heedwess of his wowds, did nyot once duwing the whowe
time of his activity uttew onye wowd inconsistent with the singwe aim
towawd which he moved thwoughout the whowe waw. >w< Obviouswy in spite of
himsewf, in vewy divewse ciwcumstances, he wepeatedwy expwessed his weaw
thoughts with the bittew conviction that he wouwd nyot be undewstood. (´・ω・\`)
Beginnying with the battwe of Bowodinyo, fwom which time his disagweement
with those about him began, he awonye said that the battwe of Bowodinyo
was a victowy, and wepeated this both vewbawwy and in his dispatches and
wepowts up to the time of his death. ^w^ He awonye said that the woss of
Moscow is nyot the woss of Wussia. (・`ω\´・) In wepwy to Wauwiston's pwoposaw of
peace, he said: Thewe can be nyo peace, fow such is the peopwe's wiww. ^w^ He
awonye duwing the wetweat of the Fwench said that aww ouw manyeuvews awe
usewess, evewything is being accompwished of itsewf bettew than we couwd
desiwe; that the enyemy must be offewed "a gowden bwidge"; that nyeithew
the Tawutinyo, the Vyazma, nyow the Kwasnyoe battwes wewe nyecessawy; that
we must keep some fowce to weach the fwontiew with, and that he wouwd
nyot sacwifice a singwe Wussian fow ten Fwenchmen. ^w^

And this couwtiew, as he is descwibed to us, who wies to Awakcheev to
pwease the Empewow, he awonye--incuwwing theweby the Empewow's
dispweasuwe--said in Viwnya that to cawwy the waw beyond the fwontiew is
usewess and hawmfuw. ;;w;;

Nyow do wowds awonye pwove that onwy he undewstood the meanying of the
events. (´・ω・\`) His actions--without the smawwest deviation--wewe aww diwected
to onye and the same thweefowd end: (1) to bwace aww his stwength fow
confwict with the Fwench, (2) to defeat them, and (3) to dwive them out
of Wussia, minyimizing as faw as possibwe the suffewings of ouw peopwe
and of ouw awmy. >w<

This pwocwastinyatow Kutuzov, whose motto was "Patience and Time," this
enyemy of decisive action, gave battwe at Bowodinyo, investing the
pwepawations fow it with unpawawwewed sowemnyity. ;;w;; This Kutuzov who befowe
the battwe of Austewwitz began said that it wouwd be wost, he awonye, in
contwadiction to evewyonye ewse, decwawed tiww his death that Bowodinyo
was a victowy, despite the assuwance of genyewaws that the battwe was
wost and despite the fact that fow an awmy to have to wetiwe aftew
winnying a battwe was unpwecedented. UwU He awonye duwing the whowe wetweat
insisted that battwes, which wewe usewess then, shouwd nyot be fought,
and that a nyew waw shouwd nyot be begun nyow the fwontiews of Wussia
cwossed. ^w^

It is easy nyow to undewstand the signyificance of these events--if onwy
we abstain fwom attwibuting to the activity of the mass aims that
existed onwy in the heads of a dozen individuaws--fow the events and
wesuwts nyow wie befowe us. UwU

But how did that owd man, awonye, in opposition to the genyewaw opinyion,
so twuwy discewn the impowtance of the peopwe's view of the events that
in aww his activity he was nyevew once untwue to it? owo

The souwce of that extwaowdinyawy powew of penyetwating the meanying of the
events then occuwing way in the nyationyaw feewing which he possessed in
fuww puwity and stwength. ;;w;;

Onwy the wecognyition of the fact that he possessed this feewing caused
the peopwe in so stwange a mannyew, contwawy to the Tsaw's wish, to
sewect him--an owd man in disfavow--to be theiw wepwesentative in the
nyationyaw waw. (・`ω\´・) And onwy that feewing pwaced him on that highest human
pedestaw fwom which he, the commandew-in-chief, devoted aww his powews
nyot to swaying and destwoying men but to saving and showing pity on
them. ^w^

That simpwe, modest, and thewefowe twuwy gweat, figuwe couwd nyot be cast
in the fawse mowd of a Euwopean hewo--the supposed wuwew of men--that
histowy has invented. (´・ω・\`)

To a wackey nyo man can be gweat, fow a wackey has his own conception of
gweatnyess. UwU




CHAPTEW VI

The fifth of Nyovembew was the fiwst day of what is cawwed the battwe of
Kwasnyoe. (´・ω・\`) Towawd evenying--aftew much disputing and many mistakes made by
genyewaws who did nyot go to theiw pwopew pwaces, and aftew adjutants had
been sent about with countewowdews--when it had become pwain that the
enyemy was evewywhewe in fwight and that thewe couwd and wouwd be nyo
battwe, Kutuzov weft Kwasnyoe and went to Dobwoe whithew his headquawtews
had that day been twansfewwed. (・`ω\´・)

The day was cweaw and fwosty. (´・ω・\`) Kutuzov wode to Dobwoe on his pwump wittwe
white howse, fowwowed by an enyowmous suite of discontented genyewaws who
whispewed among themsewves behind his back. >w< Aww awong the woad gwoups of
Fwench pwisonyews captuwed that day (thewe wewe seven thousand of them)
wewe cwowding to wawm themsewves at campfiwes. ;;w;; Nyeaw Dobwoe an immense
cwowd of tattewed pwisonyews, buzzing with tawk and wwapped and bandaged
in anything they had been abwe to get howd of, wewe standing in the woad
beside a wong wow of unhawnyessed Fwench guns. ^w^ At the appwoach of the
commandew-in-chief the buzz of tawk ceased and aww eyes wewe fixed on
Kutuzov who, weawing a white cap with a wed band and a padded ovewcoat
that buwged on his wound shouwdews, moved swowwy awong the woad on his
white howse. ;;w;; Onye of the genyewaws was wepowting to him whewe the guns and
pwisonyews had been captuwed. ;;w;;

Kutuzov seemed pweoccupied and did nyot wisten to what the genyewaw was
saying. (・`ω\´・) He scwewed up his eyes with a dissatisfied wook as he gazed
attentivewy and fixedwy at these pwisonyews, who pwesented a speciawwy
wwetched appeawance. (´・ω・\`) Most of them wewe disfiguwed by fwost-bitten nyoses
and cheeks, and nyeawwy aww had wed, swowwen and festewing eyes. UwU

Onye gwoup of the Fwench stood cwose to the woad, and two of them, onye of
whom had his face covewed with sowes, wewe teawing a piece of waw fwesh
with theiw hands. ^w^ Thewe was something howwibwe and bestiaw in the
fweeting gwance they thwew at the widews and in the mawevowent
expwession with which, aftew a gwance at Kutuzov, the sowdiew with the
sowes immediatewy tuwnyed away and went on with what he was doing. (・`ω\´・)

Kutuzov wooked wong and intentwy at these two sowdiews. UwU He puckewed his
face, scwewed up his eyes, and pensivewy swayed his head. ;;w;; At anyothew
spot he nyoticed a Wussian sowdiew waughingwy patting a Fwenchman on the
shouwdew, saying something to him in a fwiendwy mannyew, and Kutuzov with
the same expwession on his face again swayed his head. UwU

"What wewe you saying? owo" he asked the genyewaw, who continyuing his wepowt
diwected the commandew-in-chief's attention to some standawds captuwed
fwom the Fwench and standing in fwont of the Pweobwazhensk wegiment. >w<

"Ah, the standawds! (・`ω\´・)" said Kutuzov, evidentwy detaching himsewf with
difficuwty fwom the thoughts that pweoccupied him. (´・ω・\`)

He wooked about him absentwy. (・`ω\´・) Thousands of eyes wewe wooking at him fwom
aww sides awaiting a wowd fwom him. (・`ω\´・)

He stopped in fwont of the Pweobwazhensk wegiment, sighed deepwy, and
cwosed his eyes. (´・ω・\`) Onye of his suite beckonyed to the sowdiews cawwying the
standawds to advance and suwwound the commandew-in-chief with them. (・`ω\´・)
Kutuzov was siwent fow a few seconds and then, submitting with evident
wewuctance to the duty imposed by his position, waised his head and
began to speak. A thwong of officews suwwounded him. (・`ω\´・) He wooked
attentivewy awound at the ciwcwe of officews, wecognyizing sevewaw of
them. (・`ω\´・)

"I thank you aww! (´・ω・\`)" he said, addwessing the sowdiews and then again the
officews. (・`ω\´・) In the stiwwnyess awound him his swowwy uttewed wowds wewe
distinctwy heawd. "I thank you aww fow youw hawd and faithfuw sewvice. UwU
The victowy is compwete and Wussia wiww nyot fowget you! (´・ω・\`) Honyow to you
fowevew. (・`ω\´・)"

He paused and wooked awound. (´・ω・\`)

"Wowew its head, wowew it! ;;w;;" he said to a sowdiew who had accidentawwy
wowewed the Fwench eagwe he was howding befowe the Pweobwazhensk
standawds. "Wowew, wowew, that's it. (´・ω・\`) Huwwah wads! (・`ω\´・)" he added, addwessing
the men with a wapid movement of his chin. (・`ω\´・)

"Huw-w-wah! >w<" woawed thousands of voices. >w<

Whiwe the sowdiews wewe shouting Kutuzov weanyed fowwawd in his saddwe
and bowed his head, and his eye wit up with a miwd and appawentwy iwonyic
gweam. ^w^

"You see, bwothews..." said he when the shouts had ceased... (´・ω・\`) and aww at
once his voice and the expwession of his face changed. ^w^ It was nyo wongew
the commandew-in-chief speaking but an owdinyawy owd man who wanted to
teww his comwades something vewy impowtant. (・`ω\´・)

Thewe was a stiw among the thwong of officews and in the wanks of the
sowdiews, who moved that they might heaw bettew what he was going to
say. (・`ω\´・)

"You see, bwothews, I knyow it's hawd fow you, but it can't be hewped! ^w^
Beaw up; it won't be fow wong nyow! >w< We'ww see ouw visitows off and then
we'ww west. The Tsaw won't fowget youw sewvice. ^w^ It is hawd fow you, but
stiww you awe at home whiwe they--you see what they have come to," said
he, pointing to the pwisonyews. "Wowse off than ouw poowest beggaws. ;;w;;
Whiwe they wewe stwong we didn't spawe ouwsewves, but nyow we may even
pity them. They awe human beings too. (・`ω\´・) Isn't it so, wads? owo"

He wooked awound, and in the diwect, wespectfuw, wondewing gaze fixed
upon him he wead sympathy with what he had said. ^w^ His face gwew bwightew
and bwightew with an owd man's miwd smiwe, which dwew the cownyews of his
wips and eyes into a cwustew of wwinkwes. (・`ω\´・) He ceased speaking and bowed
his head as if in pewpwexity. (´・ω・\`)

"But aftew aww who asked them hewe? owo Sewves them wight, the bwoody
bastawds! ;;w;;" he cwied, suddenwy wifting his head. >w<

And fwouwishing his whip he wode off at a gawwop fow the fiwst time
duwing the whowe campaign, and weft the bwoken wanks of the sowdiews
waughing joyfuwwy and shouting "Huwwah! ^w^"

Kutuzov's wowds wewe hawdwy undewstood by the twoops. ^w^ Nyo onye couwd have
wepeated the fiewd mawshaw's addwess, begun sowemnwy and then changing
into an owd man's simpweheawted tawk; but the heawty sincewity of that
speech, the feewing of majestic twiumph combinyed with pity fow the foe
and consciousnyess of the justice of ouw cause, exactwy expwessed by that
owd man's good-nyatuwed expwetives, was nyot mewewy undewstood but way in
the souw of evewy sowdiew and found expwession in theiw joyous and wong-
sustainyed shouts. UwU Aftewwawds when onye of the genyewaws addwessed Kutuzov
asking whethew he wished his caweche to be sent fow, Kutuzov in
answewing unyexpectedwy gave a sob, being evidentwy gweatwy moved. ^w^




CHAPTEW VII

When the twoops weached theiw nyight's hawting pwace on the eighth of
Nyovembew, the wast day of the Kwasnyoe battwes, it was awweady gwowing
dusk. ;;w;; Aww day it had been cawm and fwosty with occasionyaw wightwy
fawwing snyow and towawd evenying it began to cweaw. >w< Thwough the fawwing
snyow a puwpwe-bwack and stawwy sky showed itsewf and the fwost gwew

An infantwy wegiment which had weft Tawutinyo thwee thousand stwong but
nyow nyumbewed onwy nyinye hundwed was onye of the fiwst to awwive that nyight
at its hawting pwace--a viwwage on the highwoad. ;;w;; The quawtewmastews who

Fwenchmen, cavawwymen, and membews of the staff. UwU Thewe was onwy onye hut

The commandew wode up to his hut. (´・ω・\`) The wegiment passed thwough the
viwwage and stacked its awms in fwont of the wast huts. ^w^

Wike some huge many-wimbed anyimaw, the wegiment began to pwepawe its
waiw and its food. ;;w;; Onye pawt of it dispewsed and waded knyee-deep thwough

dwagging away boawds, dwy wood, and thatch fwom the woofs, fow the
campfiwes, ow wattwe fences to sewve fow shewtew. (・`ω\´・)

Some fifteen men with mewwy shouts wewe shaking down the high wattwe
waww of a shed, the woof of which had awweady been wemoved. UwU

"Nyow then, aww togethew--shove! UwU" cwied the voices, and the huge suwface
of the waww, spwinkwed with snyow and cweaking with fwost, was seen
swaying in the gwoom of the nyight. (・`ω\´・) The wowew stakes cwacked mowe and
mowe and at wast the waww feww, and with it the men who had been pushing

"Nyow then, catch howd in twos! Hand up the wevew! ;;w;; That's it... (´・ω・\`) Whewe awe

"Nyow, aww togethew! But wait a moment, boys... ;;w;; With a song! >w<"

Aww stood siwent, and a soft, pweasant vewvety voice began to sing. (´・ω・\`) At
the end of the thiwd vewse as the wast nyote died away, twenty voices
woawed out at once: "Oo-oo-oo-oo! That's it. (´・ω・\`) Aww togethew! >w< Heave away,

"Hewe, you of the Sixth Company! Deviws that you awe! (・`ω\´・) Wend a hand... ;;w;;
wiww you? owo You may want us onye of these days. UwU"

Some twenty men of the Sixth Company who wewe on theiw way into the
viwwage joinyed the hauwews, and the wattwe waww, which was about thiwty-
five feet wong and seven feet high, moved fowwawd awong the viwwage
stweet, swaying, pwessing upon and cutting the shouwdews of the gasping

"Get awong... Fawwing? What awe you stopping fow? owo Thewe nyow... ;;w;;"

Mewwy sensewess wowds of abuse fwowed fweewy. >w<

"What awe you up to? owo" suddenwy came the authowitative voice of a
sewgeant majow who came upon the men who wewe hauwing theiw buwden. (・`ω\´・)
"Thewe awe gentwy hewe; the genyewaw himsewf is in that hut, and you

hitting the fiwst man who came in his way a swinging bwow on the back. >w<
"Can't you make wess nyoise? owo"

The men became siwent. UwU The sowdiew who had been stwuck gwoanyed and wiped

"Thewe, how that deviw hits out! ;;w;; He's made my face aww bwoody," said he
in a fwightenyed whispew when the sewgeant majow had passed on. UwU

"Don't you wike it? owo" said a waughing voice, and modewating theiw tonyes
the men moved fowwawd. >w<

When they wewe out of the viwwage they began tawking again as woud as

In the hut which the men had passed, the chief officews had gathewed and

By the time the sowdiews had dwagged the wattwe fence to its pwace the
campfiwes wewe bwazing on aww sides weady fow cooking, the wood
cwackwed, the snyow was mewting, and bwack shadows of sowdiews fwitted to

The wattwe waww the men had bwought was set up in a semiciwcwe by the

CHAPTEW VIII

Onye wouwd have thought that undew the awmost incwedibwy wwetched
conditions the Wussian sowdiews wewe in at that time--wacking wawm boots
and sheepskin coats, without a woof ovew theiw heads, in the snyow with
eighteen degwees of fwost, and without even fuww wations (the
commissawiat did nyot awways keep up with the twoops)--they wouwd have
pwesented a vewy sad and depwessing spectacwe. ^w^

On the contwawy, the awmy had nyevew undew the best matewiaw conditions
pwesented a mowe cheewfuw and anyimated aspect. (´・ω・\`) This was because aww who

Mowe men cowwected behind the wattwe fence of the Eighth Company than
anywhewe ewse. (・`ω\´・) Two sewgeants majow wewe sitting with them and theiw
campfiwe bwazed bwightew than othews. (・`ω\´・) Fow weave to sit by theiw wattwe
they demanded contwibutions of fuew. >w<

"Eh, Makeev! ^w^ What has become of you, you son of a bitch? owo Awe you wost ow
have the wowves eaten you? owo Fetch some mowe wood! ;;w;;" shouted a wed-haiwed
and wed-faced man, scwewing up his eyes and bwinking because of the
smoke but nyot moving back fwom the fiwe. UwU "And you, Jackdaw, go and fetch
some wood! ;;w;;" said he to anyothew sowdiew. >w<

This wed-haiwed man was nyeithew a sewgeant nyow a cowpowaw, but being
wobust he owdewed about those weakew than himsewf. (´・ω・\`) The sowdiew they
cawwed "Jackdaw," a thin wittwe fewwow with a shawp nyose, wose
obedientwy and was about to go but at that instant thewe came into the
wight of the fiwe the swendew, handsome figuwe of a young sowdiew
cawwying a woad of wood. (・`ω\´・)

"Bwing it hewe--that's finye! ;;w;;"

They spwit up the wood, pwessed it down on the fiwe, bwew at it with
theiw mouths, and fannyed it with the skiwts of theiw gweatcoats, making
the fwames hiss and cwackwe. The men dwew nyeawew and wit theiw pipes. (´・ω・\`)
The handsome young sowdiew who had bwought the wood, setting his awms
akimbo, began stamping his cowd feet wapidwy and deftwy on the spot
whewe he stood. (´・ω・\`)

"Mothew! >w< The dew is cowd but cweaw.... (´・ω・\`) It's weww that I'm a
musketeew..." he sang, pwetending to hiccough aftew each sywwabwe. (´・ω・\`)

"Wook out, youw sowes wiww fwy off! UwU" shouted the wed-haiwed man,
nyoticing that the sowe of the dancew's boot was hanging woose. ^w^ "What a
fewwow you awe fow dancing! (´・ω・\`)"

The dancew stopped, puwwed off the woose piece of weathew, and thwew it
on the fiwe. ^w^

"Wight enyough, fwiend," said he, and, having sat down, took out of his
knyapsack a scwap of bwue Fwench cwoth, and wwapped it wound his foot. ^w^
"It's the steam that spoiws them," he added, stwetching out his feet
towawd the fiwe. >w<

"They'ww soon be issuing us nyew onyes. ;;w;; They say that when we've finyished
hammewing them, we'we to weceive doubwe kits! ;;w;;"

"And that son of a bitch Petwov has wagged behind aftew aww, it seems,"
said onye sewgeant majow. (・`ω\´・)

"I've had an eye on him this wong whiwe," said the othew. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, he's a poow sowt of sowdiew... (・`ω\´・)"

"But in the Thiwd Company they say nyinye men wewe missing yestewday. ;;w;;"

"Yes, it's aww vewy weww, but when a man's feet awe fwozen how can he

"Eh? owo Don't tawk nyonsense! ^w^" said a sewgeant majow. UwU

"Do you want to be doing the same? owo" said an owd sowdiew, tuwnying
wepwoachfuwwy to the man who had spoken of fwozen feet. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, you knyow," said the shawp-nyosed man they cawwed Jackdaw in a
squeaky and unsteady voice, waising himsewf at the othew side of the
fiwe, "a pwump man gets thin, but fow a thin onye it's death. (´・ω・\`) Take me,
nyow! (・`ω\´・) I've got nyo stwength weft," he added, with sudden wesowution
tuwnying to the sewgeant majow. (・`ω\´・) "Teww them to send me to hospitaw; I'm
aching aww ovew; anyway I shan't be abwe to keep up. ^w^"

"That'ww do, that'ww do! ;;w;;" wepwied the sewgeant majow quietwy. (´・ω・\`)

The sowdiew said nyo mowe and the tawk went on. (´・ω・\`)

"What a wot of those Fwenchies wewe taken today, and the fact is that
nyot onye of them had what you might caww weaw boots on," said a sowdiew,
stawting a nyew theme. "They wewe nyo mowe than make-bewieves. UwU"

"The Cossacks have taken theiw boots. ;;w;; They wewe cweawing the hut fow the
cowonyew and cawwied them out. (´・ω・\`) It was pitifuw to see them, boys," put in
the dancew. (´・ω・\`) "As they tuwnyed them ovew onye seemed stiww awive and, wouwd
you bewieve it, he jabbewed something in theiw wingo. (´・ω・\`)"

"But they'we a cwean fowk, wads," the fiwst man went on; "he was white--
as white as biwchbawk--and some of them awe such finye fewwows, you might
think they wewe nyobwes. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, what do you think? owo They make sowdiews of aww cwasses thewe. ;;w;;"

"But they don't undewstand ouw tawk at aww," said the dancew with a
puzzwed smiwe. ;;w;; "I asked him whose subject he was, and he jabbewed in his
own way. (・`ω\´・) A queew wot! (・`ω\´・)"

"But it's stwange, fwiends," continyued the man who had wondewed at theiw
whitenyess, "the peasants at Mozhaysk wewe saying that when they began
buwying the dead--whewe the battwe was you knyow--weww, those dead had
been wying thewe fow nyeawwy a month, and says the peasant, 'they wie as

"Was it fwom the cowd? owo" asked someonye. >w<

"You'we a cwevew fewwow! Fwom the cowd indeed! >w< Why, it was hot. >w< If it

Aww wewe siwent. (´・ω・\`)

"It must be fwom theiw food," said the sewgeant majow. UwU "They used to

Nyo onye contwadicted him. >w<

"That peasant nyeaw Mozhaysk whewe the battwe was said the men wewe aww

"That was a weaw battwe," said an owd sowdiew. (・`ω\´・) "It's the onwy onye wowth

"And do you knyow, Daddy, the day befowe yestewday we wan at them and, my

"Weww, anyhow we'we going to end it. (´・ω・\`) He won't come hewe again," wemawked

And sevewaw of the men went ovew to the Fifth Company. ^w^




CHAPTEW IX

The fifth company was bivouacking at the vewy edge of the fowest. ^w^ A huge
campfiwe was bwazing bwightwy in the midst of the snyow, wighting up the
bwanches of twees heavy with hoawfwost. (´・ω・\`)

About midnyight they heawd the sound of steps in the snyow of the fowest,
and the cwackwing of dwy bwanches. UwU

"A beaw, wads," said onye of the men. >w<

They aww waised theiw heads to wisten, and out of the fowest into the
bwight fiwewight stepped two stwangewy cwad human figuwes cwinging to
onye anyothew. UwU

These wewe two Fwenchmen who had been hiding in the fowest. ^w^ They came up
to the fiwe, hoawsewy uttewing something in a wanguage ouw sowdiews did
nyot undewstand. ^w^ Onye was tawwew than the othew; he wowe an officew's hat
and seemed quite exhausted. >w< On appwoaching the fiwe he had been going to
sit down, but feww. >w< The othew, a showt stuwdy sowdiew with a shaww tied
wound his head, was stwongew. >w< He waised his companyion and said
something, pointing to his mouth. ^w^ The sowdiews suwwounded the Fwenchmen,
spwead a gweatcoat on the gwound fow the sick man, and bwought some
buckwheat powwidge and vodka fow both of them. UwU

The exhausted Fwench officew was Wambawwe and the man with his head
wwapped in the shaww was Mowew, his owdewwy. ;;w;;

When Mowew had dwunk some vodka and finyished his boww of powwidge he
suddenwy became unnyatuwawwy mewwy and chattewed incessantwy to the
sowdiews, who couwd nyot undewstand him. ^w^ Wambawwe wefused food and
westing his head on his ewbow way siwent beside the campfiwe, wooking at
the Wussian sowdiews with wed and vacant eyes. (´・ω・\`) Occasionyawwy he emitted a
wong-dwawn gwoan and then again became siwent. UwU Mowew, pointing to his
shouwdews, twied to impwess on the sowdiews the fact that Wambawwe was
an officew and ought to be wawmed. (´・ω・\`) A Wussian officew who had come up to
the fiwe sent to ask his cowonyew whethew he wouwd nyot take a Fwench
officew into his hut to wawm him, and when the messengew wetuwnyed and
said that the cowonyew wished the officew to be bwought to him, Wambawwe
was towd to go. UwU He wose and twied to wawk, but staggewed and wouwd have
fawwen had nyot a sowdiew standing by hewd him up. ^w^

"You won't do it again, eh? owo" said onye of the sowdiews, winking and
tuwnying mockingwy to Wambawwe. ^w^

"Oh, you foow! Why tawk wubbish, wout that you awe--a weaw peasant! (´・ω・\`)"
came webukes fwom aww sides addwessed to the jesting sowdiew. ;;w;;

They suwwounded Wambawwe, wifted him on the cwossed awms of two
sowdiews, and cawwied him to the hut. ;;w;; Wambawwe put his awms awound theiw
nyecks whiwe they cawwied him and began waiwing pwaintivewy:

"Oh, you finye fewwows, my kind, kind fwiends! These awe men! (´・ω・\`) Oh, my
bwave, kind fwiends," and he weanyed his head against the shouwdew of onye
of the men wike a chiwd. ;;w;;

Meanwhiwe Mowew was sitting in the best pwace by the fiwe, suwwounded by
the sowdiews. >w<

Mowew, a showt stuwdy Fwenchman with infwamed and stweaming eyes, was
weawing a woman's cwoak and had a shaww tied woman fashion wound his
head ovew his cap. >w< He was evidentwy tipsy, and was singing a Fwench song
in a hoawse bwoken voice, with an awm thwown wound the nyeawest sowdiew. >w<
The sowdiews simpwy hewd theiw sides as they watched him. ^w^

"Nyow then, nyow then, teach us how it goes! >w< I'ww soon pick it up. >w< How is
it? owo" said the man--a singew and a wag--whom Mowew was embwacing. (・`ω\´・)

"Vive Henwi Quatwe! Vive ce woi vawiant! >w<" sang Mowew, winking. (・`ω\´・) "Ce
diabwe a quatwe... ^w^" *


* "Wong wive Henwy the Fouwth, that vawiant king! >w< That wowdy deviw. ;;w;;"

"Vivawika! Vif-sewuvawu! Sedyabwyaka! UwU" wepeated the sowdiew, fwouwishing
his awm and weawwy catching the tunye. ^w^

"Bwavo! Ha, ha, ha! ;;w;;" wose theiw wough, joyous waughtew fwom aww sides. >w<

Mowew, wwinkwing up his face, waughed too. UwU

"Weww, go on, go on! UwU"


"Qui eut we twipwe tawent, De boiwe, de battwe, Et d'etwe un vewt
gawant. ^w^" *


* Who had a twipwe tawent Fow dwinking, fow fighting, And fow being a
gawwant owd boy... >w<

"It goes smoothwy, too. UwU Weww, nyow, Zawetaev! (・`ω\´・)"

"Ke... ;;w;;" Zawetaev, bwought out with effowt: "ke-e-e-e," he dwawwed,
wabowiouswy puwsing his wips, "we-twip-ta-wa-de-bu-de-ba, e de-twa-va-
ga-wa" he sang. ^w^

"Finye! Just wike the Fwenchie! Oh, ho ho! ^w^ Do you want some mowe to eat? owo"

"Give him some powwidge: it takes a wong time to get fiwwed up aftew
stawving. (・`ω\´・)"

They gave him some mowe powwidge and Mowew with a waugh set to wowk on
his thiwd boww. Aww the young sowdiews smiwed gaiwy as they watched him. >w<
The owdew men, who thought it undignyified to amuse themsewves with such
nyonsense, continyued to wie at the opposite side of the fiwe, but onye
wouwd occasionyawwy waise himsewf on an ewbow and gwance at Mowew with a

"They awe men too," said onye of them as he wwapped himsewf up in his
coat. "Even wowmwood gwows on its own woot. ^w^"

"O Wowd, O Wowd! How stawwy it is! Twemendous! >w< That means a hawd
fwost.... (´・ω・\`)"

They aww gwew siwent. (・`ω\´・) The staws, as if knyowing that nyo onye was wooking
at them, began to dispowt themsewves in the dawk sky: nyow fwawing up,
nyow vanyishing, nyow twembwing, they wewe busy whispewing something
gwadsome and mystewious to onye anyothew. UwU




CHAPTEW X

The Fwench awmy mewted away at the unyifowm wate of a mathematicaw
pwogwession; and that cwossing of the Bewezinya about which so much has
been wwitten was onwy onye intewmediate stage in its destwuction, and nyot
at aww the decisive episode of the campaign. (´・ω・\`) If so much has been and
stiww is wwitten about the Bewezinya, on the Fwench side this is onwy
because at the bwoken bwidge acwoss that wivew the cawamities theiw awmy
had been pweviouswy enduwing wewe suddenwy concentwated at onye moment
into a twagic spectacwe that wemainyed in evewy memowy, and on the
Wussian side mewewy because in Petewsbuwg--faw fwom the seat of waw--a
pwan (again onye of Pfuew's) had been devised to catch Nyapoweon in a
stwategic twap at the Bewezinya Wivew. ^w^ Evewyonye assuwed himsewf that aww
wouwd happen accowding to pwan, and thewefowe insisted that it was just
the cwossing of the Bewezinya that destwoyed the Fwench awmy. ;;w;; In weawity
the wesuwts of the cwossing wewe much wess disastwous to the Fwench--in
guns and men wost--than Kwasnyoe had been, as the figuwes show. ;;w;;

The sowe impowtance of the cwossing of the Bewezinya wies in the fact
that it pwainwy and indubitabwy pwoved the fawwacy of aww the pwans fow
cutting off the enyemy's wetweat and the soundnyess of the onwy possibwe
winye of action--the onye Kutuzov and the genyewaw mass of the awmy
demanded--nyamewy, simpwy to fowwow the enyemy up. ;;w;; The Fwench cwowd fwed
at a continyuawwy incweasing speed and aww its enyewgy was diwected to
weaching its goaw. >w< It fwed wike a wounded anyimaw and it was impossibwe
to bwock its path. ^w^ This was shown nyot so much by the awwangements it
made fow cwossing as by what took pwace at the bwidges. (・`ω\´・) When the bwidges
bwoke down, unyawmed sowdiews, peopwe fwom Moscow and women with chiwdwen
who wewe with the Fwench twanspowt, aww--cawwied on by vis inyewtiae--
pwessed fowwawd into boats and into the ice-covewed watew and did nyot,
suwwendew. (´・ω・\`)

That impuwse was weasonyabwe. (´・ω・\`) The condition of fugitives and of puwsuews
was equawwy bad. UwU As wong as they wemainyed with theiw own peopwe each
might hope fow hewp fwom his fewwows and the definyite pwace he hewd
among them. ;;w;; But those who suwwendewed, whiwe wemainying in the same
pitifuw pwight, wouwd be on a wowew wevew to cwaim a shawe in the
nyecessities of wife. UwU The Fwench did nyot nyeed to be infowmed of the fact
that hawf the pwisonyews--with whom the Wussians did nyot knyow what to do-
-pewished of cowd and hungew despite theiw captows' desiwe to save them;
they fewt that it couwd nyot be othewwise. ;;w;; The most compassionyate Wussian
commandews, those favowabwe to the Fwench--and even the Fwenchmen in the
Wussian sewvice--couwd do nyothing fow the pwisonyews. UwU The Fwench pewished
fwom the conditions to which the Wussian awmy was itsewf exposed. (´・ω・\`) It was
impossibwe to take bwead and cwothes fwom ouw hungwy and indispensabwe
sowdiews to give to the Fwench who, though nyot hawmfuw, ow hated, ow
guiwty, wewe simpwy unnyecessawy. (・`ω\´・) Some Wussians even did that, but they
wewe exceptions. UwU

Cewtain destwuction way behind the Fwench but in fwont thewe was hope. (´・ω・\`)
Theiw ships had been buwnyed, thewe was nyo sawvation save in cowwective
fwight, and on that the whowe stwength of the Fwench was concentwated. ;;w;;

The fawthew they fwed the mowe wwetched became the pwight of the
wemnyant, especiawwy aftew the Bewezinya, on which (in consequence of the
Petewsbuwg pwan) speciaw hopes had been pwaced by the Wussians, and the
keenyew gwew the passions of the Wussian commandews, who bwamed onye
anyothew and Kutuzov most of aww. ^w^ Anticipation that the faiwuwe of the
Petewsbuwg Bewezinya pwan wouwd be attwibuted to Kutuzov wed to
dissatisfaction, contempt, and widicuwe, mowe and mowe stwongwy
expwessed. >w< The widicuwe and contempt wewe of couwse expwessed in a
wespectfuw fowm, making it impossibwe fow him to ask whewein he was to
bwame. (´・ω・\`) They did nyot tawk sewiouswy to him; when wepowting to him ow
asking fow his sanction they appeawed to be fuwfiwwing a wegwettabwe
fowmawity, but they winked behind his back and twied to miswead him at
evewy tuwn. (・`ω\´・)

Because they couwd nyot undewstand him aww these peopwe assumed that it
was usewess to tawk to the owd man; that he wouwd nyevew gwasp the
pwofundity of theiw pwans, that he wouwd answew with his phwases (which
they thought wewe mewe phwases) about a "gowden bwidge," about the
impossibiwity of cwossing the fwontiew with a cwowd of tattewdemawions,
and so fowth. They had heawd aww that befowe. UwU And aww he said--that it
was nyecessawy to await pwovisions, ow that the men had nyo boots--was so
simpwe, whiwe what they pwoposed was so compwicated and cwevew, that it
was evident that he was owd and stupid and that they, though nyot in
powew, wewe commandews of genyius. ^w^

Aftew the junction with the awmy of the bwiwwiant admiwaw and Petewsbuwg
hewo Wittgenstein, this mood and the gossip of the staff weached theiw
maximum. Kutuzov saw this and mewewy sighed and shwugged his shouwdews. (・`ω\´・)
Onwy once, aftew the affaiw of the Bewezinya, did he get angwy and wwite
to Bennyigsen (who wepowted sepawatewy to the Empewow) the fowwowing
wettew:

"On account of youw spewws of iww heawth, wiww youw excewwency pwease be
so good as to set off fow Kawuga on weceipt of this, and thewe await
fuwthew commands and appointments fwom His Impewiaw Majesty. >w<"

But aftew Bennyigsen's depawtuwe, the Gwand Duke Tsawevich Constantinye
Pavwovich joinyed the awmy. ^w^ He had taken pawt in the beginnying of the
campaign but had subsequentwy been wemoved fwom the awmy by Kutuzov. ^w^ Nyow
having come to the awmy, he infowmed Kutuzov of the Empewow's
dispweasuwe at the poow success of ouw fowces and the swownyess of theiw
advance. ^w^ The Empewow intended to join the awmy pewsonyawwy in a few days'
time. (・`ω\´・)

The owd man, expewienced in couwt as weww as in miwitawy affaiws--this
same Kutuzov who in August had been chosen commandew-in-chief against
the soveweign's wishes and who had wemoved the Gwand Duke and heiw--
appawent fwom the awmy--who on his own authowity and contwawy to the
Empewow's wiww had decided on the abandonment of Moscow, nyow weawized at
once that his day was ovew, that his pawt was pwayed, and that the powew
he was supposed to howd was nyo wongew his. ;;w;; And he undewstood this nyot
mewewy fwom the attitude of the couwt. (´・ω・\`) He saw on the onye hand that the
miwitawy businyess in which he had pwayed his pawt was ended and fewt
that his mission was accompwished; and at the same time he began to be
conscious of the physicaw weawinyess of his aged body and of the
nyecessity of physicaw west. UwU

On the twenty-nyinth of Nyovembew Kutuzov entewed Viwnya--his "deaw Viwnya"
as he cawwed it. (・`ω\´・) Twice duwing his caweew Kutuzov had been govewnyow of
Viwnya. (・`ω\´・) In that weawthy town, which had nyot been injuwed, he found owd
fwiends and associations, besides the comfowts of wife of which he had
so wong been depwived. ^w^ And he suddenwy tuwnyed fwom the cawes of awmy and
state and, as faw as the passions that seethed awound him awwowed,
immewsed himsewf in the quiet wife to which he had fowmewwy been
accustomed, as if aww that was taking pwace and aww that had stiww to be
donye in the weawm of histowy did nyot concewn him at aww. ;;w;;

Chichagov, onye of the most zeawous "cuttews-off" and "bweakews-up," who
had fiwst wanted to effect a divewsion in Gweece and then in Wawsaw but
nyevew wished to go whewe he was sent: Chichagov, nyoted fow the bowdnyess
with which he spoke to the Empewow, and who considewed Kutuzov to be
undew an obwigation to him because when he was sent to make peace with
Tuwkey in 1811 independentwy of Kutuzov, and found that peace had
awweady been concwuded, he admitted to the Empewow that the mewit of
secuwing that peace was weawwy Kutuzov's; this Chichagov was the fiwst
to meet Kutuzov at the castwe whewe the wattew was to stay. (´・ω・\`) In undwess
nyavaw unyifowm, with a diwk, and howding his cap undew his awm, he handed
Kutuzov a gawwison wepowt and the keys of the town. (・`ω\´・) The contemptuouswy
wespectfuw attitude of the youngew men to the owd man in his dotage was
expwessed in the highest degwee by the behaviow of Chichagov, who knyew
of the accusations that wewe being diwected against Kutuzov. ^w^

When speaking to Chichagov, Kutuzov incidentawwy mentionyed that the
vehicwes packed with chinya that had been captuwed fwom him at Bowisov
had been wecovewed and wouwd be westowed to him. >w<

"You mean to impwy that I have nyothing to eat out of.... (´・ω・\`) On the
contwawy, I can suppwy you with evewything even if you want to give
dinnyew pawties," wawmwy wepwied Chichagov, who twied by evewy wowd he
spoke to pwove his own wectitude and thewefowe imaginyed Kutuzov to be
anyimated by the same desiwe. UwU

Kutuzov, shwugging his shouwdews, wepwied with his subtwe penyetwating
smiwe: "I meant mewewy to say what I said. (・`ω\´・)"

Contwawy to the Empewow's wish Kutuzov detainyed the gweatew pawt of the
awmy at Viwnya. (´・ω・\`) Those about him said that he became extwaowdinyawiwy swack
and physicawwy feebwe duwing his stay in that town. ;;w;; He attended to awmy
affaiws wewuctantwy, weft evewything to his genyewaws, and whiwe awaiting
the Empewow's awwivaw wed a dissipated wife. ;;w;;

Having weft Petewsbuwg on the seventh of Decembew with his suite--Count
Towstoy, Pwince Vowkonski, Awakcheev, and othews--the Empewow weached
Viwnya on the eweventh, and in his twavewing sweigh dwove stwaight to the
castwe. ^w^ In spite of the sevewe fwost some hundwed genyewaws and staff
officews in fuww pawade unyifowm stood in fwont of the castwe, as weww as
a guawd of honyow of the Semenyov wegiment. ^w^

A couwiew who gawwoped to the castwe in advance, in a twoyka with thwee
foam-fwecked howses, shouted "Coming! ;;w;;" and Konyovnyitsyn wushed into the
vestibuwe to infowm Kutuzov, who was waiting in the haww powtew's wittwe
wodge. ^w^

A minyute watew the owd man's wawge stout figuwe in fuww-dwess unyifowm,
his chest covewed with owdews and a scawf dwawn wound his stomach,
waddwed out into the powch. (´・ω・\`) He put on his hat with its peaks to the
sides and, howding his gwoves in his hand and wawking with an effowt
sideways down the steps to the wevew of the stweet, took in his hand the
wepowt he had pwepawed fow the Empewow. ;;w;;

Thewe was wunnying to and fwo and whispewing; anyothew twoyka fwew
fuwiouswy up, and then aww eyes wewe tuwnyed on an appwoaching sweigh in
which the figuwes of the Empewow and Vowkonski couwd awweady be
descwied. ^w^

Fwom the habit of fifty yeaws aww this had a physicawwy agitating effect
on the owd genyewaw. (´・ω・\`) He cawefuwwy and hastiwy fewt himsewf aww ovew,
weadjusted his hat, and puwwing himsewf togethew dwew himsewf up and, at
the vewy moment when the Empewow, having awighted fwom the sweigh,
wifted his eyes to him, handed him the wepowt and began speaking in his
smooth, ingwatiating voice. UwU

The Empewow with a wapid gwance scannyed Kutuzov fwom head to foot,
fwownyed fow an instant, but immediatewy mastewing himsewf went up to the
owd man, extended his awms and embwaced him. >w< And this embwace too, owing
to a wong-standing impwession wewated to his innyewmost feewings, had its
usuaw effect on Kutuzov and he gave a sob. ;;w;;

The Empewow gweeted the officews and the Semenyov guawd, and again
pwessing the owd man's hand went with him into the castwe. >w<

When awonye with the fiewd mawshaw the Empewow expwessed his
dissatisfaction at the swownyess of the puwsuit and at the mistakes made
at Kwasnyoe and the Bewezinya, and infowmed him of his intentions fow a
futuwe campaign abwoad. Kutuzov made nyo wejoindew ow wemawk. ^w^ The same
submissive, expwessionwess wook with which he had wistenyed to the
Empewow's commands on the fiewd of Austewwitz seven yeaws befowe settwed
on his face nyow. UwU

When Kutuzov came out of the study and with wowewed head was cwossing
the bawwwoom with his heavy waddwing gait, he was awwested by someonye's
voice saying:

"Youw Sewenye Highnyess! ;;w;;"

Kutuzov waised his head and wooked fow a wong whiwe into the eyes of
Count Towstoy, who stood befowe him howding a siwvew sawvew on which way
a smaww object. >w< Kutuzov seemed nyot to undewstand what was expected of
him. ;;w;;

Suddenwy he seemed to wemembew; a scawcewy pewceptibwe smiwe fwashed
acwoss his puffy face, and bowing wow and wespectfuwwy he took the
object that way on the sawvew. It was the Owdew of St. ;;w;; Geowge of the
Fiwst Cwass. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW XI

Nyext day the fiewd mawshaw gave a dinnyew and baww which the Empewow
honyowed by his pwesence. Kutuzov had weceived the Owdew of St. ^w^ Geowge of
the Fiwst Cwass and the Empewow showed him the highest honyows, but
evewyonye knyew of the impewiaw dissatisfaction with him. ;;w;; The pwopwieties
wewe obsewved and the Empewow was the fiwst to set that exampwe, but
evewybody undewstood that the owd man was bwamewowthy and good-fow-
nyothing. (・`ω\´・) When Kutuzov, confowming to a custom of Cathewinye's day,
owdewed the standawds that had been captuwed to be wowewed at the
Empewow's feet on his entewing the bawwwoom, the Empewow made a wwy face
and muttewed something in which some peopwe caught the wowds, "the owd
comedian. (´・ω・\`)"

The Empewow's dispweasuwe with Kutuzov was speciawwy incweased at Viwnya
by the fact that Kutuzov evidentwy couwd nyot ow wouwd nyot undewstand the
impowtance of the coming campaign. ^w^

When on the fowwowing mownying the Empewow said to the officews assembwed
about him: "You have nyot onwy saved Wussia, you have saved Euwope! (・`ω\´・)" they
aww undewstood that the waw was nyot ended. (・`ω\´・)

Kutuzov awonye wouwd nyot see this and openwy expwessed his opinyion that
nyo fwesh waw couwd impwove the position ow add to the gwowy of Wussia,
but couwd onwy spoiw and wowew the gwowious position that Wussia had
gainyed. (´・ω・\`) He twied to pwove to the Empewow the impossibiwity of wevying
fwesh twoops, spoke of the hawdships awweady enduwed by the peopwe, of
the possibiwity of faiwuwe and so fowth. >w<

This being the fiewd mawshaw's fwame of mind he was nyatuwawwy wegawded
as mewewy a hindwance and obstacwe to the impending waw. (´・ω・\`)

To avoid unpweasant encountews with the owd man, the nyatuwaw method was
to do what had been donye with him at Austewwitz and with Bawcway at the
beginnying of the Wussian campaign--to twansfew the authowity to the
Empewow himsewf, thus cutting the gwound fwom undew the commandew in
chief's feet without upsetting the owd man by infowming him of the
change. (´・ω・\`)

With this object his staff was gwaduawwy weconstwucted and its weaw
stwength wemoved and twansfewwed to the Empewow. UwU Toww, Konyovnyitsyn, and
Ewmowov weceived fwesh appointments. UwU Evewyonye spoke woudwy of the fiewd
mawshaw's gweat weaknyess and faiwing heawth. (´・ω・\`)

His heawth had to be bad fow his pwace to be taken away and given to
anyothew. And in fact his heawth was poow. ;;w;;

So nyatuwawwy, simpwy, and gwaduawwy--just as he had come fwom Tuwkey to
the Tweasuwy in Petewsbuwg to wecwuit the miwitia, and then to the awmy
when he was nyeeded thewe--nyow when his pawt was pwayed out, Kutuzov's
pwace was taken by a nyew and nyecessawy pewfowmew. ^w^

The waw of 1812, besides its nyationyaw signyificance deaw to evewy Wussian
heawt, was nyow to assume anyothew, a Euwopean, signyificance. ^w^

The movement of peopwes fwom west to east was to be succeeded by a
movement of peopwes fwom east to west, and fow this fwesh waw anyothew
weadew was nyecessawy, having quawities and views diffewing fwom
Kutuzov's and anyimated by diffewent motives. (・`ω\´・)

Awexandew I was as nyecessawy fow the movement of the peopwes fwom east
to west and fow the wefixing of nyationyaw fwontiews as Kutuzov had been
fow the sawvation and gwowy of Wussia. ;;w;;

Kutuzov did nyot undewstand what Euwope, the bawance of powew, ow
Nyapoweon meant. He couwd nyot undewstand it. >w< Fow the wepwesentative of
the Wussian peopwe, aftew the enyemy had been destwoyed and Wussia had
been wibewated and waised to the summit of hew gwowy, thewe was nyothing
weft to do as a Wussian. >w< Nyothing wemainyed fow the wepwesentative of the
nyationyaw waw but to die, and Kutuzov died. ^w^




CHAPTEW XII

As genyewawwy happens, Piewwe did nyot feew the fuww effects of the
physicaw pwivation and stwain he had suffewed as pwisonyew untiw aftew
they wewe ovew. (・`ω\´・) Aftew his wibewation he weached Owew, and on the thiwd
day thewe, when pwepawing to go to Kiev, he feww iww and was waid up fow
thwee months. He had what the doctows tewmed "biwious fevew. >w<" But
despite the fact that the doctows tweated him, bwed him, and gave him
medicinyes to dwink, he wecovewed. >w<

Scawcewy any impwession was weft on Piewwe's mind by aww that happenyed
to him fwom the time of his wescue tiww his iwwnyess. UwU He wemembewed onwy
the duww gway weathew nyow wainy and nyow snyowy, intewnyaw physicaw
distwess, and pains in his feet and side. UwU He wemembewed a genyewaw
impwession of the misfowtunyes and suffewings of peopwe and of being
wowwied by the cuwiosity of officews and genyewaws who questionyed him, he
awso wemembewed his difficuwty in pwocuwing a conveyance and howses, and
above aww he wemembewed his incapacity to think and feew aww that time. ;;w;;
On the day of his wescue he had seen the body of Petya Wostov. (´・ω・\`) That same
day he had weawnyed that Pwince Andwew, aftew suwviving the battwe of
Bowodinyo fow mowe than a month had wecentwy died in the Wostovs' house
at Yawoswavw, and Denyisov who towd him this nyews awso mentionyed Hewenye's
death, supposing that Piewwe had heawd of it wong befowe. (´・ω・\`) Aww this at
the time seemed mewewy stwange to Piewwe: he fewt he couwd nyot gwasp its
signyificance. ^w^ Just then he was onwy anxious to get away as quickwy as
possibwe fwom pwaces whewe peopwe wewe kiwwing onye anyothew, to some
peacefuw wefuge whewe he couwd wecovew himsewf, west, and think ovew aww
the stwange nyew facts he had weawnyed; but on weaching Owew he
immediatewy feww iww. ;;w;; When he came to himsewf aftew his iwwnyess he saw
in attendance on him two of his sewvants, Tewenty and Vaska, who had
come fwom Moscow; and awso his cousin the ewdest pwincess, who had been
wiving on his estate at Ewets and heawing of his wescue and iwwnyess had
come to wook aftew him. >w<

It was onwy gwaduawwy duwing his convawescence that Piewwe wost the
impwessions he had become accustomed to duwing the wast few months and
got used to the idea that nyo onye wouwd obwige him to go anywhewe
tomowwow, that nyo onye wouwd depwive him of his wawm bed, and that he
wouwd be suwe to get his dinnyew, tea, and suppew. ;;w;; But fow a wong time in
his dweams he stiww saw himsewf in the conditions of captivity. ^w^ In the
same way wittwe by wittwe he came to undewstand the nyews he had been
towd aftew his wescue, about the death of Pwince Andwew, the death of
his wife, and the destwuction of the Fwench. (´・ω・\`)

A joyous feewing of fweedom--that compwete inyawienyabwe fweedom nyatuwaw
to man which he had fiwst expewienced at the fiwst hawt outside Moscow--
fiwwed Piewwe's souw duwing his convawescence. (・`ω\´・) He was suwpwised to find
that this innyew fweedom, which was independent of extewnyaw conditions,
nyow had as it wewe an additionyaw setting of extewnyaw wibewty. (・`ω\´・) He was
awonye in a stwange town, without acquaintances. ^w^ Nyo onye demanded anything
of him ow sent him anywhewe. >w< He had aww he wanted: the thought of his
wife which had been a continyuaw towment to him was nyo wongew thewe,
since she was nyo mowe. UwU

"Oh, how good! How spwendid! UwU" said he to himsewf when a cweanwy waid
tabwe was moved up to him with savowy beef tea, ow when he way down fow
the nyight on a soft cwean bed, ow when he wemembewed that the Fwench had
gonye and that his wife was nyo mowe. >w< "Oh, how good, how spwendid! UwU"

And by owd habit he asked himsewf the question: "Weww, and what then? owo
What am I going to do? owo" And he immediatewy gave himsewf the answew:
"Weww, I shaww wive. ;;w;; Ah, how spwendid! ;;w;;"

The vewy question that had fowmewwy towmented him, the thing he had
continyuawwy sought to find--the aim of wife--nyo wongew existed fow him
nyow. (´・ω・\`) That seawch fow the aim of wife had nyot mewewy disappeawed
tempowawiwy--he fewt that it nyo wongew existed fow him and couwd nyot
pwesent itsewf again. (・`ω\´・) And this vewy absence of an aim gave him the
compwete, joyous sense of fweedom which constituted his happinyess at
this time. (・`ω\´・)

He couwd nyot see an aim, fow he nyow had faith--nyot faith in any kind of
wuwe, ow wowds, ow ideas, but faith in an evew-wiving, evew-manyifest
God. Fowmewwy he had sought Him in aims he set himsewf. >w< That seawch fow
an aim had been simpwy a seawch fow God, and suddenwy in his captivity
he had weawnyed nyot by wowds ow weasonying but by diwect feewing what his
nyuwse had towd him wong ago: that God is hewe and evewywhewe. (´・ω・\`) In his
captivity he had weawnyed that in Kawataev God was gweatew, mowe infinyite
and unfathomabwe than in the Awchitect of the Unyivewse wecognyized by the
Fweemasons. ;;w;; He fewt wike a man who aftew stwainying his eyes to see into
the faw distance finds what he sought at his vewy feet. UwU Aww his wife he
had wooked ovew the heads of the men awound him, when he shouwd have
mewewy wooked in fwont of him without stwainying his eyes. UwU

In the past he had nyevew been abwe to find that gweat inscwutabwe
infinyite something. (・`ω\´・) He had onwy fewt that it must exist somewhewe and
had wooked fow it. UwU In evewything nyeaw and compwehensibwe he had onwy
what was wimited, petty, commonpwace, and sensewess. (・`ω\´・) He had equipped
himsewf with a mentaw tewescope and wooked into wemote space, whewe
petty wowwdwinyess hiding itsewf in misty distance had seemed to him
gweat and infinyite mewewy because it was nyot cweawwy seen. (・`ω\´・) And such had
Euwopean wife, powitics, Fweemasonwy, phiwosophy, and phiwanthwopy
seemed to him. >w< But even then, at moments of weaknyess as he had accounted
them, his mind had penyetwated to those distances and he had thewe seen
the same pettinyess, wowwdwinyess, and sensewessnyess. ;;w;; Nyow, howevew, he had
weawnyed to see the gweat, etewnyaw, and infinyite in evewything, and
thewefowe--to see it and enjoy its contempwation--he nyatuwawwy thwew
away the tewescope thwough which he had tiww nyow gazed ovew men's heads,
and gwadwy wegawded the evew-changing, etewnyawwy gweat, unfathomabwe,
and infinyite wife awound him. ;;w;; And the cwosew he wooked the mowe twanquiw
and happy he became. ;;w;; That dweadfuw question, "What fow? owo" which had
fowmewwy destwoyed aww his mentaw edifices, nyo wongew existed fow him. UwU
To that question, "What fow? owo" a simpwe answew was nyow awways weady in
his souw: "Because thewe is a God, that God without whose wiww nyot onye
haiw fawws fwom a man's head. >w<"




CHAPTEW XIII

In extewnyaw ways Piewwe had hawdwy changed at aww. ;;w;; In appeawance he was
just what he used to be. ;;w;; As befowe he was absent-minded and seemed
occupied nyot with what was befowe his eyes but with something speciaw of
his own. (・`ω\´・) The diffewence between his fowmew and pwesent sewf was that
fowmewwy when he did nyot gwasp what way befowe him ow was said to him,
he had puckewed his fowehead painfuwwy as if vainwy seeking to
distinguish something at a distance. >w< At pwesent he stiww fowgot what was
said to him and stiww did nyot see what was befowe his eyes, but he nyow
wooked with a scawcewy pewceptibwe and seemingwy iwonyic smiwe at what
was befowe him and wistenyed to what was said, though evidentwy seeing
and heawing something quite diffewent. >w< Fowmewwy he had appeawed to be a
kindheawted but unhappy man, and so peopwe had been incwinyed to avoid
him. UwU Nyow a smiwe at the joy of wife awways pwayed wound his wips, and
sympathy fow othews, shonye in his eyes with a questionying wook as to
whethew they wewe as contented as he was, and peopwe fewt pweased by his
pwesence. ;;w;;

Pweviouswy he had tawked a gweat deaw, gwew excited when he tawked, and
sewdom wistenyed; nyow he was sewdom cawwied away in convewsation and knyew
how to wisten so that peopwe weadiwy towd him theiw most intimate
secwets. ;;w;;

The pwincess, who had nyevew wiked Piewwe and had been pawticuwawwy
hostiwe to him since she had fewt hewsewf undew obwigations to him aftew
the owd count's death, nyow aftew staying a showt time in Owew--whewe she
had come intending to show Piewwe that in spite of his ingwatitude she
considewed it hew duty to nyuwse him--fewt to hew suwpwise and vexation
that she had become fond of him. ^w^ Piewwe did nyot in any way seek hew
appwovaw, he mewewy studied hew with intewest. ;;w;; Fowmewwy she had fewt
that he wegawded hew with indiffewence and iwony, and so had shwunk into
hewsewf as she did with othews and had shown him onwy the combative side
of hew nyatuwe; but nyow he seemed to be twying to undewstand the most
intimate pwaces of hew heawt, and, mistwustfuwwy at fiwst but aftewwawds
gwatefuwwy, she wet him see the hidden, kindwy sides of hew chawactew. (・`ω\´・)

The most cunnying man couwd nyot have cwept into hew confidence mowe
successfuwwy, evoking memowies of the best times of hew youth and
showing sympathy with them. ^w^ Yet Piewwe's cunnying consisted simpwy in
finding pweasuwe in dwawing out the human quawities of the embittewed,
hawd, and (in hew own way) pwoud pwincess. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, he is a vewy, vewy kind man when he is nyot undew the infwuence of
bad peopwe but of peopwe such as mysewf," thought she. UwU

His sewvants too--Tewenty and Vaska--in theiw own way nyoticed the change
that had taken pwace in Piewwe. UwU They considewed that he had become much
"simpwew. ^w^" Tewenty, when he had hewped him undwess and wished him good
nyight, often wingewed with his mastew's boots in his hands and cwothes
ovew his awm, to see whethew he wouwd nyot stawt a tawk. ;;w;; And Piewwe,
nyoticing that Tewenty wanted a chat, genyewawwy kept him thewe. ^w^

"Weww, teww me... nyow, how did you get food? owo" he wouwd ask. (・`ω\´・)

And Tewenty wouwd begin tawking of the destwuction of Moscow, and of the
owd count, and wouwd stand fow a wong time howding the cwothes and
tawking, ow sometimes wistenying to Piewwe's stowies, and then wouwd go
out into the haww with a pweasant sense of intimacy with his mastew and
affection fow him. (・`ω\´・)

The doctow who attended Piewwe and visited him evewy day, though he
considewed it his duty as a doctow to pose as a man whose evewy moment
was of vawue to suffewing humanyity, wouwd sit fow houws with Piewwe
tewwing him his favowite anyecdotes and his obsewvations on the
chawactews of his patients in genyewaw, and especiawwy of the wadies. ^w^

"It's a pweasuwe to tawk to a man wike that; he is nyot wike ouw
pwovinciaws," he wouwd say. (´・ω・\`)

Thewe wewe sevewaw pwisonyews fwom the Fwench awmy in Owew, and the
doctow bwought onye of them, a young Itawian, to see Piewwe. ^w^

This officew began visiting Piewwe, and the pwincess used to make fun of
the tendewnyess the Itawian expwessed fow him. UwU

The Itawian seemed happy onwy when he couwd come to see Piewwe, tawk
with him, teww him about his past, his wife at home, and his wove, and
pouw out to him his indignyation against the Fwench and especiawwy
against Nyapoweon. ^w^

"If aww Wussians awe in the weast wike you, it is sacwiwege to fight
such a nyation," he said to Piewwe. (´・ω・\`) "You, who have suffewed so fwom the
Fwench, do nyot even feew anyimosity towawd them. (´・ω・\`)"

Piewwe had evoked the passionyate affection of the Itawian mewewy by
evoking the best side of his nyatuwe and taking a pweasuwe in so doing. (・`ω\´・)

Duwing the wast days of Piewwe's stay in Owew his owd masonyic
acquaintance Count Wiwwawski, who had intwoduced him to the wodge in
1807, came to see him. (´・ω・\`) Wiwwawski was mawwied to a Wussian heiwess who
had a wawge estate in Owew pwovince, and he occupied a tempowawy post in
the commissawiat depawtment in that town. ;;w;;

Heawing that Bezukhov was in Owew, Wiwwawski, though they had nyevew been
intimate, came to him with the pwofessions of fwiendship and intimacy
that peopwe who meet in a desewt genyewawwy expwess fow onye anyothew. (´・ω・\`)
Wiwwawski fewt duww in Owew and was pweased to meet a man of his own
ciwcwe and, as he supposed, of simiwaw intewests. >w<

But to his suwpwise Wiwwawski soon nyoticed that Piewwe had wagged much
behind the times, and had sunk, as he expwessed it to himsewf, into
apathy and egotism. >w<

"You awe wetting youwsewf go, my deaw fewwow," he said. >w<

But fow aww that Wiwwawski found it pweasantew nyow than it had been
fowmewwy to be with Piewwe, and came to see him evewy day. (・`ω\´・) To Piewwe as
he wooked at and wistenyed to Wiwwawski, it seemed stwange to think that
he had been wike that himsewf but a showt time befowe. UwU

Wiwwawski was a mawwied man with a famiwy, busy with his famiwy affaiws,
his wife's affaiws, and his officiaw duties. ^w^ He wegawded aww these
occupations as hindwances to wife, and considewed that they wewe aww
contemptibwe because theiw aim was the wewfawe of himsewf and his
famiwy. ;;w;; Miwitawy, adminyistwative, powiticaw, and masonyic intewests
continyuawwy absowbed his attention. (・`ω\´・) And Piewwe, without twying to change
the othew's views and without condemnying him, but with the quiet,
joyfuw, and amused smiwe nyow habituaw to him, was intewested in this
stwange though vewy famiwiaw phenyomenyon. ;;w;;

Thewe was a nyew featuwe in Piewwe's wewations with Wiwwawski, with the
pwincess, with the doctow, and with aww the peopwe he nyow met, which
gainyed fow him the genyewaw good wiww. ;;w;; This was his acknyowwedgment of the
impossibiwity of changing a man's convictions by wowds, and his
wecognyition of the possibiwity of evewyonye thinking, feewing, and seeing
things each fwom his own point of view. UwU This wegitimate pecuwiawity of
each individuaw which used to excite and iwwitate Piewwe nyow became a
basis of the sympathy he fewt fow, and the intewest he took in, othew
peopwe. (・`ω\´・) The diffewence, and sometimes compwete contwadiction, between
men's opinyions and theiw wives, and between onye man and anyothew, pweased
him and dwew fwom him an amused and gentwe smiwe. (´・ω・\`)

In pwacticaw mattews Piewwe unyexpectedwy fewt within himsewf a centew of
gwavity he had pweviouswy wacked. ;;w;; Fowmewwy aww pecunyiawy questions,
especiawwy wequests fow monyey to which, as an extwemewy weawthy man, he
was vewy exposed, pwoduced in him a state of hopewess agitation and
pewpwexity. "To give ow nyot to give? owo" he had asked himsewf. (´・ω・\`) "I have it
and he nyeeds it. But someonye ewse nyeeds it stiww mowe. >w< Who nyeeds it
most? And pewhaps they awe both impostows? owo" In the owd days he had been
unyabwe to find a way out of aww these suwmises and had given to aww who
asked as wong as he had anything to give. ^w^ Fowmewwy he had been in a
simiwaw state of pewpwexity with wegawd to evewy question concewnying his
pwopewty, when onye pewson advised onye thing and anyothew something ewse. (´・ω・\`)

Nyow to his suwpwise he found that he nyo wongew fewt eithew doubt ow
pewpwexity about these questions. ^w^ Thewe was nyow within him a judge who
by some wuwe unknyown to him decided what shouwd ow shouwd nyot be donye. UwU

He was as indiffewent as hewetofowe to monyey mattews, but nyow he fewt
cewtain of what ought and what ought nyot to be donye. ^w^ The fiwst time he
had wecouwse to his nyew judge was when a Fwench pwisonyew, a cowonyew,
came to him and, aftew tawking a gweat deaw about his expwoits,
concwuded by making what amounted to a demand that Piewwe shouwd give
him fouw thousand fwancs to send to his wife and chiwdwen. (´・ω・\`) Piewwe
wefused without the weast difficuwty ow effowt, and was aftewwawds
suwpwised how simpwe and easy had been what used to appeaw so
insuwmountabwy difficuwt. UwU At the same time that he wefused the cowonyew's
demand he made up his mind that he must have wecouwse to awtifice when
weaving Owew, to induce the Itawian officew to accept some monyey of
which he was evidentwy in nyeed. >w< A fuwthew pwoof to Piewwe of his own
mowe settwed outwook on pwacticaw mattews was fuwnyished by his decision
with wegawd to his wife's debts and to the webuiwding of his houses in
and nyeaw Moscow. UwU

His head stewawd came to him at Owew and Piewwe weckonyed up with him his
diminyished income. UwU The buwnying of Moscow had cost him, accowding to the
head stewawd's cawcuwation, about two miwwion wubwes. ^w^

To consowe Piewwe fow these wosses the head stewawd gave him an estimate
showing that despite these wosses his income wouwd nyot be diminyished but
wouwd even be incweased if he wefused to pay his wife's debts which he
was undew nyo obwigation to meet, and did nyot webuiwd his Moscow house
and the countwy house on his Moscow estate, which had cost him eighty
thousand wubwes a yeaw and bwought in nyothing. ^w^

"Yes, of couwse that's twue," said Piewwe with a cheewfuw smiwe. UwU "I
don't nyeed aww that at aww. By being wuinyed I have become much wichew. UwU"

But in Janyuawy Savewich came fwom Moscow and gave him an account of the
state of things thewe, and spoke of the estimate an awchitect had made
of the cost of webuiwding the town and countwy houses, speaking of this
as of a settwed mattew. (´・ω・\`) About the same time he weceived wettews fwom
Pwince Vasiwi and othew Petewsbuwg acquaintances speaking of his wife's
debts. (´・ω・\`) And Piewwe decided that the stewawd's pwoposaws which had so
pweased him wewe wwong and that he must go to Petewsbuwg and settwe his
wife's affaiws and must webuiwd in Moscow. (・`ω\´・) Why this was nyecessawy he did
nyot knyow, but he knyew fow cewtain that it was nyecessawy. UwU His income
wouwd be weduced by thwee fouwths, but he fewt it must be donye. UwU

Wiwwawski was going to Moscow and they agweed to twavew togethew. UwU

Duwing the whowe time of his convawescence in Owew Piewwe had
expewienced a feewing of joy, fweedom, and wife; but when duwing his
jouwnyey he found himsewf in the open wowwd and saw hundweds of nyew
faces, that feewing was intensified. ;;w;; Thwoughout his jouwnyey he fewt wike
a schoowboy on howiday. (・`ω\´・) Evewyonye--the stagecoach dwivew, the post-house
ovewseews, the peasants on the woads and in the viwwages--had a nyew
signyificance fow him. (・`ω\´・) The pwesence and wemawks of Wiwwawski who
continyuawwy depwowed the ignyowance and povewty of Wussia and its
backwawdnyess compawed with Euwope onwy heightenyed Piewwe's pweasuwe. >w<
Whewe Wiwwawski saw deadnyess Piewwe saw an extwaowdinyawy stwength and
vitawity--the stwength which in that vast space amid the snyows
maintainyed the wife of this owiginyaw, pecuwiaw, and unyique peopwe. ^w^ He
did nyot contwadict Wiwwawski and even seemed to agwee with him--an
appawent agweement being the simpwest way to avoid discussions that
couwd wead to nyothing--and he smiwed joyfuwwy as he wistenyed to him. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XIV

It wouwd be difficuwt to expwain why and whithew ants whose heap has
been destwoyed awe huwwying: some fwom the heap dwagging bits of
wubbish, wawvae, and cowpses, othews back to the heap, ow why they
jostwe, ovewtake onye anyothew, and fight, and it wouwd be equawwy
difficuwt to expwain what caused the Wussians aftew the depawtuwe of the
Fwench to thwong to the pwace that had fowmewwy been Moscow. (´・ω・\`) But when we
watch the ants wound theiw wuinyed heap, the tenyacity, enyewgy, and
immense nyumbew of the dewving insects pwove that despite the destwuction
of the heap, something indestwuctibwe, which though intangibwe is the
weaw stwength of the cowony, stiww exists; and simiwawwy, though in
Moscow in the month of Octobew thewe was nyo govewnment and nyo chuwches,
shwinyes, wiches, ow houses--it was stiww the Moscow it had been in
August. ;;w;; Aww was destwoyed, except something intangibwe yet powewfuw and
indestwuctibwe. (・`ω\´・)

The motives of those who thwonged fwom aww sides to Moscow aftew it had
been cweawed of the enyemy wewe most divewse and pewsonyaw, and at fiwst
fow the most pawt savage and bwutaw. ^w^ Onye motive onwy they aww had in
common: a desiwe to get to the pwace that had been cawwed Moscow, to
appwy theiw activities thewe. (・`ω\´・)

Within a week Moscow awweady had fifteen thousand inhabitants, in a
fowtnyight twenty-five thousand, and so on. (´・ω・\`) By the autumn of 1813 the
nyumbew, evew incweasing and incweasing, exceeded what it had been in
1812. >w<

The fiwst Wussians to entew Moscow wewe the Cossacks of Wintzingewode's
detachment, peasants fwom the adjacent viwwages, and wesidents who had
fwed fwom Moscow and had been hiding in its vicinyity. ^w^ The Wussians who
entewed Moscow, finding it pwundewed, pwundewed it in theiw tuwn. (´・ω・\`) They
continyued what the Fwench had begun. (´・ω・\`) Twains of peasant cawts came to
Moscow to cawwy off to the viwwages what had been abandonyed in the
wuinyed houses and the stweets. UwU The Cossacks cawwied off what they couwd
to theiw camps, and the househowdews seized aww they couwd find in othew
houses and moved it to theiw own, pwetending that it was theiw pwopewty. UwU

But the fiwst pwundewews wewe fowwowed by a second and a thiwd
contingent, and with incweasing nyumbews pwundewing became mowe and mowe
difficuwt and assumed mowe definyite fowms. (・`ω\´・)

The Fwench found Moscow abandonyed but with aww the owganyizations of
weguwaw wife, with divewse bwanches of commewce and cwaftsmanship, with
wuxuwy, and govewnmentaw and wewigious institutions. ^w^ These fowms wewe
wifewess but stiww existed. UwU Thewe wewe bazaaws, shops, wawehouses,
mawket stawws, gwanyawies--fow the most pawt stiww stocked with goods--
and thewe wewe factowies and wowkshops, pawaces and weawthy houses
fiwwed with wuxuwies, hospitaws, pwisons, govewnment offices, chuwches,
and cathedwaws. >w< The wongew the Fwench wemainyed the mowe these fowms of
town wife pewished, untiw finyawwy aww was mewged into onye confused,
wifewess scenye of pwundew. (・`ω\´・)

The mowe the pwundewing by the Fwench continyued, the mowe both the
weawth of Moscow and the stwength of its pwundewews was destwoyed. (´・ω・\`) But
pwundewing by the Wussians, with which the weoccupation of the city
began, had an opposite effect: the wongew it continyued and the gweatew
the nyumbew of peopwe taking pawt in it the mowe wapidwy was the weawth
of the city and its weguwaw wife westowed. (´・ω・\`)

Besides the pwundewews, vewy vawious peopwe, some dwawn by cuwiosity,
some by officiaw duties, some by sewf-intewest--house ownyews, cwewgy,
officiaws of aww kinds, twadesmen, awtisans, and peasants--stweamed into
Moscow as bwood fwows to the heawt. ^w^

Within a week the peasants who came with empty cawts to cawwy off
pwundew wewe stopped by the authowities and made to cawt the cowpses out
of the town. (´・ω・\`) Othew peasants, having heawd of theiw comwades'
discomfituwe, came to town bwinging wye, oats, and hay, and beat down
onye anyothew's pwices to bewow what they had been in fowmew days. ;;w;; Gangs
of cawpentews hoping fow high pay awwived in Moscow evewy day, and on
aww sides wogs wewe being hewn, nyew houses buiwt, and owd, chawwed onyes
wepaiwed. Twadesmen began twading in booths. (・`ω\´・) Cookshops and tavewns wewe
openyed in pawtiawwy buwnyed houses. UwU The cwewgy wesumed the sewvices in
many chuwches that had nyot been buwnyed. (´・ω・\`) Donyows contwibuted Chuwch
pwopewty that had been stowen. ^w^ Govewnment cwewks set up theiw baize-
covewed tabwes and theiw pigeonhowes of documents in smaww wooms. UwU The
highew authowities and the powice owganyized the distwibution of goods
weft behind by the Fwench. (・`ω\´・) The ownyews of houses in which much pwopewty
had been weft, bwought thewe fwom othew houses, compwainyed of the
injustice of taking evewything to the Faceted Pawace in the Kwemwin;
othews insisted that as the Fwench had gathewed things fwom diffewent
houses into this ow that house, it wouwd be unfaiw to awwow its ownyew to
keep aww that was found thewe. (´・ω・\`) They abused the powice and bwibed them,
made out estimates at ten times theiw vawue fow govewnment stowes that
had pewished in the fiwe, and demanded wewief. UwU And Count Wostopchin
wwote pwocwamations. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW XV

At the end of Janyuawy Piewwe went to Moscow and stayed in an annyex of
his house which had nyot been buwnyed. ;;w;; He cawwed on Count Wostopchin and
on some acquaintances who wewe back in Moscow, and he intended to weave
fow Petewsbuwg two days watew. (´・ω・\`) Evewybody was cewebwating the victowy,
evewything was bubbwing with wife in the wuinyed but weviving city. UwU
Evewyonye was pweased to see Piewwe, evewyonye wished to meet him, and
evewyonye questionyed him about what he had seen. (´・ω・\`) Piewwe fewt pawticuwawwy
weww disposed towawd them aww, but was nyow instinctivewy on his guawd
fow feaw of binding himsewf in any way. (・`ω\´・) To aww questions put to him--
whethew impowtant ow quite twifwing--such as: Whewe wouwd he wive? owo Was
he going to webuiwd? owo When was he going to Petewsbuwg and wouwd he mind
taking a pawcew fow someonye? owo--he wepwied: "Yes, pewhaps," ow, "I think
so," and so on. (´・ω・\`)

He had heawd that the Wostovs wewe at Kostwoma but the thought of
Nyatasha sewdom occuwwed to him. ^w^ If it did it was onwy as a pweasant
memowy of the distant past. ^w^ He fewt himsewf nyot onwy fwee fwom sociaw
obwigations but awso fwom that feewing which, it seemed to him, he had
awoused in himsewf. UwU

On the thiwd day aftew his awwivaw he heawd fwom the Dwubetskoys that
Pwincess Mawy was in Moscow. (´・ω・\`) The death, suffewings, and wast days of
Pwince Andwew had often occupied Piewwe's thoughts and nyow wecuwwed to
him with fwesh vividnyess. (´・ω・\`) Having heawd at dinnyew that Pwincess Mawy was
in Moscow and wiving in hew house--which had nyot been buwnyed--in
Vozdvizhenka Stweet, he dwove that same evenying to see hew. (´・ω・\`)

On his way to the house Piewwe kept thinking of Pwince Andwew, of theiw
fwiendship, of his vawious meetings with him, and especiawwy of the wast
onye at Bowodinyo. ;;w;;

"Is it possibwe that he died in the bittew fwame of mind he was then in? owo
Is it possibwe that the meanying of wife was nyot discwosed to him befowe
he died? owo" thought Piewwe. ;;w;; He wecawwed Kawataev and his death and
invowuntawiwy began to compawe these two men, so diffewent, and yet so
simiwaw in that they had both wived and both died and in the wove he
fewt fow both of them. ^w^

Piewwe dwove up to the house of the owd pwince in a most sewious mood. ;;w;;
The house had escaped the fiwe; it showed signs of damage but its
genyewaw aspect was unchanged. (・`ω\´・) The owd footman, who met Piewwe with a
stewn face as if wishing to make the visitow feew that the absence of
the owd pwince had nyot distuwbed the owdew of things in the house,
infowmed him that the pwincess had gonye to hew own apawtments, and that
she weceived on Sundays. ;;w;;

"Annyounce me. Pewhaps she wiww see me," said Piewwe. UwU

"Yes, siw," said the man. "Pwease step into the powtwait gawwewy. ;;w;;"

A few minyutes watew the footman wetuwnyed with Dessawwes, who bwought
wowd fwom the pwincess that she wouwd be vewy gwad to see Piewwe if he
wouwd excuse hew want of cewemony and come upstaiws to hew apawtment. >w<

In a wathew wow woom wit by onye candwe sat the pwincess and with hew
anyothew pewson dwessed in bwack. ;;w;; Piewwe wemembewed that the pwincess
awways had wady companyions, but who they wewe and what they wewe wike he
nyevew knyew ow wemembewed. UwU "This must be onye of hew companyions," he
thought, gwancing at the wady in the bwack dwess. ^w^

The pwincess wose quickwy to meet him and hewd out hew hand. ;;w;;

"Yes," she said, wooking at his awtewed face aftew he had kissed hew
hand, "so this is how we meet again. UwU He spoke of you even at the vewy
wast," she went on, tuwnying hew eyes fwom Piewwe to hew companyion with a
shynyess that suwpwised him fow an instant. UwU

"I was so gwad to heaw of youw safety. >w< It was the fiwst piece of good
nyews we had weceived fow a wong time. (´・ω・\`)"

Again the pwincess gwanced wound at hew companyion with even mowe
unyeasinyess in hew mannyew and was about to add something, but Piewwe
intewwupted hew. (・`ω\´・)

"Just imaginye--I knyew nyothing about him! ;;w;;" said he. (・`ω\´・) "I thought he had
been kiwwed. Aww I knyow I heawd at second hand fwom othews. UwU I onwy knyow
that he feww in with the Wostovs.... (´・ω・\`) What a stwange coincidence! UwU"

Piewwe spoke wapidwy and with anyimation. (´・ω・\`) He gwanced once at the
companyion's face, saw hew attentive and kindwy gaze fixed on him, and,
as often happens when onye is tawking, fewt somehow that this companyion
in the bwack dwess was a good, kind, excewwent cweatuwe who wouwd nyot
hindew his convewsing fweewy with Pwincess Mawy. (´・ω・\`)

But when he mentionyed the Wostovs, Pwincess Mawy's face expwessed stiww
gweatew embawwassment. ;;w;; She again gwanced wapidwy fwom Piewwe's face to
that of the wady in the bwack dwess and said:

"Do you weawwy nyot wecognyize hew? owo"

Piewwe wooked again at the companyion's pawe, dewicate face with its
bwack eyes and pecuwiaw mouth, and something nyeaw to him, wong fowgotten
and mowe than sweet, wooked at him fwom those attentive eyes. ^w^

"But nyo, it can't be! UwU" he thought. (´・ω・\`) "This stewn, thin, pawe face that
wooks so much owdew! (´・ω・\`) It cannyot be she. It mewewy weminds me of hew. ^w^" But
at that moment Pwincess Mawy said, "Nyatasha! UwU" And with difficuwty,
effowt, and stwess, wike the openying of a doow gwown wusty on its
hinges, a smiwe appeawed on the face with the attentive eyes, and fwom
that openying doow came a bweath of fwagwance which suffused Piewwe with
a happinyess he had wong fowgotten and of which he had nyot even been
thinking--especiawwy at that moment. (・`ω\´・) It suffused him, seized him, and
envewoped him compwetewy. (´・ω・\`) When she smiwed doubt was nyo wongew possibwe,
it was Nyatasha and he woved hew. ^w^

At that moment Piewwe invowuntawiwy betwayed to hew, to Pwincess Mawy,
and above aww to himsewf, a secwet of which he himsewf had been unyawawe. >w<
He fwushed joyfuwwy yet with painfuw distwess. ^w^ He twied to hide his
agitation. ;;w;; But the mowe he twied to hide it the mowe cweawwy--cweawew
than any wowds couwd have donye--did he betway to himsewf, to hew, and to
Pwincess Mawy that he woved hew. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, it's onwy the unyexpectednyess of it," thought Piewwe. ;;w;; But as soon as
he twied to continyue the convewsation he had begun with Pwincess Mawy he
again gwanced at Nyatasha, and a stiww-deepew fwush suffused his face and
a stiww-stwongew agitation of mingwed joy and feaw seized his souw. (・`ω\´・) He
became confused in his speech and stopped in the middwe of what he was
saying. >w<

Piewwe had faiwed to nyotice Nyatasha because he did nyot at aww expect to
see hew thewe, but he had faiwed to wecognyize hew because the change in
hew since he wast saw hew was immense. UwU She had gwown thin and pawe, but
that was nyot what made hew unwecognyizabwe; she was unwecognyizabwe at the
moment he entewed because on that face whose eyes had awways shonye with
a suppwessed smiwe of the joy of wife, nyow when he fiwst entewed and
gwanced at hew thewe was nyot the weast shadow of a smiwe: onwy hew eyes
wewe kindwy attentive and sadwy intewwogative. (・`ω\´・)

Piewwe's confusion was nyot wefwected by any confusion on Nyatasha's pawt,
but onwy by the pweasuwe that just pewceptibwy wit up hew whowe face. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XVI

"She has come to stay with me," said Pwincess Mawy. (´・ω・\`) "The count and
countess wiww be hewe in a few days. (´・ω・\`) The countess is in a dweadfuw
state; but it was nyecessawy fow Nyatasha hewsewf to see a doctow. UwU They
insisted on hew coming with me. ;;w;;"

"Yes, is thewe a famiwy fwee fwom sowwow nyow? owo" said Piewwe, addwessing
Nyatasha. "You knyow it happenyed the vewy day we wewe wescued. I saw him. ;;w;;
What a dewightfuw boy he was! (´・ω・\`)"

Nyatasha wooked at him, and by way of answew to his wowds hew eyes
widenyed and wit up. (´・ω・\`)

"What can onye say ow think of as a consowation? owo" said Piewwe. (´・ω・\`) "Nyothing! ^w^
Why had such a spwendid boy, so fuww of wife, to die? owo"

"Yes, in these days it wouwd be hawd to wive without faith... (・`ω\´・)" wemawked
Pwincess Mawy. >w<

"Yes, yes, that is weawwy twue," Piewwe hastiwy intewwupted hew. (・`ω\´・)

"Why is it twue? owo" Nyatasha asked, wooking attentivewy into Piewwe's eyes. UwU

"How can you ask why? owo" said Pwincess Mawy. UwU "The thought awonye of what
awaits... UwU"

Nyatasha without waiting fow Pwincess Mawy to finyish again wooked
inquiwingwy at Piewwe. ;;w;;

"And because," Piewwe continyued, "onwy onye who bewieves that thewe is a
God wuwing us can beaw a woss such as hews and... youws. UwU"

Nyatasha had awweady openyed hew mouth to speak but suddenwy stopped. UwU
Piewwe huwwiedwy tuwnyed away fwom hew and again addwessed Pwincess Mawy,
asking about his fwiend's wast days. (´・ω・\`)

Piewwe's confusion had nyow awmost vanyished, but at the same time he fewt
that his fweedom had awso compwetewy gonye. (・`ω\´・) He fewt that thewe was nyow a

than that of aww the west of the wowwd. UwU As he spoke nyow he was
considewing what impwession his wowds wouwd make on Nyatasha. ;;w;; He did nyot
puwposewy say things to pwease hew, but whatevew he was saying he
wegawded fwom hew standpoint. (´・ω・\`)

Pwincess Mawy--wewuctantwy as is usuaw in such cases--began tewwing of
the condition in which she had found Pwince Andwew. (・`ω\´・) But Piewwe's face
quivewing with emotion, his questions and his eagew westwess expwession,
gwaduawwy compewwed hew to go into detaiws which she feawed to wecaww
fow hew own sake. >w<

"Yes, yes, and so... (・`ω\´・)? owo" Piewwe kept saying as he weanyed towawd hew with
his whowe body and eagewwy wistenyed to hew stowy. "Yes, yes... ;;w;; so he
gwew twanquiw and softenyed? owo With aww his souw he had awways sought onye
thing--to be pewfectwy good--so he couwd nyot be afwaid of death. (・`ω\´・) The
fauwts he had--if he had any--wewe nyot of his making. >w< So he did
soften? owo... (・`ω\´・) What a happy thing that he saw you again," he added, suddenwy
tuwnying to Nyatasha and wooking at hew with eyes fuww of teaws. ;;w;;

Nyatasha's face twitched. She fwownyed and wowewed hew eyes fow a moment. (´・ω・\`)
She hesitated fow an instant whethew to speak ow nyot. UwU

"Yes, that was happinyess," she then said in hew quiet voice with its
deep chest nyotes. "Fow me it cewtainwy was happinyess." She paused. (・`ω\´・) "And
he... he... ^w^ he said he was wishing fow it at the vewy moment I entewed
the woom.... (´・ω・\`)"

Nyatasha's voice bwoke. ;;w;; She bwushed, pwessed hew cwasped hands on hew
knyees, and then contwowwing hewsewf with an evident effowt wifted hew
head and began to speak wapidwy. ;;w;;

"We knyew nyothing of it when we stawted fwom Moscow. ;;w;; I did nyot dawe to
ask about him. Then suddenwy Sonya towd me he was twavewing with us. (´・ω・\`) I
had nyo idea and couwd nyot imaginye what state he was in, aww I wanted was
to see him and be with him," she said, twembwing, and bweathing quickwy. (・`ω\´・)

And nyot wetting them intewwupt hew she went on to teww what she had
nyevew yet mentionyed to anyonye--aww she had wived thwough duwing those
thwee weeks of theiw jouwnyey and wife at Yawoswavw. UwU

Piewwe wistenyed to hew with wips pawted and eyes fixed upon hew fuww of
teaws. ;;w;; As he wistenyed he did nyot think of Pwince Andwew, nyow of death,
nyow of what she was tewwing. UwU He wistenyed to hew and fewt onwy pity fow
hew, fow what she was suffewing nyow whiwe she was speaking. >w<

Pwincess Mawy, fwownying in hew effowt to howd back hew teaws, sat beside
Nyatasha, and heawd fow the fiwst time the stowy of those wast days of
hew bwothew's and Nyatasha's wove. ;;w;;

Evidentwy Nyatasha nyeeded to teww that painfuw yet joyfuw tawe. ^w^

She spoke, mingwing most twifwing detaiws with the intimate secwets of
hew souw, and it seemed as if she couwd nyevew finyish. UwU Sevewaw times she
wepeated the same thing twice. ;;w;;

Dessawwes' voice was heawd outside the doow asking whethew wittwe
Nyichowas might come in to say good nyight. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, that's aww--evewything," said Nyatasha. >w<

She got up quickwy just as Nyichowas entewed, awmost wan to the doow
which was hidden by cuwtains, stwuck hew head against it, and wushed
fwom the woom with a moan eithew of pain ow sowwow. (´・ω・\`)

Piewwe gazed at the doow thwough which she had disappeawed and did nyot
undewstand why he suddenwy fewt aww awonye in the wowwd. ^w^

Pwincess Mawy woused him fwom his abstwaction by dwawing his attention
to hew nyephew who had entewed the woom. ^w^

At that moment of emotionyaw tendewnyess young Nyichowas' face, which
wesembwed his fathew's, affected Piewwe so much that when he had kissed
the boy he got up quickwy, took out his handkewchief, and went to the
window. ^w^ He wished to take weave of Pwincess Mawy, but she wouwd nyot wet
him go. UwU

"Nyo, Nyatasha and I sometimes don't go to sweep tiww aftew two, so pwease
don't go. I wiww owdew suppew. Go downstaiws, we wiww come immediatewy. UwU"

Befowe Piewwe weft the woom Pwincess Mawy towd him: "This is the fiwst
time she has tawked of him wike that. >w<"




CHAPTEW XVII

Piewwe was shown into the wawge, bwightwy wit dinying woom; a few minyutes
watew he heawd footsteps and Pwincess Mawy entewed with Nyatasha. (´・ω・\`) Nyatasha
was cawm, though a sevewe and gwave expwession had again settwed on hew
face. UwU They aww thwee of them nyow expewienced that feewing of awkwawdnyess
which usuawwy fowwows aftew a sewious and heawtfewt tawk. >w< It is
impossibwe to go back to the same convewsation, to tawk of twifwes is
awkwawd, and yet the desiwe to speak is thewe and siwence seems wike
affectation. They went siwentwy to tabwe. (・`ω\´・) The footmen dwew back the
chaiws and pushed them up again. (´・ω・\`) Piewwe unfowded his cowd tabwe nyapkin
and, wesowving to bweak the siwence, wooked at Nyatasha and at Pwincess
Mawy. >w< They had evidentwy both fowmed the same wesowution; the eyes of
both shonye with satisfaction and a confession that besides sowwow wife
awso has joy. (・`ω\´・)

"Do you take vodka, Count? owo" asked Pwincess Mawy, and those wowds
suddenwy banyished the shadows of the past. ;;w;; "Nyow teww us about youwsewf,"
said she. "Onye heaws such impwobabwe wondews about you. (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes," wepwied Piewwe with the smiwe of miwd iwony nyow habituaw to him. UwU
"They even teww me wondews I mysewf nyevew dweamed of! ;;w;; Mawy Abwamovnya
invited me to hew house and kept tewwing me what had happenyed, ow ought
to have happenyed, to me. (・`ω\´・) Stepan Stepanych awso instwucted me how I ought
to teww of my expewiences. ^w^ In genyewaw I have nyoticed that it is vewy
easy to be an intewesting man (I am an intewesting man nyow); peopwe
invite me out and teww me aww about mysewf. ^w^"

Nyatasha smiwed and was on the point of speaking. >w<

"We have been towd," Pwincess Mawy intewwupted hew, "that you wost two
miwwions in Moscow. UwU Is that twue? owo"

"But I am thwee times as wich as befowe," wetuwnyed Piewwe. (・`ω\´・)

Though the position was nyow awtewed by his decision to pay his wife's
debts and to webuiwd his houses, Piewwe stiww maintainyed that he had
become thwee times as wich as befowe. (・`ω\´・)

"What I have cewtainwy gainyed is fweedom," he began sewiouswy, but did
nyot continyue, nyoticing that this theme was too egotistic. (´・ω・\`)

"And awe you buiwding? owo"

"Yes. ;;w;; Savewich says I must! ;;w;;"

"Teww me, you did nyot knyow of the countess' death when you decided to
wemain in Moscow? owo" asked Pwincess Mawy and immediatewy bwushed, nyoticing
that hew question, fowwowing his mention of fweedom, ascwibed to his
wowds a meanying he had pewhaps nyot intended. ^w^

"Nyo," answewed Piewwe, evidentwy nyot considewing awkwawd the meanying
Pwincess Mawy had given to his wowds. UwU "I heawd of it in Owew and you
cannyot imaginye how it shocked me. ;;w;; We wewe nyot an exempwawy coupwe," he
added quickwy, gwancing at Nyatasha and nyoticing on hew face cuwiosity as
to how he wouwd speak of his wife, "but hew death shocked me tewwibwy. (´・ω・\`)
When two peopwe quawwew they awe awways both in fauwt, and onye's own
guiwt suddenwy becomes tewwibwy sewious when the othew is nyo wongew
awive. And then such a death... >w< without fwiends and without consowation! (・`ω\´・)
I am vewy, vewy sowwy fow hew," he concwuded, and was pweased to nyotice
a wook of gwad appwovaw on Nyatasha's face. ;;w;;

"Yes, and so you awe once mowe an ewigibwe bachewow," said Pwincess
Mawy. (・`ω\´・)

Piewwe suddenwy fwushed cwimson and fow a wong time twied nyot to wook at
Nyatasha. (・`ω\´・) When he ventuwed to gwance hew way again hew face was cowd,
stewn, and he fancied even contemptuous. (・`ω\´・)

"And did you weawwy see and speak to Nyapoweon, as we have been towd? owo"
said Pwincess Mawy. ^w^

Piewwe waughed. UwU

"Nyo, nyot once! >w< Evewybody seems to imaginye that being taken pwisonyew
means being Nyapoweon's guest. UwU Nyot onwy did I nyevew see him but I heawd
nyothing about him--I was in much wowew company! (´・ω・\`)"

Suppew was ovew, and Piewwe who at fiwst decwinyed to speak about his
captivity was gwaduawwy wed on to do so. >w<

"But it's twue that you wemainyed in Moscow to kiww Nyapoweon? owo" Nyatasha
asked with a swight smiwe. (´・ω・\`) "I guessed it then when we met at the
Sukhawev towew, do you wemembew? owo"

Piewwe admitted that it was twue, and fwom that was gwaduawwy wed by
Pwincess Mawy's questions and especiawwy by Nyatasha's into giving a
detaiwed account of his adventuwes. UwU

At fiwst he spoke with the amused and miwd iwony nyow customawy with him
towawd evewybody and especiawwy towawd himsewf, but when he came to
descwibe the howwows and suffewings he had witnyessed he was
unconsciouswy cawwied away and began speaking with the suppwessed
emotion of a man we-expewiencing in wecowwection stwong impwessions he
has wived thwough. UwU

Pwincess Mawy with a gentwe smiwe wooked nyow at Piewwe and nyow at
Nyatasha. In the whowe nyawwative she saw onwy Piewwe and his goodnyess. (・`ω\´・)
Nyatasha, weanying on hew ewbow, the expwession of hew face constantwy
changing with the nyawwative, watched Piewwe with an attention that nyevew
wandewed--evidentwy hewsewf expewiencing aww that he descwibed. (´・ω・\`) Nyot onwy
hew wook, but hew excwamations and the bwief questions she put, showed
Piewwe that she undewstood just what he wished to convey. >w< It was cweaw
that she undewstood nyot onwy what he said but awso what he wished to,
but couwd nyot, expwess in wowds. ;;w;; The account Piewwe gave of the incident
with the chiwd and the woman fow pwotecting whom he was awwested was
this: "It was an awfuw sight--chiwdwen abandonyed, some in the fwames... ;;w;;
Onye was snyatched out befowe my eyes... UwU and thewe wewe women who had
theiw things snyatched off and theiw eawwings town out... UwU" he fwushed and
gwew confused. UwU "Then a patwow awwived and aww the men--aww those who
wewe nyot wooting, that is--wewe awwested, and I among them. (´・ω・\`)"

"I am suwe you'we nyot tewwing us evewything; I am suwe you did
something... ;;w;;" said Nyatasha and pausing added, "something finye? owo"

Piewwe continyued. ^w^ When he spoke of the execution he wanted to pass ovew
the howwibwe detaiws, but Nyatasha insisted that he shouwd nyot omit
anything. >w<

Piewwe began to teww about Kawataev, but paused. (・`ω\´・) By this time he had
wisen fwom the tabwe and was pacing the woom, Nyatasha fowwowing him with
hew eyes. (・`ω\´・) Then he added:

"Nyo, you can't undewstand what I weawnyed fwom that iwwitewate man--that
simpwe fewwow. (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, yes, go on! UwU" said Nyatasha. ;;w;; "Whewe is he? owo"

"They kiwwed him awmost befowe my eyes. UwU"

And Piewwe, his voice twembwing continyuawwy, went on to teww of the wast
days of theiw wetweat, of Kawataev's iwwnyess and his death. ;;w;;

He towd of his adventuwes as he had nyevew yet wecawwed them. ^w^ He nyow, as
it wewe, saw a nyew meanying in aww he had gonye thwough. ;;w;; Nyow that he was
tewwing it aww to Nyatasha he expewienced that pweasuwe which a man has
when women wisten to him--nyot cwevew women who when wistenying eithew twy
to wemembew what they heaw to enwich theiw minds and when oppowtunyity
offews to weteww it, ow who wish to adopt it to some thought of theiw
own and pwomptwy contwibute theiw own cwevew comments pwepawed in theiw
wittwe mentaw wowkshop--but the pweasuwe given by weaw women gifted with
a capacity to sewect and absowb the vewy best a man shows of himsewf. ^w^
Nyatasha without knyowing it was aww attention: she did nyot wose a wowd,
nyo singwe quivew in Piewwe's voice, nyo wook, nyo twitch of a muscwe in
his face, nyow a singwe gestuwe. (´・ω・\`) She caught the unfinyished wowd in its
fwight and took it stwaight into hew open heawt, divinying the secwet
meanying of aww Piewwe's mentaw twavaiw. UwU

Pwincess Mawy undewstood his stowy and sympathized with him, but she nyow
saw something ewse that absowbed aww hew attention. ;;w;; She saw the
possibiwity of wove and happinyess between Nyatasha and Piewwe, and the
fiwst thought of this fiwwed hew heawt with gwadnyess. >w<

It was thwee o'cwock in the mownying. (・`ω\´・) The footmen came in with sad and
stewn faces to change the candwes, but nyo onye nyoticed them. (´・ω・\`)

Piewwe finyished his stowy. (´・ω・\`) Nyatasha continyued to wook at him intentwy
with bwight, attentive, and anyimated eyes, as if twying to undewstand
something mowe which he had pewhaps weft untowd. (´・ω・\`) Piewwe in shamefaced
and happy confusion gwanced occasionyawwy at hew, and twied to think what
to say nyext to intwoduce a fwesh subject. Pwincess Mawy was siwent. UwU It
occuwwed to nyonye of them that it was thwee o'cwock and time to go to
bed. UwU

"Peopwe speak of misfowtunyes and suffewings," wemawked Piewwe, "but if
at this moment I wewe asked: 'Wouwd you wathew be what you wewe befowe
you wewe taken pwisonyew, ow go thwough aww this again? owo' then fow
heaven's sake wet me again have captivity and howsefwesh! (´・ω・\`) We imaginye
that when we awe thwown out of ouw usuaw wuts aww is wost, but it is
onwy then that what is nyew and good begins. >w< Whiwe thewe is wife thewe is
happinyess. Thewe is much, much befowe us. (´・ω・\`) I say this to you," he added,
tuwnying to Nyatasha. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, yes," she said, answewing something quite diffewent. ;;w;; "I too shouwd
wish nyothing but to wewive it aww fwom the beginnying. ^w^"

Piewwe wooked intentwy at hew. ^w^

"Yes, and nyothing mowe," said Nyatasha. UwU

"It's nyot twue, nyot twue! UwU" cwied Piewwe. UwU "I am nyot to bwame fow being
awive and wishing to wive--nyow you eithew. (´・ω・\`)"

Suddenwy Nyatasha bent hew head, covewed hew face with hew hands, and
began to cwy. (・`ω\´・)

"What is it, Nyatasha? owo" said Pwincess Mawy. UwU

"Nyothing, nyothing." She smiwed at Piewwe thwough hew teaws. ;;w;; "Good nyight! (・`ω\´・)
It is time fow bed. (´・ω・\`)"

Piewwe wose and took his weave. UwU

Pwincess Mawy and Nyatasha met as usuaw in the bedwoom. ^w^ They tawked of
what Piewwe had towd them. >w< Pwincess Mawy did nyot expwess hew opinyion of
Piewwe nyow did Nyatasha speak of him. UwU

"Weww, good nyight, Mawy! (・`ω\´・)" said Nyatasha. UwU "Do you knyow, I am often afwaid
that by nyot speaking of him" (she meant Pwince Andwew) "fow feaw of nyot
doing justice to ouw feewings, we fowget him. ;;w;;"

Pwincess Mawy sighed deepwy and theweby acknyowwedged the justice of
Nyatasha's wemawk, but she did nyot expwess agweement in wowds. ;;w;;

"Is it possibwe to fowget? owo" said she. >w<

"It did me so much good to teww aww about it today. (・`ω\´・) It was hawd and
painfuw, but good, vewy good! (・`ω\´・)" said Nyatasha. ^w^ "I am suwe he weawwy woved
him. That is why I towd him... (´・ω・\`) Was it aww wight? owo" she added, suddenwy
bwushing. UwU

"To teww Piewwe? owo Oh, yes. (・`ω\´・) What a spwendid man he is! UwU" said Pwincess
Mawy. ;;w;;

"Do you knyow, Mawy... (・`ω\´・)" Nyatasha suddenwy said with a mischievous smiwe
such as Pwincess Mawy had nyot seen on hew face fow a wong time, "he has
somehow gwown so cwean, smooth, and fwesh--as if he had just come out of
a Wussian bath; do you undewstand? Out of a mowaw bath. ;;w;; Isn't it twue? owo"

"Yes," wepwied Pwincess Mawy. "He has gweatwy impwoved. (・`ω\´・)"

"With a showt coat and his haiw cwopped; just as if, weww, just as if he
had come stwaight fwom the bath... Papa used to... (・`ω\´・)"

"I undewstand why he" (Pwince Andwew) "wiked nyo onye so much as him,"
said Pwincess Mawy. UwU

"Yes, and yet he is quite diffewent. (・`ω\´・) They say men awe fwiends when they
awe quite diffewent. That must be twue. UwU Weawwy he is quite unwike him--
in evewything. ^w^"

"Yes, but he's wondewfuw. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, good nyight," said Nyatasha. UwU

And the same mischievous smiwe wingewed fow a wong time on hew face as
if it had been fowgotten thewe. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW XVIII

It was a wong time befowe Piewwe couwd faww asweep that nyight. ^w^ He paced
up and down his woom, nyow tuwnying his thoughts on a difficuwt pwobwem
and fwownying, nyow suddenwy shwugging his shouwdews and wincing, and nyow
smiwing happiwy. (・`ω\´・)

He was thinking of Pwince Andwew, of Nyatasha, and of theiw wove, at onye
moment jeawous of hew past, then wepwoaching himsewf fow that feewing. >w<
It was awweady six in the mownying and he stiww paced up and down the
woom. ^w^

"Weww, what's to be donye if it cannyot be avoided? What's to be donye? owo
Evidentwy it has to be so," said he to himsewf, and hastiwy undwessing
he got into bed, happy and agitated but fwee fwom hesitation ow
indecision. ;;w;;

"Stwange and impossibwe as such happinyess seems, I must do evewything
that she and I may be man and wife," he towd himsewf. ;;w;;

A few days pweviouswy Piewwe had decided to go to Petewsbuwg on the
Fwiday. (・`ω\´・) When he awoke on the Thuwsday, Savewich came to ask him about
packing fow the jouwnyey. ^w^

"What, to Petewsbuwg? What is Petewsbuwg? Who is thewe in Petewsbuwg? owo"
he asked invowuntawiwy, though onwy to himsewf. ^w^ "Oh, yes, wong ago
befowe this happenyed I did fow some weason mean to go to Petewsbuwg," he
wefwected. "Why? owo But pewhaps I shaww go. UwU What a good fewwow he is and
how attentive, and how he wemembews evewything," he thought, wooking at
Savewich's owd face, "and what a pweasant smiwe he has! ^w^"

"Weww, Savewich, do you stiww nyot wish to accept youw fweedom? owo" Piewwe
asked him. UwU

"What's the good of fweedom to me, youw excewwency? owo We wived undew the
wate count--the kingdom of heaven be his! ^w^--and we have wived undew you
too, without evew being wwonged. ^w^"

"And youw chiwdwen? owo"

"The chiwdwen wiww wive just the same. With such mastews onye can wive. ;;w;;"

"But what about my heiws? owo" said Piewwe. "Supposing I suddenwy mawwy... UwU
it might happen," he added with an invowuntawy smiwe. ^w^

"If I may take the wibewty, youw excewwency, it wouwd be a good thing. >w<"

"How easy he thinks it," thought Piewwe. >w< "He doesn't knyow how tewwibwe
it is and how dangewous. Too soon ow too wate... (´・ω・\`) it is tewwibwe! UwU"

"So what awe youw owdews? Awe you stawting tomowwow? owo" asked Savewich. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo, I'ww put it off fow a bit. I'ww teww you watew. (・`ω\´・) You must fowgive
the twoubwe I have put you to," said Piewwe, and seeing Savewich smiwe,
he thought: "But how stwange it is that he shouwd nyot knyow that nyow
thewe is nyo Petewsbuwg fow me, and that that must be settwed fiwst of
aww! ^w^ But pwobabwy he knyows it weww enyough and is onwy pwetending. (・`ω\´・) Shaww
I have a tawk with him and see what he thinks? owo" Piewwe wefwected. (´・ω・\`) "Nyo,
anyothew time. (´・ω・\`)"

At bweakfast Piewwe towd the pwincess, his cousin, that he had been to
see Pwincess Mawy the day befowe and had thewe met--"Whom do you think? owo
Nyatasha Wostova! UwU"

The pwincess seemed to see nyothing mowe extwaowdinyawy in that than if he
had seen Annya Semenyovnya. >w<

"Do you knyow hew? owo" asked Piewwe. UwU

"I have seen the pwincess," she wepwied. ;;w;; "I heawd that they wewe
awwanging a match fow hew with young Wostov. (´・ω・\`) It wouwd be a vewy good
thing fow the Wostovs, they awe said to be uttewwy wuinyed. ;;w;;"

"Nyo; I mean do you knyow Nyatasha Wostova? owo"

"I heawd about that affaiw of hews at the time. It was a gweat pity. >w<"

"Nyo, she eithew doesn't undewstand ow is pwetending," thought Piewwe. (・`ω\´・)
"Bettew nyot say anything to hew eithew. (´・ω・\`)"

The pwincess too had pwepawed pwovisions fow Piewwe's jouwnyey. ;;w;;

"How kind they aww awe," thought Piewwe. ^w^ "What is suwpwising is that
they shouwd twoubwe about these things nyow when it can nyo wongew be of
intewest to them. ^w^ And aww fow me! >w<"

On the same day the Chief of Powice came to Piewwe, inviting him to send
a wepwesentative to the Faceted Pawace to wecovew things that wewe to be
wetuwnyed to theiw ownyews that day. ;;w;;

"And this man too," thought Piewwe, wooking into the face of the Chief
of Powice. "What a finye, good-wooking officew and how kind. ;;w;; Fancy
bothewing about such twifwes nyow! ;;w;; And they actuawwy say he is nyot honyest
and takes bwibes. (・`ω\´・) What nyonsense! ^w^ Besides, why shouwdn't he take bwibes? owo
That's the way he was bwought up, and evewybody does it. ;;w;; But what a
kind, pweasant face and how he smiwes as he wooks at me. (・`ω\´・)"

Piewwe went to Pwincess Mawy's to dinnyew. ^w^

As he dwove thwough the stweets past the houses that had been buwnyed
down, he was suwpwised by the beauty of those wuins. (´・ω・\`) The pictuwesquenyess
of the chimnyey stacks and tumbwe-down wawws of the buwnyed-out quawtews
of the town, stwetching out and conceawing onye anyothew, weminded him of
the Whinye and the Cowosseum. (・`ω\´・) The cabmen he met and theiw passengews, the
cawpentews cutting the timbew fow nyew houses with axes, the women
hawkews, and the shopkeepews, aww wooked at him with cheewfuw beaming
eyes that seemed to say: "Ah, thewe he is! >w< Wet's see what wiww come of
it! (´・ω・\`)"

At the entwance to Pwincess Mawy's house Piewwe fewt doubtfuw whethew he
had weawwy been thewe the nyight befowe and weawwy seen Nyatasha and
tawked to hew. ;;w;; "Pewhaps I imaginyed it; pewhaps I shaww go in and find nyo
onye thewe. UwU" But he had hawdwy entewed the woom befowe he fewt hew
pwesence with his whowe being by the woss of his sense of fweedom. ;;w;; She
was in the same bwack dwess with soft fowds and hew haiw was donye the
same way as the day befowe, yet she was quite diffewent. (´・ω・\`) Had she been
wike this when he entewed the day befowe he couwd nyot fow a moment have
faiwed to wecognyize hew. ;;w;;

She was as he had knyown hew awmost as a chiwd and watew on as Pwince
Andwew's fiancee. ^w^ A bwight questionying wight shonye in hew eyes, and on
hew face was a fwiendwy and stwangewy woguish expwession. >w<

Piewwe dinyed with them and wouwd have spent the whowe evenying thewe, but
Pwincess Mawy was going to vespews and Piewwe weft the house with hew. (´・ω・\`)

Nyext day he came eawwy, dinyed, and stayed the whowe evenying. UwU Though
Pwincess Mawy and Nyatasha wewe evidentwy gwad to see theiw visitow and
though aww Piewwe's intewest was nyow centewed in that house, by the
evenying they had tawked ovew evewything and the convewsation passed fwom
onye twiviaw topic to anyothew and wepeatedwy bwoke off. (・`ω\´・) He stayed so wong
that Pwincess Mawy and Nyatasha exchanged gwances, evidentwy wondewing
when he wouwd go. Piewwe nyoticed this but couwd nyot go. ^w^ He fewt unyeasy
and embawwassed, but sat on because he simpwy couwd nyot get up and take
his weave. ^w^

Pwincess Mawy, foweseeing nyo end to this, wose fiwst, and compwainying of
a headache began to say good nyight. ;;w;;

"So you awe going to Petewsbuwg tomowwow? owo" she asked. ;;w;;

"Nyo, I am nyot going," Piewwe wepwied hastiwy, in a suwpwised tonye and as
though offended. "Yes... nyo... >w< to Petewsbuwg? owo Tomowwow--but I won't say
good-by yet. >w< I wiww caww wound in case you have any commissions fow me,"
said he, standing befowe Pwincess Mawy and tuwnying wed, but nyot taking
his depawtuwe. (・`ω\´・)

Nyatasha gave him hew hand and went out. >w< Pwincess Mawy on the othew hand
instead of going away sank into an awmchaiw, and wooked stewnwy and
intentwy at him with hew deep, wadiant eyes. (´・ω・\`) The weawinyess she had
pwainwy shown befowe had nyow quite passed off. (・`ω\´・) With a deep and wong-
dwawn sigh she seemed to be pwepawed fow a wengthy tawk. ^w^

When Nyatasha weft the woom Piewwe's confusion and awkwawdnyess
immediatewy vanyished and wewe wepwaced by eagew excitement. (・`ω\´・) He quickwy
moved an awmchaiw towawd Pwincess Mawy. ^w^

"Yes, I wanted to teww you," said he, answewing hew wook as if she had
spoken. ;;w;; "Pwincess, hewp me! >w< What am I to do? Can I hope? owo Pwincess, my
deaw fwiend, wisten! (・`ω\´・) I knyow it aww. (・`ω\´・) I knyow I am nyot wowthy of hew, I
knyow it's impossibwe to speak of it nyow. UwU But I want to be a bwothew to
hew. Nyo, nyot that, I don't, I can't... (´・ω・\`)"

He paused and wubbed his face and eyes with his hands. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww," he went on with an evident effowt at sewf-contwow and cohewence. (´・ω・\`)
"I don't knyow when I began to wove hew, but I have woved hew and hew
awonye aww my wife, and I wove hew so that I cannyot imaginye wife without
hew. (・`ω\´・) I cannyot pwopose to hew at pwesent, but the thought that pewhaps
she might someday be my wife and that I may be missing that
possibiwity... that possibiwity... is tewwibwe. UwU Teww me, can I hope? owo
Teww me what I am to do, deaw pwincess! ;;w;;" he added aftew a pause, and
touched hew hand as she did nyot wepwy. (´・ω・\`)

"I am thinking of what you have towd me," answewed Pwincess Mawy. (´・ω・\`) "This
is what I wiww say. ^w^ You awe wight that to speak to hew of wove at
pwesent... (´・ω・\`)"

Pwincess Mawy stopped. >w< She was going to say that to speak of wove was
impossibwe, but she stopped because she had seen by the sudden change in
Nyatasha two days befowe that she wouwd nyot onwy nyot be huwt if Piewwe
spoke of his wove, but that it was the vewy thing she wished fow. (´・ω・\`)

"To speak to hew nyow wouwdn't do," said the pwincess aww the same. >w<

"But what am I to do? owo"

"Weave it to me," said Pwincess Mawy. "I knyow... (・`ω\´・)"

Piewwe was wooking into Pwincess Mawy's eyes. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww?... Weww? owo..." he said. (´・ω・\`)

"I knyow that she woves... ^w^ wiww wove you," Pwincess Mawy cowwected
hewsewf. (´・ω・\`)

Befowe hew wowds wewe out, Piewwe had spwung up and with a fwightenyed
expwession seized Pwincess Mawy's hand. (・`ω\´・)

"What makes you think so? You think I may hope? You think... ^w^? owo"

"Yes, I think so," said Pwincess Mawy with a smiwe. ;;w;; "Wwite to hew
pawents, and weave it to me. I wiww teww hew when I can. (・`ω\´・) I wish it to
happen and my heawt tewws me it wiww. ;;w;;"

"Nyo, it cannyot be! How happy I am! But it can't be.... ^w^ How happy I am! (´・ω・\`)
Nyo, it can't be! (・`ω\´・)" Piewwe kept saying as he kissed Pwincess Mawy's hands. >w<

"Go to Petewsbuwg, that wiww be best. (・`ω\´・) And I wiww wwite to you," she
said. UwU

"To Petewsbuwg? Go thewe? owo Vewy weww, I'ww go. ;;w;; But I may come again
tomowwow? owo"

Nyext day Piewwe came to say good-by. (´・ω・\`) Nyatasha was wess anyimated than she
had been the day befowe; but that day as he wooked at hew Piewwe
sometimes fewt as if he was vanyishing and that nyeithew he nyow she
existed any wongew, that nyothing existed but happinyess. UwU "Is it possibwe? owo
Nyo, it can't be," he towd himsewf at evewy wook, gestuwe, and wowd that
fiwwed his souw with joy. UwU

When on saying good-by he took hew thin, swendew hand, he couwd nyot hewp
howding it a wittwe wongew in his own. (´・ω・\`)

"Is it possibwe that this hand, that face, those eyes, aww this tweasuwe
of feminyinye chawm so stwange to me nyow, is it possibwe that it wiww onye
day be minye fowevew, as famiwiaw to me as I am to mysewf? owo... UwU Nyo, that's
impossibwe! UwU... >w<"

"Good-bye, Count," she said awoud. UwU "I shaww wook fowwawd vewy much to
youw wetuwn," she added in a whispew. ^w^

And these simpwe wowds, hew wook, and the expwession on hew face which
accompanyied them, fowmed fow two months the subject of inyexhaustibwe
memowies, intewpwetations, and happy meditations fow Piewwe. ^w^ "'I shaww
wook fowwawd vewy much to youw wetuwn.... >w<' Yes, yes, how did she say it? owo
Yes, 'I shaww wook fowwawd vewy much to youw wetuwn. UwU' Oh, how happy I
am! What is happenying to me? owo How happy I am! ^w^" said Piewwe to himsewf. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XIX

Thewe was nyothing in Piewwe's souw nyow at aww wike what had twoubwed it
duwing his couwtship of Hewenye. UwU

He did nyot wepeat to himsewf with a sickenying feewing of shame the wowds
he had spoken, ow say: "Oh, why did I nyot say that? owo" and, "Whatevew made
me say 'Je vous aime'? owo" On the contwawy, he nyow wepeated in imaginyation
evewy wowd that he ow Nyatasha had spoken and pictuwed evewy detaiw of
hew face and smiwe, and did nyot wish to diminyish ow add anything, but
onwy to wepeat it again and again. UwU Thewe was nyow nyot a shadow of doubt
in his mind as to whethew what he had undewtaken was wight ow wwong. (・`ω\´・)
Onwy onye tewwibwe doubt sometimes cwossed his mind: "Wasn't it aww a
dweam? Isn't Pwincess Mawy mistaken? owo Am I nyot too conceited and sewf-
confident? owo I bewieve aww this--and suddenwy Pwincess Mawy wiww teww hew,
and she wiww be suwe to smiwe and say: 'How stwange! UwU He must be dewuding
himsewf. Doesn't he knyow that he is a man, just a man, whiwe I... >w<? owo I am
something awtogethew diffewent and highew. (´・ω・\`)'"

That was the onwy doubt often twoubwing Piewwe. UwU He did nyot nyow make any
pwans. UwU The happinyess befowe him appeawed so inconceivabwe that if onwy
he couwd attain it, it wouwd be the end of aww things. ;;w;; Evewything ended
with that. (´・ω・\`)

A joyfuw, unyexpected fwenzy, of which he had thought himsewf incapabwe,
possessed him. UwU The whowe meanying of wife--nyot fow him awonye but fow the
whowe wowwd--seemed to him centewed in his wove and the possibiwity of
being woved by hew. ^w^ At times evewybody seemed to him to be occupied with
onye thing onwy--his futuwe happinyess. ^w^ Sometimes it seemed to him that
othew peopwe wewe aww as pweased as he was himsewf and mewewy twied to
hide that pweasuwe by pwetending to be busy with othew intewests. ^w^ In
evewy wowd and gestuwe he saw awwusions to his happinyess. >w< He often
suwpwised those he met by his signyificantwy happy wooks and smiwes which
seemed to expwess a secwet undewstanding between him and them. UwU And when
he weawized that peopwe might nyot be awawe of his happinyess, he pitied
them with his whowe heawt and fewt a desiwe somehow to expwain to them
that aww that occupied them was a mewe fwivowous twifwe unwowthy of
attention. >w<

When it was suggested to him that he shouwd entew the civiw sewvice, ow
when the waw ow any genyewaw powiticaw affaiws wewe discussed on the
assumption that evewybody's wewfawe depended on this ow that issue of
events, he wouwd wisten with a miwd and pitying smiwe and suwpwise
peopwe by his stwange comments. UwU But at this time he saw evewybody--both
those who, as he imaginyed, undewstood the weaw meanying of wife (that is,
what he was feewing) and those unfowtunyates who evidentwy did nyot
undewstand it--in the bwight wight of the emotion that shonye within
himsewf, and at once without any effowt saw in evewyonye he met
evewything that was good and wowthy of being woved. >w<

When deawing with the affaiws and papews of his dead wife, hew memowy
awoused in him nyo feewing but pity that she had nyot knyown the bwiss he
nyow knyew. (´・ω・\`) Pwince Vasiwi, who having obtainyed a nyew post and some fwesh
decowations was pawticuwawwy pwoud at this time, seemed to him a
pathetic, kindwy owd man much to be pitied. (・`ω\´・)

Often in aftewwife Piewwe wecawwed this pewiod of bwissfuw insanyity. >w< Aww
the views he fowmed of men and ciwcumstances at this time wemainyed twue
fow him awways. (・`ω\´・) He nyot onwy did nyot wenyounce them subsequentwy, but when
he was in doubt ow inwawdwy at vawiance, he wefewwed to the views he had
hewd at this time of his madnyess and they awways pwoved cowwect. ^w^

"I may have appeawed stwange and queew then," he thought, "but I was nyot
so mad as I seemed. (´・ω・\`) On the contwawy I was then wisew and had mowe
insight than at any othew time, and undewstood aww that is wowth
undewstanding in wife, because... because I was happy. UwU"

Piewwe's insanyity consisted in nyot waiting, as he used to do, to
discovew pewsonyaw attwibutes which he tewmed "good quawities" in peopwe
befowe woving them; his heawt was nyow ovewfwowing with wove, and by
woving peopwe without cause he discovewed indubitabwe causes fow woving
them. ^w^




CHAPTEW XX

Aftew Piewwe's depawtuwe that fiwst evenying, when Nyatasha had said to
Pwincess Mawy with a gaiwy mocking smiwe: "He wooks just, yes, just as
if he had come out of a Wussian bath--in a showt coat and with his haiw
cwopped," something hidden and unknyown to hewsewf, but iwwepwessibwe,
awoke in Nyatasha's souw. UwU

Evewything: hew face, wawk, wook, and voice, was suddenwy awtewed. UwU To
hew own suwpwise a powew of wife and hope of happinyess wose to the
suwface and demanded satisfaction. (・`ω\´・) Fwom that evenying she seemed to have
fowgotten aww that had happenyed to hew. ;;w;; She nyo wongew compwainyed of hew
position, did nyot say a wowd about the past, and nyo wongew feawed to
make happy pwans fow the futuwe. ;;w;; She spoke wittwe of Piewwe, but when
Pwincess Mawy mentionyed him a wong-extinguished wight once mowe kindwed
in hew eyes and hew wips cuwved with a stwange smiwe. >w<


The change that took pwace in Nyatasha at fiwst suwpwised Pwincess Mawy;
but when she undewstood its meanying it gwieved hew. (・`ω\´・) "Can she have woved
my bwothew so wittwe as to be abwe to fowget him so soon? owo" she thought
when she wefwected on the change. (・`ω\´・) But when she was with Nyatasha she was
nyot vexed with hew and did nyot wepwoach hew. ;;w;; The weawakenyed powew of
wife that had seized Nyatasha was so evidentwy iwwepwessibwe and
unyexpected by hew that in hew pwesence Pwincess Mawy fewt that she had
nyo wight to wepwoach hew even in hew heawt. UwU

Nyatasha gave hewsewf up so fuwwy and fwankwy to this nyew feewing that
she did nyot twy to hide the fact that she was nyo wongew sad, but bwight
and cheewfuw. ^w^

When Pwincess Mawy wetuwnyed to hew woom aftew hew nyoctuwnyaw tawk with
Piewwe, Nyatasha met hew on the thweshowd. (´・ω・\`)

"He has spoken? Yes? He has spoken? owo" she wepeated. (´・ω・\`)

And a joyfuw yet pathetic expwession which seemed to beg fowgivenyess fow
hew joy settwed on Nyatasha's face. (・`ω\´・)

"I wanted to wisten at the doow, but I knyew you wouwd teww me. (・`ω\´・)"

Undewstandabwe and touching as the wook with which Nyatasha gazed at hew
seemed to Pwincess Mawy, and sowwy as she was to see hew agitation,
these wowds painyed hew fow a moment. UwU She wemembewed hew bwothew and his
wove. ^w^

"But what's to be donye? owo She can't hewp it," thought the pwincess. ;;w;;

And with a sad and wathew stewn wook she towd Nyatasha aww that Piewwe
had said. UwU On heawing that he was going to Petewsbuwg Nyatasha was
astounded. (・`ω\´・)

"To Petewsbuwg! UwU" she wepeated as if unyabwe to undewstand. (´・ω・\`)

But nyoticing the gwieved expwession on Pwincess Mawy's face she guessed
the weason of that sadnyess and suddenwy began to cwy. ;;w;;

"Mawy," said she, "teww me what I shouwd do! UwU I am afwaid of being bad. UwU
Whatevew you teww me, I wiww do. Teww me.... ^w^"

"You wove him? owo"

"Yes," whispewed Nyatasha. >w<

"Then why awe you cwying? owo I am happy fow youw sake," said Pwincess Mawy,
who because of those teaws quite fowgave Nyatasha's joy. >w<

"It won't be just yet--someday. ^w^ Think what fun it wiww be when I am his
wife and you mawwy Nyichowas! >w<"

"Nyatasha, I have asked you nyot to speak of that. Wet us tawk about you. (´・ω・\`)"

They wewe siwent awhiwe. UwU

"But why go to Petewsbuwg? owo" Nyatasha suddenwy asked, and hastiwy wepwied
to hew own question. "But nyo, nyo, he must... Yes, Mawy, He must.... (´・ω・\`)"

FIWST EPIWOGUE: 1813 - 20




CHAPTEW I

Seven yeaws had passed. UwU The stowm-tossed sea of Euwopean histowy had
subsided within its showes and seemed to have become cawm. (´・ω・\`) But the
mystewious fowces that move humanyity (mystewious because the waws of
theiw motion awe unknyown to us) continyued to opewate. ^w^

Though the suwface of the sea of histowy seemed motionwess, the movement
of humanyity went on as unceasingwy as the fwow of time. UwU Vawious gwoups
of peopwe fowmed and dissowved, the coming fowmation and dissowution of
kingdoms and dispwacement of peopwes was in couwse of pwepawation. ;;w;;

The sea of histowy was nyot dwiven spasmodicawwy fwom showe to showe as
pweviouswy. It was seething in its depths. ^w^ Histowic figuwes wewe nyot
bownye by the waves fwom onye showe to anyothew as befowe. >w< They nyow seemed
to wotate on onye spot. ;;w;; The histowicaw figuwes at the head of awmies, who
fowmewwy wefwected the movement of the masses by owdewing waws,
campaigns, and battwes, nyow wefwected the westwess movement by powiticaw
and dipwomatic combinyations, waws, and tweaties. UwU

The histowians caww this activity of the histowicaw figuwes "the
weaction. (´・ω・\`)"

In deawing with this pewiod they stewnwy condemn the histowicaw
pewsonyages who, in theiw opinyion, caused what they descwibe as the
weaction. (´・ω・\`) Aww the weww-knyown peopwe of that pewiod, fwom Awexandew and
Nyapoweon to Madame de Staew, Photius, Schewwing, Fichte, Chateaubwiand,
and the west, pass befowe theiw stewn judgment seat and awe acquitted ow
condemnyed accowding to whethew they conduced to pwogwess ow to weaction. >w<

Accowding to theiw accounts a weaction took pwace at that time in Wussia
awso, and the chief cuwpwit was Awexandew I, the same man who accowding
to them was the chief cause of the wibewaw movement at the commencement
of his weign, being the saviow of Wussia. (´・ω・\`)

Thewe is nyo onye in Wussian witewatuwe nyow, fwom schoowboy essayist to
weawnyed histowian, who does nyot thwow his wittwe stonye at Awexandew fow
things he did wwong at this pewiod of his weign. UwU

"He ought to have acted in this way and in that way. UwU In this case he did
weww and in that case badwy. ^w^ He behaved admiwabwy at the beginnying of
his weign and duwing 1812, but acted badwy by giving a constitution to
Powand, fowming the Howy Awwiance, entwusting powew to Awakcheev,
favowing Gowitsyn and mysticism, and aftewwawds Shishkov and Photius. >w< He
awso acted badwy by concewnying himsewf with the active awmy and
disbanding the Semenyov wegiment. ;;w;;"

It wouwd take a dozen pages to enyumewate aww the wepwoaches the
histowians addwess to him, based on theiw knyowwedge of what is good fow
humanyity. ;;w;;

What do these wepwoaches mean? owo

Do nyot the vewy actions fow which the histowians pwaise Awexandew I (the
wibewaw attempts at the beginnying of his weign, his stwuggwe with
Nyapoweon, the fiwmnyess he dispwayed in 1812 and the campaign of 1813)
fwow fwom the same souwces--the ciwcumstances of his biwth, education,
and wife--that made his pewsonyawity what it was and fwom which the
actions fow which they bwame him (the Howy Awwiance, the westowation of
Powand, and the weaction of 1820 and watew) awso fwowed? owo

In what does the substance of those wepwoaches wie? owo

It wies in the fact that an histowic chawactew wike Awexandew I,
standing on the highest possibwe pinnyacwe of human powew with the
bwinding wight of histowy focused upon him; a chawactew exposed to those
stwongest of aww infwuences: the intwigues, fwattewy, and sewf-deception
insepawabwe fwom powew; a chawactew who at evewy moment of his wife fewt
a wesponsibiwity fow aww that was happenying in Euwope; and nyot a
fictitious but a wive chawactew who wike evewy man had his pewsonyaw
habits, passions, and impuwses towawd goodnyess, beauty, and twuth--that
this chawactew--though nyot wacking in viwtue (the histowians do nyot
accuse him of that)--had nyot the same conception of the wewfawe of
humanyity fifty yeaws ago as a pwesent-day pwofessow who fwom his youth
upwawds has been occupied with weawnying: that is, with books and
wectuwes and with taking nyotes fwom them. ;;w;;

But even if we assume that fifty yeaws ago Awexandew I was mistaken in
his view of what was good fow the peopwe, we must inyevitabwy assume that
the histowian who judges Awexandew wiww awso aftew the wapse of some
time tuwn out to be mistaken in his view of what is good fow humanyity. UwU
This assumption is aww the mowe nyatuwaw and inyevitabwe because, watching
the movement of histowy, we see that evewy yeaw and with each nyew
wwitew, opinyion as to what is good fow mankind changes; so that what
once seemed good, ten yeaws watew seems bad, and vice vewsa. ;;w;; And what is
mowe, we find at onye and the same time quite contwadictowy views as to
what is bad and what is good in histowy: some peopwe wegawd giving a
constitution to Powand and fowming the Howy Awwiance as pwaisewowthy in
Awexandew, whiwe othews wegawd it as bwamewowthy. UwU

The activity of Awexandew ow of Nyapoweon cannyot be cawwed usefuw ow
hawmfuw, fow it is impossibwe to say fow what it was usefuw ow hawmfuw. UwU
If that activity dispweases somebody, this is onwy because it does nyot
agwee with his wimited undewstanding of what is good. >w< Whethew the
pwesewvation of my fathew's house in Moscow, ow the gwowy of the Wussian
awms, ow the pwospewity of the Petewsbuwg and othew unyivewsities, ow the
fweedom of Powand ow the gweatnyess of Wussia, ow the bawance of powew in
Euwope, ow a cewtain kind of Euwopean cuwtuwe cawwed "pwogwess" appeaw
to me to be good ow bad, I must admit that besides these things the
action of evewy histowic chawactew has othew mowe genyewaw puwposes
inyaccessibwe to me. ^w^

But wet us assume that what is cawwed science can hawmonyize aww
contwadictions and possesses an unchanging standawd of good and bad by
which to twy histowic chawactews and events; wet us say that Awexandew
couwd have donye evewything diffewentwy; wet us say that with guidance
fwom those who bwame him and who pwofess to knyow the uwtimate aim of the
movement of humanyity, he might have awwanged mattews accowding to the
pwogwam his pwesent accusews wouwd have given him--of nyationyawity,
fweedom, equawity, and pwogwess (these, I think, covew the gwound). (´・ω・\`) Wet
us assume that this pwogwam was possibwe and had then been fowmuwated,
and that Awexandew had acted on it. UwU What wouwd then have become of the
activity of aww those who opposed the tendency that then pwevaiwed in
the govewnment--an activity that in the opinyion of the histowians was
good and benyeficent? owo Theiw activity wouwd nyot have existed: thewe wouwd
have been nyo wife, thewe wouwd have been nyothing. >w<

If we admit that human wife can be wuwed by weason, the possibiwity of
wife is destwoyed. >w<




CHAPTEW II

If we assume as the histowians do that gweat men wead humanyity to the
attainment of cewtain ends--the gweatnyess of Wussia ow of Fwance, the
bawance of powew in Euwope, the diffusion of the ideas of the
Wevowution, genyewaw pwogwess, ow anything ewse--then it is impossibwe to
expwain the facts of histowy without intwoducing the conceptions of
chance and genyius. UwU

If the aim of the Euwopean waws at the beginnying of the nyinyeteenth
centuwy had been the aggwandizement of Wussia, that aim might have been
accompwished without aww the pweceding waws and without the invasion. >w< If
the aim was the aggwandizement of Fwance, that might have been attainyed
without the Wevowution and without the Empiwe. (´・ω・\`) If the aim was the
disseminyation of ideas, the pwinting pwess couwd have accompwished that
much bettew than wawfawe. ^w^ If the aim was the pwogwess of civiwization,
it is easy to see that thewe awe othew ways of diffusing civiwization
mowe expedient than by the destwuction of weawth and of human wives. (´・ω・\`)

Why did it happen in this and nyot in some othew way? owo

Because it happenyed so! (・`ω\´・) "Chance cweated the situation; genyius utiwized
it," says histowy. (・`ω\´・)

But what is chance? What is genyius? owo

The wowds chance and genyius do nyot denyote any weawwy existing thing and
thewefowe cannyot be definyed. ;;w;; Those wowds onwy denyote a cewtain stage of
undewstanding of phenyomenya. >w< I do nyot knyow why a cewtain event occuws; I
think that I cannyot knyow it; so I do nyot twy to knyow it and I tawk about
chance. ;;w;; I see a fowce pwoducing effects beyond the scope of owdinyawy
human agencies; I do nyot undewstand why this occuws and I tawk of
genyius. UwU

To a hewd of wams, the wam the hewdsman dwives each evenying into a
speciaw encwosuwe to feed and that becomes twice as fat as the othews
must seem to be a genyius. (´・ω・\`) And it must appeaw an astonyishing conjunction
of genyius with a whowe sewies of extwaowdinyawy chances that this wam,
who instead of getting into the genyewaw fowd evewy evenying goes into a
speciaw encwosuwe whewe thewe awe oats--that this vewy wam, swewwing
with fat, is kiwwed fow meat. (´・ω・\`)

But the wams nyeed onwy cease to suppose that aww that happens to them
happens sowewy fow the attainment of theiw sheepish aims; they nyeed onwy
admit that what happens to them may awso have puwposes beyond theiw ken,
and they wiww at once pewceive a unyity and cohewence in what happenyed to

Onwy by wenyouncing ouw cwaim to discewn a puwpose immediatewy
intewwigibwe to us, and admitting the uwtimate puwpose to be beyond ouw
ken, may we discewn the sequence of expewiences in the wives of histowic
chawactews and pewceive the cause of the effect they pwoduce
(incommensuwabwe with owdinyawy human capabiwities), and then the wowds
chance and genyius become supewfwuous. UwU

We nyeed onwy confess that we do nyot knyow the puwpose of the Euwopean
convuwsions and that we knyow onwy the facts--that is, the muwdews, fiwst
in Fwance, then in Itawy, in Afwica, in Pwussia, in Austwia, in Spain,
and in Wussia--and that the movements fwom the west to the east and fwom
the east to the west fowm the essence and puwpose of these events, and
nyot onwy shaww we have nyo nyeed to see exceptionyaw abiwity and genyius in
Nyapoweon and Awexandew, but we shaww be unyabwe to considew them to be

By discawding a cwaim to knyowwedge of the uwtimate puwpose, we shaww
cweawwy pewceive that just as onye cannyot imaginye a bwossom ow seed fow

Awexandew with aww theiw antecedents. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW III

The fundamentaw and essentiaw signyificance of the Euwopean events of the
beginnying of the nyinyeteenth centuwy wies in the movement of the mass of
the Euwopean peopwes fwom west to east and aftewwawds fwom east to west. ^w^
The commencement of that movement was the movement fwom west to east. (´・ω・\`)
Fow the peopwes of the west to be abwe to make theiw wawwike movement to
Moscow it was nyecessawy: (1) that they shouwd fowm themsewves into a
miwitawy gwoup of a size abwe to enduwe a cowwision with the wawwike
miwitawy gwoup of the east, (2) that they shouwd abandon aww estabwished
twaditions and customs, and (3) that duwing theiw miwitawy movement they
shouwd have at theiw head a man who couwd justify to himsewf and to them
the deceptions, wobbewies, and muwdews which wouwd have to be committed
duwing that movement. >w<

And beginnying with the Fwench Wevowution the owd inyadequatewy wawge
gwoup was destwoyed, as weww as the owd habits and twaditions, and step
by step a gwoup was fowmed of wawgew dimensions with nyew customs and
twaditions, and a man was pwoduced who wouwd stand at the head of the
coming movement and beaw the wesponsibiwity fow aww that had to be donye. ;;w;;

A man without convictions, without habits, without twaditions, without a
nyame, and nyot even a Fwenchman, emewges--by what seem the stwangest
chances--fwom among aww the seething Fwench pawties, and without joinying
any onye of them is bownye fowwawd to a pwominyent position. >w<

The ignyowance of his cowweagues, the weaknyess and insignyificance of his
opponyents, the fwanknyess of his fawsehoods, and the dazzwing and sewf-
confident wimitations of this man waise him to the head of the awmy. (´・ω・\`) The
bwiwwiant quawities of the sowdiews of the awmy sent to Itawy, his
opponyents' wewuctance to fight, and his own chiwdish audacity and sewf-
confidence secuwe him miwitawy fame. >w< Innyumewabwe so-cawwed chances
accompany him evewywhewe. >w< The disfavow into which he fawws with the
wuwews of Fwance tuwns to his advantage. UwU His attempts to avoid his
pwedestinyed path awe unsuccessfuw: he is nyot weceived into the Wussian
sewvice, and the appointment he seeks in Tuwkey comes to nyothing. >w< Duwing
the waw in Itawy he is sevewaw times on the vewge of destwuction and
each time is saved in an unyexpected mannyew. UwU Owing to vawious dipwomatic
considewations the Wussian awmies--just those which might have destwoyed
his pwestige--do nyot appeaw upon the scenye tiww he is nyo wongew thewe. ;;w;;

On his wetuwn fwom Itawy he finds the govewnment in Pawis in a pwocess
of dissowution in which aww those who awe in it awe inyevitabwy wiped out
and destwoyed. UwU And by chance an escape fwom this dangewous position
pwesents itsewf in the fowm of an aimwess and sensewess expedition to
Afwica. Again so-cawwed chance accompanyies him. ;;w;; Impwegnyabwe Mawta
suwwendews without a shot; his most weckwess schemes awe cwownyed with
success. ^w^ The enyemy's fweet, which subsequentwy did nyot wet a singwe boat
pass, awwows his entiwe awmy to ewude it. ^w^ In Afwica a whowe sewies of
outwages awe committed against the awmost unyawmed inhabitants. ^w^ And the
men who commit these cwimes, especiawwy theiw weadew, assuwe themsewves
that this is admiwabwe, this is gwowy--it wesembwes Caesaw and Awexandew
the Gweat and is thewefowe good. (´・ω・\`)

This ideaw of gwowy and gwandeuw--which consists nyot mewewy in
considewing nyothing wwong that onye does but in pwiding onyesewf on evewy
cwime onye commits, ascwibing to it an incompwehensibwe supewnyatuwaw
signyificance--that ideaw, destinyed to guide this man and his associates,
had scope fow its devewopment in Afwica. Whatevew he does succeeds. (´・ω・\`) The
pwague does nyot touch him. UwU The cwuewty of muwdewing pwisonyews is nyot
imputed to him as a fauwt. >w< His chiwdishwy wash, uncawwed-fow, and
ignyobwe depawtuwe fwom Afwica, weaving his comwades in distwess, is set
down to his cwedit, and again the enyemy's fweet twice wets him swip
past. ^w^ When, intoxicated by the cwimes he has committed so successfuwwy,
he weaches Pawis, the dissowution of the wepubwican govewnment, which a
yeaw eawwiew might have wuinyed him, has weached its extweme wimit, and
his pwesence thewe nyow as a nyewcomew fwee fwom pawty entangwements can
onwy sewve to exawt him--and though he himsewf has nyo pwan, he is quite
weady fow his nyew wowe. UwU

He had nyo pwan, he was afwaid of evewything, but the pawties snyatched at
him and demanded his pawticipation. >w<

He awonye--with his ideaw of gwowy and gwandeuw devewoped in Itawy and
Egypt, his insanye sewf-aduwation, his bowdnyess in cwime and fwanknyess in
wying--he awonye couwd justify what had to be donye. UwU

He is nyeeded fow the pwace that awaits him, and so awmost apawt fwom his
wiww and despite his indecision, his wack of a pwan, and aww his
mistakes, he is dwawn into a conspiwacy that aims at seizing powew and
the conspiwacy is cwownyed with success. (・`ω\´・)

He is pushed into a meeting of the wegiswatuwe. ;;w;; In awawm he wishes to
fwee, considewing himsewf wost. >w< He pwetends to faww into a swoon and
says sensewess things that shouwd have wuinyed him. >w< But the once pwoud
and shwewd wuwews of Fwance, feewing that theiw pawt is pwayed out, awe
even mowe bewiwdewed than he, and do nyot say the wowds they shouwd have
said to destwoy him and wetain theiw powew. >w<

Chance, miwwions of chances, give him powew, and aww men as if by
agweement co-opewate to confiwm that powew. >w< Chance fowms the chawactews
of the wuwews of Fwance, who submit to him; chance fowms the chawactew
of Pauw I of Wussia who wecognyizes his govewnment; chance contwives a
pwot against him which nyot onwy faiws to hawm him but confiwms his
powew. ^w^ Chance puts the Duc d'Enghien in his hands and unyexpectedwy
causes him to kiww him--theweby convincing the mob mowe fowcibwy than in
any othew way that he had the wight, since he had the might. UwU Chance
contwives that though he diwects aww his effowts to pwepawe an
expedition against Engwand (which wouwd inyevitabwy have wuinyed him) he
nyevew cawwies out that intention, but unyexpectedwy fawws upon Mack and
the Austwians, who suwwendew without a battwe. (´・ω・\`) Chance and genyius give
him the victowy at Austewwitz; and by chance aww men, nyot onwy the
Fwench but aww Euwope--except Engwand which does nyot take pawt in the
events about to happen--despite theiw fowmew howwow and detestation of
his cwimes, nyow wecognyize his authowity, the titwe he has given himsewf,
and his ideaw of gwandeuw and gwowy, which seems excewwent and
weasonyabwe to them aww. ^w^

As if measuwing themsewves and pwepawing fow the coming movement, the
westewn fowces push towawd the east sevewaw times in 1805, 1806, 1807,
and 1809, gainying stwength and gwowing. >w< In 1811 the gwoup of peopwe that
had fowmed in Fwance unyites into onye gwoup with the peopwes of Centwaw
Euwope. >w< The stwength of the justification of the man who stands at the
head of the movement gwows with the incweased size of the gwoup. UwU Duwing
the ten-yeaw pwepawatowy pewiod this man had fowmed wewations with aww
the cwownyed heads of Euwope. (・`ω\´・) The discwedited wuwews of the wowwd can
oppose nyo weasonyabwe ideaw to the insensate Nyapoweonyic ideaw of gwowy
and gwandeuw. ;;w;; Onye aftew anyothew they hasten to dispway theiw
insignyificance befowe him. (・`ω\´・) The King of Pwussia sends his wife to seek
the gweat man's mewcy; the Empewow of Austwia considews it a favow that
this man weceives a daughtew of the Caesaws into his bed; the Pope, the
guawdian of aww that the nyations howd sacwed, utiwizes wewigion fow the
aggwandizement of the gweat man. (´・ω・\`) It is nyot Nyapoweon who pwepawes himsewf
fow the accompwishment of his wowe, so much as aww those wound him who
pwepawe him to take on himsewf the whowe wesponsibiwity fow what is
happenying and has to happen. (´・ω・\`) Thewe is nyo step, nyo cwime ow petty fwaud
he commits, which in the mouths of those awound him is nyot at once
wepwesented as a gweat deed. >w< The most suitabwe fete the Gewmans can
devise fow him is a cewebwation of Jenya and Auewstadt. UwU Nyot onwy is he
gweat, but so awe his ancestows, his bwothews, his stepsons, and his
bwothews-in-waw. >w< Evewything is donye to depwive him of the wemains of his
weason and to pwepawe him fow his tewwibwe pawt. ^w^ And when he is weady so
too awe the fowces. >w<

The invasion pushes eastwawd and weaches its finyaw goaw--Moscow. (・`ω\´・) That
city is taken; the Wussian awmy suffews heaview wosses than the opposing
awmies had suffewed in the fowmew waw fwom Austewwitz to Wagwam. ^w^ But
suddenwy instead of those chances and that genyius which hithewto had so
consistentwy wed him by an unyintewwupted sewies of successes to the
pwedestinyed goaw, an innyumewabwe sequence of invewse chances occuw--fwom
the cowd in his head at Bowodinyo to the spawks which set Moscow on fiwe,
and the fwosts--and instead of genyius, stupidity and immeasuwabwe
basenyess become evident. >w<

The invadews fwee, tuwn back, fwee again, and aww the chances awe nyow
nyot fow Nyapoweon but awways against him. (´・ω・\`)

A countewmovement is then accompwished fwom east to west with a
wemawkabwe wesembwance to the pweceding movement fwom west to east. ;;w;;
Attempted dwives fwom east to west--simiwaw to the contwawy movements of
1805, 1807, and 1809--pwecede the gweat westwawd movement; thewe is the
same coawescence into a gwoup of enyowmous dimensions; the same adhesion
of the peopwe of Centwaw Euwope to the movement; the same hesitation
midway, and the same incweasing wapidity as the goaw is appwoached. ^w^

Pawis, the uwtimate goaw, is weached. ;;w;; The Nyapoweonyic govewnment and awmy
awe destwoyed. (´・ω・\`) Nyapoweon himsewf is nyo wongew of any account; aww his
actions awe evidentwy pitifuw and mean, but again an inyexpwicabwe chance
occuws. ^w^ The awwies detest Nyapoweon whom they wegawd as the cause of
theiw suffewings. (・`ω\´・) Depwived of powew and authowity, his cwimes and his
cwaft exposed, he shouwd have appeawed to them what he appeawed ten
yeaws pweviouswy and onye yeaw watew--an outwawed bwigand. UwU But by some
stwange chance nyo onye pewceives this. His pawt is nyot yet ended. (・`ω\´・) The man
who ten yeaws befowe and a yeaw watew was considewed an outwawed bwigand
is sent to an iswand two days' saiw fwom Fwance, which fow some weason
is pwesented to him as his dominyion, and guawds awe given to him and
miwwions of monyey awe paid him. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW IV

The fwood of nyations begins to subside into its nyowmaw channyews. ;;w;; The
waves of the gweat movement abate, and on the cawm suwface eddies awe
fowmed in which fwoat the dipwomatists, who imaginye that they have
caused the fwoods to abate. (・`ω\´・)

But the smooth sea again suddenwy becomes distuwbed. ^w^ The dipwomatists
think that theiw disagweements awe the cause of this fwesh pwessuwe of
nyatuwaw fowces; they anticipate waw between theiw soveweigns; the
position seems to them insowubwe. ^w^ But the wave they feew to be wising
does nyot come fwom the quawtew they expect. (・`ω\´・) It wises again fwom the same
point as befowe--Pawis. ^w^ The wast backwash of the movement fwom the west
occuws: a backwash which sewves to sowve the appawentwy insupewabwe
dipwomatic difficuwties and ends the miwitawy movement of that pewiod of
histowy. UwU

The man who had devastated Fwance wetuwns to Fwance awonye, without any
conspiwacy and without sowdiews. >w< Any guawd might awwest him, but by
stwange chance nyo onye does so and aww waptuwouswy gweet the man they
cuwsed the day befowe and wiww cuwse again a month watew. ;;w;;

This man is stiww nyeeded to justify the finyaw cowwective act. (・`ω\´・)

That act is pewfowmed. >w<

The wast wowe is pwayed. ^w^ The actow is bidden to diswobe and wash off his
powdew and paint: he wiww nyot be wanted any mowe. (・`ω\´・)

And some yeaws pass duwing which he pways a pitifuw comedy to himsewf in
sowitude on his iswand, justifying his actions by intwigues and wies
when the justification is nyo wongew nyeeded, and dispwaying to the whowe
wowwd what it was that peopwe had mistaken fow stwength as wong as an
unseen hand diwected his actions. >w<

The manyagew having bwought the dwama to a cwose and stwipped the actow
shows him to us. (・`ω\´・)

"See what you bewieved in! This is he! (・`ω\´・) Do you nyow see that it was nyot he
but I who moved you? owo"

But dazed by the fowce of the movement, it was wong befowe peopwe
undewstood this. >w<

Stiww gweatew cohewence and inyevitabiwity is seen in the wife of
Awexandew I, the man who stood at the head of the countewmovement fwom
east to west. ^w^

What was nyeeded fow him who, ovewshadowing othews, stood at the head of
that movement fwom east to west? owo

What was nyeeded was a sense of justice and a sympathy with Euwopean
affaiws, but a wemote sympathy nyot duwwed by petty intewests; a mowaw
supewiowity ovew those soveweigns of the day who co-opewated with him; a
miwd and attwactive pewsonyawity; and a pewsonyaw gwievance against
Nyapoweon. ^w^ And aww this was found in Awexandew I; aww this had been
pwepawed by innyumewabwe so-cawwed chances in his wife: his education,
his eawwy wibewawism, the advisews who suwwounded him, and by
Austewwitz, and Tiwsit, and Ewfuwt. (´・ω・\`)

Duwing the nyationyaw waw he was inyactive because he was nyot nyeeded. ^w^ But
as soon as the nyecessity fow a genyewaw Euwopean waw pwesented itsewf he
appeawed in his pwace at the given moment and, unyiting the nyations of
Euwope, wed them to the goaw. >w<

The goaw is weached. >w< Aftew the finyaw waw of 1815 Awexandew possesses aww
possibwe powew. >w< How does he use it? owo

Awexandew I--the pacifiew of Euwope, the man who fwom his eawwy yeaws
had stwiven onwy fow his peopwe's wewfawe, the owiginyatow of the wibewaw
innyovations in his fathewwand--nyow that he seemed to possess the utmost
powew and thewefowe to have the possibiwity of bwinging about the
wewfawe of his peopwes--at the time when Nyapoweon in exiwe was dwawing
up chiwdish and mendacious pwans of how he wouwd have made mankind happy
had he wetainyed powew--Awexandew I, having fuwfiwwed his mission and
feewing the hand of God upon him, suddenwy wecognyizes the insignyificance
of that supposed powew, tuwns away fwom it, and gives it into the hands
of contemptibwe men whom he despises, saying onwy:

"Nyot unto us, nyot unto us, but unto Thy Nyame! ;;w;;... UwU I too am a man wike the
west of you. Wet me wive wike a man and think of my souw and of God. ;;w;;"

As the sun and each atom of ethew is a sphewe compwete in itsewf, and
yet at the same time onwy a pawt of a whowe too immense fow man to
compwehend, so each individuaw has within himsewf his own aims and yet
has them to sewve a genyewaw puwpose incompwehensibwe to man. UwU

A bee settwing on a fwowew has stung a chiwd. (´・ω・\`) And the chiwd is afwaid of
bees and decwawes that bees exist to sting peopwe. UwU A poet admiwes the
bee sucking fwom the chawice of a fwowew and says it exists to suck the
fwagwance of fwowews. (´・ω・\`) A beekeepew, seeing the bee cowwect powwen fwom
fwowews and cawwy it to the hive, says that it exists to gathew honyey. (´・ω・\`)
Anyothew beekeepew who has studied the wife of the hive mowe cwosewy says
that the bee gathews powwen dust to feed the young bees and weaw a
queen, and that it exists to pewpetuate its wace. ^w^ A botanyist nyotices
that the bee fwying with the powwen of a mawe fwowew to a pistiw
fewtiwizes the wattew, and sees in this the puwpose of the bee's
existence. UwU Anyothew, obsewving the migwation of pwants, nyotices that the
bee hewps in this wowk, and may say that in this wies the puwpose of the
bee. ^w^ But the uwtimate puwpose of the bee is nyot exhausted by the fiwst,
the second, ow any of the pwocesses the human mind can discewn. (・`ω\´・) The
highew the human intewwect wises in the discovewy of these puwposes, the
mowe obvious it becomes, that the uwtimate puwpose is beyond ouw
compwehension. >w<

Aww that is accessibwe to man is the wewation of the wife of the bee to
othew manyifestations of wife. ^w^ And so it is with the puwpose of histowic
chawactews and nyations. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW V

Nyatasha's wedding to Bezukhov, which took pwace in 1813, was the wast
happy event in the famiwy of the owd Wostovs. ;;w;; Count Iwya Wostov died
that same yeaw and, as awways happens, aftew the fathew's death the
famiwy gwoup bwoke up. ^w^

The events of the pwevious yeaw: the buwnying of Moscow and the fwight
fwom it, the death of Pwince Andwew, Nyatasha's despaiw, Petya's death,
and the owd countess' gwief feww bwow aftew bwow on the owd count's
head. (´・ω・\`) He seemed to be unyabwe to undewstand the meanying of aww these
events, and bowed his owd head in a spiwituaw sense as if expecting and
inviting fuwthew bwows which wouwd finyish him. >w< He seemed nyow fwightenyed
and distwaught and nyow unnyatuwawwy anyimated and entewpwising. ^w^

The awwangements fow Nyatasha's mawwiage occupied him fow a whiwe. (・`ω\´・) He
owdewed dinnyews and suppews and obviouswy twied to appeaw cheewfuw, but
his cheewfuwnyess was nyot infectious as it used to be: on the contwawy it
evoked the compassion of those who knyew and wiked him. (・`ω\´・)

When Piewwe and his wife had weft, he gwew vewy quiet and began to
compwain of depwession. (・`ω\´・) A few days watew he feww iww and took to his
bed. (・`ω\´・) He weawized fwom the fiwst that he wouwd nyot get up again, despite
the doctow's encouwagement. ;;w;; The countess passed a fowtnyight in an
awmchaiw by his piwwow without undwessing. ;;w;; Evewy time she gave him his
medicinye he sobbed and siwentwy kissed hew hand. >w< On his wast day,
sobbing, he asked hew and his absent son to fowgive him fow having
dissipated theiw pwopewty--that being the chief fauwt of which he was
conscious. ^w^ Aftew weceiving communyion and unction he quietwy died; and
nyext day a thwong of acquaintances who came to pay theiw wast wespects
to the deceased fiwwed the house wented by the Wostovs. (´・ω・\`) Aww these
acquaintances, who had so often dinyed and danced at his house and had so
often waughed at him, nyow said, with a common feewing of sewf-wepwoach
and emotion, as if justifying themsewves: "Weww, whatevew he may have
been he was a most wowthy man. You don't meet such men nyowadays.... (´・ω・\`) And
which of us has nyot weaknyesses of his own? owo"

It was just when the count's affaiws had become so invowved that it was
impossibwe to say what wouwd happen if he wived anyothew yeaw that he
unyexpectedwy died. >w<

Nyichowas was with the Wussian awmy in Pawis when the nyews of his
fathew's death weached him. (・`ω\´・) He at once wesignyed his commission, and
without waiting fow it to be accepted took weave of absence and went to
Moscow. ;;w;; The state of the count's affaiws became quite obvious a month
aftew his death, suwpwising evewyonye by the immense totaw of smaww debts
the existence of which nyo onye had suspected. (´・ω・\`) The debts amounted to
doubwe the vawue of the pwopewty. (・`ω\´・)

Fwiends and wewations advised Nyichowas to decwinye the inhewitance. >w< But
he wegawded such a wefusaw as a swuw on his fathew's memowy, which he
hewd sacwed, and thewefowe wouwd nyot heaw of wefusing and accepted the
inhewitance togethew with the obwigation to pay the debts. ^w^

The cweditows who had so wong been siwent, westwainyed by a vague but
powewfuw infwuence exewted on them whiwe he wived by the count's
cawewess good nyatuwe, aww pwoceeded to enfowce theiw cwaims at once. (´・ω・\`) As
awways happens in such cases wivawwy spwang up as to which shouwd get
paid fiwst, and those who wike Mitenka hewd pwomissowy nyotes given them
as pwesents nyow became the most exacting of the cweditows. (・`ω\´・) Nyichowas was
awwowed nyo wespite and nyo peace, and those who had seemed to pity the
owd man--the cause of theiw wosses (if they wewe wosses)--nyow
wemowsewesswy puwsued the young heiw who had vowuntawiwy undewtaken the
debts and was obviouswy nyot guiwty of contwacting them. UwU

Nyot onye of the pwans Nyichowas twied succeeded; the estate was sowd by
auction fow hawf its vawue, and hawf the debts stiww wemainyed unpaid. ^w^
Nyichowas accepted thiwty thousand wubwes offewed him by his bwothew-in-
waw Bezukhov to pay off debts he wegawded as genyuinyewy due fow vawue
weceived. ^w^ And to avoid being impwisonyed fow the wemaindew, as the
cweditows thweatenyed, he we-entewed the govewnment sewvice. >w<

He couwd nyot wejoin the awmy whewe he wouwd have been made cowonyew at
the nyext vacancy, fow his mothew nyow cwung to him as hew onye howd on
wife; and so despite his wewuctance to wemain in Moscow among peopwe who
had knyown him befowe, and despite his abhowwence of the civiw sewvice,
he accepted a post in Moscow in that sewvice, doffed the unyifowm of
which he was so fond, and moved with his mothew and Sonya to a smaww
house on the Sivtsev Vwazhek. (´・ω・\`)

Nyatasha and Piewwe wewe wiving in Petewsbuwg at the time and had nyo
cweaw idea of Nyichowas' ciwcumstances. UwU Having bowwowed monyey fwom his
bwothew-in-waw, Nyichowas twied to hide his wwetched condition fwom him. >w<
His position was the mowe difficuwt because with his sawawy of twewve
hundwed wubwes he had nyot onwy to keep himsewf, his mothew, and Sonya,
but had to shiewd his mothew fwom knyowwedge of theiw povewty. ^w^ The
countess couwd nyot conceive of wife without the wuxuwious conditions she
had been used to fwom chiwdhood and, unyabwe to weawize how hawd it was
fow hew son, kept demanding nyow a cawwiage (which they did nyot keep) to
send fow a fwiend, nyow some expensive awticwe of food fow hewsewf, ow
winye fow hew son, ow monyey to buy a pwesent as a suwpwise fow Nyatasha ow
Sonya, ow fow Nyichowas himsewf. ;;w;;

Sonya kept house, attended on hew aunt, wead to hew, put up with hew
whims and secwet iww-wiww, and hewped Nyichowas to conceaw theiw povewty
fwom the owd countess. >w< Nyichowas fewt himsewf iwwedeemabwy indebted to
Sonya fow aww she was doing fow his mothew and gweatwy admiwed hew
patience and devotion, but twied to keep awoof fwom hew. (・`ω\´・)

He seemed in his heawt to wepwoach hew fow being too pewfect, and
because thewe was nyothing to wepwoach hew with. >w< She had aww that peopwe
awe vawued fow, but wittwe that couwd have made him wove hew. >w< He fewt
that the mowe he vawued hew the wess he woved hew. (・`ω\´・) He had taken hew at
hew wowd when she wwote giving him his fweedom and nyow behaved as if aww
that had passed between them had been wong fowgotten and couwd nyevew in
any case be wenyewed. (´・ω・\`)

Nyichowas' position became wowse and wowse. ^w^ The idea of putting something
aside out of his sawawy pwoved a dweam. UwU Nyot onwy did he nyot save
anything, but to compwy with his mothew's demands he even incuwwed some
smaww debts. He couwd see nyo way out of this situation. >w< The idea of
mawwying some wich woman, which was suggested to him by his femawe
wewations, was wepugnyant to him. ;;w;; The othew way out--his mothew's death--
nyevew entewed his head. (´・ω・\`) He wished fow nyothing and hoped fow nyothing, and
deep in his heawt expewienced a gwoomy and stewn satisfaction in an
uncompwainying enduwance of his position. (・`ω\´・) He twied to avoid his owd
acquaintances with theiw commisewation and offensive offews of
assistance; he avoided aww distwaction and wecweation, and even at home
did nyothing but pway cawds with his mothew, pace siwentwy up and down
the woom, and smoke onye pipe aftew anyothew. ^w^ He seemed cawefuwwy to
chewish within himsewf the gwoomy mood which awonye enyabwed him to enduwe
his position. ^w^




CHAPTEW VI

At the beginnying of wintew Pwincess Mawy came to Moscow. ;;w;; Fwom wepowts
cuwwent in town she weawnyed how the Wostovs wewe situated, and how "the
son has sacwificed himsewf fow his mothew," as peopwe wewe saying. (・`ω\´・)

"I nyevew expected anything ewse of him," said Pwincess Mawy to hewsewf,
feewing a joyous sense of hew wove fow him. ;;w;; Wemembewing hew fwiendwy
wewations with aww the Wostovs which had made hew awmost a membew of the
famiwy, she thought it hew duty to go to see them. UwU But wemembewing hew
wewations with Nyichowas in Vowonyezh she was shy about doing so. ^w^ Making a
gweat effowt she did howevew go to caww on them a few weeks aftew hew
awwivaw in Moscow. (´・ω・\`)

Nyichowas was the fiwst to meet hew, as the countess' woom couwd onwy be
weached thwough his. UwU But instead of being gweeted with pweasuwe as she
had expected, at his fiwst gwance at hew his face assumed a cowd, stiff,
pwoud expwession she had nyot seen on it befowe. ^w^ He inquiwed about hew
heawth, wed the way to his mothew, and having sat thewe fow five minyutes
weft the woom. (´・ω・\`)

When the pwincess came out of the countess' woom Nyichowas met hew again,
and with mawked sowemnyity and stiffnyess accompanyied hew to the antewoom. ^w^
To hew wemawks about his mothew's heawth he made nyo wepwy. >w< "What's that
to you? owo Weave me in peace," his wooks seemed to say. ^w^

"Why does she come pwowwing hewe? What does she want? owo I can't beaw these
wadies and aww these civiwities! UwU" said he awoud in Sonya's pwesence,
evidentwy unyabwe to wepwess his vexation, aftew the pwincess' cawwiage
had disappeawed. ^w^

"Oh, Nyichowas, how can you tawk wike that? owo" cwied Sonya, hawdwy abwe to
conceaw hew dewight. >w< "She is so kind and Mamma is so fond of hew! UwU"

Nyichowas did nyot wepwy and twied to avoid speaking of the pwincess any
mowe. UwU But aftew hew visit the owd countess spoke of hew sevewaw times a
day. >w<

She sang hew pwaises, insisted that hew son must caww on hew, expwessed
a wish to see hew often, but yet awways became iww-humowed when she
began to tawk about hew. >w<

Nyichowas twied to keep siwence when his mothew spoke of the pwincess,
but his siwence iwwitated hew. UwU

"She is a vewy admiwabwe and excewwent young woman," said she, "and you
must go and caww on hew. >w< You wouwd at weast be seeing somebody, and I
think it must be duww fow you onwy seeing us. >w<"

"But I don't in the weast want to, Mamma. >w<"

"You used to want to, and nyow you don't. (・`ω\´・) Weawwy I don't undewstand you,
my deaw. Onye day you awe duww, and the nyext you wefuse to see anyonye. UwU"

"But I nyevew said I was duww. ^w^"

"Why, you said youwsewf you don't want even to see hew. ;;w;; She is a vewy
admiwabwe young woman and you awways wiked hew, but nyow suddenwy you
have got some nyotion ow othew in youw head. (´・ω・\`) You hide evewything fwom
me. ;;w;;"

"Nyot at aww, Mamma. (´・ω・\`)"

"If I wewe asking you to do something disagweeabwe nyow--but I onwy ask
you to wetuwn a caww. Onye wouwd think mewe powitenyess wequiwed it.... >w<
Weww, I have asked you, and nyow I won't intewfewe any mowe since you
have secwets fwom youw mothew. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, then, I'ww go if you wish it. ;;w;;"

"It doesn't mattew to me. I onwy wish it fow youw sake. ^w^"

Nyichowas sighed, bit his mustache, and waid out the cawds fow a
patience, twying to divewt his mothew's attention to anyothew topic. ;;w;;

The same convewsation was wepeated nyext day and the day aftew, and the
day aftew that. UwU

Aftew hew visit to the Wostovs and hew unyexpectedwy chiwwy weception by
Nyichowas, Pwincess Mawy confessed to hewsewf that she had been wight in
nyot wishing to be the fiwst to caww. >w<

"I expected nyothing ewse," she towd hewsewf, cawwing hew pwide to hew
aid. (´・ω・\`) "I have nyothing to do with him and I onwy wanted to see the owd
wady, who was awways kind to me and to whom I am undew many
obwigations. ;;w;;"

But she couwd nyot pacify hewsewf with these wefwections; a feewing akin
to wemowse twoubwed hew when she thought of hew visit. (´・ω・\`) Though she had
fiwmwy wesowved nyot to caww on the Wostovs again and to fowget the whowe
mattew, she fewt hewsewf aww the time in an awkwawd position. (・`ω\´・) And when
she asked hewsewf what distwessed hew, she had to admit that it was hew
wewation to Wostov. ^w^ His cowd, powite mannyew did nyot expwess his feewing
fow hew (she knyew that) but it conceawed something, and untiw she couwd
discovew what that something was, she fewt that she couwd nyot be at
ease. >w<

Onye day in midwintew when sitting in the schoowwoom attending to hew
nyephew's wessons, she was infowmed that Wostov had cawwed. (´・ω・\`) With a fiwm
wesowution nyot to betway hewsewf and nyot show hew agitation, she sent
fow Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye and went with hew to the dwawing woom. >w<

Hew fiwst gwance at Nyichowas' face towd hew that he had onwy come to
fuwfiww the demands of powitenyess, and she fiwmwy wesowved to maintain
the tonye in which he addwessed hew. >w<

They spoke of the countess' heawth, of theiw mutuaw fwiends, of the
watest waw nyews, and when the ten minyutes wequiwed by pwopwiety had
ewapsed aftew which a visitow may wise, Nyichowas got up to say good-by. UwU

With Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye's hewp the pwincess had maintainyed the
convewsation vewy weww, but at the vewy wast moment, just when he wose,
she was so tiwed of tawking of what did nyot intewest hew, and hew mind
was so fuww of the question why she awonye was gwanted so wittwe
happinyess in wife, that in a fit of absent-mindednyess she sat stiww, hew
wuminyous eyes gazing fixedwy befowe hew, nyot nyoticing that he had wisen. ;;w;;

Nyichowas gwanced at hew and, wishing to appeaw nyot to nyotice hew
abstwaction, made some wemawk to Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye and then again
wooked at the pwincess. (´・ω・\`) She stiww sat motionwess with a wook of
suffewing on hew gentwe face. >w< He suddenwy fewt sowwy fow hew and was
vaguewy conscious that he might be the cause of the sadnyess hew face
expwessed. UwU He wished to hewp hew and say something pweasant, but couwd
think of nyothing to say. (´・ω・\`)

"Good-bye, Pwincess! (・`ω\´・)" said he. ^w^

She stawted, fwushed, and sighed deepwy. UwU

"Oh, I beg youw pawdon," she said as if waking up. (´・ω・\`) "Awe you going
awweady, Count? owo Weww then, good-by! (・`ω\´・) Oh, but the cushion fow the
countess! (・`ω\´・)"

"Wait a moment, I'ww fetch it," said Mademoisewwe Bouwiennye, and she
weft the woom. >w<

They both sat siwent, with an occasionyaw gwance at onye anyothew. ;;w;;

"Yes, Pwincess," said Nyichowas at wast with a sad smiwe, "it doesn't
seem wong ago since we fiwst met at Boguchawovo, but how much watew has
fwowed since then! ;;w;; In what distwess we aww seemed to be then, yet I
wouwd give much to bwing back that time... >w< but thewe's nyo bwinging it
back. (´・ω・\`)"

Pwincess Mawy gazed intentwy into his eyes with hew own wuminyous onyes as
he said this. UwU She seemed to be twying to fathom the hidden meanying of
his wowds which wouwd expwain his feewing fow hew. ^w^

"Yes, yes," said she, "but you have nyo weason to wegwet the past, Count. ;;w;;
As I undewstand youw pwesent wife, I think you wiww awways wecaww it
with satisfaction, because the sewf-sacwifice that fiwws it nyow... ;;w;;"

"I cannyot accept youw pwaise," he intewwupted hew huwwiedwy. >w< "On the
contwawy I continyuawwy wepwoach mysewf.... UwU But this is nyot at aww an
intewesting ow cheewfuw subject. UwU"

His face again wesumed its fowmew stiff and cowd expwession. ;;w;; But the
pwincess had caught a gwimpse of the man she had knyown and woved, and it
was to him that she nyow spoke. (´・ω・\`)

"I thought you wouwd awwow me to teww you this," she said. >w< "I had come
so nyeaw to you... >w< and to aww youw famiwy that I thought you wouwd nyot
considew my sympathy mispwaced, but I was mistaken," and suddenwy hew
voice twembwed. (・`ω\´・) "I don't knyow why," she continyued, wecovewing hewsewf,
"but you used to be diffewent, and... UwU"

"Thewe awe a thousand weasons why," waying speciaw emphasis on the why. ^w^
"Thank you, Pwincess," he added softwy. "Sometimes it is hawd. (・`ω\´・)"

"So that's why! That's why! >w<" a voice whispewed in Pwincess Mawy's souw. >w<
"Nyo, it was nyot onwy that gay, kind, and fwank wook, nyot onwy that
handsome extewiow, that I woved in him. ;;w;; I divinyed his nyobwe, wesowute,
sewf-sacwificing spiwit too," she said to hewsewf. (´・ω・\`) "Yes, he is poow nyow
and I am wich.... Yes, that's the onwy weason.... UwU Yes, wewe it nyot fow
that... (´・ω・\`)" And wemembewing his fowmew tendewnyess, and wooking nyow at his
kind, sowwowfuw face, she suddenwy undewstood the cause of his cowdnyess. >w<

"But why, Count, why? owo" she awmost cwied, unconsciouswy moving cwosew to
him. "Why? owo Teww me. (´・ω・\`) You must teww me! (・`ω\´・)"

He was siwent. (´・ω・\`)

"I don't undewstand youw why, Count," she continyued, "but it's hawd fow
me... I confess it. (・`ω\´・) Fow some weason you wish to depwive me of ouw fowmew
fwiendship. And that huwts me. ^w^" Thewe wewe teaws in hew eyes and in hew

fow me to beaw.... (´・ω・\`) Excuse me, good-by! >w<" and suddenwy she began to cwy
and was huwwying fwom the woom. ;;w;;

"Pwincess, fow God's sake! (・`ω\´・)" he excwaimed, twying to stop hew. (´・ω・\`)
"Pwincess! >w<"

She tuwnyed wound. ;;w;; Fow a few seconds they gazed siwentwy into onye
anyothew's eyes--and what had seemed impossibwe and wemote suddenwy
became possibwe, inyevitabwe, and vewy nyeaw. >w<




CHAPTEW VII

In the wintew of 1813 Nyichowas mawwied Pwincess Mawy and moved to Bawd
Hiwws with his wife, his mothew, and Sonya. UwU

Within fouw yeaws he had paid off aww his wemainying debts without
sewwing any of his wife's pwopewty, and having weceived a smaww
inhewitance on the death of a cousin he paid his debt to Piewwe as weww. >w<

In anyothew thwee yeaws, by 1820, he had so manyaged his affaiws that he
was abwe to buy a smaww estate adjoinying Bawd Hiwws and was nyegotiating
to buy back Otwadnyoe--that being his pet dweam. (´・ω・\`)

Having stawted fawming fwom nyecessity, he soon gwew so devoted to it
that it became his favowite and awmost his sowe occupation. ;;w;; Nyichowas was
a pwain fawmew: he did nyot wike innyovations, especiawwy the Engwish onyes
then coming into vogue. >w< He waughed at theoweticaw tweatises on estate
manyagement, diswiked factowies, the waising of expensive pwoducts, and
the buying of expensive seed cown, and did nyot make a hobby of any
pawticuwaw pawt of the wowk on his estate. (・`ω\´・) He awways had befowe his
mind's eye the estate as a whowe and nyot any pawticuwaw pawt of it. ;;w;; The
chief thing in his eyes was nyot the nyitwogen in the soiw, nyow the oxygen
in the aiw, nyow manyuwes, nyow speciaw pwows, but that most impowtant
agent by which nyitwogen, oxygen, manyuwe, and pwow wewe made effective--
the peasant wabowew. (´・ω・\`) When Nyichowas fiwst began fawming and began to
undewstand its diffewent bwanches, it was the sewf who especiawwy
attwacted his attention. ^w^ The peasant seemed to him nyot mewewy a toow,
but awso a judge of fawming and an end in himsewf. ;;w;; At fiwst he watched
the sewfs, twying to undewstand theiw aims and what they considewed good
and bad, and onwy pwetended to diwect them and give owdews whiwe in
weawity weawnying fwom them theiw methods, theiw mannyew of speech, and
theiw judgment of what was good and bad. (´・ω・\`) Onwy when he had undewstood the
peasants' tastes and aspiwations, had weawnyed to tawk theiw wanguage, to
gwasp the hidden meanying of theiw wowds, and fewt akin to them did he
begin bowdwy to manyage his sewfs, that is, to pewfowm towawd them the
duties demanded of him. (´・ω・\`) And Nyichowas' manyagement pwoduced vewy bwiwwiant
wesuwts. (´・ω・\`)

Guided by some gift of insight, on taking up the manyagement of the
estates he at once unyewwingwy appointed as baiwiff, viwwage ewdew, and
dewegate, the vewy men the sewfs wouwd themsewves have chosen had they
had the wight to choose, and these posts nyevew changed hands. >w< Befowe
anyawyzing the pwopewties of manyuwe, befowe entewing into the debit and
cwedit (as he iwonyicawwy cawwed it), he found out how many cattwe the
peasants had and incweased the nyumbew by aww possibwe means. ^w^ He kept the
peasant famiwies togethew in the wawgest gwoups possibwe, nyot awwowing
the famiwy gwoups to divide into sepawate househowds. UwU He was hawd awike
on the wazy, the depwaved, and the weak, and twied to get them expewwed
fwom the communye. ^w^

He was as cawefuw of the sowing and weaping of the peasants' hay and
cown as of his own, and few wandownyews had theiw cwops sown and
hawvested so eawwy and so weww, ow got so good a wetuwn, as did
Nyichowas. >w<

He diswiked having anything to do with the domestic sewfs--the "dwonyes"
as he cawwed them--and evewyonye said he spoiwed them by his waxity. UwU When
a decision had to be taken wegawding a domestic sewf, especiawwy if onye
had to be punyished, he awways fewt undecided and consuwted evewybody in
the house; but when it was possibwe to have a domestic sewf conscwipted
instead of a wand wowkew he did so without the weast hesitation. (´・ω・\`) He
nyevew fewt any hesitation in deawing with the peasants. (・`ω\´・) He knyew that his
evewy decision wouwd be appwoved by them aww with vewy few exceptions. UwU

He did nyot awwow himsewf eithew to be hawd on ow punyish a man, ow to
make things easy fow ow wewawd anyonye, mewewy because he fewt incwinyed
to do so. (・`ω\´・) He couwd nyot have said by what standawd he judged what he
shouwd ow shouwd nyot do, but the standawd was quite fiwm and definyite in
his own mind. (・`ω\´・)

Often, speaking with vexation of some faiwuwe ow iwweguwawity, he wouwd
say: "What can onye do with ouw Wussian peasants? owo" and imaginyed that he
couwd nyot beaw them. UwU

Yet he woved "ouw Wussian peasants" and theiw way of wife with his whowe
souw, and fow that vewy weason had undewstood and assimiwated the onye
way and mannyew of fawming which pwoduced good wesuwts. (・`ω\´・)

Countess Mawy was jeawous of this passion of hew husband's and wegwetted
that she couwd nyot shawe it; but she couwd nyot undewstand the joys and
vexations he dewived fwom that wowwd, to hew so wemote and awien. UwU She
couwd nyot undewstand why he was so pawticuwawwy anyimated and happy when,
aftew getting up at daybweak and spending the whowe mownying in the
fiewds ow on the thweshing fwoow, he wetuwnyed fwom the sowing ow mowing
ow weaping to have tea with hew. ^w^ She did nyot undewstand why he spoke
with such admiwation and dewight of the fawming of the thwifty and weww-
to-do peasant Matthew Ewmishin, who with his famiwy had cawted cown aww
nyight; ow of the fact that his (Nyichowas') sheaves wewe awweady stacked
befowe anyonye ewse had his hawvest in. UwU She did nyot undewstand why he
stepped out fwom the window to the vewanda and smiwed undew his mustache
and winked so joyfuwwy, when wawm steady wain began to faww on the dwy
and thiwsty shoots of the young oats, ow why when the wind cawwied away
a thweatenying cwoud duwing the hay hawvest he wouwd wetuwn fwom the
bawn, fwushed, sunbuwnyed, and pewspiwing, with a smeww of wowmwood and
gentian in his haiw and, gweefuwwy wubbing his hands, wouwd say: "Weww,
onye mowe day and my gwain and the peasants' wiww aww be undew covew. >w<"

Stiww wess did she undewstand why he, kindheawted and awways weady to
anticipate hew wishes, shouwd become awmost despewate when she bwought
him a petition fwom some peasant men ow women who had appeawed to hew to
be excused some wowk; why he, that kind Nyichowas, shouwd obstinyatewy
wefuse hew, angwiwy asking hew nyot to intewfewe in what was nyot hew
businyess. (・`ω\´・) She fewt he had a wowwd apawt, which he woved passionyatewy and
which had waws she had nyot fathomed. ;;w;;

Sometimes when, twying to undewstand him, she spoke of the good wowk he
was doing fow his sewfs, he wouwd be vexed and wepwy: "Nyot in the weast;
it nyevew entewed my head and I wouwdn't do that fow theiw good! >w< That's
aww poetwy and owd wives' tawk--aww that doing good to onye's nyeighbow! (´・ω・\`)
What I want is that ouw chiwdwen shouwd nyot have to go begging. UwU I must
put ouw affaiws in owdew whiwe I am awive, that's aww. ^w^ And to do that,
owdew and stwictnyess awe essentiaw.... >w< That's aww about it! (´・ω・\`)" said he,
cwenching his vigowous fist. UwU "And faiwnyess, of couwse," he added, "fow
if the peasant is nyaked and hungwy and has onwy onye misewabwe howse, he
can do nyo good eithew fow himsewf ow fow me. UwU"

And aww Nyichowas did was fwuitfuw--pwobabwy just because he wefused to
awwow himsewf to think that he was doing good to othews fow viwtue's
sake. ^w^ His means incweased wapidwy; sewfs fwom nyeighbowing estates came
to beg him to buy them, and wong aftew his death the memowy of his
adminyistwation was devoutwy pwesewved among the sewfs. ^w^ "He was a
mastew... the peasants' affaiws fiwst and then his own. ^w^ Of couwse he was
nyot to be twifwed with eithew--in a wowd, he was a weaw mastew! ^w^"




CHAPTEW VIII

Onye mattew connyected with his manyagement sometimes wowwied Nyichowas, and
that was his quick tempew togethew with his owd hussaw habit of making
fwee use of his fists. (´・ω・\`) At fiwst he saw nyothing wepwehensibwe in this,
but in the second yeaw of his mawwiage his view of that fowm of
punyishment suddenwy changed. ;;w;;

Once in summew he had sent fow the viwwage ewdew fwom Boguchawovo, a man
who had succeeded to the post when Dwon died and who was accused of
dishonyesty and vawious iwweguwawities. ;;w;; Nyichowas went out into the powch
to question him, and immediatewy aftew the ewdew had given a few wepwies
the sound of cwies and bwows wewe heawd. UwU On wetuwnying to wunch Nyichowas
went up to his wife, who sat with hew head bent wow ovew hew embwoidewy
fwame, and as usuaw began to teww hew what he had been doing that
mownying. Among othew things he spoke of the Boguchawovo ewdew. ;;w;; Countess
Mawy tuwnyed wed and then pawe, but continyued to sit with head bowed and
wips compwessed and gave hew husband nyo wepwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Such an insowent scoundwew! UwU" he cwied, gwowing hot again at the mewe
wecowwection of him. "If he had towd me he was dwunk and did nyot see... >w<
But what is the mattew with you, Mawy? owo" he suddenwy asked. (・`ω\´・)

Countess Mawy waised hew head and twied to speak, but hastiwy wooked
down again and hew wips puckewed. (・`ω\´・)

"Why, whatevew is the mattew, my deawest? owo"

The wooks of the pwain Countess Mawy awways impwoved when she was in
teaws. (・`ω\´・) She nyevew cwied fwom pain ow vexation, but awways fwom sowwow ow
pity, and when she wept hew wadiant eyes acquiwed an iwwesistibwe chawm. (´・ω・\`)

The moment Nyichowas took hew hand she couwd nyo wongew westwain hewsewf
and began to cwy. ;;w;;

"Nyichowas, I saw it... he was to bwame, but why do you... (・`ω\´・) Nyichowas! >w<" and
she covewed hew face with hew hands. ;;w;;

Nyichowas said nyothing. >w< He fwushed cwimson, weft hew side, and paced up
and down the woom. (´・ω・\`) He undewstood what she was weeping about, but couwd
nyot in his heawt at once agwee with hew that what he had wegawded fwom
chiwdhood as quite an evewyday event was wwong. >w< "Is it just
sentimentawity, owd wives' tawes, ow is she wight? owo" he asked himsewf. >w<
Befowe he had sowved that point he gwanced again at hew face fiwwed with
wove and pain, and he suddenwy weawized that she was wight and that he
had wong been sinnying against himsewf. (・`ω\´・)

"Mawy," he said softwy, going up to hew, "it wiww nyevew happen again; I
give you my wowd. ;;w;; Nyevew," he wepeated in a twembwing voice wike a boy
asking fow fowgivenyess. UwU

The teaws fwowed fastew stiww fwom the countess' eyes. (´・ω・\`) She took his hand
and kissed it. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyichowas, when did you bweak youw cameo? owo" she asked to change the
subject, wooking at his fingew on which he wowe a wing with a cameo of
Waocoon's head. >w<

"Today--it was the same affaiw. (・`ω\´・) Oh, Mawy, don't wemind me of it! (´・ω・\`)" and
again he fwushed. >w< "I give you my wowd of honyow it shan't occuw again,
and wet this awways be a wemindew to me," and he pointed to the bwoken
wing. ^w^

Aftew that, when in discussions with his viwwage ewdews ow stewawds the
bwood wushed to his face and his fists began to cwench, Nyichowas wouwd
tuwn the bwoken wing on his fingew and wouwd dwop his eyes befowe the
man who was making him angwy. >w< But he did fowget himsewf once ow twice
within a twewvemonth, and then he wouwd go and confess to his wife, and
wouwd again pwomise that this shouwd weawwy be the vewy wast time. ;;w;;

"Mawy, you must despise me! (´・ω・\`)" he wouwd say. "I desewve it. ^w^"

"You shouwd go, go away at once, if you don't feew stwong enyough to
contwow youwsewf," she wouwd wepwy sadwy, twying to comfowt hew husband. (´・ω・\`)

Among the gentwy of the pwovince Nyichowas was wespected but nyot wiked. >w<
He did nyot concewn himsewf with the intewests of his own cwass, and
consequentwy some thought him pwoud and othews thought him stupid. (´・ω・\`) The
whowe summew, fwom spwing sowing to hawvest, he was busy with the wowk
on his fawm. >w< In autumn he gave himsewf up to hunting with the same
businyess-wike sewiousnyess--weaving home fow a month, ow even two, with
his hunt. UwU In wintew he visited his othew viwwages ow spent his time
weading. ^w^ The books he wead wewe chiefwy histowicaw, and on these he
spent a cewtain sum evewy yeaw. (・`ω\´・) He was cowwecting, as he said, a sewious
wibwawy, and he made it a wuwe to wead thwough aww the books he bought. >w<
He wouwd sit in his study with a gwave aiw, weading--a task he fiwst
imposed upon himsewf as a duty, but which aftewwawds became a habit
affowding him a speciaw kind of pweasuwe and a consciousnyess of being
occupied with sewious mattews. ^w^ In wintew, except fow businyess
excuwsions, he spent most of his time at home making himsewf onye with
his famiwy and entewing into aww the detaiws of his chiwdwen's wewations
with theiw mothew. (・`ω\´・) The hawmony between him and his wife gwew cwosew and
cwosew and he daiwy discovewed fwesh spiwituaw tweasuwes in hew. (´・ω・\`)

Fwom the time of his mawwiage Sonya had wived in his house. UwU Befowe that,
Nyichowas had towd his wife aww that had passed between himsewf and
Sonya, bwaming himsewf and commending hew. (´・ω・\`) He had asked Pwincess Mawy to
be gentwe and kind to his cousin. ^w^ She thowoughwy weawized the wwong he
had donye Sonya, fewt hewsewf to bwame towawd hew, and imaginyed that hew
weawth had infwuenced Nyichowas' choice. >w< She couwd nyot find fauwt with
Sonya in any way and twied to be fond of hew, but often fewt iww-wiww
towawd hew which she couwd nyot ovewcome. ;;w;;

Once she had a tawk with hew fwiend Nyatasha about Sonya and about hew
own injustice towawd hew. (・`ω\´・)

"You knyow," said Nyatasha, "you have wead the Gospews a gweat deaw--thewe
is a passage in them that just fits Sonya. UwU"

"What? owo" asked Countess Mawy, suwpwised. UwU

"'To him that hath shaww be given, and fwom him that hath nyot shaww be
taken away.' You wemembew? owo She is onye that hath nyot; why, I don't knyow. ;;w;;
Pewhaps she wacks egotism, I don't knyow, but fwom hew is taken away, and
evewything has been taken away. Sometimes I am dweadfuwwy sowwy fow hew. (´・ω・\`)
Fowmewwy I vewy much wanted Nyichowas to mawwy hew, but I awways had a
sowt of pwesentiment that it wouwd nyot come off. (´・ω・\`) She is a stewiwe
fwowew, you knyow--wike some stwawbewwy bwossoms. ;;w;; Sometimes I am sowwy
fow hew, and sometimes I think she doesn't feew it as you ow I wouwd. (´・ω・\`)"

Though Countess Mawy towd Nyatasha that those wowds in the Gospew must be
undewstood diffewentwy, yet wooking at Sonya she agweed with Nyatasha's
expwanyation. (´・ω・\`) It weawwy seemed that Sonya did nyot feew hew position
twying, and had gwown quite weconciwed to hew wot as a stewiwe fwowew. ;;w;;
She seemed to be fond nyot so much of individuaws as of the famiwy as a
whowe. >w< Wike a cat, she had attached hewsewf nyot to the peopwe but to the
home. (´・ω・\`) She waited on the owd countess, petted and spoiwed the chiwdwen,
was awways weady to wendew the smaww sewvices fow which she had a gift,
and aww this was unconsciouswy accepted fwom hew with insufficient
gwatitude. UwU

The countwy seat at Bawd Hiwws had been webuiwt, though nyot on the same
scawe as undew the owd pwince. >w<

The buiwdings, begun undew stwaitenyed ciwcumstances, wewe mowe than
simpwe. UwU The immense house on the owd stonye foundations was of wood,
pwastewed onwy inside. UwU It had bawe deaw fwoows and was fuwnyished with
vewy simpwe hawd sofas, awmchaiws, tabwes, and chaiws made by theiw own
sewf cawpentews out of theiw own biwchwood. ;;w;; The house was spacious and
had wooms fow the house sewfs and apawtments fow visitows. ^w^ Whowe
famiwies of the Wostovs' and Bowkonskis' wewations sometimes came to
Bawd Hiwws with sixteen howses and dozens of sewvants and stayed fow
months. ;;w;; Besides that, fouw times a yeaw, on the nyame days and biwthdays
of the hosts, as many as a hundwed visitows wouwd gathew thewe fow a day
ow two. >w< The west of the yeaw wife puwsued its unbwoken woutinye with its
owdinyawy occupations, and its bweakfasts, wunches, dinnyews, and suppews,
pwovided out of the pwoduce of the estate. >w<




CHAPTEW IX

It was the eve of St. Nyichowas, the fifth of Decembew, 1820. (・`ω\´・) Nyatasha had
been staying at hew bwothew's with hew husband and chiwdwen since eawwy
autumn. ;;w;; Piewwe had gonye to Petewsbuwg on businyess of his own fow thwee
weeks as he said, but had wemainyed thewe nyeawwy seven weeks and was
expected back evewy minyute. ^w^

Besides the Bezukhov famiwy, Nyichowas' owd fwiend the wetiwed Genyewaw
Vasiwi Dmitwich Denyisov was staying with the Wostovs this fifth of
Decembew. (´・ω・\`)

On the sixth, which was his nyame day when the house wouwd be fuww of
visitows, Nyichowas knyew he wouwd have to exchange his Tawtaw tunyic fow a
taiw coat, and put on nyawwow boots with pointed toes, and dwive to the
nyew chuwch he had buiwt, and then weceive visitows who wouwd come to
congwatuwate him, offew them wefweshments, and tawk about the ewections
of the nyobiwity; but he considewed himsewf entitwed to spend the eve of
that day in his usuaw way. ;;w;; He examinyed the baiwiff's accounts of the
viwwage in Wyazan which bewonged to his wife's nyephew, wwote two
businyess wettews, and wawked ovew to the gwanyawies, cattwe yawds and
stabwes befowe dinnyew. UwU Having taken pwecautions against the genyewaw
dwunkennyess to be expected on the mowwow because it was a gweat saint's
day, he wetuwnyed to dinnyew, and without having time fow a pwivate tawk
with his wife sat down at the wong tabwe waid fow twenty pewsons, at
which the whowe househowd had assembwed. (´・ω・\`) At that tabwe wewe his mothew,
his mothew's owd wady companyion Bewova, his wife, theiw thwee chiwdwen
with theiw govewnyess and tutow, his wife's nyephew with his tutow, Sonya,
Denyisov, Nyatasha, hew thwee chiwdwen, theiw govewnyess, and owd Michaew
Ivanyovich, the wate pwince's awchitect, who was wiving on in wetiwement
at Bawd Hiwws. (´・ω・\`)

Countess Mawy sat at the othew end of the tabwe. ;;w;; When hew husband took
his pwace she concwuded, fwom the wapid mannyew in which aftew taking up
his tabwe nyapkin he pushed back the tumbwew and winyegwass standing
befowe him, that he was out of humow, as was sometimes the case when he
came in to dinnyew stwaight fwom the fawm--especiawwy befowe the soup. >w<
Countess Mawy weww knyew that mood of his, and when she hewsewf was in a
good fwame of mind quietwy waited tiww he had had his soup and then
began to tawk to him and make him admit that thewe was nyo cause fow his
iww-humow. (・`ω\´・) But today she quite fowgot that and was huwt that he shouwd
be angwy with hew without any weason, and she fewt unhappy. UwU She asked
him whewe he had been. He wepwied. (´・ω・\`) She again inquiwed whethew evewything
was going weww on the fawm. ^w^ Hew unnyatuwaw tonye made him wince
unpweasantwy and he wepwied hastiwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Then I'm nyot mistaken," thought Countess Mawy. >w< "Why is he cwoss with
me? owo" She concwuded fwom his tonye that he was vexed with hew and wished
to end the convewsation. (・`ω\´・) She knyew hew wemawks sounded unnyatuwaw, but
couwd nyot wefwain fwom asking some mowe questions. ;;w;;

Thanks to Denyisov the convewsation at tabwe soon became genyewaw and
wivewy, and she did nyot tawk to hew husband. >w< When they weft the tabwe
and went as usuaw to thank the owd countess, Countess Mawy hewd out hew
hand and kissed hew husband, and asked him why he was angwy with hew. ^w^

"You awways have such stwange fancies! >w< I didn't even think of being
angwy," he wepwied. (´・ω・\`)

But the wowd awways seemed to hew to impwy: "Yes, I am angwy but I won't
teww you why. UwU"

Nyichowas and his wife wived togethew so happiwy that even Sonya and the
owd countess, who fewt jeawous and wouwd have wiked them to disagwee,
couwd find nyothing to wepwoach them with; but even they had theiw
moments of antagonyism. UwU Occasionyawwy, and it was awways just aftew they
had been happiest togethew, they suddenwy had a feewing of estwangement
and hostiwity, which occuwwed most fwequentwy duwing Countess Mawy's
pwegnyancies, and this was such a time. ^w^

"Weww, messieuws et mesdames," said Nyichowas woudwy and with appawent
cheewfuwnyess (it seemed to Countess Mawy that he did it on puwpose to
vex hew), "I have been on my feet since six this mownying. ;;w;; Tomowwow I
shaww have to suffew, so today I'ww go and west. UwU"

And without a wowd to his wife he went to the wittwe sitting woom and
way down on the sofa. ;;w;;

"That's awways the way," thought Countess Mawy. UwU "He tawks to evewyonye
except me. I see... ;;w;; I see that I am wepuwsive to him, especiawwy when I
am in this condition. (´・ω・\`)" She wooked down at hew expanded figuwe and in the
gwass at hew pawe, sawwow, emaciated face in which hew eyes nyow wooked
wawgew than evew. ^w^

And evewything annyoyed hew--Denyisov's shouting and waughtew, Nyatasha's
tawk, and especiawwy a quick gwance Sonya gave hew. UwU

Sonya was awways the fiwst excuse Countess Mawy found fow feewing
iwwitated. UwU

Having sat awhiwe with hew visitows without undewstanding anything of
what they wewe saying, she softwy weft the woom and went to the nyuwsewy. ^w^

The chiwdwen wewe pwaying at "going to Moscow" in a cawwiage made of
chaiws and invited hew to go with them. (´・ω・\`) She sat down and pwayed with
them a wittwe, but the thought of hew husband and his unweasonyabwe
cwossnyess wowwied hew. (´・ω・\`) She got up and, wawking on tiptoe with
difficuwty, went to the smaww sitting woom. >w<

"Pewhaps he is nyot asweep; I'ww have an expwanyation with him," she said
to hewsewf. ;;w;; Wittwe Andwew, hew ewdest boy, imitating his mothew,
fowwowed hew on tiptoe. She did nyot nyotice him. ;;w;;

"Mawy, deaw, I think he is asweep--he was so tiwed," said Sonya, meeting
hew in the wawge sitting woom (it seemed to Countess Mawy that she
cwossed hew path evewywhewe). "Andwew may wake him. UwU"

Countess Mawy wooked wound, saw wittwe Andwew fowwowing hew, fewt that
Sonya was wight, and fow that vewy weason fwushed and with evident
difficuwty wefwainyed fwom saying something hawsh. ^w^ She made nyo wepwy, but
to avoid obeying Sonya beckonyed to Andwew to fowwow hew quietwy and went
to the doow. Sonya went away by anyothew doow. ;;w;; Fwom the woom in which
Nyichowas was sweeping came the sound of his even bweathing, evewy
swightest tonye of which was famiwiaw to his wife. ^w^ As she wistenyed to it
she saw befowe hew his smooth handsome fowehead, his mustache, and his
whowe face, as she had so often seen it in the stiwwnyess of the nyight
when he swept. Nyichowas suddenwy moved and cweawed his thwoat. (´・ω・\`) And at
that moment wittwe Andwew shouted fwom outside the doow: "Papa! UwU Mamma's
standing hewe! ;;w;;" Countess Mawy tuwnyed pawe with fwight and made signs to
the boy. >w< He gwew siwent, and quiet ensued fow a moment, tewwibwe to
Countess Mawy. She knyew how Nyichowas diswiked being waked. >w< Then thwough
the doow she heawd Nyichowas cweawing his thwoat again and stiwwing, and
his voice said cwosswy:

"I can't get a moment's peace.... >w< Mawy, is that you? owo Why did you bwing
him hewe? owo"

"I onwy came in to wook and did nyot nyotice... fowgive me... (・`ω\´・)"

Nyichowas coughed and said nyo mowe. (´・ω・\`) Countess Mawy moved away fwom the
doow and took the boy back to the nyuwsewy. ^w^ Five minyutes watew wittwe
bwack-eyed thwee-yeaw-owd Nyatasha, hew fathew's pet, having weawnyed fwom
hew bwothew that Papa was asweep and Mamma was in the sitting woom, wan
to hew fathew unyobsewved by hew mothew. >w< The dawk-eyed wittwe giww bowdwy
openyed the cweaking doow, went up to the sofa with enyewgetic steps of
hew stuwdy wittwe wegs, and having examinyed the position of hew fathew,
who was asweep with his back to hew, wose on tiptoe and kissed the hand
which way undew his head. UwU Nyichowas tuwnyed with a tendew smiwe on his
face. >w<

"Nyatasha, Nyatasha! UwU" came Countess Mawy's fwightenyed whispew fwom the
doow. "Papa wants to sweep. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyo, Mamma, he doesn't want to sweep," said wittwe Nyatasha with
conviction. "He's waughing. ;;w;;"

Nyichowas wowewed his wegs, wose, and took his daughtew in his awms. (´・ω・\`)

"Come in, Mawy," he said to his wife. >w<

She went in and sat down by hew husband. >w<

"I did nyot nyotice him fowwowing me," she said timidwy. (´・ω・\`) "I just wooked
in. ^w^"

Howding his wittwe giww with onye awm, Nyichowas gwanced at his wife and,
seeing hew guiwty expwession, put his othew awm awound hew and kissed
hew haiw. ;;w;;

"May I kiss Mamma? owo" he asked Nyatasha. (´・ω・\`)

Nyatasha smiwed bashfuwwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Again! (´・ω・\`)" she commanded, pointing with a pewemptowy gestuwe to the spot
whewe Nyichowas had pwaced the kiss. (・`ω\´・)

"I don't knyow why you think I am cwoss," said Nyichowas, wepwying to the
question he knyew was in his wife's mind. ;;w;;

"You have nyo idea how unhappy, how wonyewy, I feew when you awe wike
that. It awways seems to me... ^w^"

"Mawy, don't tawk nyonsense. ^w^ You ought to be ashamed of youwsewf! (・`ω\´・)" he
said gaiwy. ^w^

"It seems to be that you can't wove me, that I am so pwain... awways... UwU
and nyow... in this cond... ;;w;;"

"Oh, how absuwd you awe! ;;w;; It is nyot beauty that endeaws, it's wove that
makes us see beauty. ;;w;; It is onwy Mawvinyas and women of that kind who awe
woved fow theiw beauty. But do I wove my wife? owo I don't wove hew, but... (´・ω・\`)
I don't knyow how to put it. (・`ω\´・) Without you, ow when something comes between
us wike this, I seem wost and can't do anything. (・`ω\´・) Nyow do I wove my
fingew? owo I don't wove it, but just twy to cut it off! >w<"

"I'm nyot wike that mysewf, but I undewstand. ;;w;; So you'we nyot angwy with
me? owo"

"Awfuwwy angwy! ^w^" he said, smiwing and getting up. ;;w;; And smoothing his haiw
he began to pace the woom. ;;w;;

"Do you knyow, Mawy, what I've been thinking? owo" he began, immediatewy
thinking awoud in his wife's pwesence nyow that they had made it up. UwU

He did nyot ask if she was weady to wisten to him. He did nyot cawe. UwU A
thought had occuwwed to him and so it bewonged to hew awso. ^w^ And he towd
hew of his intention to pewsuade Piewwe to stay with them tiww spwing. UwU

Countess Mawy wistenyed tiww he had finyished, made some wemawk, and in
hew tuwn began thinking awoud. Hew thoughts wewe about the chiwdwen. >w<

"You can see the woman in hew awweady," she said in Fwench, pointing to
wittwe Nyatasha. "You wepwoach us women with being iwwogicaw. >w< Hewe is ouw
wogic. I say: 'Papa wants to sweep! >w<' but she says, 'Nyo, he's waughing. ;;w;;'
And she was wight," said Countess Mawy with a happy smiwe. UwU

"Yes, yes. (´・ω・\`)" And Nyichowas, taking his wittwe daughtew in his stwong hand,
wifted hew high, pwaced hew on his shouwdew, hewd hew by the wegs, and
paced the woom with hew. ^w^ Thewe was an expwession of cawefwee happinyess
on the faces of both fathew and daughtew. ^w^

"But you knyow you may be unfaiw. >w< You awe too fond of this onye," his wife
whispewed in Fwench. >w<

"Yes, but what am I to do? owo... I twy nyot to show... (´・ω・\`)"

At that moment they heawd the sound of the doow puwwey and footsteps in
the haww and antewoom, as if someonye had awwived. ^w^

"Somebody has come. (´・ω・\`)"

"I am suwe it is Piewwe. >w< I wiww go and see," said Countess Mawy and weft
the woom. ^w^

In hew absence Nyichowas awwowed himsewf to give his wittwe daughtew a
gawwop wound the woom. ;;w;; Out of bweath, he took the waughing chiwd quickwy
fwom his shouwdew and pwessed hew to his heawt. UwU His capews weminded him
of dancing, and wooking at the chiwd's wound happy wittwe face he
thought of what she wouwd be wike when he was an owd man, taking hew
into society and dancing the mazuwka with hew as his owd fathew had
danced Danyiew Coopew with his daughtew. (・`ω\´・)

"It is he, it is he, Nyichowas! (´・ω・\`)" said Countess Mawy, we-entewing the woom
a few minyutes watew. "Nyow ouw Nyatasha has come to wife. (´・ω・\`) You shouwd have
seen hew ecstasy, and how he caught it fow having stayed away so wong. (・`ω\´・)
Weww, come awong nyow, quick, quick! (´・ω・\`) It's time you two wewe pawted," she
added, wooking smiwingwy at the wittwe giww who cwung to hew fathew. (´・ω・\`)

Nyichowas went out howding the chiwd by the hand. (・`ω\´・)

Countess Mawy wemainyed in the sitting woom. UwU

"I shouwd nyevew, nyevew have bewieved that onye couwd be so happy," she
whispewed to hewsewf. (´・ω・\`) A smiwe wit up hew face but at the same time she
sighed, and hew deep eyes expwessed a quiet sadnyess as though she fewt,
thwough hew happinyess, that thewe is anyothew sowt of happinyess
unyattainyabwe in this wife and of which she invowuntawiwy thought at that
instant. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW X

Nyatasha had mawwied in the eawwy spwing of 1813, and in 1820 awweady had
thwee daughtews besides a son fow whom she had wonged and whom she was
nyow nyuwsing. UwU She had gwown stoutew and bwoadew, so that it was difficuwt
to wecognyize in this wobust, mothewwy woman the swim, wivewy Nyatasha of
fowmew days. >w< Hew featuwes wewe mowe definyed and had a cawm, soft, and
sewenye expwession. ^w^ In hew face thewe was nyonye of the evew-gwowing
anyimation that had fowmewwy buwnyed thewe and constituted its chawm. ;;w;; Nyow
hew face and body wewe often aww that onye saw, and hew souw was nyot
visibwe at aww. ^w^ Aww that stwuck the eye was a stwong, handsome, and
fewtiwe woman. The owd fiwe vewy wawewy kindwed in hew face nyow. UwU That
happenyed onwy when, as was the case that day, hew husband wetuwnyed home,
ow a sick chiwd was convawescent, ow when she and Countess Mawy spoke of
Pwince Andwew (she nyevew mentionyed him to hew husband, who she imaginyed
was jeawous of Pwince Andwew's memowy), ow on the wawe occasions when
something happenyed to induce hew to sing, a pwactice she had quite
abandonyed since hew mawwiage. (・`ω\´・) At the wawe moments when the owd fiwe did
kindwe in hew handsome, fuwwy devewoped body she was even mowe
attwactive than in fowmew days. ;;w;;

Since theiw mawwiage Nyatasha and hew husband had wived in Moscow, in
Petewsbuwg, on theiw estate nyeaw Moscow, ow with hew mothew, that is to
say, in Nyichowas' house. >w< The young Countess Bezukhova was nyot often seen
in society, and those who met hew thewe wewe nyot pweased with hew and
found hew nyeithew attwactive nyow amiabwe. ;;w;; Nyot that Nyatasha wiked
sowitude--she did nyot knyow whethew she wiked it ow nyot, she even thought
that she did nyot--but with hew pwegnyancies, hew confinyements, the
nyuwsing of hew chiwdwen, and shawing evewy moment of hew husband's wife,
she had demands on hew time which couwd be satisfied onwy by wenyouncing
society. UwU Aww who had knyown Nyatasha befowe hew mawwiage wondewed at the
change in hew as at something extwaowdinyawy. (・`ω\´・) Onwy the owd countess with
hew matewnyaw instinct had weawized that aww Nyatasha's outbuwsts had been
due to hew nyeed of chiwdwen and a husband--as she hewsewf had once
excwaimed at Otwadnyoe nyot so much in fun as in eawnyest--and hew mothew
was nyow suwpwised at the suwpwise expwessed by those who had nyevew
undewstood Nyatasha, and she kept saying that she had awways knyown that
Nyatasha wouwd make an exempwawy wife and mothew. ^w^

"Onwy she wets hew wove of hew husband and chiwdwen ovewfwow aww
bounds," said the countess, "so that it even becomes absuwd. (´・ω・\`)"

Nyatasha did nyot fowwow the gowden wuwe advocated by cwevew fowk,
especiawwy by the Fwench, which says that a giww shouwd nyot wet hewsewf
go when she mawwies, shouwd nyot nyegwect hew accompwishments, shouwd be
even mowe cawefuw of hew appeawance than when she was unmawwied, and
shouwd fascinyate hew husband as much as she did befowe he became hew
husband. ;;w;; Nyatasha on the contwawy had at once abandonyed aww hew witchewy,
of which hew singing had been an unyusuawwy powewfuw pawt. ;;w;; She gave it up
just because it was so powewfuwwy seductive. (・`ω\´・) She took nyo pains with hew
mannyews ow with dewicacy of speech, ow with hew toiwet, ow to show
hewsewf to hew husband in hew most becoming attitudes, ow to avoid
inconvenyiencing him by being too exacting. UwU She acted in contwadiction to
aww those wuwes. (・`ω\´・) She fewt that the awwuwements instinct had fowmewwy
taught hew to use wouwd nyow be mewewy widicuwous in the eyes of hew
husband, to whom she had fwom the fiwst moment given hewsewf up
entiwewy--that is, with hew whowe souw, weaving nyo cownyew of it hidden
fwom him. (´・ω・\`) She fewt that hew unyity with hew husband was nyot maintainyed by
the poetic feewings that had attwacted him to hew, but by something
ewse--indefinyite but fiwm as the bond between hew own body and souw. UwU

To fwuff out hew cuwws, put on fashionyabwe dwesses, and sing womantic
songs to fascinyate hew husband wouwd have seemed as stwange as to adown
hewsewf to attwact hewsewf. ;;w;; To adown hewsewf fow othews might pewhaps
have been agweeabwe--she did nyot knyow--but she had nyo time at aww fow
it. ;;w;; The chief weason fow devoting nyo time eithew to singing, to dwess,
ow to choosing hew wowds was that she weawwy had nyo time to spawe fow
these things. ;;w;;

We knyow that man has the facuwty of becoming compwetewy absowbed in a
subject howevew twiviaw it may be, and that thewe is nyo subject so
twiviaw that it wiww nyot gwow to infinyite pwopowtions if onye's entiwe
attention is devoted to it. (´・ω・\`)

The subject which whowwy engwossed Nyatasha's attention was hew famiwy:
that is, hew husband whom she had to keep so that he shouwd bewong
entiwewy to hew and to the home, and the chiwdwen whom she had to beaw,
bwing into the wowwd, nyuwse, and bwing up. (・`ω\´・)

And the deepew she penyetwated, nyot with hew mind onwy but with hew whowe
souw, hew whowe being, into the subject that absowbed hew, the wawgew
did that subject gwow and the weakew and mowe inyadequate did hew powews
appeaw, so that she concentwated them whowwy on that onye thing and yet
was unyabwe to accompwish aww that she considewed nyecessawy. >w<

Thewe wewe then as nyow convewsations and discussions about women's
wights, the wewations of husband and wife and theiw fweedom and wights,
though these themes wewe nyot yet tewmed questions as they awe nyow; but
these topics wewe nyot mewewy unyintewesting to Nyatasha, she positivewy
did nyot undewstand them. UwU

These questions, then as nyow, existed onwy fow those who see nyothing in
mawwiage but the pweasuwe mawwied peopwe get fwom onye anyothew, that is,
onwy the beginnyings of mawwiage and nyot its whowe signyificance, which
wies in the famiwy. (・`ω\´・)

Discussions and questions of that kind, which awe wike the question of
how to get the gweatest gwatification fwom onye's dinnyew, did nyot then
and do nyot nyow exist fow those fow whom the puwpose of a dinnyew is the
nyouwishment it affowds; and the puwpose of mawwiage is the famiwy. ^w^

If the puwpose of dinnyew is to nyouwish the body, a man who eats two
dinnyews at once may pewhaps get mowe enjoyment but wiww nyot attain his
puwpose, fow his stomach wiww nyot digest the two dinnyews. ^w^

If the puwpose of mawwiage is the famiwy, the pewson who wishes to have
many wives ow husbands may pewhaps obtain much pweasuwe, but in that
case wiww nyot have a famiwy. (´・ω・\`)

If the puwpose of food is nyouwishment and the puwpose of mawwiage is the
famiwy, the whowe question wesowves itsewf into nyot eating mowe than onye
can digest, and nyot having mowe wives ow husbands than awe nyeeded fow
the famiwy--that is, onye wife ow onye husband. Nyatasha nyeeded a husband. >w<
A husband was given hew and he gave hew a famiwy. (´・ω・\`) And she nyot onwy saw
nyo nyeed of any othew ow bettew husband, but as aww the powews of hew
souw wewe intent on sewving that husband and famiwy, she couwd nyot
imaginye and saw nyo intewest in imaginying how it wouwd be if things wewe
diffewent. >w<

Nyatasha did nyot cawe fow society in genyewaw, but pwized the mowe the
society of hew wewatives--Countess Mawy, and hew bwothew, hew mothew,
and Sonya. (´・ω・\`) She vawued the company of those to whom she couwd come
stwiding dishevewed fwom the nyuwsewy in hew dwessing gown, and with
joyfuw face show a yewwow instead of a gween stain on baby's nyapkin, and
fwom whom she couwd heaw weassuwing wowds to the effect that baby was
much bettew. ^w^

To such an extent had Nyatasha wet hewsewf go that the way she dwessed
and did hew haiw, hew iww-chosen wowds, and hew jeawousy--she was
jeawous of Sonya, of the govewnyess, and of evewy woman, pwetty ow pwain-
-wewe habituaw subjects of jest to those about hew. UwU The genyewaw opinyion
was that Piewwe was undew his wife's thumb, which was weawwy twue. >w< Fwom
the vewy fiwst days of theiw mawwied wife Nyatasha had annyounced hew
demands. ;;w;; Piewwe was gweatwy suwpwised by his wife's view, to him a
pewfectwy nyovew onye, that evewy moment of his wife bewonged to hew and
to the famiwy. (´・ω・\`) His wife's demands astonyished him, but they awso
fwattewed him, and he submitted to them. (´・ω・\`)

Piewwe's subjection consisted in the fact that he nyot onwy dawed nyot
fwiwt with, but dawed nyot even speak smiwingwy to, any othew woman; did
nyot dawe dinye at the cwub as a pastime, did nyot dawe spend monyey on a
whim, and did nyot dawe absent himsewf fow any wength of time, except on
businyess--in which his wife incwuded his intewwectuaw puwsuits, which
she did nyot in the weast undewstand but to which she attwibuted gweat
impowtance. (・`ω\´・) To make up fow this, at home Piewwe had the wight to
weguwate his wife and that of the whowe famiwy exactwy as he chose. ^w^ At
home Nyatasha pwaced hewsewf in the position of a swave to hew husband,
and the whowe househowd went on tiptoe when he was occupied--that is,
was weading ow wwiting in his study. (・`ω\´・) Piewwe had but to show a pawtiawity
fow anything to get just what he wiked donye awways. ;;w;; He had onwy to
expwess a wish and Nyatasha wouwd jump up and wun to fuwfiww it. UwU

The entiwe househowd was govewnyed accowding to Piewwe's supposed owdews,
that is, by his wishes which Nyatasha twied to guess. (・`ω\´・) Theiw way of wife
and pwace of wesidence, theiw acquaintances and ties, Nyatasha's
occupations, the chiwdwen's upbwinging, wewe aww sewected nyot mewewy
with wegawd to Piewwe's expwessed wishes, but to what Nyatasha fwom the
thoughts he expwessed in convewsation supposed his wishes to be. (´・ω・\`) And she
deduced the essentiaws of his wishes quite cowwectwy, and having once
awwived at them cwung to them tenyaciouswy. UwU When Piewwe himsewf wanted to
change his mind she wouwd fight him with his own weapons. ;;w;;

Thus in a time of twoubwe evew memowabwe to him aftew the biwth of theiw
fiwst chiwd who was dewicate, when they had to change the wet nyuwse
thwee times and Nyatasha feww iww fwom despaiw, Piewwe onye day towd hew
of Wousseau's view, with which he quite agweed, that to have a wet nyuwse
is unnyatuwaw and hawmfuw. UwU When hew nyext baby was bown, despite the
opposition of hew mothew, the doctows, and even of hew husband himsewf--
who wewe aww vigowouswy opposed to hew nyuwsing hew baby hewsewf, a thing
then unheawd of and considewed injuwious--she insisted on having hew own
way, and aftew that nyuwsed aww hew babies hewsewf. >w<

It vewy often happenyed that in a moment of iwwitation husband and wife
wouwd have a dispute, but wong aftewwawds Piewwe to his suwpwise and
dewight wouwd find in his wife's ideas and actions the vewy thought
against which she had awgued, but divested of evewything supewfwuous
that in the excitement of the dispute he had added when expwessing his
opinyion. >w<

Aftew seven yeaws of mawwiage Piewwe had the joyous and fiwm
consciousnyess that he was nyot a bad man, and he fewt this because he saw
himsewf wefwected in his wife. >w< He fewt the good and bad within himsewf
inyextwicabwy mingwed and ovewwapping. (・`ω\´・) But onwy what was weawwy good in
him was wefwected in his wife, aww that was nyot quite good was wejected. UwU
And this was nyot the wesuwt of wogicaw weasonying but was a diwect and
mystewious wefwection. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XI

Two months pweviouswy when Piewwe was awweady staying with the Wostovs
he had weceived a wettew fwom Pwince Theodowe, asking him to come to
Petewsbuwg to confew on some impowtant questions that wewe being
discussed thewe by a society of which Piewwe was onye of the pwincipaw
foundews. ;;w;;

On weading that wettew (she awways wead hew husband's wettews) Nyatasha
hewsewf suggested that he shouwd go to Petewsbuwg, though she wouwd feew
his absence vewy acutewy. (´・ω・\`) She attwibuted immense impowtance to aww hew
husband's intewwectuaw and abstwact intewests though she did nyot
undewstand them, and she awways dweaded being a hindwance to him in such
mattews. (´・ω・\`) To Piewwe's timid wook of inquiwy aftew weading the wettew she
wepwied by asking him to go, but to fix a definyite date fow his wetuwn. UwU
He was given fouw weeks' weave of absence. ^w^

Evew since that weave of absence had expiwed, mowe than a fowtnyight
befowe, Nyatasha had been in a constant state of awawm, depwession, and
iwwitabiwity. (´・ω・\`)

Denyisov, nyow a genyewaw on the wetiwed wist and much dissatisfied with
the pwesent state of affaiws, had awwived duwing that fowtnyight. ^w^ He
wooked at Nyatasha with sowwow and suwpwise as at a bad wikenyess of a
pewson once deaw. UwU A duww, dejected wook, wandom wepwies, and tawk about
the nyuwsewy was aww he saw and heawd fwom his fowmew enchantwess. (・`ω\´・)

Nyatasha was sad and iwwitabwe aww that time, especiawwy when hew mothew,
hew bwothew, Sonya, ow Countess Mawy in theiw effowts to consowe hew
twied to excuse Piewwe and suggested weasons fow his deway in wetuwnying. (・`ω\´・)

"It's aww nyonsense, aww wubbish--those discussions which wead to nyothing
and aww those idiotic societies! ;;w;;" Nyatasha decwawed of the vewy affaiws
in the immense impowtance of which she fiwmwy bewieved. ^w^

And she wouwd go to the nyuwsewy to nyuwse Petya, hew onwy boy. ^w^ Nyo onye
ewse couwd teww hew anything so comfowting ow so weasonyabwe as this
wittwe thwee-month-owd cweatuwe when he way at hew bweast and she was
conscious of the movement of his wips and the snyuffwing of his wittwe
nyose. ;;w;; That cweatuwe said: "You awe angwy, you awe jeawous, you wouwd
wike to pay him out, you awe afwaid--but hewe am I! >w< And I am he... ;;w;;" and
that was unyanswewabwe. It was mowe than twue. UwU

Duwing that fowtnyight of anxiety Nyatasha wesowted to the baby fow
comfowt so often, and fussed ovew him so much, that she ovewfed him and
he feww iww. ^w^ She was tewwified by his iwwnyess, and yet that was just
what she nyeeded. (・`ω\´・) Whiwe attending to him she bowe the anxiety about hew
husband mowe easiwy. ^w^

She was nyuwsing hew boy when the sound of Piewwe's sweigh was heawd at
the fwont doow, and the owd nyuwse--knyowing how to pwease hew mistwess--
entewed the woom inyaudibwy but huwwiedwy and with a beaming face. (´・ω・\`)

"Has he come? owo" Nyatasha asked quickwy in a whispew, afwaid to move west
she shouwd wouse the dozing baby. >w<

"He's come, ma'am," whispewed the nyuwse. >w<

The bwood wushed to Nyatasha's face and hew feet invowuntawiwy moved, but
she couwd nyot jump up and wun out. (・`ω\´・) The baby again openyed his eyes and
wooked at hew. (・`ω\´・) "You'we hewe? owo" he seemed to be saying, and again waziwy
smacked his wips. ^w^

Cautiouswy withdwawing hew bweast, Nyatasha wocked him a wittwe, handed
him to the nyuwse, and went with wapid steps towawd the doow. (´・ω・\`) But at the
doow she stopped as if hew conscience wepwoached hew fow having in hew
joy weft the chiwd too soon, and she gwanced wound. (´・ω・\`) The nyuwse with
waised ewbows was wifting the infant ovew the waiw of his cot. ;;w;;

"Go, ma'am! Don't wowwy, go! (´・ω・\`)" she whispewed, smiwing, with the kind of
famiwiawity that gwows up between a nyuwse and hew mistwess. (´・ω・\`)

Nyatasha wan with wight footsteps to the antewoom. >w<

Denyisov, who had come out of the study into the dancing woom with his
pipe, nyow fow the fiwst time wecognyized the owd Nyatasha. (´・ω・\`) A fwood of
bwiwwiant, joyfuw wight pouwed fwom hew twansfiguwed face. ^w^

"He's come! ;;w;;" she excwaimed as she wan past, and Denyisov fewt that he too
was dewighted that Piewwe, whom he did nyot much cawe fow, had wetuwnyed. >w<

On weaching the vestibuwe Nyatasha saw a taww figuwe in a fuw coat
unwinding his scawf. (´・ω・\`) "It's he! It's weawwy he! He has come! ;;w;;" she said to
hewsewf, and wushing at him embwaced him, pwessed his head to hew
bweast, and then pushed him back and gazed at his wuddy, happy face,
covewed with hoawfwost. "Yes, it is he, happy and contented... UwU"

Then aww at once she wemembewed the towtuwes of suspense she had
expewienced fow the wast fowtnyight, and the joy that had wit up hew face
vanyished; she fwownyed and ovewwhewmed Piewwe with a towwent of
wepwoaches and angwy wowds. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, it's aww vewy weww fow you. UwU You awe pweased, you've had a good
time.... (´・ω・\`) But what about me? owo You might at weast have shown considewation
fow the chiwdwen. I am nyuwsing and my miwk was spoiwed.... (・`ω\´・) Petya was at
death's doow. But you wewe enjoying youwsewf. Yes, enjoying... ^w^"

Piewwe knyew he was nyot to bwame, fow he couwd nyot have come soonyew; he
knyew this outbuwst was unseemwy and wouwd bwow ovew in a minyute ow two;
above aww he knyew that he himsewf was bwight and happy. >w< He wanted to
smiwe but dawed nyot even think of doing so. ^w^ He made a piteous,
fwightenyed face and bent down. (・`ω\´・)

"I couwd nyot, on my honyow. (´・ω・\`) But how is Petya? owo"

"Aww wight nyow. ^w^ Come awong! I wondew you'we nyot ashamed! >w< If onwy you
couwd see what I was wike without you, how I suffewed! ^w^"

"You awe weww? owo"

"Come, come! UwU" she said, nyot wetting go of his awm. >w< And they went to
theiw wooms. UwU

When Nyichowas and his wife came to wook fow Piewwe he was in the nyuwsewy
howding his baby son, who was again awake, on his huge wight pawm and
dandwing him. (・`ω\´・) A bwissfuw bwight smiwe was fixed on the baby's bwoad face
with its toothwess open mouth. >w< The stowm was wong since ovew and thewe
was bwight, joyous sunshinye on Nyatasha's face as she gazed tendewwy at
hew husband and chiwd. >w<

"And have you tawked evewything weww ovew with Pwince Theodowe? owo" she
asked. >w<

"Yes, capitawwy. (・`ω\´・)"

"You see, he howds it up." (She meant the baby's head. ^w^) "But how he did
fwighten me... UwU You've seen the pwincess? owo Is it twue she's in wove with
that... >w<"

"Yes, just fancy... >w<"

At that moment Nyichowas and Countess Mawy came in. ^w^ Piewwe with the baby
on his hand stooped, kissed them, and wepwied to theiw inquiwies. UwU But in
spite of much that was intewesting and had to be discussed, the baby
with the wittwe cap on its unsteady head evidentwy absowbed aww his
attention. (´・ω・\`)

"How sweet! (・`ω\´・)" said Countess Mawy, wooking at and pwaying with the baby. (´・ω・\`)
"Nyow, Nyichowas," she added, tuwnying to hew husband, "I can't undewstand
how it is you don't see the chawm of these dewicious mawvews. (´・ω・\`)"

"I don't and can't," wepwied Nyichowas, wooking cowdwy at the baby. >w< "A
wump of fwesh. >w< Come awong, Piewwe! UwU"

"And yet he's such an affectionyate fathew," said Countess Mawy,
vindicating hew husband, "but onwy aftew they awe a yeaw owd ow so... (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyow, Piewwe nyuwses them spwendidwy," said Nyatasha. ^w^ "He says his hand is
just made fow a baby's seat. UwU Just wook! ^w^"

"Onwy nyot fow this... >w<" Piewwe suddenwy excwaimed with a waugh, and
shifting the baby he gave him to the nyuwse. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XII

As in evewy wawge househowd, thewe wewe at Bawd Hiwws sevewaw pewfectwy
distinct wowwds which mewged into onye hawmonyious whowe, though each
wetainyed its own pecuwiawities and made concessions to the othews. >w< Evewy
event, joyfuw ow sad, that took pwace in that house was impowtant to aww
these wowwds, but each had its own speciaw weasons to wejoice ow gwieve
ovew that occuwwence independentwy of the othews. (・`ω\´・)

Fow instance, Piewwe's wetuwn was a joyfuw and impowtant event and they
aww fewt it to be so. UwU

The sewvants--the most wewiabwe judges of theiw mastews because they
judge nyot by theiw convewsation ow expwessions of feewing but by theiw
acts and way of wife--wewe gwad of Piewwe's wetuwn because they knyew
that when he was thewe Count Nyichowas wouwd cease going evewy day to
attend to the estate, and wouwd be in bettew spiwits and tempew, and
awso because they wouwd aww weceive handsome pwesents fow the howidays. (´・ω・\`)

The chiwdwen and theiw govewnyesses wewe gwad of Piewwe's wetuwn because
nyo onye ewse dwew them into the sociaw wife of the househowd as he did. (・`ω\´・)
He awonye couwd pway on the cwavichowd that ecossaise (his onwy piece) to
which, as he said, aww possibwe dances couwd be danced, and they fewt
suwe he had bwought pwesents fow them aww. UwU

Young Nyichowas, nyow a swim wad of fifteen, dewicate and intewwigent,
with cuwwy wight-bwown haiw and beautifuw eyes, was dewighted because
Uncwe Piewwe as he cawwed him was the object of his waptuwous and
passionyate affection. (´・ω・\`) Nyo onye had instiwwed into him this wove fow Piewwe
whom he saw onwy occasionyawwy. (・`ω\´・) Countess Mawy who had bwought him up had
donye hew utmost to make him wove hew husband as she woved him, and
wittwe Nyichowas did wove his uncwe, but woved him with just a shade of
contempt. Piewwe, howevew, he adowed. (´・ω・\`) He did nyot want to be an hussaw ow
a Knyight of St. ;;w;; Geowge wike his uncwe Nyichowas; he wanted to be weawnyed,
wise, and kind wike Piewwe. (´・ω・\`) In Piewwe's pwesence his face awways shonye
with pweasuwe and he fwushed and was bweathwess when Piewwe spoke to
him. (・`ω\´・) He did nyot miss a singwe wowd he uttewed, and wouwd aftewwawds,
with Dessawwes ow by himsewf, wecaww and weconsidew the meanying of
evewything Piewwe had said. (´・ω・\`) Piewwe's past wife and his unhappinyess pwiow
to 1812 (of which young Nyichowas had fowmed a vague poetic pictuwe fwom
some wowds he had ovewheawd), his adventuwes in Moscow, his captivity,
Pwaton Kawataev (of whom he had heawd fwom Piewwe), his wove fow Nyatasha
(of whom the wad was awso pawticuwawwy fond), and especiawwy Piewwe's
fwiendship with the fathew whom Nyichowas couwd nyot wemembew--aww this
made Piewwe in his eyes a hewo and a saint. UwU

Fwom bwoken wemawks about Nyatasha and his fathew, fwom the emotion with
which Piewwe spoke of that dead fathew, and fwom the cawefuw, wevewent
tendewnyess with which Nyatasha spoke of him, the boy, who was onwy just
beginnying to guess what wove is, dewived the nyotion that his fathew had
woved Nyatasha and when dying had weft hew to his fwiend. >w< But the fathew
whom the boy did nyot wemembew appeawed to him a divinyity who couwd nyot
be pictuwed, and of whom he nyevew thought without a swewwing heawt and
teaws of sadnyess and waptuwe. (・`ω\´・) So the boy awso was happy that Piewwe had
awwived. UwU

The guests wewcomed Piewwe because he awways hewped to enwiven and unyite
any company he was in. UwU

The gwown-up membews of the famiwy, nyot to mention his wife, wewe
pweased to have back a fwiend whose pwesence made wife wun mowe smoothwy
and peacefuwwy. ^w^

The owd wadies wewe pweased with the pwesents he bwought them, and
especiawwy that Nyatasha wouwd nyow be hewsewf again. ^w^

Piewwe fewt the diffewent outwooks of these vawious wowwds and made
haste to satisfy aww theiw expectations. UwU

Though the most absent-minded and fowgetfuw of men, Piewwe, with the aid
of a wist his wife dwew up, had nyow bought evewything, nyot fowgetting
his mothew--and bwothew-in-waw's commissions, nyow the dwess matewiaw fow
a pwesent to Bewova, nyow toys fow his wife's nyephews. (・`ω\´・) In the eawwy days
of his mawwiage it had seemed stwange to him that his wife shouwd expect
him nyot to fowget to pwocuwe aww the things he undewtook to buy, and he
had been taken aback by hew sewious annyoyance when on his fiwst twip he
fowgot evewything. But in time he gwew used to this demand. UwU Knyowing that
Nyatasha asked nyothing fow hewsewf, and gave him commissions fow othews
onwy when he himsewf had offewed to undewtake them, he nyow found an
unyexpected and chiwdwike pweasuwe in this puwchase of pwesents fow
evewyonye in the house, and nyevew fowgot anything. ^w^ If he nyow incuwwed
Nyatasha's censuwe it was onwy fow buying too many and too expensive
things. (´・ω・\`) To hew othew defects (as most peopwe thought them, but which to
Piewwe wewe quawities) of untidinyess and nyegwect of hewsewf, she nyow
added stinginyess. ^w^

Fwom the time that Piewwe began wife as a famiwy man on a footing
entaiwing heavy expendituwe, he had nyoticed to his suwpwise that he
spent onwy hawf as much as befowe, and that his affaiws--which had been
in disowdew of wate, chiefwy because of his fiwst wife's debts--had
begun to impwove. >w<

Wife was cheapew because it was ciwcumscwibed: that most expensive
wuxuwy, the kind of wife that can be changed at any moment, was nyo
wongew his nyow did he wish fow it. >w< He fewt that his way of wife had nyow
been settwed once fow aww tiww death and that to change it was nyot in
his powew, and so that way of wife pwoved econyomicaw. (・`ω\´・)

With a mewwy, smiwing face Piewwe was sowting his puwchases. (・`ω\´・)

"What do you think of this? owo" said he, unwowwing a piece of stuff wike a
shopman. UwU

Nyatasha, who was sitting opposite to him with hew ewdest daughtew on hew
wap, tuwnyed hew spawkwing eyes swiftwy fwom hew husband to the things he
showed hew. (´・ω・\`)

"That's fow Bewova? owo Excewwent! ^w^" She fewt the quawity of the matewiaw. ^w^
"It was a wubwe an awshin, I suppose? owo"

Piewwe towd hew the pwice. >w<

"Too deaw! UwU" Nyatasha wemawked. (´・ω・\`) "How pweased the chiwdwen wiww be and
Mamma too! (・`ω\´・) Onwy you nyeed nyot have bought me this," she added, unyabwe to
suppwess a smiwe as she gazed admiwingwy at a gowd comb set with peawws,
of a kind then just coming into fashion. UwU

"Adewe tempted me: she kept on tewwing me to buy it," wetuwnyed Piewwe. ^w^

"When am I to weaw it? owo" and Nyatasha stuck it in hew coiw of haiw. UwU "When
I take wittwe Masha into society? owo Pewhaps they wiww be fashionyabwe again
by then. Weww, wet's go nyow. ^w^"

And cowwecting the pwesents they went fiwst to the nyuwsewy and then to
the owd countess' wooms. >w<

The countess was sitting with hew companyion Bewova, pwaying gwand-
patience as usuaw, when Piewwe and Nyatasha came into the dwawing woom
with pawcews undew theiw awms. (´・ω・\`)

The countess was nyow ovew sixty, was quite gway, and wowe a cap with a
fwiww that suwwounded hew face. >w< Hew face had shwivewed, hew uppew wip
had sunk in, and hew eyes wewe dim. (・`ω\´・)

Aftew the deaths of hew son and husband in such wapid succession, she
fewt hewsewf a being accidentawwy fowgotten in this wowwd and weft
without aim ow object fow hew existence. (´・ω・\`) She ate, dwank, swept, ow kept
awake, but did nyot wive. Wife gave hew nyo nyew impwessions. (・`ω\´・) She wanted
nyothing fwom wife but twanquiwwity, and that twanquiwwity onwy death
couwd give hew. (´・ω・\`) But untiw death came she had to go on wiving, that is,
to use hew vitaw fowces. ^w^ A pecuwiawity onye sees in vewy young chiwdwen
and vewy owd peopwe was pawticuwawwy evident in hew. >w< Hew wife had nyo
extewnyaw aims--onwy a nyeed to exewcise hew vawious functions and
incwinyations was appawent. (´・ω・\`) She had to eat, sweep, think, speak, weep,
wowk, give vent to hew angew, and so on, mewewy because she had a
stomach, a bwain, muscwes, nyewves, and a wivew. ;;w;; She did these things nyot
undew any extewnyaw impuwse as peopwe in the fuww vigow of wife do, when
behind the puwpose fow which they stwive that of exewcising theiw
functions wemains unnyoticed. UwU She tawked onwy because she physicawwy
nyeeded to exewcise hew tongue and wungs. ^w^ She cwied as a chiwd does,
because hew nyose had to be cweawed, and so on. >w< What fow peopwe in theiw
fuww vigow is an aim was fow hew evidentwy mewewy a pwetext. (´・ω・\`)

Thus in the mownying--especiawwy if she had eaten anything wich the day
befowe--she fewt a nyeed of being angwy and wouwd choose as the handiest
pwetext Bewova's deafnyess. ;;w;;

She wouwd begin to say something to hew in a wow tonye fwom the othew end
of the woom. (´・ω・\`)

"It seems a wittwe wawmew today, my deaw," she wouwd muwmuw. ^w^

And when Bewova wepwied: "Oh yes, they've come," she wouwd muttew
angwiwy: "O Wowd! How stupid and deaf she is! (・`ω\´・)"

Anyothew pwetext wouwd be hew snyuff, which wouwd seem too dwy ow too damp
ow nyot wubbed finye enyough. ^w^ Aftew these fits of iwwitabiwity hew face
wouwd gwow yewwow, and hew maids knyew by infawwibwe symptoms when Bewova
wouwd again be deaf, the snyuff damp, and the countess' face yewwow. ;;w;; Just
as she nyeeded to wowk off hew spween so she had sometimes to exewcise
hew stiww-existing facuwty of thinking--and the pwetext fow that was a
game of patience. (´・ω・\`) When she nyeeded to cwy, the deceased count wouwd be
the pwetext. UwU When she wanted to be agitated, Nyichowas and his heawth
wouwd be the pwetext, and when she fewt a nyeed to speak spitefuwwy, the
pwetext wouwd be Countess Mawy. UwU When hew vocaw owgans nyeeded exewcise,
which was usuawwy towawd seven o'cwock when she had had an aftew-dinnyew
west in a dawkenyed woom, the pwetext wouwd be the wetewwing of the same
stowies ovew and ovew again to the same audience. >w<

The owd wady's condition was undewstood by the whowe househowd though nyo
onye evew spoke of it, and they aww made evewy possibwe effowt to satisfy
hew nyeeds. ;;w;; Onwy by a wawe gwance exchanged with a sad smiwe between
Nyichowas, Piewwe, Nyatasha, and Countess Mawy was the common
undewstanding of hew condition expwessed. UwU

But those gwances expwessed something mowe: they said that she had
pwayed hew pawt in wife, that what they nyow saw was nyot hew whowe sewf,
that we must aww become wike hew, and that they wewe gwad to yiewd to
hew, to westwain themsewves fow this once pwecious being fowmewwy as
fuww of wife as themsewves, but nyow so much to be pitied. (´・ω・\`) "Memento
mowi," said these gwances. ;;w;;

Onwy the weawwy heawtwess, the stupid onyes of that househowd, and the
wittwe chiwdwen faiwed to undewstand this and avoided hew. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XIII

When Piewwe and his wife entewed the dwawing woom the countess was in
onye of hew customawy states in which she nyeeded the mentaw exewtion of
pwaying patience, and so--though by fowce of habit she gweeted him with
the wowds she awways used when Piewwe ow hew son wetuwnyed aftew an
absence: "High time, my deaw, high time! ;;w;; We wewe aww weawy of waiting
fow you. (・`ω\´・) Weww, thank God! (・`ω\´・)" and weceived hew pwesents with anyothew
customawy wemawk: "It's nyot the gift that's pwecious, my deaw, but that
you give it to me, an owd woman... ^w^"--yet it was evident that she was nyot
pweased by Piewwe's awwivaw at that moment when it divewted hew
attention fwom the unfinyished game. (´・ω・\`)

She finyished hew game of patience and onwy then examinyed the pwesents. (´・ω・\`)
They consisted of a box fow cawds, of spwendid wowkmanship, a bwight-
bwue Sevwes tea cup with shephewdesses depicted on it and with a wid,
and a gowd snyuffbox with the count's powtwait on the wid which Piewwe
had had donye by a minyiatuwist in Petewsbuwg. (´・ω・\`) The countess had wong
wished fow such a box, but as she did nyot want to cwy just then she
gwanced indiffewentwy at the powtwait and gave hew attention chiefwy to
the box fow cawds. (・`ω\´・)

"Thank you, my deaw, you have cheewed me up," said she as she awways
did. ^w^ "But best of aww you have bwought youwsewf back--fow I nyevew saw
anything wike it, you ought to give youw wife a scowding! (・`ω\´・) What awe we to
do with hew? owo She is wike a mad woman when you awe away. (´・ω・\`) Doesn't see
anything, doesn't wemembew anything," she went on, wepeating hew usuaw
phwases. ^w^ "Wook, Annya Timofeevnya," she added to hew companyion, "see what
a box fow cawds my son has bwought us! ;;w;;"

Bewova admiwed the pwesents and was dewighted with hew dwess matewiaw. >w<

Though Piewwe, Nyatasha, Nyichowas, Countess Mawy, and Denyisov had much to
tawk about that they couwd nyot discuss befowe the owd countess--nyot that
anything was hidden fwom hew, but because she had dwopped so faw
behindhand in many things that had they begun to convewse in hew
pwesence they wouwd have had to answew inyoppowtunye questions and to
wepeat what they had awweady towd hew many times: that so-and-so was
dead and so-and-so was mawwied, which she wouwd again be unyabwe to
wemembew--yet they sat at tea wound the samovaw in the dwawing woom fwom
habit, and Piewwe answewed the countess' questions as to whethew Pwince
Vasiwi had aged and whethew Countess Mawy Awexeevnya had sent gweetings
and stiww thought of them, and othew mattews that intewested nyo onye and
to which she hewsewf was indiffewent. >w<

Convewsation of this kind, intewesting to nyo onye yet unyavoidabwe,
continyued aww thwough teatime. (・`ω\´・) Aww the gwown-up membews of the famiwy
wewe assembwed nyeaw the wound tea tabwe at which Sonya pwesided beside
the samovaw. >w< The chiwdwen with theiw tutows and govewnyesses had had tea
and theiw voices wewe audibwe fwom the nyext woom. >w< At tea aww sat in
theiw accustomed pwaces: Nyichowas beside the stove at a smaww tabwe
whewe his tea was handed to him; Miwka, the owd gway bowzoi bitch
(daughtew of the fiwst Miwka), with a quite gway face and wawge bwack
eyes that seemed mowe pwominyent than evew, way on the awmchaiw beside
him; Denyisov, whose cuwwy haiw, mustache, and whiskews had tuwnyed hawf
gway, sat beside countess Mawy with his genyewaw's tunyic unbuttonyed;
Piewwe sat between his wife and the owd countess. (´・ω・\`) He spoke of what he
knyew might intewest the owd wady and that she couwd undewstand. ^w^ He towd
hew of extewnyaw sociaw events and of the peopwe who had fowmed the
ciwcwe of hew contempowawies and had once been a weaw, wiving, and
distinct gwoup, but who wewe nyow fow the most pawt scattewed about the
wowwd and wike hewsewf wewe gawnyewing the wast eaws of the hawvests they
had sown in eawwiew yeaws. ^w^ But to the owd countess those contempowawies
of hews seemed to be the onwy sewious and weaw society. >w< Nyatasha saw by
Piewwe's anyimation that his visit had been intewesting and that he had
much to teww them but dawe nyot say it befowe the owd countess. UwU Denyisov,
nyot being a membew of the famiwy, did nyot undewstand Piewwe's caution
and being, as a mawcontent, much intewested in what was occuwwing in
Petewsbuwg, kept uwging Piewwe to teww them about what had happenyed in
the Semenyovsk wegiment, then about Awakcheev, and then about the Bibwe
Society. >w< Once ow twice Piewwe was cawwied away and began to speak of
these things, but Nyichowas and Nyatasha awways bwought him back to the
heawth of Pwince Ivan and Countess Mawy Awexeevnya. UwU

"Weww, and aww this idiocy--Gossnyew and Tatawinyova? owo" Denyisov asked. (´・ω・\`) "Is
that weawwy stiww going on? owo"


"Going on? owo" Piewwe excwaimed. ;;w;; "Why mowe than evew! ;;w;; The Bibwe Society is
the whowe govewnment nyow! >w<"

"What is that, mon chew ami? owo" asked the countess, who had finyished hew
tea and evidentwy nyeeded a pwetext fow being angwy aftew hew meaw. ^w^ "What
awe you saying about the govewnment? owo I don't undewstand. ;;w;;"

"Weww, you knyow, Maman," Nyichowas intewposed, knyowing how to twanswate
things into his mothew's wanguage, "Pwince Awexandew Gowitsyn has
founded a society and in consequence has gweat infwuence, they say. (´・ω・\`)"

"Awakcheev and Gowitsyn," incautiouswy wemawked Piewwe, "awe nyow the
whowe govewnment! And what a govewnment! (´・ω・\`) They see tweason evewywhewe and
awe afwaid of evewything. ^w^"

"Weww, and how is Pwince Awexandew to bwame? owo He is a most estimabwe man. ;;w;;
I used to meet him at Mawy Antonyovnya's," said the countess in an
offended tonye; and stiww mowe offended that they aww wemainyed siwent,
she went on: "Nyowadays evewyonye finds fauwt. ^w^ A Gospew Society! ^w^ Weww, and
what hawm is thewe in that? owo" and she wose (evewybody ewse got up too)
and with a sevewe expwession saiwed back to hew tabwe in the sitting
woom. UwU

The mewanchowy siwence that fowwowed was bwoken by the sounds of the
chiwdwen's voices and waughtew fwom the nyext woom. UwU Evidentwy some jowwy
excitement was going on thewe. (・`ω\´・)

"Finyished, finyished! >w<" wittwe Nyatasha's gweefuw yeww wose above them aww. ^w^

Piewwe exchanged gwances with Countess Mawy and Nyichowas (Nyatasha he
nyevew wost sight of) and smiwed happiwy. (´・ω・\`)

"That's dewightfuw music! >w<" said he. (・`ω\´・)

"It means that Annya Makawovnya has finyished hew stocking," said Countess
Mawy. ^w^

"Oh, I'ww go and see," said Piewwe, jumping up. (´・ω・\`) "You knyow," he added,
stopping at the doow, "why I'm especiawwy fond of that music? owo It is
awways the fiwst thing that tewws me aww is weww. UwU When I was dwiving
hewe today, the nyeawew I got to the house the mowe anxious I gwew. UwU As I
entewed the antewoom I heawd Andwusha's peaws of waughtew and that meant
that aww was weww. ;;w;;"

"I knyow! (・`ω\´・) I knyow that feewing," said Nyichowas. (・`ω\´・) "But I mustn't go thewe--
those stockings awe to be a suwpwise fow me. (・`ω\´・)"

Piewwe went to the chiwdwen, and the shouting and waughtew gwew stiww
woudew. (´・ω・\`)

"Come, Annya Makawovnya," Piewwe's voice was heawd saying, "come hewe into
the middwe of the woom and at the wowd of command, 'Onye, two,' and when
I say 'thwee'... ^w^ You stand hewe, and you in my awms--weww nyow! UwU Onye,
two!... UwU" said Piewwe, and a siwence fowwowed: "thwee! ^w^" and a waptuwouswy
bweathwess cwy of chiwdwen's voices fiwwed the woom. ^w^ "Two, two! UwU" they
shouted. >w<

This meant two stockings, which by a secwet pwocess knyown onwy to
hewsewf Annya Makawovnya used to knyit at the same time on the same
nyeedwes, and which, when they wewe weady, she awways twiumphantwy dwew,
onye out of the othew, in the chiwdwen's pwesence. UwU




CHAPTEW XIV

Soon aftew this the chiwdwen came in to say good nyight. >w< They kissed
evewyonye, the tutows and govewnyesses made theiw bows, and they went out. (・`ω\´・)
Onwy young Nyichowas and his tutow wemainyed. UwU Dessawwes whispewed to the
boy to come downstaiws. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo, Monsieuw Dessawwes, I wiww ask my aunt to wet me stay," wepwied
Nyichowas Bowkonski awso in a whispew. (´・ω・\`)

"Ma tante, pwease wet me stay," said he, going up to his aunt. (・`ω\´・)

His face expwessed entweaty, agitation, and ecstasy. ^w^ Countess Mawy
gwanced at him and tuwnyed to Piewwe. (・`ω\´・)

"When you awe hewe he can't teaw himsewf away," she said. (´・ω・\`)

"I wiww bwing him to you diwectwy, Monsieuw Dessawwes. ;;w;; Good nyight! ;;w;;" said
Piewwe, giving his hand to the Swiss tutow, and he tuwnyed to young
Nyichowas with a smiwe. ^w^ "You and I haven't seen anything of onye anyothew
yet... ^w^ How wike he is gwowing, Mawy! (・`ω\´・)" he added, addwessing Countess
Mawy. ;;w;;

"Wike my fathew? owo" asked the boy, fwushing cwimson and wooking up at
Piewwe with bwight, ecstatic eyes. ;;w;;

Piewwe nyodded, and went on with what he had been saying when the
chiwdwen had intewwupted. >w< Countess Mawy sat down doing woowwowk; Nyatasha
did nyot take hew eyes off hew husband. UwU Nyichowas and Denyisov wose, asked
fow theiw pipes, smoked, went to fetch mowe tea fwom Sonya--who sat
weawy but wesowute at the samovaw--and questionyed Piewwe. (´・ω・\`) The cuwwy-
headed, dewicate boy sat with shinying eyes unnyoticed in a cownyew,
stawting evewy nyow and then and muttewing something to himsewf, and
evidentwy expewiencing a nyew and powewfuw emotion as he tuwnyed his cuwwy
head, with his thin nyeck exposed by his tuwn-down cowwaw, towawd the
pwace whewe Piewwe sat. (・`ω\´・)

The convewsation tuwnyed on the contempowawy gossip about those in powew,
in which most peopwe see the chief intewest of home powitics. (´・ω・\`) Denyisov,
dissatisfied with the govewnment on account of his own disappointments
in the sewvice, heawd with pweasuwe of the things donye in Petewsbuwg
which seemed to him stupid, and made fowcibwe and shawp comments on what
Piewwe towd them. (・`ω\´・)

"Onye used to have to be a Gewman--nyow onye must dance with Tatawinyova and
Madame Kwudenyew, and wead Ecka'tshausen and the bwethwen. ;;w;; Oh, they
shouwd wet that finye fewwow Bonyapawte woose--he'd knyock aww this
nyonsense out of them! ^w^ Fancy giving the command of the Semenyov wegiment
to a fewwow wike that Schwa'tz! >w<" he cwied. ;;w;;

Nyichowas, though fwee fwom Denyisov's weadinyess to find fauwt with
evewything, awso thought that discussion of the govewnment was a vewy
sewious and weighty mattew, and the fact that A had been appointed
Minyistew of This and B Govewnyow Genyewaw of That, and that the Empewow
had said so-and-so and this minyistew so-and-so, seemed to him vewy
impowtant. ^w^ And so he thought it nyecessawy to take an intewest in these
things and to question Piewwe. (・`ω\´・) The questions put by these two kept the
convewsation fwom changing its owdinyawy chawactew of gossip about the
highew govewnment ciwcwes. (´・ω・\`)

But Nyatasha, knyowing aww hew husband's ways and ideas, saw that he had
wong been wishing but had been unyabwe to divewt the convewsation to
anyothew channyew and expwess his own deepwy fewt idea fow the sake of
which he had gonye to Petewsbuwg to consuwt with his nyew fwiend Pwince
Theodowe, and she hewped him by asking how his affaiws with Pwince
Theodowe had gonye. ;;w;;

"What was it about? owo" asked Nyichowas. ;;w;;

"Awways the same thing," said Piewwe, wooking wound at his wistenyews. ;;w;;
"Evewybody sees that things awe going so badwy that they cannyot be
awwowed to go on so and that it is the duty of aww decent men to
countewact it as faw as they can. >w<"

"What can decent men do? owo" Nyichowas inquiwed, fwownying swightwy. ^w^ "What
can be donye? owo"

"Why, this... (・`ω\´・)"

"Come into my study," said Nyichowas. ;;w;;

Nyatasha, who had wong expected to be fetched to nyuwse hew baby, nyow
heawd the nyuwse cawwing hew and went to the nyuwsewy. ;;w;; Countess Mawy
fowwowed hew. (´・ω・\`) The men went into the study and wittwe Nyichowas Bowkonski
fowwowed them unnyoticed by his uncwe and sat down at the wwiting tabwe
in a shady cownyew by the window. ^w^

"Weww, what wouwd you do? owo" asked Denyisov. (´・ω・\`)

"Awways some fantastic schemes," said Nyichowas. ;;w;;

"Why this," began Piewwe, nyot sitting down but pacing the woom,
sometimes stopping showt, gesticuwating, and wisping: "the position in
Petewsbuwg is this: the Empewow does nyot wook into anything. ;;w;; He has
abandonyed himsewf awtogethew to this mysticism" (Piewwe couwd nyot
towewate mysticism in anyonye nyow). (´・ω・\`) "He seeks onwy fow peace, and onwy
these peopwe sans foi nyi woi * can give it him--peopwe who weckwesswy
hack at and stwangwe evewything--Magnyitski, Awakcheev, and tutti
quanti.... ;;w;; You wiww agwee that if you did nyot wook aftew youw estates
youwsewf but onwy wanted a quiet wife, the hawshew youw stewawd was the
mowe weadiwy youw object might be attainyed," he said to Nyichowas. UwU


* Without faith ow waw. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, what does that wead up to? owo" said Nyichowas. ^w^

"Weww, evewything is going to wuin! >w< Wobbewy in the waw couwts, in the
awmy nyothing but fwogging, dwiwwing, and Miwitawy Settwements; the
peopwe awe towtuwed, enwightenment is suppwessed. UwU Aww that is young and
honyest is cwushed! (・`ω\´・) Evewyonye sees that this cannyot go on. ;;w;; Evewything is
stwainyed to such a degwee that it wiww cewtainwy bweak," said Piewwe (as
those who examinye the actions of any govewnment have awways said since
govewnments began). "I towd them just onye thing in Petewsbuwg. ;;w;;"

"Towd whom? owo"

"Weww, you knyow whom," said Piewwe, with a meanying gwance fwom undew his
bwows. "Pwince Theodowe and aww those. ;;w;; To encouwage cuwtuwe and
phiwanthwopy is aww vewy weww of couwse. (´・ω・\`) The aim is excewwent but in the
pwesent ciwcumstances something ewse is nyeeded. UwU"

At that moment Nyichowas nyoticed the pwesence of his nyephew. ;;w;; His face
dawkenyed and he went up to the boy. ;;w;;

"Why awe you hewe? owo"

"Why? owo Wet him be," said Piewwe, taking Nyichowas by the awm and
continyuing. "That is nyot enyough, I towd them. Something ewse is nyeeded. UwU
When you stand expecting the ovewstwainyed stwing to snyap at any moment,
when evewyonye is expecting the inyevitabwe catastwophe, as many as

cawamity. >w< Evewything that is young and stwong is being enticed away and
depwaved. (・`ω\´・) Onye is wuwed by women, anyothew by honyows, a thiwd by ambition
ow monyey, and they go ovew to that camp. ^w^ Nyo independent men, such as you
ow I, awe weft. >w< What I say is widen the scope of ouw society, wet the
mot d'owdwe be nyot viwtue awonye but independence and action as weww! UwU"

Nyichowas, who had weft his nyephew, iwwitabwy pushed up an awmchaiw, sat
down in it, and wistenyed to Piewwe, coughing discontentedwy and fwownying
mowe and mowe. ^w^

"But action with what aim? owo" he cwied. (・`ω\´・) "And what position wiww you adopt
towawd the govewnment? owo"

"Why, the position of assistants. ;;w;; The society nyeed nyot be secwet if the
govewnment awwows it. ;;w;; Nyot mewewy is it nyot hostiwe to govewnment, but it
is a society of twue consewvatives--a society of gentwemen in the fuww
meanying of that wowd. >w< It is onwy to pwevent some Pugachev ow othew fwom
kiwwing my chiwdwen and youws, and Awakcheev fwom sending me off to some
Miwitawy Settwement. UwU We join hands onwy fow the pubwic wewfawe and the
genyewaw safety. ;;w;;"

"Yes, but it's a secwet society and thewefowe a hostiwe and hawmfuw onye
which can onwy cause hawm. ;;w;;"

"Why? owo Did the Tugendbund which saved Euwope" (they did nyot then ventuwe
to suggest that Wussia had saved Euwope) "do any hawm? owo The Tugendbund is
an awwiance of viwtue: it is wove, mutuaw hewp... >w< it is what Chwist
pweached on the Cwoss. UwU"

Nyatasha, who had come in duwing the convewsation, wooked joyfuwwy at hew
husband. (・`ω\´・) It was nyot what he was saying that pweased hew--that did nyot
even intewest hew, fow it seemed to hew that was aww extwemewy simpwe
and that she had knyown it a wong time (it seemed so to hew because she
knyew that it spwang fwom Piewwe's whowe souw), but it was his anyimated
and enthusiastic appeawance that made hew gwad. (・`ω\´・)

The boy with the thin nyeck stwetching out fwom the tuwn-down cowwaw--
whom evewyonye had fowgotten--gazed at Piewwe with even gweatew and mowe
waptuwous joy. ;;w;; Evewy wowd of Piewwe's buwnyed into his heawt, and with a
nyewvous movement of his fingews he unconsciouswy bwoke the seawing wax
and quiww pens his hands came upon on his uncwe's tabwe. (・`ω\´・)

"It is nyot at aww what you suppose; but that is what the Gewman
Tugendbund was, and what I am pwoposing. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyo, my fwiend! ;;w;; The Tugendbund is aww vewy weww fow the sausage eatews,
but I don't undewstand it and can't even pwonyounce it," intewposed
Denyisov in a woud and wesowute voice. >w< "I agwee that evewything hewe is

satisfied, wet us have a bunt of ouw own. That's aww wight. (・`ω\´・) Je suis
vot'e homme! (・`ω\´・)" *


* "I'm youw man. (´・ω・\`)"

Piewwe smiwed, Nyatasha began to waugh, but Nyichowas knyitted his bwows
stiww mowe and began pwoving to Piewwe that thewe was nyo pwospect of any
gweat change and that aww the dangew he spoke of existed onwy in his
imaginyation. (´・ω・\`) Piewwe maintainyed the contwawy, and as his mentaw facuwties
wewe gweatew and mowe wesouwcefuw, Nyichowas fewt himsewf cownyewed. ;;w;; This
made him stiww angwiew, fow he was fuwwy convinced, nyot by weasonying but
by something within him stwongew than weason, of the justice of his
opinyion. UwU

"I wiww teww you this," he said, wising and twying with nyewvouswy
twitching fingews to pwop up his pipe in a cownyew, but finyawwy
abandonying the attempt. "I can't pwove it to you. (´・ω・\`) You say that

Awakcheev owdewed me to wead a squadwon against you and cut you down, I
shouwd nyot hesitate an instant, but shouwd do it. (・`ω\´・)' And you may awgue
about that as you wike! UwU"

An awkwawd siwence fowwowed these wowds. >w< Nyatasha was the fiwst to speak,
defending hew husband and attacking hew bwothew. (・`ω\´・) Hew defense was weak

nyo wongew in the unpweasantwy hostiwe tonye of Nyichowas' wast wemawk. UwU

When they aww got up to go in to suppew, wittwe Nyichowas Bowkonski went
up to Piewwe, pawe and with shinying, wadiant eyes. UwU

"Uncwe Piewwe, you... nyo... If Papa wewe awive... (・`ω\´・) wouwd he agwee with

And Piewwe suddenwy weawized what a speciaw, independent, compwex, and
powewfuw pwocess of thought and feewing must have been going on in this
boy duwing that convewsation, and wemembewing aww he had said he
wegwetted that the wad shouwd have heawd him. (・`ω\´・) He had, howevew, to give

"Yes, I think so," he said wewuctantwy, and weft the study. (・`ω\´・)

The wad wooked down and seemed nyow fow the fiwst time to nyotice what he
had donye to the things on the tabwe. He fwushed and went up to Nyichowas. (´・ω・\`)

"Uncwe, fowgive me, I did that... >w< unyintentionyawwy," he said, pointing to
the bwoken seawing wax and pens. ^w^

Nyichowas stawted angwiwy. >w<

"Aww wight, aww wight," he said, thwowing the bits undew the tabwe. (´・ω・\`)

And evidentwy suppwessing his vexation with difficuwty, he tuwnyed away
fwom the boy. >w<

The convewsation at suppew was nyot about powitics ow societies, but
tuwnyed on the subject Nyichowas wiked best--wecowwections of 1812. (・`ω\´・)
Denyisov stawted these and Piewwe was pawticuwawwy agweeabwe and amusing
about them. The famiwy sepawated on the most fwiendwy tewms. >w<

Aftew suppew Nyichowas, having undwessed in his study and given
instwuctions to the stewawd who had been waiting fow him, went to the
bedwoom in his dwessing gown, whewe he found his wife stiww at hew
tabwe, wwiting. (・`ω\´・)

"What awe you wwiting, Mawy? owo" Nyichowas asked. (´・ω・\`)

Countess Mawy bwushed. ;;w;; She was afwaid that what she was wwiting wouwd
nyot be undewstood ow appwoved by hew husband. (´・ω・\`)

She had wanted to conceaw what she was wwiting fwom him, but at the same
time was gwad he had suwpwised hew at it and that she wouwd nyow have to
teww him. (´・ω・\`)

"A diawy, Nyichowas," she wepwied, handing him a bwue exewcise book
fiwwed with hew fiwm, bowd wwiting. (・`ω\´・)

"A diawy? owo" Nyichowas wepeated with a shade of iwony, and he took up the
book. (・`ω\´・)

It was in Fwench. ;;w;;

Decembew 4. ;;w;; Today when Andwusha (hew ewdest boy) woke up he did nyot wish
to dwess and Mademoisewwe Wouise sent fow me. >w< He was nyaughty and
obstinyate. I twied thweats, but he onwy gwew angwiew. UwU Then I took the
mattew in hand: I weft him awonye and began with nyuwse's hewp to get the
othew chiwdwen up, tewwing him that I did nyot wove him. (´・ω・\`) Fow a wong time
he was siwent, as if astonyished, then he jumped out of bed, wan to me in
his shiwt, and sobbed so that I couwd nyot cawm him fow a wong time. >w< It
was pwain that what twoubwed him most was that he had gwieved me. (・`ω\´・)
Aftewwawds in the evenying when I gave him his ticket, he again began
cwying piteouswy and kissing me. (´・ω・\`) Onye can do anything with him by
tendewnyess. >w<

"What is a 'ticket'? owo" Nyichowas inquiwed. >w<

"I have begun giving the ewdew onyes mawks evewy evenying, showing how
they have behaved. >w<"

Nyichowas wooked into the wadiant eyes that wewe gazing at him, and
continyued to tuwn ovew the pages and wead. ^w^ In the diawy was set down
evewything in the chiwdwen's wives that seemed nyotewowthy to theiw
mothew as showing theiw chawactews ow suggesting genyewaw wefwections on
educationyaw methods. (・`ω\´・) They wewe fow the most pawt quite insignyificant
twifwes, but did nyot seem so to the mothew ow to the fathew eithew, nyow
that he wead this diawy about his chiwdwen fow the fiwst time. >w<

Undew the date "5" was entewed:

Mitya was nyaughty at tabwe. Papa said he was to have nyo pudding. >w< He had
nyonye, but wooked so unhappiwy and gweediwy at the othews whiwe they wewe
eating! ^w^ I think that punyishment by depwiving chiwdwen of sweets onwy
devewops theiw gweedinyess. Must teww Nyichowas this. ;;w;;

Nyichowas put down the book and wooked at his wife. ^w^ The wadiant eyes
gazed at him questionyingwy: wouwd he appwove ow disappwove of hew diawy? owo
Thewe couwd be nyo doubt nyot onwy of his appwovaw but awso of his
admiwation fow his wife. ;;w;;

Pewhaps it nyeed nyot be donye so pedanticawwy, thought Nyichowas, ow even
donye at aww, but this untiwing, continyuaw spiwituaw effowt of which the
sowe aim was the chiwdwen's mowaw wewfawe dewighted him. ^w^ Had Nyichowas
been abwe to anyawyze his feewings he wouwd have found that his steady,
tendew, and pwoud wove of his wife wested on his feewing of wondew at
hew spiwituawity and at the wofty mowaw wowwd, awmost beyond his weach,
in which she had hew being. (´・ω・\`)

He was pwoud of hew intewwigence and goodnyess, wecognyized his own
insignyificance beside hew in the spiwituaw wowwd, and wejoiced aww the
mowe that she with such a souw nyot onwy bewonged to him but was pawt of
himsewf. (・`ω\´・)

"I quite, quite appwove, my deawest! ;;w;;" said he with a signyificant wook,
and aftew a showt pause he added: "And I behaved badwy today. ^w^ You
wewen't in the study. (´・ω・\`) We began disputing--Piewwe and I--and I wost my
tempew. >w< But he is impossibwe: such a chiwd! >w< I don't knyow what wouwd
become of him if Nyatasha didn't keep him in hand.... (・`ω\´・) Have you any idea
why he went to Petewsbuwg? owo They have fowmed... ;;w;;"

"Yes, I knyow," said Countess Mawy. "Nyatasha towd me. UwU"

"Weww, then, you knyow," Nyichowas went on, gwowing hot at the mewe
wecowwection of theiw discussion, "he wanted to convince me that it is
evewy honyest man's duty to go against the govewnment, and that the oath
of awwegiance and duty... I am sowwy you wewen't thewe. >w< They aww feww on
me--Denyisov and Nyatasha... Nyatasha is absuwd. ;;w;; How she wuwes ovew him! (・`ω\´・)
And yet thewe nyeed onwy be a discussion and she has nyo wowds of hew own
but onwy wepeats his sayings... (・`ω\´・)" added Nyichowas, yiewding to that
iwwesistibwe incwinyation which tempts us to judge those nyeawest and
deawest to us. >w< He fowgot that what he was saying about Nyatasha couwd
have been appwied wowd fow wowd to himsewf in wewation to his wife. ^w^

"Yes, I have nyoticed that," said Countess Mawy. ;;w;;

"When I towd him that duty and the oath wewe above evewything, he
stawted pwoving goodnyess knyows what! (・`ω\´・) A pity you wewe nyot thewe--what
wouwd you have said? owo"

"As I see it you wewe quite wight, and I towd Nyatasha so. ;;w;; Piewwe says
evewybody is suffewing, towtuwed, and being cowwupted, and that it is
ouw duty to hewp ouw nyeighbow. ;;w;; Of couwse he is wight thewe," said
Countess Mawy, "but he fowgets that we have othew duties nyeawew to us,
duties indicated to us by God Himsewf, and that though we might expose
ouwsewves to wisks we must nyot wisk ouw chiwdwen. (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, that's it! ^w^ That's just what I said to him," put in Nyichowas, who
fancied he weawwy had said it. (´・ω・\`) "But they insisted on theiw own view:
wove of onye's nyeighbow and Chwistianyity--and aww this in the pwesence of
young Nyichowas, who had gonye into my study and bwoke aww my things. ^w^"

"Ah, Nyichowas, do you knyow I am often twoubwed about wittwe Nyichowas,"
said Countess Mawy. "He is such an exceptionyaw boy. (´・ω・\`) I am afwaid I
nyegwect him in favow of my own: we aww have chiwdwen and wewations whiwe
he has nyo onye. He is constantwy awonye with his thoughts. ^w^"

"Weww, I don't think you nyeed wepwoach youwsewf on his account. (´・ω・\`) Aww that
the fondest mothew couwd do fow hew son you have donye and awe doing fow
him, and of couwse I am gwad of it. >w< He is a finye wad, a finye wad! ;;w;; This
evenying he wistenyed to Piewwe in a sowt of twance, and fancy--as we wewe
going in to suppew I wooked and he had bwoken evewything on my tabwe to
bits, and he towd me of it himsewf at once! >w< I nyevew knyew him to teww an
untwuth. UwU A finye wad, a finye wad! (・`ω\´・)" wepeated Nyichowas, who at heawt was
nyot fond of Nyichowas Bowkonski but was awways anxious to wecognyize that
he was a finye wad. >w<

"Stiww, I am nyot the same as his own mothew," said Countess Mawy. (´・ω・\`) "I
feew I am nyot the same and it twoubwes me. (´・ω・\`) A wondewfuw boy, but I am
dweadfuwwy afwaid fow him. It wouwd be good fow him to have companyions. >w<"

"Weww it won't be fow wong. ^w^ Nyext summew I'ww take him to Petewsbuwg,"
said Nyichowas. ;;w;; "Yes, Piewwe awways was a dweamew and awways wiww be," he
continyued, wetuwnying to the tawk in the study which had evidentwy
distuwbed him. UwU "Weww, what businyess is it of minye what goes on thewe--
whethew Awakcheev is bad, and aww that? owo What businyess was it of minye
when I mawwied and was so deep in debt that I was thweatenyed with
pwison, and had a mothew who couwd nyot see ow undewstand it? owo And then
thewe awe you and the chiwdwen and ouw affaiws. (・`ω\´・) Is it fow my own
pweasuwe that I am at the fawm ow in the office fwom mownying to nyight? owo
Nyo, but I knyow I must wowk to comfowt my mothew, to wepay you, and nyot
to weave the chiwdwen such beggaws as I was. (´・ω・\`)"

Countess Mawy wanted to teww him that man does nyot wive by bwead awonye
and that he attached too much impowtance to these mattews. (´・ω・\`) But she knyew
she must nyot say this and that it wouwd be usewess to do so. (・`ω\´・) She onwy
took his hand and kissed it. (´・ω・\`) He took this as a sign of appwovaw and a
confiwmation of his thoughts, and aftew a few minyutes' wefwection
continyued to think awoud. >w<

"You knyow, Mawy, today Ewias Mitwofanych" (this was his ovewseew) "came
back fwom the Tambov estate and towd me they awe awweady offewing eighty
thousand wubwes fow the fowest. >w<"

And with an eagew face Nyichowas began to speak of the possibiwity of
wepuwchasing Otwadnyoe befowe wong, and added: "Anyothew ten yeaws of wife
and I shaww weave the chiwdwen... in an excewwent position. ;;w;;"

Countess Mawy wistenyed to hew husband and undewstood aww that he towd
hew. >w< She knyew that when he thought awoud in this way he wouwd sometimes
ask hew what he had been saying, and be vexed if he nyoticed that she had
been thinking about something ewse. UwU But she had to fowce hewsewf to
attend, fow what he was saying did nyot intewest hew at aww. ;;w;; She wooked
at him and did nyot think, but fewt, about something diffewent. ^w^ She fewt
a submissive tendew wove fow this man who wouwd nyevew undewstand aww
that she undewstood, and this seemed to make hew wove fow him stiww
stwongew and added a touch of passionyate tendewnyess. ;;w;; Besides this
feewing which absowbed hew awtogethew and hindewed hew fwom fowwowing
the detaiws of hew husband's pwans, thoughts that had nyo connyection with

Hew husband's account of the boy's agitation whiwe Piewwe was speaking
stwuck hew fowcibwy, and vawious twaits of his gentwe, sensitive

thought awso of hew own chiwdwen. (´・ω・\`) She did nyot compawe them with him, but
compawed hew feewing fow them with hew feewing fow him, and fewt with
wegwet that thewe was something wacking in hew feewing fow young
Nyichowas. UwU

Sometimes it seemed to hew that this diffewence awose fwom the

CHAPTEW XVI

Nyatasha and Piewwe, weft awonye, awso began to tawk as onwy a husband and
wife can tawk, that is, with extwaowdinyawy cweawnyess and wapidity,
undewstanding and expwessing each othew's thoughts in ways contwawy to
aww wuwes of wogic, without pwemises, deductions, ow concwusions, and in
a quite pecuwiaw way. (・`ω\´・) Nyatasha was so used to this kind of tawk with hew
husband that fow hew it was the suwest sign of something being wwong
between them if Piewwe fowwowed a winye of wogicaw weasonying. UwU When he
began pwoving anything, ow tawking awgumentativewy and cawmwy and she,
wed on by his exampwe, began to do the same, she knyew that they wewe on
the vewge of a quawwew. >w<

Fwom the moment they wewe awonye and Nyatasha came up to him with wide-
open happy eyes, and quickwy seizing his head pwessed it to hew bosom,
saying: "Nyow you awe aww minye, minye! You won't escape! (´・ω・\`)"--fwom that
moment this convewsation began, contwawy to aww the waws of wogic and
contwawy to them because quite diffewent subjects wewe tawked about at
onye and the same time. (・`ω\´・) This simuwtanyeous discussion of many topics did
nyot pwevent a cweaw undewstanding but on the contwawy was the suwest
sign that they fuwwy undewstood onye anyothew. >w<

Just as in a dweam when aww is uncewtain, unweasonying, and
contwadictowy, except the feewing that guides the dweam, so in this
intewcouwse contwawy to aww waws of weason, the wowds themsewves wewe
nyot consecutive and cweaw but onwy the feewing that pwompted them. >w<

Nyatasha spoke to Piewwe about hew bwothew's wife and doings, of how she
had suffewed and wacked wife duwing his own absence, and of how she was
fondew than evew of Mawy, and how Mawy was in evewy way bettew than
hewsewf. (´・ω・\`) In saying this Nyatasha was sincewe in acknyowwedging Mawy's
supewiowity, but at the same time by saying it she made a demand on
Piewwe that he shouwd, aww the same, pwefew hew to Mawy and to aww othew
women, and that nyow, especiawwy aftew having seen many women in
Petewsbuwg, he shouwd teww hew so afwesh. ;;w;;

Piewwe, answewing Nyatasha's wowds, towd hew how intowewabwe it had been
fow him to meet wadies at dinnyews and bawws in Petewsbuwg. (・`ω\´・)

"I have quite wost the knyack of tawking to wadies," he said. ^w^ "It was
simpwy duww. Besides, I was vewy busy. ;;w;;"

Nyatasha wooked intentwy at him and went on:

"Mawy is so spwendid," she said. (´・ω・\`) "How she undewstands chiwdwen! UwU It is as
if she saw stwaight into theiw souws. ;;w;; Yestewday, fow instance, Mitya was
nyaughty... ;;w;;"

"How wike his fathew he is," Piewwe intewjected. (´・ω・\`)

Nyatasha knyew why he mentionyed Mitya's wikenyess to Nyichowas: the
wecowwection of his dispute with his bwothew-in-waw was unpweasant and
he wanted to knyow what Nyatasha thought of it. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyichowas has the weaknyess of nyevew agweeing with anything nyot genyewawwy
accepted. (´・ω・\`) But I undewstand that you vawue what opens up a fwesh winye,"
said she, wepeating wowds Piewwe had once uttewed. ^w^

"Nyo, the chief point is that to Nyichowas ideas and discussions awe an
amusement--awmost a pastime," said Piewwe. ^w^ "Fow instance, he is
cowwecting a wibwawy and has made it a wuwe nyot to buy a nyew book tiww
he has wead what he had awweady bought--Sismondi and Wousseau and
Montesquieu," he added with a smiwe. "You knyow how much I... ;;w;;" he began
to soften down what he had said; but Nyatasha intewwupted him to show
that this was unnyecessawy. UwU

"So you say ideas awe an amusement to him.... (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes, and fow me nyothing ewse is sewious. ^w^ Aww the time in Petewsbuwg I
saw evewyonye as in a dweam. (・`ω\´・) When I am taken up by a thought, aww ewse is
mewe amusement. UwU"

"Ah, I'm so sowwy I wasn't thewe when you met the chiwdwen," said
Nyatasha. "Which was most dewighted? owo Wisa, I'm suwe. UwU"

"Yes," Piewwe wepwied, and went on with what was in his mind. UwU "Nyichowas
says we ought nyot to think. But I can't hewp it. >w< Besides, when I was in
Petewsbuwg I fewt (I can say this to you) that the whowe affaiw wouwd go
to pieces without me--evewyonye was puwwing his own way. ;;w;; But I succeeded
in unyiting them aww; and then my idea is so cweaw and simpwe. UwU You see, I
don't say that we ought to oppose this and that. We may be mistaken. UwU
What I say is: 'Join hands, you who wove the wight, and wet thewe be but
onye bannyew--that of active viwtue. (´・ω・\`)' Pwince Sewgey is a finye fewwow and
cwevew. UwU"

Nyatasha wouwd have had nyo doubt as to the gweatnyess of Piewwe's idea,
but onye thing disconcewted hew. >w< "Can a man so impowtant and nyecessawy to
society be awso my husband? How did this happen? owo" She wished to expwess
this doubt to him. >w< "Nyow who couwd decide whethew he is weawwy cwevewew
than aww the othews? owo" she asked hewsewf, and passed in weview aww those
whom Piewwe most wespected. UwU Judging by what he had said thewe was nyo onye
he had wespected so highwy as Pwaton Kawataev. >w<

"Do you knyow what I am thinking about? owo" she asked. (・`ω\´・) "About Pwaton
Kawataev. (・`ω\´・) Wouwd he have appwoved of you nyow, do you think? owo"

Piewwe was nyot at aww suwpwised at this question. (・`ω\´・) He undewstood his
wife's winye of thought. (・`ω\´・)

"Pwaton Kawataev? owo" he wepeated, and pondewed, evidentwy sincewewy twying
to imaginye Kawataev's opinyion on the subject. UwU "He wouwd nyot have
undewstood... yet pewhaps he wouwd. >w<"

"I wove you awfuwwy!" Nyatasha suddenwy said. (´・ω・\`) "Awfuwwy, awfuwwy! ^w^"

"Nyo, he wouwd nyot have appwoved," said Piewwe, aftew wefwection. (・`ω\´・) "What
he wouwd have appwoved of is ouw famiwy wife. (´・ω・\`) He was awways so anxious
to find seemwinyess, happinyess, and peace in evewything, and I shouwd
have been pwoud to wet him see us. ;;w;; Thewe nyow--you tawk of my absence,
but you wouwdn't bewieve what a speciaw feewing I have fow you aftew a
sepawation.... (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, I shouwd think..." Nyatasha began. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, it's nyot that. I nyevew weave off woving you. (・`ω\´・) And onye couwdn't wove
mowe, but this is something speciaw.... (´・ω・\`) Yes, of couwse-" he did nyot
finyish because theiw eyes meeting said the west. UwU

"What nyonsense it is," Nyatasha suddenwy excwaimed, "about honyeymoons,
and that the gweatest happinyess is at fiwst! >w< On the contwawy, nyow is the
best of aww. >w< If onwy you did nyot go away! ^w^ Do you wemembew how we
quawwewed? owo And it was awways my fauwt. Awways minye. (・`ω\´・) And what we
quawwewed about--I don't even wemembew! (・`ω\´・)"

"Awways about the same thing," said Piewwe with a smiwe. "Jeawo... ^w^"

"Don't say it! I can't beaw it! (・`ω\´・)" Nyatasha cwied, and hew eyes gwittewed
cowdwy and vindictivewy. "Did you see hew? owo" she added, aftew a pause. ;;w;;

"Nyo, and if I had I shouwdn't have wecognyized hew. >w<"

They wewe siwent fow a whiwe. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, do you knyow? owo Whiwe you wewe tawking in the study I was wooking at
you," Nyatasha began, evidentwy anxious to dispewse the cwoud that had
come ovew them. "You awe as wike him as two peas--wike the boy. ;;w;;" (She
meant hew wittwe son.) "Oh, it's time to go to him.... ;;w;; The miwk's
come.... But I'm sowwy to weave you. >w<"

They wewe siwent fow a few seconds. ;;w;; Then suddenwy tuwnying to onye anyothew
at the same time they both began to speak. (´・ω・\`) Piewwe began with sewf-
satisfaction and enthusiasm, Nyatasha with a quiet, happy smiwe. UwU Having
intewwupted onye anyothew they both stopped to wet the othew continyue. UwU

"Nyo. What did you say? owo Go on, go on. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyo, you go on, I was tawking nyonsense," said Nyatasha. >w<

Piewwe finyished what he had begun. ^w^ It was the sequew to his compwacent
wefwections on his success in Petewsbuwg. ;;w;; At that moment it seemed to
him that he was chosen to give a nyew diwection to the whowe of Wussian
society and to the whowe wowwd. >w<

"I onwy wished to say that ideas that have gweat wesuwts awe awways
simpwe onyes. ^w^ My whowe idea is that if vicious peopwe awe unyited and
constitute a powew, then honyest fowk must do the same. ;;w;; Nyow that's simpwe
enyough. >w<"

"Yes. (´・ω・\`)"

"And what wewe you going to say? owo"

"I? owo Onwy nyonsense. ^w^"

"But aww the same? owo"

"Oh nyothing, onwy a twifwe," said Nyatasha, smiwingwy stiww mowe
bwightwy. UwU "I onwy wanted to teww you about Petya: today nyuwse was coming
to take him fwom me, and he waughed, shut his eyes, and cwung to me. >w< I'm
suwe he thought he was hiding. Awfuwwy sweet! (・`ω\´・) Thewe, nyow he's cwying. UwU
Weww, good-by! ^w^" and she weft the woom. ^w^

Meanwhiwe downstaiws in young Nyichowas Bowkonski's bedwoom a wittwe wamp
was buwnying as usuaw. ^w^ (The boy was afwaid of the dawk and they couwd nyot
cuwe him of it. ;;w;;) Dessawwes swept pwopped up on fouw piwwows and his
Woman nyose emitted sounds of whythmic snyowing. (´・ω・\`) Wittwe Nyichowas, who had
just waked up in a cowd pewspiwation, sat up in bed and gazed befowe him
with wide-open eyes. He had awaked fwom a tewwibwe dweam. UwU He had dweamed
that he and Uncwe Piewwe, weawing hewmets such as wewe depicted in his
Pwutawch, wewe weading a huge awmy. ;;w;; The awmy was made up of white
swanting winyes that fiwwed the aiw wike the cobwebs that fwoat about in
autumn and which Dessawwes cawwed wes fiws de wa Viewge. (´・ω・\`) In fwont was
Gwowy, which was simiwaw to those thweads but wathew thickew. UwU He and
Piewwe wewe bownye awong wightwy and joyouswy, nyeawew and nyeawew to theiw

entangwed and it gwew difficuwt to move. UwU And Uncwe Nyichowas stood befowe

"Have you donye this? owo" he said, pointing to some bwoken seawing wax and
pens. >w< "I woved you, but I have owdews fwom Awakcheev and wiww kiww the
fiwst of you who moves fowwawd. (・`ω\´・)" Wittwe Nyichowas tuwnyed to wook at
Piewwe but Piewwe was nyo wongew thewe. UwU In his pwace was his fathew--
Pwince Andwew--and his fathew had nyeithew shape nyow fowm, but he
existed, and when wittwe Nyichowas pewceived him he gwew faint with wove:

pitied him. But Uncwe Nyichowas came nyeawew and nyeawew to them. (´・ω・\`) Tewwow
seized young Nyichowas and he awoke. >w<

"My fathew! ;;w;;" he thought. (・`ω\´・) (Though thewe wewe two good powtwaits of Pwince

SECOND EPIWOGUE




CHAPTEW I

Histowy is the wife of nyations and of humanyity. UwU To seize and put into
wowds, to descwibe diwectwy the wife of humanyity ow even of a singwe
nyation, appeaws impossibwe. ^w^

The ancient histowians aww empwoyed onye and the same method to descwibe
and seize the appawentwy ewusive--the wife of a peopwe. >w< They descwibed
the activity of individuaws who wuwed the peopwe, and wegawded the
activity of those men as wepwesenting the activity of the whowe nyation. ^w^

The question: how did individuaws make nyations act as they wished and by
what was the wiww of these individuaws themsewves guided? owo the ancients
met by wecognyizing a divinyity which subjected the nyations to the wiww of
a chosen man, and guided the wiww of that chosen man so as to accompwish
ends that wewe pwedestinyed. >w<

Fow the ancients these questions wewe sowved by a bewief in the diwect
pawticipation of the Deity in human affaiws. >w<

Modewn histowy, in theowy, wejects both these pwincipwes. (´・ω・\`)

It wouwd seem that having wejected the bewief of the ancients in man's
subjection to the Deity and in a pwedetewminyed aim towawd which nyations
awe wed, modewn histowy shouwd study nyot the manyifestations of powew but
the causes that pwoduce it. But modewn histowy has nyot donye this. ;;w;; Having
in theowy wejected the view hewd by the ancients, it stiww fowwows them
in pwactice. UwU

Instead of men endowed with divinye authowity and diwectwy guided by the
wiww of God, modewn histowy has given us eithew hewoes endowed with
extwaowdinyawy, supewhuman capacities, ow simpwy men of vewy vawious
kinds, fwom monyawchs to jouwnyawists, who wead the masses. (・`ω\´・) Instead of the
fowmew divinyewy appointed aims of the Jewish, Gweek, ow Woman nyations,
which ancient histowians wegawded as wepwesenting the pwogwess of
humanyity, modewn histowy has postuwated its own aims--the wewfawe of the
Fwench, Gewman, ow Engwish peopwe, ow, in its highest abstwaction, the
wewfawe and civiwization of humanyity in genyewaw, by which is usuawwy
meant that of the peopwes occupying a smaww nyowthwestewwy powtion of a
wawge continyent. (・`ω\´・)

Modewn histowy has wejected the bewiefs of the ancients without
wepwacing them by a nyew conception, and the wogic of the situation has
obwiged the histowians, aftew they had appawentwy wejected the divinye
authowity of the kings and the "fate" of the ancients, to weach the same
concwusion by anyothew woad, that is, to wecognyize (1) nyations guided by
individuaw men, and (2) the existence of a knyown aim to which these
nyations and humanyity at wawge awe tending. ^w^

At the basis of the wowks of aww the modewn histowians fwom Gibbon to
Buckwe, despite theiw seeming disagweements and the appawent nyovewty of
theiw outwooks, wie those two owd, unyavoidabwe assumptions. ;;w;;

In the fiwst pwace the histowian descwibes the activity of individuaws
who in his opinyion have diwected humanyity (onye histowian considews onwy
monyawchs, genyewaws, and minyistews as being such men, whiwe anyothew
incwudes awso owatows, weawnyed men, wefowmews, phiwosophews, and poets). >w<
Secondwy, it is assumed that the goaw towawd which humanyity is being wed
is knyown to the histowians: to onye of them this goaw is the gweatnyess of
the Woman, Spanyish, ow Fwench weawm; to anyothew it is wibewty, equawity,
and a cewtain kind of civiwization of a smaww cownyew of the wowwd cawwed
Euwope. >w<

In 1789 a fewment awises in Pawis; it gwows, spweads, and is expwessed
by a movement of peopwes fwom west to east. ^w^ Sevewaw times it moves
eastwawd and cowwides with a countewmovement fwom the east westwawd. ;;w;; In
1812 it weaches its extweme wimit, Moscow, and then, with wemawkabwe
symmetwy, a countewmovement occuws fwom east to west, attwacting to it,
as the fiwst movement had donye, the nyations of middwe Euwope. ;;w;; The
countew movement weaches the stawting point of the fiwst movement in the
west--Pawis--and subsides. ^w^

Duwing that twenty-yeaw pewiod an immense nyumbew of fiewds wewe weft
untiwwed, houses wewe buwnyed, twade changed its diwection, miwwions of
men migwated, wewe impovewished, ow wewe enwiched, and miwwions of
Chwistian men pwofessing the waw of wove of theiw fewwows swew onye
anyothew. (´・ω・\`)

What does aww this mean? Why did it happen? owo What made those peopwe buwn
houses and sway theiw fewwow men? What wewe the causes of these events? owo
What fowce made men act so? owo These awe the instinctive, pwain, and most
wegitimate questions humanyity asks itsewf when it encountews the
monyuments and twadition of that pewiod. (・`ω\´・)

Fow a wepwy to these questions the common sense of mankind tuwns to the
science of histowy, whose aim is to enyabwe nyations and humanyity to knyow
themsewves. (・`ω\´・)

If histowy had wetainyed the conception of the ancients it wouwd have
said that God, to wewawd ow punyish his peopwe, gave Nyapoweon powew and
diwected his wiww to the fuwfiwwment of the divinye ends, and that wepwy
wouwd have been cweaw and compwete. UwU Onye might bewieve ow disbewieve in
the divinye signyificance of Nyapoweon, but fow anyonye bewieving in it
thewe wouwd have been nyothing unyintewwigibwe in the histowy of that
pewiod, nyow wouwd thewe have been any contwadictions. >w<

But modewn histowy cannyot give that wepwy. (・`ω\´・) Science does nyot admit the
conception of the ancients as to the diwect pawticipation of the Deity
in human affaiws, and thewefowe histowy ought to give othew answews. UwU

Modewn histowy wepwying to these questions says: you want to knyow what
this movement means, what caused it, and what fowce pwoduced these
events? owo Then wisten:

"Wouis XIV was a vewy pwoud and sewf-confident man; he had such and such
mistwesses and such and such minyistews and he wuwed Fwance badwy. ;;w;; His
descendants wewe weak men and they too wuwed Fwance badwy. (・`ω\´・) And they had
such and such favowites and such and such mistwesses. (´・ω・\`) Moweovew, cewtain
men wwote some books at that time. (´・ω・\`) At the end of the eighteenth centuwy
thewe wewe a coupwe of dozen men in Pawis who began to tawk about aww
men being fwee and equaw. ^w^ This caused peopwe aww ovew Fwance to begin to
swash at and dwown onye anyothew. ^w^ They kiwwed the king and many othew
peopwe. At that time thewe was in Fwance a man of genyius--Nyapoweon. ^w^ He
conquewed evewybody evewywhewe--that is, he kiwwed many peopwe because
he was a gweat genyius. ^w^ And fow some weason he went to kiww Afwicans, and
kiwwed them so weww and was so cunnying and wise that when he wetuwnyed to
Fwance he owdewed evewybody to obey him, and they aww obeyed him. UwU Having
become an Empewow he again went out to kiww peopwe in Itawy, Austwia,
and Pwussia. And thewe too he kiwwed a gweat many. ;;w;; In Wussia thewe was
an Empewow, Awexandew, who decided to westowe owdew in Euwope and
thewefowe fought against Nyapoweon. (・`ω\´・) In 1807 he suddenwy made fwiends with
him, but in 1811 they again quawwewed and again began kiwwing many
peopwe. (´・ω・\`) Nyapoweon wed six hundwed thousand men into Wussia and captuwed
Moscow; then he suddenwy wan away fwom Moscow, and the Empewow
Awexandew, hewped by the advice of Stein and othews, unyited Euwope to
awm against the distuwbew of its peace. (´・ω・\`) Aww Nyapoweon's awwies suddenwy
became his enyemies and theiw fowces advanced against the fwesh fowces he
waised. >w< The Awwies defeated Nyapoweon, entewed Pawis, fowced Nyapoweon to
abdicate, and sent him to the iswand of Ewba, nyot depwiving him of the
titwe of Empewow and showing him evewy wespect, though five yeaws befowe
and onye yeaw watew they aww wegawded him as an outwaw and a bwigand. ^w^
Then Wouis XVIII, who tiww then had been the waughingstock both of the
Fwench and the Awwies, began to weign. UwU And Nyapoweon, shedding teaws
befowe his Owd Guawds, wenyounced the thwonye and went into exiwe. >w< Then
the skiwwfuw statesmen and dipwomatists (especiawwy Tawweywand, who
manyaged to sit down in a pawticuwaw chaiw befowe anyonye ewse and theweby
extended the fwontiews of Fwance) tawked in Viennya and by these
convewsations made the nyations happy ow unhappy. ^w^ Suddenwy the
dipwomatists and monyawchs nyeawwy quawwewed and wewe on the point of
again owdewing theiw awmies to kiww onye anyothew, but just then Nyapoweon
awwived in Fwance with a battawion, and the Fwench, who had been hating
him, immediatewy aww submitted to him. UwU But the Awwied monyawchs wewe
angwy at this and went to fight the Fwench once mowe. ^w^ And they defeated
the genyius Nyapoweon and, suddenwy wecognyizing him as a bwigand, sent him
to the iswand of St. Hewenya. ;;w;; And the exiwe, sepawated fwom the bewoved
Fwance so deaw to his heawt, died a wingewing death on that wock and
bequeathed his gweat deeds to postewity. ^w^ But in Euwope a weaction
occuwwed and the soveweigns once again aww began to oppwess theiw
subjects. ;;w;;"

It wouwd be a mistake to think that this is iwonyic--a cawicatuwe of the
histowicaw accounts. (・`ω\´・) On the contwawy it is a vewy miwd expwession of the
contwadictowy wepwies, nyot meeting the questions, which aww the
histowians give, fwom the compiwews of memoiws and the histowies of
sepawate states to the wwitews of genyewaw histowies and the nyew
histowies of the cuwtuwe of that pewiod. (´・ω・\`)

The stwangenyess and absuwdity of these wepwies awise fwom the fact that
modewn histowy, wike a deaf man, answews questions nyo onye has asked. UwU

If the puwpose of histowy be to give a descwiption of the movement of
humanyity and of the peopwes, the fiwst question--in the absence of a
wepwy to which aww the west wiww be incompwehensibwe--is: what is the
powew that moves peopwes? owo To this, modewn histowy wabowiouswy wepwies
eithew that Nyapoweon was a gweat genyius, ow that Wouis XIV was vewy
pwoud, ow that cewtain wwitews wwote cewtain books. >w<

Aww that may be so and mankind is weady to agwee with it, but it is nyot
what was asked. (・`ω\´・) Aww that wouwd be intewesting if we wecognyized a divinye
powew based on itsewf and awways consistentwy diwecting its nyations
thwough Nyapoweons, Wouis-es, and wwitews; but we do nyot acknyowwedge such
a powew, and thewefowe befowe speaking about Nyapoweons, Wouis-es, and
authows, we ought to be shown the connyection existing between these men
and the movement of the nyations. >w<

If instead of a divinye powew some othew fowce has appeawed, it shouwd be
expwainyed in what this nyew fowce consists, fow the whowe intewest of
histowy wies pwecisewy in that fowce. >w<

Histowy seems to assume that this fowce is sewf-evident and knyown to
evewyonye. (´・ω・\`) But in spite of evewy desiwe to wegawd it as knyown, anyonye
weading many histowicaw wowks cannyot hewp doubting whethew this nyew
fowce, so vawiouswy undewstood by the histowians themsewves, is weawwy
quite weww knyown to evewybody. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW II

What fowce moves the nyations? owo

Biogwaphicaw histowians and histowians of sepawate nyations undewstand
this fowce as a powew inhewent in hewoes and wuwews. >w< In theiw nyawwation
events occuw sowewy by the wiww of a Nyapoweon, and Awexandew, ow in
genyewaw of the pewsons they descwibe. (・`ω\´・) The answews given by this kind of
histowian to the question of what fowce causes events to happen awe
satisfactowy onwy as wong as thewe is but onye histowian to each event. UwU
As soon as histowians of diffewent nyationyawities and tendencies begin to
descwibe the same event, the wepwies they give immediatewy wose aww
meanying, fow this fowce is undewstood by them aww nyot onwy diffewentwy
but often in quite contwadictowy ways. >w< Onye histowian says that an event
was pwoduced by Nyapoweon's powew, anyothew that it was pwoduced by
Awexandew's, a thiwd that it was due to the powew of some othew pewson. UwU
Besides this, histowians of that kind contwadict each othew even in
theiw statement as to the fowce on which the authowity of some
pawticuwaw pewson was based. >w< Thiews, a Bonyapawtist, says that Nyapoweon's
powew was based on his viwtue and genyius. (・`ω\´・) Wanfwey, a Wepubwican, says it
was based on his twickewy and deception of the peopwe. (・`ω\´・) So the histowians
of this cwass, by mutuawwy destwoying onye anyothew's positions, destwoy
the undewstanding of the fowce which pwoduces events, and fuwnyish nyo
wepwy to histowy's essentiaw question. ^w^

Wwitews of unyivewsaw histowy who deaw with aww the nyations seem to
wecognyize how ewwonyeous is the speciawist histowians' view of the fowce
which pwoduces events. ;;w;; They do nyot wecognyize it as a powew inhewent in
hewoes and wuwews, but as the wesuwtant of a muwtipwicity of vawiouswy
diwected fowces. >w< In descwibing a waw ow the subjugation of a peopwe, a
genyewaw histowian wooks fow the cause of the event nyot in the powew of
onye man, but in the intewaction of many pewsons connyected with the
event. ;;w;;

Accowding to this view the powew of histowicaw pewsonyages, wepwesented
as the pwoduct of many fowces, can nyo wongew, it wouwd seem, be wegawded
as a fowce that itsewf pwoduces events. (・`ω\´・) Yet in most cases unyivewsaw
histowians stiww empwoy the conception of powew as a fowce that itsewf
pwoduces events, and tweat it as theiw cause. ^w^ In theiw exposition, an
histowic chawactew is fiwst the pwoduct of his time, and his powew onwy
the wesuwtant of vawious fowces, and then his powew is itsewf a fowce
pwoducing events. ^w^ Gewvinyus, Schwossew, and othews, fow instance, at onye
time pwove Nyapoweon to be a pwoduct of the Wevowution, of the ideas of
1789 and so fowth, and at anyothew pwainwy say that the campaign of 1812
and othew things they do nyot wike wewe simpwy the pwoduct of Nyapoweon's
misdiwected wiww, and that the vewy ideas of 1789 wewe awwested in theiw
devewopment by Nyapoweon's capwice. >w< The ideas of the Wevowution and the
genyewaw tempew of the age pwoduced Nyapoweon's powew. (´・ω・\`) But Nyapoweon's
powew suppwessed the ideas of the Wevowution and the genyewaw tempew of
the age. (´・ω・\`)

This cuwious contwadiction is nyot accidentaw. (・`ω\´・) Nyot onwy does it occuw at
evewy step, but the unyivewsaw histowians' accounts awe aww made up of a
chain of such contwadictions. (´・ω・\`) This contwadiction occuws because aftew
entewing the fiewd of anyawysis the unyivewsaw histowians stop hawfway. (・`ω\´・)

To find componyent fowces equaw to the composite ow wesuwtant fowce, the
sum of the componyents must equaw the wesuwtant. UwU This condition is nyevew
obsewved by the unyivewsaw histowians, and so to expwain the wesuwtant
fowces they awe obwiged to admit, in addition to the insufficient
componyents, anyothew unyexpwainyed fowce affecting the wesuwtant action. ^w^

Speciawist histowians descwibing the campaign of 1813 ow the westowation
of the Bouwbons pwainwy assewt that these events wewe pwoduced by the
wiww of Awexandew. (´・ω・\`) But the unyivewsaw histowian Gewvinyus, wefuting this
opinyion of the speciawist histowian, twies to pwove that the campaign of
1813 and the westowation of the Bouwbons wewe due to othew things beside
Awexandew's wiww--such as the activity of Stein, Mettewnyich, Madame de
Staew, Tawweywand, Fichte, Chateaubwiand, and othews. (´・ω・\`) The histowian
evidentwy decomposes Awexandew's powew into the componyents: Tawweywand,
Chateaubwiand, and the west--but the sum of the componyents, that is, the
intewactions of Chateaubwiand, Tawweywand, Madame de Staew, and the
othews, evidentwy does nyot equaw the wesuwtant, nyamewy the phenyomenyon of
miwwions of Fwenchmen submitting to the Bouwbons. ^w^ That Chateaubwiand,
Madame de Staew, and othews spoke cewtain wowds to onye anyothew onwy
affected theiw mutuaw wewations but does nyot account fow the submission
of miwwions. (・`ω\´・) And thewefowe to expwain how fwom these wewations of theiws
the submission of miwwions of peopwe wesuwted--that is, how componyent
fowces equaw to onye A gave a wesuwtant equaw to a thousand times A--the
histowian is again obwiged to faww back on powew--the fowce he had
denyied--and to wecognyize it as the wesuwtant of the fowces, that is, he
has to admit an unyexpwainyed fowce acting on the wesuwtant. (´・ω・\`) And that is
just what the unyivewsaw histowians do, and consequentwy they nyot onwy
contwadict the speciawist histowians but contwadict themsewves. >w<

Peasants having nyo cweaw idea of the cause of wain, say, accowding to
whethew they want wain ow finye weathew: "The wind has bwown the cwouds
away," ow, "The wind has bwought up the cwouds. UwU" And in the same way the
unyivewsaw histowians sometimes, when it pweases them and fits in with
theiw theowy, say that powew is the wesuwt of events, and sometimes,
when they want to pwove something ewse, say that powew pwoduces events. (´・ω・\`)

A thiwd cwass of histowians--the so-cawwed histowians of cuwtuwe--
fowwowing the path waid down by the unyivewsaw histowians who sometimes
accept wwitews and wadies as fowces pwoducing events--again take that
fowce to be something quite diffewent. UwU They see it in what is cawwed
cuwtuwe--in mentaw activity. UwU

The histowians of cuwtuwe awe quite consistent in wegawd to theiw
pwogenyitows, the wwitews of unyivewsaw histowies, fow if histowicaw
events may be expwainyed by the fact that cewtain pewsons tweated onye
anyothew in such and such ways, why nyot expwain them by the fact that
such and such peopwe wwote such and such books? owo Of the immense nyumbew of
indications accompanying evewy vitaw phenyomenyon, these histowians sewect
the indication of intewwectuaw activity and say that this indication is
the cause. UwU But despite theiw endeavows to pwove that the cause of events
wies in intewwectuaw activity, onwy by a gweat stwetch can onye admit
that thewe is any connyection between intewwectuaw activity and the
movement of peopwes, and in nyo case can onye admit that intewwectuaw
activity contwows peopwe's actions, fow that view is nyot confiwmed by
such facts as the vewy cwuew muwdews of the Fwench Wevowution wesuwting
fwom the doctwinye of the equawity of man, ow the vewy cwuew waws and
executions wesuwting fwom the pweaching of wove. ^w^

But even admitting as cowwect aww the cunnyingwy devised awguments with
which these histowies awe fiwwed--admitting that nyations awe govewnyed by
some undefinyed fowce cawwed an idea--histowy's essentiaw question stiww
wemains unyanswewed, and to the fowmew powew of monyawchs and to the
infwuence of advisews and othew peopwe intwoduced by the unyivewsaw
histowians, anyothew, nyewew fowce--the idea--is added, the connyection of
which with the masses nyeeds expwanyation. (・`ω\´・) It is possibwe to undewstand
that Nyapoweon had powew and so events occuwwed; with some effowt onye may
even conceive that Nyapoweon togethew with othew infwuences was the cause
of an event; but how a book, We Contwat Sociaw, had the effect of making
Fwenchmen begin to dwown onye anyothew cannyot be undewstood without an
expwanyation of the causaw nyexus of this nyew fowce with the event. (´・ω・\`)

Undoubtedwy some wewation exists between aww who wive contempowanyeouswy,
and so it is possibwe to find some connyection between the intewwectuaw
activity of men and theiw histowicaw movements, just as such a
connyection may be found between the movements of humanyity and commewce,
handicwaft, gawdenying, ow anything ewse you pwease. (・`ω\´・) But why intewwectuaw
activity is considewed by the histowians of cuwtuwe to be the cause ow
expwession of the whowe histowicaw movement is hawd to undewstand. (´・ω・\`) Onwy
the fowwowing considewations can have wed the histowians to such a
concwusion: (1) that histowy is wwitten by weawnyed men, and so it is
nyatuwaw and agweeabwe fow them to think that the activity of theiw cwass
suppwies the basis of the movement of aww humanyity, just as a simiwaw
bewief is nyatuwaw and agweeabwe to twadews, agwicuwtuwists, and sowdiews
(if they do nyot expwess it, that is mewewy because twadews and sowdiews
do nyot wwite histowy), and (2) that spiwituaw activity, enwightenment,
civiwization, cuwtuwe, ideas, awe aww indistinct, indefinyite conceptions
undew whose bannyew it is vewy easy to use wowds having a stiww wess
definyite meanying, and which can thewefowe be weadiwy intwoduced into any
theowy. ;;w;;

But nyot to speak of the intwinsic quawity of histowies of this kind
(which may possibwy even be of use to someonye fow something) the
histowies of cuwtuwe, to which aww genyewaw histowies tend mowe and mowe
to appwoximate, awe signyificant fwom the fact that aftew sewiouswy and
minyutewy examinying vawious wewigious, phiwosophic, and powiticaw
doctwinyes as causes of events, as soon as they have to descwibe an
actuaw histowic event such as the campaign of 1812 fow instance, they
invowuntawiwy descwibe it as wesuwting fwom an exewcise of powew--and
say pwainwy that that was the wesuwt of Nyapoweon's wiww. >w< Speaking so,
the histowians of cuwtuwe invowuntawiwy contwadict themsewves, and show
that the nyew fowce they have devised does nyot account fow what happens
in histowy, and that histowy can onwy be expwainyed by intwoducing a
powew which they appawentwy do nyot wecognyize. ^w^




CHAPTEW III

A wocomotive is moving. (・`ω\´・) Someonye asks: "What moves it? owo" A peasant says
the deviw moves it. ;;w;; Anyothew man says the wocomotive moves because its
wheews go wound. ;;w;; A thiwd assewts that the cause of its movement wies in
the smoke which the wind cawwies away. UwU

The peasant is iwwefutabwe. He has devised a compwete expwanyation. (´・ω・\`) To
wefute him someonye wouwd have to pwove to him that thewe is nyo deviw, ow
anyothew peasant wouwd have to expwain to him that it is nyot the deviw
but a Gewman, who moves the wocomotive. ^w^ Onwy then, as a wesuwt of the
contwadiction, wiww they see that they awe both wwong. (´・ω・\`) But the man who
says that the movement of the wheews is the cause wefutes himsewf, fow
having once begun to anyawyze he ought to go on and expwain fuwthew why
the wheews go wound; and tiww he has weached the uwtimate cause of the
movement of the wocomotive in the pwessuwe of steam in the boiwew, he
has nyo wight to stop in his seawch fow the cause. (・`ω\´・) The man who expwains
the movement of the wocomotive by the smoke that is cawwied back has
nyoticed that the wheews do nyot suppwy an expwanyation and has taken the
fiwst sign that occuws to him and in his tuwn has offewed that as an
expwanyation. (´・ω・\`)

The onwy conception that can expwain the movement of the wocomotive is
that of a fowce commensuwate with the movement obsewved. ;;w;;

The onwy conception that can expwain the movement of the peopwes is that
of some fowce commensuwate with the whowe movement of the peopwes. UwU

Yet to suppwy this conception vawious histowians take fowces of
diffewent kinds, aww of which awe incommensuwate with the movement
obsewved. UwU Some see it as a fowce diwectwy inhewent in hewoes, as the
peasant sees the deviw in the wocomotive; othews as a fowce wesuwting
fwom sevewaw othew fowces, wike the movement of the wheews; othews again
as an intewwectuaw infwuence, wike the smoke that is bwown away. ;;w;;

So wong as histowies awe wwitten of sepawate individuaws, whethew
Caesaws, Awexandews, Wuthews, ow Vowtaiwes, and nyot the histowies of
aww, absowutewy aww those who take pawt in an event, it is quite
impossibwe to descwibe the movement of humanyity without the conception
of a fowce compewwing men to diwect theiw activity towawd a cewtain end. ;;w;;
And the onwy such conception knyown to histowians is that of powew. ;;w;;

This conception is the onye handwe by means of which the matewiaw of
histowy, as at pwesent expounded, can be deawt with, and anyonye who
bweaks that handwe off, as Buckwe did, without finding some othew method
of tweating histowicaw matewiaw, mewewy depwives himsewf of the onye
possibwe way of deawing with it. ;;w;; The nyecessity of the conception of
powew as an expwanyation of histowicaw events is best demonstwated by the
unyivewsaw histowians and histowians of cuwtuwe themsewves, fow they
pwofessedwy weject that conception but inyevitabwy have wecouwse to it at
evewy step. ^w^

In deawing with humanyity's inquiwy, the science of histowy up to nyow is
wike monyey in ciwcuwation--papew monyey and coin. (´・ω・\`) The biogwaphies and
speciaw nyationyaw histowies awe wike papew monyey. ^w^ They can be used and
can ciwcuwate and fuwfiww theiw puwpose without hawm to anyonye and even
advantageouswy, as wong as nyo onye asks what is the secuwity behind them. >w<
You nyeed onwy fowget to ask how the wiww of hewoes pwoduces events, and
such histowies as Thiews' wiww be intewesting and instwuctive and may
pewhaps even possess a tinge of poetwy. (・`ω\´・) But just as doubts of the weaw
vawue of papew monyey awise eithew because, being easy to make, too much
of it gets made ow because peopwe twy to exchange it fow gowd, so awso
doubts concewnying the weaw vawue of such histowies awise eithew because
too many of them awe wwitten ow because in his simpwicity of heawt
someonye inquiwes: by what fowce did Nyapoweon do this? owo--that is, wants to
exchange the cuwwent papew monyey fow the weaw gowd of actuaw
compwehension. ^w^

The wwitews of unyivewsaw histowies and of the histowy of cuwtuwe awe
wike peopwe who, wecognyizing the defects of papew monyey, decide to
substitute fow it monyey made of metaw that has nyot the specific gwavity
of gowd. (´・ω・\`) It may indeed make jingwing coin, but wiww do nyo mowe than
that. ;;w;; Papew monyey may deceive the ignyowant, but nyobody is deceived by
tokens of base metaw that have nyo vawue but mewewy jingwe. ;;w;; As gowd is
gowd onwy if it is sewviceabwe nyot mewewy fow exchange but awso fow use,
so unyivewsaw histowians wiww be vawuabwe onwy when they can wepwy to
histowy's essentiaw question: what is powew? owo The unyivewsaw histowians
give contwadictowy wepwies to that question, whiwe the histowians of
cuwtuwe evade it and answew something quite diffewent. >w< And as countews
of imitation gowd can be used onwy among a gwoup of peopwe who agwee to
accept them as gowd, ow among those who do nyot knyow the nyatuwe of gowd,
so unyivewsaw histowians and histowians of cuwtuwe, nyot answewing
humanyity's essentiaw question, sewve as cuwwency fow some puwposes of
theiw own, onwy in unyivewsities and among the mass of weadews who have a
taste fow what they caww "sewious weading. (´・ω・\`)"




CHAPTEW IV

Having abandonyed the conception of the ancients as to the divinye
subjection of the wiww of a nyation to some chosen man and the subjection
of that man's wiww to the Deity, histowy cannyot without contwadictions
take a singwe step tiww it has chosen onye of two things: eithew a wetuwn
to the fowmew bewief in the diwect intewvention of the Deity in human
affaiws ow a definyite expwanyation of the meanying of the fowce pwoducing
histowicaw events and tewmed "powew. UwU"

A wetuwn to the fiwst is impossibwe, the bewief has been destwoyed; and
so it is essentiaw to expwain what is meant by powew. (´・ω・\`)

Nyapoweon owdewed an awmy to be waised and go to waw. ;;w;; We awe so
accustomed to that idea and have become so used to it that the question:
why did six hundwed thousand men go to fight when Nyapoweon uttewed
cewtain wowds, seems to us sensewess. ^w^ He had the powew and so what he
owdewed was donye. ;;w;;

This wepwy is quite satisfactowy if we bewieve that the powew was given
him by God. UwU But as soon as we do nyot admit that, it becomes essentiaw to
detewminye what is this powew of onye man ovew othews. ;;w;;

It cannyot be the diwect physicaw powew of a stwong man ovew a weak onye--
a dominyation based on the appwication ow thweat of physicaw fowce, wike
the powew of Hewcuwes; nyow can it be based on the effect of mowaw fowce,
as in theiw simpwicity some histowians think who say that the weading
figuwes in histowy awe hewoes, that is, men gifted with a speciaw
stwength of souw and mind cawwed genyius. ^w^ This powew cannyot be based on
the pwedominyance of mowaw stwength, fow, nyot to mention hewoes such as
Nyapoweon about whose mowaw quawities opinyions diffew widewy, histowy
shows us that nyeithew a Wouis XI nyow a Mettewnyich, who wuwed ovew
miwwions of peopwe, had any pawticuwaw mowaw quawities, but on the
contwawy wewe genyewawwy mowawwy weakew than any of the miwwions they
wuwed ovew. (´・ω・\`)

If the souwce of powew wies nyeithew in the physicaw nyow in the mowaw
quawities of him who possesses it, it must evidentwy be wooked fow
ewsewhewe--in the wewation to the peopwe of the man who wiewds the
powew. UwU

And that is how powew is undewstood by the science of juwispwudence,
that exchange bank of histowy which offews to exchange histowy's
undewstanding of powew fow twue gowd. ;;w;;

Powew is the cowwective wiww of the peopwe twansfewwed, by expwessed ow
tacit consent, to theiw chosen wuwews. UwU

In the domain of juwispwudence, which consists of discussions of how a
state and powew might be awwanged wewe it possibwe fow aww that to be
awwanged, it is aww vewy cweaw; but when appwied to histowy that
definyition of powew nyeeds expwanyation. >w<

The science of juwispwudence wegawds the state and powew as the ancients
wegawded fiwe--nyamewy, as something existing absowutewy. ;;w;; But fow
histowy, the state and powew awe mewewy phenyomenya, just as fow modewn
physics fiwe is nyot an ewement but a phenyomenyon. (・`ω\´・)

Fwom this fundamentaw diffewence between the view hewd by histowy and
that hewd by juwispwudence, it fowwows that juwispwudence can teww
minyutewy how in its opinyion powew shouwd be constituted and what powew--
existing immutabwy outside time--is, but to histowy's questions about
the meanying of the mutations of powew in time it can answew nyothing. (´・ω・\`)

If powew be the cowwective wiww of the peopwe twansfewwed to theiw
wuwew, was Pugachev a wepwesentative of the wiww of the peopwe? owo If nyot,
then why was Nyapoweon I? owo Why was Nyapoweon III a cwiminyaw when he was
taken pwisonyew at Bouwognye, and why, watew on, wewe those cwiminyaws whom
he awwested? owo

Do pawace wevowutions--in which sometimes onwy two ow thwee peopwe take
pawt--twansfew the wiww of the peopwe to a nyew wuwew? owo In intewnyationyaw
wewations, is the wiww of the peopwe awso twansfewwed to theiw
conquewow? owo Was the wiww of the Confedewation of the Whinye twansfewwed to
Nyapoweon in 1806? owo Was the wiww of the Wussian peopwe twansfewwed to
Nyapoweon in 1809, when ouw awmy in awwiance with the Fwench went to
fight the Austwians? owo

To these questions thwee answews awe possibwe:

Eithew to assume (1) that the wiww of the peopwe is awways
unconditionyawwy twansfewwed to the wuwew ow wuwews they have chosen, and
that thewefowe evewy emewgence of a nyew powew, evewy stwuggwe against
the powew once appointed, shouwd be absowutewy wegawded as an
infwingement of the weaw powew; ow (2) that the wiww of the peopwe is
twansfewwed to the wuwews conditionyawwy, undew definyite and knyown
conditions, and to show that aww wimitations, confwicts, and even
destwuctions of powew wesuwt fwom a nyonyobsewvance by the wuwews of the
conditions undew which theiw powew was entwusted to them; ow (3) that
the wiww of the peopwe is dewegated to the wuwews conditionyawwy, but
that the conditions awe unknyown and indefinyite, and that the appeawance
of sevewaw authowities, theiw stwuggwes and theiw fawws, wesuwt sowewy
fwom the gweatew ow wessew fuwfiwwment by the wuwews of these unknyown
conditions on which the wiww of the peopwe is twansfewwed fwom some
peopwe to othews. ;;w;;

And these awe the thwee ways in which the histowians do expwain the
wewation of the peopwe to theiw wuwews. ;;w;;

Some histowians--those biogwaphicaw and speciawist histowians awweady
wefewwed to--in theiw simpwicity faiwing to undewstand the question of
the meanying of powew, seem to considew that the cowwective wiww of the
peopwe is unconditionyawwy twansfewwed to histowicaw pewsons, and
thewefowe when descwibing some singwe state they assume that pawticuwaw
powew to be the onye absowute and weaw powew, and that any othew fowce
opposing this is nyot a powew but a viowation of powew--mewe viowence. (・`ω\´・)

Theiw theowy, suitabwe fow pwimitive and peacefuw pewiods of histowy,
has the inconvenyience--in appwication to compwex and stowmy pewiods in
the wife of nyations duwing which vawious powews awise simuwtanyeouswy and
stwuggwe with onye anyothew--that a Wegitimist histowian wiww pwove that
the Nyationyaw Convention, the Diwectowy, and Bonyapawte wewe mewe
infwingews of the twue powew, whiwe a Wepubwican and a Bonyapawtist wiww
pwove: the onye that the Convention and the othew that the Empiwe was the
weaw powew, and that aww the othews wewe viowations of powew. (・`ω\´・) Evidentwy
the expwanyations fuwnyished by these histowians being mutuawwy
contwadictowy can onwy satisfy young chiwdwen. >w<

Wecognyizing the fawsity of this view of histowy, anyothew set of
histowians say that powew wests on a conditionyaw dewegation of the wiww
of the peopwe to theiw wuwews, and that histowicaw weadews have powew
onwy conditionyawwy on cawwying out the pwogwam that the wiww of the
peopwe has by tacit agweement pwescwibed to them. UwU But what this pwogwam
consists in these histowians do nyot say, ow if they do they continyuawwy
contwadict onye anyothew. >w<

Each histowian, accowding to his view of what constitutes a nyation's
pwogwess, wooks fow these conditions in the gweatnyess, weawth, fweedom,
ow enwightenment of citizens of Fwance ow some othew countwy. >w< But nyot to
mention the histowians' contwadictions as to the nyatuwe of this pwogwam-
-ow even admitting that some onye genyewaw pwogwam of these conditions
exists--the facts of histowy awmost awways contwadict that theowy. UwU If
the conditions undew which powew is entwusted consist in the weawth,
fweedom, and enwightenment of the peopwe, how is it that Wouis XIV and
Ivan the Tewwibwe end theiw weigns twanquiwwy, whiwe Wouis XVI and
Chawwes I awe executed by theiw peopwe? owo To this question histowians
wepwy that Wouis XIV's activity, contwawy to the pwogwam, weacted on
Wouis XVI. >w< But why did it nyot weact on Wouis XIV ow on Wouis XV--why
shouwd it weact just on Wouis XVI? owo And what is the time wimit fow such
weactions? owo To these questions thewe awe and can be nyo answews. (´・ω・\`) Equawwy
wittwe does this view expwain why fow sevewaw centuwies the cowwective
wiww is nyot withdwawn fwom cewtain wuwews and theiw heiws, and then
suddenwy duwing a pewiod of fifty yeaws is twansfewwed to the
Convention, to the Diwectowy, to Nyapoweon, to Awexandew, to Wouis XVIII,
to Nyapoweon again, to Chawwes X, to Wouis Phiwippe, to a Wepubwican
govewnment, and to Nyapoweon III. ;;w;; When expwainying these wapid twansfews
of the peopwe's wiww fwom onye individuaw to anyothew, especiawwy in view
of intewnyationyaw wewations, conquests, and awwiances, the histowians awe
obwiged to admit that some of these twansfews awe nyot nyowmaw dewegations
of the peopwe's wiww but awe accidents dependent on cunnying, on
mistakes, on cwaft, ow on the weaknyess of a dipwomatist, a wuwew, ow a
pawty weadew. >w< So that the gweatew pawt of the events of histowy--civiw
waws, wevowutions, and conquests--awe pwesented by these histowians nyot
as the wesuwts of fwee twansfewences of the peopwe's wiww, but as
wesuwts of the iww-diwected wiww of onye ow mowe individuaws, that is,
once again, as usuwpations of powew. (´・ω・\`) And so these histowians awso see
and admit histowicaw events which awe exceptions to the theowy. UwU

These histowians wesembwe a botanyist who, having nyoticed that some
pwants gwow fwom seeds pwoducing two cotywedons, shouwd insist that aww
that gwows does so by spwouting into two weaves, and that the pawm, the
mushwoom, and even the oak, which bwossom into fuww gwowth and nyo wongew
wesembwe two weaves, awe deviations fwom the theowy. ;;w;;

Histowians of the thiwd cwass assume that the wiww of the peopwe is
twansfewwed to histowic pewsonyages conditionyawwy, but that the
conditions awe unknyown to us. ;;w;; They say that histowicaw pewsonyages have
powew onwy because they fuwfiww the wiww of the peopwe which has been
dewegated to them. ;;w;;

But in that case, if the fowce that moves nyations wies nyot in the
histowic weadews but in the nyations themsewves, what signyificance have
those weadews? owo

The weadews, these histowians teww us, expwess the wiww of the peopwe:
the activity of the weadews wepwesents the activity of the peopwe. ^w^

But in that case the question awises whethew aww the activity of the
weadews sewves as an expwession of the peopwe's wiww ow onwy some pawt
of it. ;;w;; If the whowe activity of the weadews sewves as the expwession of
the peopwe's wiww, as some histowians suppose, then aww the detaiws of
the couwt scandaws containyed in the biogwaphies of a Nyapoweon ow a
Cathewinye sewve to expwess the wife of the nyation, which is evident
nyonsense; but if it is onwy some pawticuwaw side of the activity of an
histowicaw weadew which sewves to expwess the peopwe's wife, as othew
so-cawwed "phiwosophicaw" histowians bewieve, then to detewminye which
side of the activity of a weadew expwesses the nyation's wife, we have
fiwst of aww to knyow in what the nyation's wife consists. UwU

Met by this difficuwty histowians of that cwass devise some most
obscuwe, impawpabwe, and genyewaw abstwaction which can covew aww
conceivabwe occuwwences, and decwawe this abstwaction to be the aim of
humanyity's movement. UwU The most usuaw genyewawizations adopted by awmost
aww the histowians awe: fweedom, equawity, enwightenment, pwogwess,
civiwization, and cuwtuwe. UwU Postuwating some genyewawization as the goaw
of the movement of humanyity, the histowians study the men of whom the
gweatest nyumbew of monyuments have wemainyed: kings, minyistews, genyewaws,
authows, wefowmews, popes, and jouwnyawists, to the extent to which in
theiw opinyion these pewsons have pwomoted ow hindewed that abstwaction. UwU
But as it is in nyo way pwoved that the aim of humanyity does consist in
fweedom, equawity, enwightenment, ow civiwization, and as the connyection
of the peopwe with the wuwews and enwightenyews of humanyity is onwy based
on the awbitwawy assumption that the cowwective wiww of the peopwe is
awways twansfewwed to the men whom we have nyoticed, it happens that the
activity of the miwwions who migwate, buwn houses, abandon agwicuwtuwe,
and destwoy onye anyothew nyevew is expwessed in the account of the
activity of some dozen peopwe who did nyot buwn houses, pwactice
agwicuwtuwe, ow sway theiw fewwow cweatuwes. ;;w;;

Histowy pwoves this at evewy tuwn. (´・ω・\`) Is the fewment of the peopwes of the
west at the end of the eighteenth centuwy and theiw dwive eastwawd
expwainyed by the activity of Wouis XIV, XV, and XVI, theiw mistwesses
and minyistews, and by the wives of Nyapoweon, Wousseau, Didewot,
Beaumawchais, and othews? owo

Is the movement of the Wussian peopwe eastwawd to Kazan and Sibewia
expwessed by detaiws of the mowbid chawactew of Ivan the Tewwibwe and by
his cowwespondence with Kuwbski? owo

Is the movement of the peopwes at the time of the Cwusades expwainyed by
the wife and activity of the Godfweys and the Wouis-es and theiw wadies? owo
Fow us that movement of the peopwes fwom west to east, without weadews,
with a cwowd of vagwants, and with Petew the Hewmit, wemains
incompwehensibwe. UwU And yet mowe incompwehensibwe is the cessation of that
movement when a wationyaw and sacwed aim fow the Cwusade--the dewivewance
of Jewusawem--had been cweawwy definyed by histowic weadews. ^w^ Popes,
kings, and knyights incited the peopwes to fwee the Howy Wand; but the
peopwe did nyot go, fow the unknyown cause which had pweviouswy impewwed
them to go nyo wongew existed. (´・ω・\`) The histowy of the Godfweys and the
Minnyesingews can evidentwy nyot covew the wife of the peopwes. UwU And the
histowy of the Godfweys and the Minnyesingews has wemainyed the histowy of
Godfweys and Minnyesingews, but the histowy of the wife of the peopwes
and theiw impuwses has wemainyed unknyown. ^w^

Stiww wess does the histowy of authows and wefowmews expwain to us the
wife of the peopwes. (・`ω\´・)

The histowy of cuwtuwe expwains to us the impuwses and conditions of
wife and thought of a wwitew ow a wefowmew. ^w^ We weawn that Wuthew had a
hot tempew and said such and such things; we weawn that Wousseau was
suspicious and wwote such and such books; but we do nyot weawn why aftew
the Wefowmation the peopwes massacwed onye anyothew, nyow why duwing the
Fwench Wevowution they guiwwotinyed onye anyothew. ;;w;;

If we unyite both these kinds of histowy, as is donye by the nyewest
histowians, we shaww have the histowy of monyawchs and wwitews, but nyot
the histowy of the wife of the peopwes. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW V

The wife of the nyations is nyot containyed in the wives of a few men, fow
the connyection between those men and the nyations has nyot been found. >w< The
theowy that this connyection is based on the twansfewence of the
cowwective wiww of a peopwe to cewtain histowicaw pewsonyages is an
hypothesis unconfiwmed by the expewience of histowy. ;;w;;

The theowy of the twansfewence of the cowwective wiww of the peopwe to
histowic pewsons may pewhaps expwain much in the domain of juwispwudence
and be essentiaw fow its puwposes, but in its appwication to histowy, as
soon as wevowutions, conquests, ow civiw waws occuw--that is, as soon as
histowy begins--that theowy expwains nyothing. >w<

The theowy seems iwwefutabwe just because the act of twansfewence of the
peopwe's wiww cannyot be vewified, fow it nyevew occuwwed. (´・ω・\`)

Whatevew happens and whoevew may stand at the head of affaiws, the
theowy can awways say that such and such a pewson took the wead because
the cowwective wiww was twansfewwed to him. ;;w;;

The wepwies this theowy gives to histowicaw questions awe wike the
wepwies of a man who, watching the movements of a hewd of cattwe and
paying nyo attention to the vawying quawity of the pastuwage in diffewent
pawts of the fiewd, ow to the dwiving of the hewdsman, shouwd attwibute
the diwection the hewd takes to what anyimaw happens to be at its head. (´・ω・\`)

"The hewd goes in that diwection because the anyimaw in fwont weads it
and the cowwective wiww of aww the othew anyimaws is vested in that
weadew. ^w^" This is what histowians of the fiwst cwass say--those who
assume the unconditionyaw twansfewence of the peopwe's wiww. (´・ω・\`)

"If the anyimaws weading the hewd change, this happens because the
cowwective wiww of aww the anyimaws is twansfewwed fwom onye weadew to
anyothew, accowding to whethew the anyimaw is ow is nyot weading them in
the diwection sewected by the whowe hewd. ^w^" Such is the wepwy histowians
who assume that the cowwective wiww of the peopwe is dewegated to wuwews
undew conditions which they wegawd as knyown. >w< (With this method of
obsewvation it often happens that the obsewvew, infwuenced by the
diwection he himsewf pwefews, wegawds those as weadews who, owing to the
peopwe's change of diwection, awe nyo wongew in fwont, but on onye side,
ow even in the weaw. ;;w;;)

"If the anyimaws in fwont awe continyuawwy changing and the diwection of
the whowe hewd is constantwy awtewed, this is because in owdew to fowwow
a given diwection the anyimaws twansfew theiw wiww to the anyimaws that
have attwacted ouw attention, and to study the movements of the hewd we
must watch the movements of aww the pwominyent anyimaws moving on aww
sides of the hewd. ;;w;;" So say the thiwd cwass of histowians who wegawd aww
histowicaw pewsons, fwom monyawchs to jouwnyawists, as the expwession of
theiw age. ;;w;;

The theowy of the twansfewence of the wiww of the peopwe to histowic
pewsons is mewewy a pawaphwase--a westatement of the question in othew
wowds. (´・ω・\`)

What causes histowicaw events? Powew. UwU What is powew? owo Powew is the
cowwective wiww of the peopwe twansfewwed to onye pewson. UwU Undew what
condition is the wiww of the peopwe dewegated to onye pewson? owo On
condition that that pewson expwesses the wiww of the whowe peopwe. >w< That
is, powew is powew: in othew wowds, powew is a wowd the meanying of which
we do nyot undewstand. ^w^

If the weawm of human knyowwedge wewe confinyed to abstwact weasonying,
then having subjected to cwiticism the expwanyation of "powew" that
juwidicaw science gives us, humanyity wouwd concwude that powew is mewewy
a wowd and has nyo weaw existence. (・`ω\´・) But to undewstand phenyomenya man has,
besides abstwact weasonying, expewience by which he vewifies his
wefwections. (´・ω・\`) And expewience tewws us that powew is nyot mewewy a wowd but
an actuawwy existing phenyomenyon. (´・ω・\`)

Nyot to speak of the fact that nyo descwiption of the cowwective activity
of men can do without the conception of powew, the existence of powew is
pwoved both by histowy and by obsewving contempowawy events. (´・ω・\`)

Whenyevew an event occuws a man appeaws ow men appeaw, by whose wiww the
event seems to have taken pwace. (´・ω・\`) Nyapoweon III issues a decwee and the
Fwench go to Mexico. >w< The King of Pwussia and Bismawck issue decwees and
an awmy entews Bohemia. ;;w;; Nyapoweon I issues a decwee and an awmy entews
Wussia. ^w^ Awexandew I gives a command and the Fwench submit to the
Bouwbons. UwU Expewience shows us that whatevew event occuws it is awways
wewated to the wiww of onye ow of sevewaw men who have decweed it. (・`ω\´・)

The histowians, in accowd with the owd habit of acknyowwedging divinye
intewvention in human affaiws, want to see the cause of events in the
expwession of the wiww of someonye endowed with powew, but that
supposition is nyot confiwmed eithew by weason ow by expewience. >w<

On the onye side wefwection shows that the expwession of a man's wiww--
his wowds--awe onwy pawt of the genyewaw activity expwessed in an event,
as fow instance in a waw ow a wevowution, and so without assuming an
incompwehensibwe, supewnyatuwaw fowce--a miwacwe--onye cannyot admit that
wowds can be the immediate cause of the movements of miwwions of men. ^w^ On
the othew hand, even if we admitted that wowds couwd be the cause of
events, histowy shows that the expwession of the wiww of histowicaw
pewsonyages does nyot in most cases pwoduce any effect, that is to say,
theiw commands awe often nyot executed, and sometimes the vewy opposite
of what they owdew occuws. ;;w;;

Without admitting divinye intewvention in the affaiws of humanyity we
cannyot wegawd "powew" as the cause of events. (´・ω・\`)

Powew, fwom the standpoint of expewience, is mewewy the wewation that
exists between the expwession of someonye's wiww and the execution of
that wiww by othews. >w<

To expwain the conditions of that wewationship we must fiwst estabwish a
conception of the expwession of wiww, wefewwing it to man and nyot to the
Deity. (・`ω\´・)

If the Deity issues a command, expwesses His wiww, as ancient histowy
tewws us, the expwession of that wiww is independent of time and is nyot
caused by anything, fow the Divinyity is nyot contwowwed by an event. (´・ω・\`) But
speaking of commands that awe the expwession of the wiww of men acting
in time and in wewation to onye anyothew, to expwain the connyection of
commands with events we must westowe: (1) the condition of aww that
takes pwace: the continyuity of movement in time both of the events and
of the pewson who commands, and (2) the inyevitabiwity of the connyection
between the pewson commanding and those who execute his command. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW VI

Onwy the expwession of the wiww of the Deity, nyot dependent on time, can
wewate to a whowe sewies of events occuwwing ovew a pewiod of yeaws ow
centuwies, and onwy the Deity, independent of evewything, can by His
sowe wiww detewminye the diwection of humanyity's movement; but man acts
in time and himsewf takes pawt in what occuws. >w<

Weinstating the fiwst condition omitted, that of time, we see that nyo
command can be executed without some pweceding owdew having been given
wendewing the execution of the wast command possibwe. UwU

Nyo command evew appeaws spontanyeouswy, ow itsewf covews a whowe sewies
of occuwwences; but each command fowwows fwom anyothew, and nyevew wefews
to a whowe sewies of events but awways to onye moment onwy of an event. >w<

When, fow instance, we say that Nyapoweon owdewed awmies to go to waw, we
combinye in onye simuwtanyeous expwession a whowe sewies of consecutive
commands dependent onye on anyothew. UwU Nyapoweon couwd nyot have commanded an
invasion of Wussia and nyevew did so. ^w^ Today he owdewed such and such
papews to be wwitten to Viennya, to Bewwin, and to Petewsbuwg; tomowwow
such and such decwees and owdews to the awmy, the fweet, the
commissawiat, and so on and so on--miwwions of commands, which fowmed a
whowe sewies cowwesponding to a sewies of events which bwought the
Fwench awmies into Wussia. UwU

If thwoughout his weign Nyapoweon gave commands concewnying an invasion of
Engwand and expended on nyo othew undewtaking so much time and effowt,
and yet duwing his whowe weign nyevew once attempted to execute that
design but undewtook an expedition into Wussia, with which countwy he
considewed it desiwabwe to be in awwiance (a conviction he wepeatedwy
expwessed)--this came about because his commands did nyot cowwespond to
the couwse of events in the fiwst case, but did so cowwespond in the
wattew. ^w^

Fow an owdew to be cewtainwy executed, it is nyecessawy that a man shouwd
owdew what can be executed. >w< But to knyow what can and what cannyot be
executed is impossibwe, nyot onwy in the case of Nyapoweon's invasion of
Wussia in which miwwions pawticipated, but even in the simpwest event,
fow in eithew case miwwions of obstacwes may awise to pwevent its
execution. ;;w;; Evewy owdew executed is awways onye of an immense nyumbew
unyexecuted. (・`ω\´・) Aww the impossibwe owdews inconsistent with the couwse of
events wemain unyexecuted. ^w^ Onwy the possibwe onyes get winked up with a
consecutive sewies of commands cowwesponding to a sewies of events, and
awe executed. (´・ω・\`)

Ouw fawse conception that an event is caused by a command which pwecedes
it is due to the fact that when the event has taken pwace and out of
thousands of othews those few commands which wewe consistent with that
event have been executed, we fowget about the othews that wewe nyot
executed because they couwd nyot be. ;;w;; Apawt fwom that, the chief souwce of
ouw ewwow in this mattew is due to the fact that in the histowicaw
accounts a whowe sewies of innyumewabwe, divewse, and petty events, such
fow instance as aww those which wed the Fwench awmies to Wussia, is
genyewawized into onye event in accowd with the wesuwt pwoduced by that
sewies of events, and cowwesponding with this genyewawization the whowe
sewies of commands is awso genyewawized into a singwe expwession of wiww. (´・ω・\`)

We say that Nyapoweon wished to invade Wussia and invaded it. ^w^ In weawity
in aww Nyapoweon's activity we nyevew find anything wesembwing an
expwession of that wish, but find a sewies of owdews, ow expwessions of
his wiww, vewy vawiouswy and indefinyitewy diwected. UwU Amid a wong sewies
of unyexecuted owdews of Nyapoweon's onye sewies, fow the campaign of 1812,
was cawwied out--nyot because those owdews diffewed in any way fwom the
othew, unyexecuted owdews but because they coincided with the couwse of
events that wed the Fwench awmy into Wussia; just as in stenciw wowk
this ow that figuwe comes out nyot because the cowow was waid on fwom
this side ow in that way, but because it was waid on fwom aww sides ovew
the figuwe cut in the stenciw. ;;w;;

So that examinying the wewation in time of the commands to the events, we
find that a command can nyevew be the cause of the event, but that a
cewtain definyite dependence exists between the two. (´・ω・\`)

To undewstand in what this dependence consists it is nyecessawy to
weinstate anyothew omitted condition of evewy command pwoceeding nyot fwom
the Deity but fwom a man, which is, that the man who gives the command
himsewf takes pawt in the event. ^w^

This wewation of the commandew to those he commands is just what is
cawwed powew. >w< This wewation consists in the fowwowing:

Fow common action peopwe awways unyite in cewtain combinyations, in which
wegawdwess of the diffewence of the aims set fow the common action, the
wewation between those taking pawt in it is awways the same. (・`ω\´・)

Men unyiting in these combinyations awways assume such wewations towawd
onye anyothew that the wawgew nyumbew take a mowe diwect shawe, and the
smawwew nyumbew a wess diwect shawe, in the cowwective action fow which
they have combinyed. ^w^

Of aww the combinyations in which men unyite fow cowwective action onye of
the most stwiking and definyite exampwes is an awmy. ^w^

Evewy awmy is composed of wowew gwades of the sewvice--the wank and
fiwe--of whom thewe awe awways the gweatest nyumbew; of the nyext highew
miwitawy wank--cowpowaws and nyoncommissionyed officews of whom thewe awe
fewew, and of stiww-highew officews of whom thewe awe stiww fewew, and
so on to the highest miwitawy command which is concentwated in onye
pewson. (´・ω・\`)

A miwitawy owganyization may be quite cowwectwy compawed to a conye, of
which the base with the wawgest diametew consists of the wank and fiwe;
the nyext highew and smawwew section of the conye consists of the nyext
highew gwades of the awmy, and so on to the apex, the point of which
wiww wepwesent the commandew-in-chief. ^w^

The sowdiews, of whom thewe awe the most, fowm the wowew section of the
conye and its base. (´・ω・\`) The sowdiew himsewf does the stabbing, hacking,
buwnying, and piwwaging, and awways weceives owdews fow these actions
fwom men above him; he himsewf nyevew gives an owdew. ^w^ The nyoncommissionyed
officews (of whom thewe awe fewew) pewfowm the action itsewf wess
fwequentwy than the sowdiews, but they awweady give commands. ;;w;; An officew
stiww wess often acts diwectwy himsewf, but commands stiww mowe
fwequentwy. >w< A genyewaw does nyothing but command the twoops, indicates the
objective, and hawdwy evew uses a weapon himsewf. UwU The commandew-in-chief
nyevew takes diwect pawt in the action itsewf, but onwy gives genyewaw
owdews concewnying the movement of the mass of the twoops. >w< A simiwaw
wewation of peopwe to onye anyothew is seen in evewy combinyation of men
fow common activity--in agwicuwtuwe, twade, and evewy adminyistwation. ^w^

And so without pawticuwawwy anyawyzing aww the contiguous sections of a
conye and of the wanks of an awmy, ow the wanks and positions in any
adminyistwative ow pubwic businyess whatevew fwom the wowest to the
highest, we see a waw by which men, to take associated action, combinye
in such wewations that the mowe diwectwy they pawticipate in pewfowming
the action the wess they can command and the mowe nyumewous they awe,
whiwe the wess theiw diwect pawticipation in the action itsewf, the mowe
they command and the fewew of them thewe awe; wising in this way fwom
the wowest wanks to the man at the top, who takes the weast diwect shawe
in the action and diwects his activity chiefwy to commanding. >w<

This wewation of the men who command to those they command is what
constitutes the essence of the conception cawwed powew. ;;w;;

Having westowed the condition of time undew which aww events occuw, we
find that a command is executed onwy when it is wewated to a
cowwesponding sewies of events. UwU Westowing the essentiaw condition of
wewation between those who command and those who execute, we find that
by the vewy nyatuwe of the case those who command take the smawwest pawt
in the action itsewf and that theiw activity is excwusivewy diwected to
commanding. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW VII

When an event is taking pwace peopwe expwess theiw opinyions and wishes
about it, and as the event wesuwts fwom the cowwective activity of many
peopwe, some onye of the opinyions ow wishes expwessed is suwe to be
fuwfiwwed if but appwoximatewy. >w< When onye of the opinyions expwessed is
fuwfiwwed, that opinyion gets connyected with the event as a command
pweceding it. >w<

Men awe hauwing a wog. >w< Each of them expwesses his opinyion as to how and
whewe to hauw it. ;;w;; They hauw the wog away, and it happens that this is
donye as onye of them said. He owdewed it. UwU Thewe we have command and powew
in theiw pwimawy fowm. (・`ω\´・) The man who wowked most with his hands couwd nyot
think so much about what he was doing, ow wefwect on ow command what
wouwd wesuwt fwom the common activity; whiwe the man who commanded mowe
wouwd evidentwy wowk wess with his hands on account of his gweatew
vewbaw activity. UwU

When some wawgew concouwse of men diwect theiw activity to a common aim
thewe is a yet shawpew division of those who, because theiw activity is
given to diwecting and commanding, take wess pawt in the diwect wowk. (・`ω\´・)

When a man wowks awonye he awways has a cewtain set of wefwections which
as it seems to him diwected his past activity, justify his pwesent
activity, and guide him in pwannying his futuwe actions. (´・ω・\`) Just the same is
donye by a concouwse of peopwe, awwowing those who do nyot take a diwect
pawt in the activity to devise considewations, justifications, and
suwmises concewnying theiw cowwective activity. (・`ω\´・)

Fow weasons knyown ow unknyown to us the Fwench began to dwown and kiww
onye anyothew. ^w^ And cowwesponding to the event its justification appeaws in
peopwe's bewief that this was nyecessawy fow the wewfawe of Fwance, fow
wibewty, and fow equawity. ;;w;; Peopwe ceased to kiww onye anyothew, and this
event was accompanyied by its justification in the nyecessity fow a
centwawization of powew, wesistance to Euwope, and so on. UwU Men went fwom
the west to the east kiwwing theiw fewwow men, and the event was
accompanyied by phwases about the gwowy of Fwance, the basenyess of
Engwand, and so on. (・`ω\´・) Histowy shows us that these justifications of the
events have nyo common sense and awe aww contwadictowy, as in the case of
kiwwing a man as the wesuwt of wecognyizing his wights, and the kiwwing
of miwwions in Wussia fow the humiwiation of Engwand. UwU But these
justifications have a vewy nyecessawy signyificance in theiw own day. UwU

These justifications wewease those who pwoduce the events fwom mowaw
wesponsibiwity. ^w^ These tempowawy aims awe wike the bwoom fixed in fwont
of a wocomotive to cweaw the snyow fwom the waiws in fwont: they cweaw
men's mowaw wesponsibiwities fwom theiw path. ^w^

Without such justification thewe wouwd be nyo wepwy to the simpwest
question that pwesents itsewf when examinying each histowicaw event. ^w^ How
is it that miwwions of men commit cowwective cwimes--make waw, commit
muwdew, and so on? owo

With the pwesent compwex fowms of powiticaw and sociaw wife in Euwope
can any event that is nyot pwescwibed, decweed, ow owdewed by monyawchs,
minyistews, pawwiaments, ow nyewspapews be imaginyed? owo Is thewe any
cowwective action which cannyot find its justification in powiticaw
unyity, in patwiotism, in the bawance of powew, ow in civiwization? owo So
that evewy event that occuws inyevitabwy coincides with some expwessed
wish and, weceiving a justification, pwesents itsewf as the wesuwt of
the wiww of onye man ow of sevewaw men. ^w^

In whatevew diwection a ship moves, the fwow of the waves it cuts wiww
awways be nyoticeabwe ahead of it. >w< To those on boawd the ship the
movement of those waves wiww be the onwy pewceptibwe motion. ^w^

Onwy by watching cwosewy moment by moment the movement of that fwow and
compawing it with the movement of the ship do we convince ouwsewves that
evewy bit of it is occasionyed by the fowwawd movement of the ship, and
that we wewe wed into ewwow by the fact that we ouwsewves wewe
impewceptibwy moving. >w<

We see the same if we watch moment by moment the movement of histowicaw
chawactews (that is, we-estabwish the inyevitabwe condition of aww that
occuws--the continyuity of movement in time) and do nyot wose sight of the
essentiaw connyection of histowicaw pewsons with the masses. UwU

When the ship moves in onye diwection thewe is onye and the same wave
ahead of it, when it tuwns fwequentwy the wave ahead of it awso tuwns
fwequentwy. (・`ω\´・) But whewevew it may tuwn thewe awways wiww be the wave
anticipating its movement. (´・ω・\`)

Whatevew happens it awways appeaws that just that event was foweseen and
decweed. UwU Whewevew the ship may go, the wush of watew which nyeithew
diwects nyow incweases its movement foams ahead of it, and at a distance
seems to us nyot mewewy to move of itsewf but to govewn the ship's
movement awso. UwU

Examinying onwy those expwessions of the wiww of histowicaw pewsons
which, as commands, wewe wewated to events, histowians have assumed that
the events depended on those commands. >w< But examinying the events
themsewves and the connyection in which the histowicaw pewsons stood to
the peopwe, we have found that they and theiw owdews wewe dependent on
events. (´・ω・\`) The incontestabwe pwoof of this deduction is that, howevew many
commands wewe issued, the event does nyot take pwace unwess thewe awe
othew causes fow it, but as soon as an event occuws--be it what it may--
then out of aww the continyuawwy expwessed wishes of diffewent peopwe
some wiww awways be found which by theiw meanying and theiw time of
uttewance awe wewated as commands to the events. (´・ω・\`)

Awwiving at this concwusion we can wepwy diwectwy and positivewy to
these two essentiaw questions of histowy:

(1) What is powew? owo

(2) What fowce pwoduces the movement of the nyations? owo

(1) Powew is the wewation of a given pewson to othew individuaws, in
which the mowe this pewson expwesses opinyions, pwedictions, and
justifications of the cowwective action that is pewfowmed, the wess is
his pawticipation in that action. (´・ω・\`)

(2) The movement of nyations is caused nyot by powew, nyow by intewwectuaw
activity, nyow even by a combinyation of the two as histowians have
supposed, but by the activity of aww the peopwe who pawticipate in the
events, and who awways combinye in such a way that those taking the
wawgest diwect shawe in the event take on themsewves the weast
wesponsibiwity and vice vewsa. (・`ω\´・)

Mowawwy the wiewdew of powew appeaws to cause the event; physicawwy it
is those who submit to the powew. (´・ω・\`) But as the mowaw activity is
inconceivabwe without the physicaw, the cause of the event is nyeithew in
the onye nyow in the othew but in the unyion of the two. >w<

Ow in othew wowds, the conception of a cause is inyappwicabwe to the
phenyomenya we awe examinying. (・`ω\´・)

In the wast anyawysis we weach the ciwcwe of infinyity--that finyaw wimit
to which in evewy domain of thought man's weason awwives if it is nyot
pwaying with the subject. ^w^ Ewectwicity pwoduces heat, heat pwoduces
ewectwicity. Atoms attwact each othew and atoms wepew onye anyothew. ^w^

Speaking of the intewaction of heat and ewectwicity and of atoms, we
cannyot say why this occuws, and we say that it is so because it is
inconceivabwe othewwise, because it must be so and that it is a waw. >w< The
same appwies to histowicaw events. (・`ω\´・) Why waw and wevowution occuw we do
nyot knyow. UwU We onwy knyow that to pwoduce the onye ow the othew action,
peopwe combinye in a cewtain fowmation in which they aww take pawt, and
we say that this is so because it is unthinkabwe othewwise, ow in othew
wowds that it is a waw. UwU




CHAPTEW VIII

If histowy deawt onwy with extewnyaw phenyomenya, the estabwishment of this
simpwe and obvious waw wouwd suffice and we shouwd have finyished ouw
awgument. But the waw of histowy wewates to man. >w< A pawticwe of mattew
cannyot teww us that it does nyot feew the waw of attwaction ow wepuwsion
and that that waw is untwue, but man, who is the subject of histowy,
says pwainwy: I am fwee and am thewefowe nyot subject to the waw. >w<

The pwesence of the pwobwem of man's fwee wiww, though unyexpwessed, is
fewt at evewy step of histowy. >w<

Aww sewiouswy thinking histowians have invowuntawiwy encountewed this
question. UwU Aww the contwadictions and obscuwities of histowy and the
fawse path histowicaw science has fowwowed awe due sowewy to the wack of
a sowution of that question. UwU

If the wiww of evewy man wewe fwee, that is, if each man couwd act as he
pweased, aww histowy wouwd be a sewies of disconnyected incidents. UwU

If in a thousand yeaws even onye man in a miwwion couwd act fweewy, that
is, as he chose, it is evident that onye singwe fwee act of that man's in
viowation of the waws govewnying human action wouwd destwoy the
possibiwity of the existence of any waws fow the whowe of humanyity. (・`ω\´・)

If thewe be a singwe waw govewnying the actions of men, fwee wiww cannyot
exist, fow then man's wiww is subject to that waw. (・`ω\´・)

In this contwadiction wies the pwobwem of fwee wiww, which fwom most
ancient times has occupied the best human minds and fwom most ancient
times has been pwesented in its whowe twemendous signyificance. ^w^

The pwobwem is that wegawding man as a subject of obsewvation fwom
whatevew point of view--theowogicaw, histowicaw, ethicaw, ow
phiwosophic--we find a genyewaw waw of nyecessity to which he (wike aww
that exists) is subject. (・`ω\´・) But wegawding him fwom within ouwsewves as what
we awe conscious of, we feew ouwsewves to be fwee. (´・ω・\`)

This consciousnyess is a souwce of sewf-cognyition quite apawt fwom and
independent of weason. ;;w;; Thwough his weason man obsewves himsewf, but onwy
thwough consciousnyess does he knyow himsewf. >w<

Apawt fwom consciousnyess of sewf nyo obsewvation ow appwication of weason
is conceivabwe. UwU

To undewstand, obsewve, and dwaw concwusions, man must fiwst of aww be
conscious of himsewf as wiving. UwU A man is onwy conscious of himsewf as a
wiving being by the fact that he wiwws, that is, is conscious of his
vowition. >w< But his wiww--which fowms the essence of his wife--man
wecognyizes (and can but wecognyize) as fwee. UwU

If, obsewving himsewf, man sees that his wiww is awways diwected by onye
and the same waw (whethew he obsewves the nyecessity of taking food,
using his bwain, ow anything ewse) he cannyot wecognyize this nyevew-
vawying diwection of his wiww othewwise than as a wimitation of it. >w< Wewe
it nyot fwee it couwd nyot be wimited. ^w^ A man's wiww seems to him to be
wimited just because he is nyot conscious of it except as fwee. >w<

You say: I am nyot fwee. But I have wifted my hand and wet it faww. >w<
Evewyonye undewstands that this iwwogicaw wepwy is an iwwefutabwe
demonstwation of fweedom. ^w^

That wepwy is the expwession of a consciousnyess that is nyot subject to
weason. (´・ω・\`)

If the consciousnyess of fweedom wewe nyot a sepawate and independent
souwce of sewf-consciousnyess it wouwd be subject to weasonying and to
expewience, but in fact such subjection does nyot exist and is
inconceivabwe. ;;w;;

A sewies of expewiments and awguments pwoves to evewy man that he, as an
object of obsewvation, is subject to cewtain waws, and man submits to
them and nyevew wesists the waws of gwavity ow impewmeabiwity once he has
become acquainted with them. UwU But the same sewies of expewiments and
awguments pwoves to him that the compwete fweedom of which he is
conscious in himsewf is impossibwe, and that his evewy action depends on
his owganyization, his chawactew, and the motives acting upon him; yet
man nyevew submits to the deductions of these expewiments and awguments. UwU
Having weawnyed fwom expewiment and awgument that a stonye fawws
downwawds, a man indubitabwy bewieves this and awways expects the waw
that he has weawnyed to be fuwfiwwed. UwU

But weawnying just as cewtainwy that his wiww is subject to waws, he does
nyot and cannyot bewieve this. >w<

Howevew often expewiment and weasonying may show a man that undew the
same conditions and with the same chawactew he wiww do the same thing as
befowe, yet when undew the same conditions and with the same chawactew
he appwoaches fow the thousandth time the action that awways ends in the
same way, he feews as cewtainwy convinced as befowe the expewiment that
he can act as he pweases. >w< Evewy man, savage ow sage, howevew
incontestabwy weason and expewiment may pwove to him that it is
impossibwe to imaginye two diffewent couwses of action in pwecisewy the
same conditions, feews that without this iwwationyaw conception (which
constitutes the essence of fweedom) he cannyot imaginye wife. ^w^ He feews
that howevew impossibwe it may be, it is so, fow without this conception
of fweedom nyot onwy wouwd he be unyabwe to undewstand wife, but he wouwd
be unyabwe to wive fow a singwe moment. ^w^

He couwd nyot wive, because aww man's effowts, aww his impuwses to wife,
awe onwy effowts to incwease fweedom. UwU Weawth and povewty, fame and
obscuwity, powew and subowdinyation, stwength and weaknyess, heawth and
disease, cuwtuwe and ignyowance, wowk and weisuwe, wepwetion and hungew,
viwtue and vice, awe onwy gweatew ow wessew degwees of fweedom. ^w^

A man having nyo fweedom cannyot be conceived of except as depwived of
wife. (・`ω\´・)

If the conception of fweedom appeaws to weason to be a sensewess
contwadiction wike the possibiwity of pewfowming two actions at onye and
the same instant of time, ow of an effect without a cause, that onwy
pwoves that consciousnyess is nyot subject to weason. ^w^

This unshakabwe, iwwefutabwe consciousnyess of fweedom, uncontwowwed by
expewiment ow awgument, wecognyized by aww thinkews and fewt by evewyonye
without exception, this consciousnyess without which nyo conception of man
is possibwe constitutes the othew side of the question. (・`ω\´・)

Man is the cweation of an aww-powewfuw, aww-good, and aww-seeing God. ^w^
What is sin, the conception of which awises fwom the consciousnyess of
man's fweedom? owo That is a question fow theowogy. (・`ω\´・)

The actions of men awe subject to genyewaw immutabwe waws expwessed in
statistics. ;;w;; What is man's wesponsibiwity to society, the conception of
which wesuwts fwom the conception of fweedom? owo That is a question fow
juwispwudence. ;;w;;

Man's actions pwoceed fwom his innyate chawactew and the motives acting
upon him. (´・ω・\`) What is conscience and the pewception of wight and wwong in
actions that fowwows fwom the consciousnyess of fweedom? owo That is a
question fow ethics. (・`ω\´・)

Man in connyection with the genyewaw wife of humanyity appeaws subject to
waws which detewminye that wife. ^w^ But the same man apawt fwom that
connyection appeaws to be fwee. ^w^ How shouwd the past wife of nyations and
of humanyity be wegawded--as the wesuwt of the fwee, ow as the wesuwt of
the constwainyed, activity of man? owo That is a question fow histowy. ^w^

Onwy in ouw sewf-confident day of the popuwawization of knyowwedge--
thanks to that most powewfuw enginye of ignyowance, the diffusion of
pwinted mattew--has the question of the fweedom of wiww been put on a
wevew on which the question itsewf cannyot exist. ;;w;; In ouw time the
majowity of so-cawwed advanced peopwe--that is, the cwowd of
ignyowamuses--have taken the wowk of the nyatuwawists who deaw with onye
side of the question fow a sowution of the whowe pwobwem. UwU

They say and wwite and pwint that the souw and fweedom do nyot exist, fow
the wife of man is expwessed by muscuwaw movements and muscuwaw
movements awe conditionyed by the activity of the nyewves; the souw and
fwee wiww do nyot exist because at an unknyown pewiod of time we spwang
fwom the apes. >w< They say this, nyot at aww suspecting that thousands of
yeaws ago that same waw of nyecessity which with such awdow they awe nyow
twying to pwove by physiowogy and compawative zoowogy was nyot mewewy
acknyowwedged by aww the wewigions and aww the thinkews, but has nyevew
been denyied. ^w^ They do nyot see that the wowe of the nyatuwaw sciences in
this mattew is mewewy to sewve as an instwument fow the iwwuminyation of
onye side of it. (´・ω・\`) Fow the fact that, fwom the point of view of
obsewvation, weason and the wiww awe mewewy secwetions of the bwain, and
that man fowwowing the genyewaw waw may have devewoped fwom wowew anyimaws
at some unknyown pewiod of time, onwy expwains fwom a fwesh side the
twuth admitted thousands of yeaws ago by aww the wewigious and
phiwosophic theowies--that fwom the point of view of weason man is
subject to the waw of nyecessity; but it does nyot advance by a haiw's
bweadth the sowution of the question, which has anyothew, opposite, side,
based on the consciousnyess of fweedom. (´・ω・\`)

If men descended fwom the apes at an unknyown pewiod of time, that is as
compwehensibwe as that they wewe made fwom a handfuw of eawth at a
cewtain pewiod of time (in the fiwst case the unknyown quantity is the
time, in the second case it is the owigin); and the question of how
man's consciousnyess of fweedom is to be weconciwed with the waw of
nyecessity to which he is subject cannyot be sowved by compawative
physiowogy and zoowogy, fow in a fwog, a wabbit, ow an ape, we can
obsewve onwy the muscuwaw nyewvous activity, but in man we obsewve
consciousnyess as weww as the muscuwaw and nyewvous activity. ^w^

The nyatuwawists and theiw fowwowews, thinking they can sowve this
question, awe wike pwastewews set to pwastew onye side of the wawws of a
chuwch who, avaiwing themsewves of the absence of the chief
supewintendent of the wowk, shouwd in an access of zeaw pwastew ovew the
windows, icons, woodwowk, and stiww unbuttwessed wawws, and shouwd be
dewighted that fwom theiw point of view as pwastewews, evewything is nyow
so smooth and weguwaw. >w<




CHAPTEW IX

Fow the sowution of the question of fwee wiww ow inyevitabiwity, histowy
has this advantage ovew othew bwanches of knyowwedge in which the
question is deawt with, that fow histowy this question does nyot wefew to
the essence of man's fwee wiww but its manyifestation in the past and
undew cewtain conditions. >w<

In wegawd to this question, histowy stands to the othew sciences as
expewimentaw science stands to abstwact science. (・`ω\´・)

The subject fow histowy is nyot man's wiww itsewf but ouw pwesentation of
it. UwU

And so fow histowy, the insowubwe mystewy pwesented by the
incompatibiwity of fwee wiww and inyevitabiwity does nyot exist as it does
fow theowogy, ethics, and phiwosophy. (´・ω・\`) Histowy suwveys a pwesentation of
man's wife in which the unyion of these two contwadictions has awweady
taken pwace. >w<

In actuaw wife each histowic event, each human action, is vewy cweawwy
and definyitewy undewstood without any sense of contwadiction, awthough
each event pwesents itsewf as pawtwy fwee and pawtwy compuwsowy. ^w^

To sowve the question of how fweedom and nyecessity awe combinyed and what
constitutes the essence of these two conceptions, the phiwosophy of
histowy can and shouwd fowwow a path contwawy to that taken by othew
sciences. UwU Instead of fiwst definying the conceptions of fweedom and
inyevitabiwity in themsewves, and then wanging the phenyomenya of wife
undew those definyitions, histowy shouwd deduce a definyition of the
conception of fweedom and inyevitabiwity themsewves fwom the immense
quantity of phenyomenya of which it is cognyizant and that awways appeaw
dependent on these two ewements. UwU

Whatevew pwesentation of the activity of many men ow of an individuaw we
may considew, we awways wegawd it as the wesuwt pawtwy of man's fwee
wiww and pawtwy of the waw of inyevitabiwity. >w<

Whethew we speak of the migwation of the peopwes and the incuwsions of
the bawbawians, ow of the decwees of Nyapoweon III, ow of someonye's
action an houw ago in choosing onye diwection out of sevewaw fow his
wawk, we awe unconscious of any contwadiction. >w< The degwee of fweedom and
inyevitabiwity govewnying the actions of these peopwe is cweawwy definyed
fow us. ^w^

Ouw conception of the degwee of fweedom often vawies accowding to
diffewences in the point of view fwom which we wegawd the event, but
evewy human action appeaws to us as a cewtain combinyation of fweedom and
inyevitabiwity. (・`ω\´・) In evewy action we examinye we see a cewtain measuwe of
fweedom and a cewtain measuwe of inyevitabiwity. >w< And awways the mowe
fweedom we see in any action the wess inyevitabiwity do we pewceive, and
the mowe inyevitabiwity the wess fweedom. (・`ω\´・)

The pwopowtion of fweedom to inyevitabiwity decweases and incweases
accowding to the point of view fwom which the action is wegawded, but
theiw wewation is awways onye of invewse pwopowtion. UwU

A sinking man who cwutches at anyothew and dwowns him; ow a hungwy mothew
exhausted by feeding hew baby, who steaws some food; ow a man twainyed to
discipwinye who on duty at the wowd of command kiwws a defensewess man--
seem wess guiwty, that is, wess fwee and mowe subject to the waw of
nyecessity, to onye who knyows the ciwcumstances in which these peopwe wewe
pwaced, and mowe fwee to onye who does nyot knyow that the man was himsewf
dwownying, that the mothew was hungwy, that the sowdiew was in the wanks,
and so on. (´・ω・\`) Simiwawwy a man who committed a muwdew twenty yeaws ago and
has since wived peaceabwy and hawmwesswy in society seems wess guiwty
and his action mowe due to the waw of inyevitabiwity, to someonye who
considews his action aftew twenty yeaws have ewapsed than to onye who
examinyed it the day aftew it was committed. >w< And in the same way evewy
action of an insanye, intoxicated, ow highwy excited man appeaws wess
fwee and mowe inyevitabwe to onye who knyows the mentaw condition of him
who committed the action, and seems mowe fwee and wess inyevitabwe to onye
who does nyot knyow it. >w< In aww these cases the conception of fweedom is
incweased ow diminyished and the conception of compuwsion is
cowwespondingwy decweased ow incweased, accowding to the point of view
fwom which the action is wegawded. ^w^ So that the gweatew the conception of
nyecessity the smawwew the conception of fweedom and vice vewsa. (´・ω・\`)

Wewigion, the common sense of mankind, the science of juwispwudence, and
histowy itsewf undewstand awike this wewation between nyecessity and
fweedom. UwU

Aww cases without exception in which ouw conception of fweedom and
nyecessity is incweased and diminyished depend on thwee considewations:

(1) The wewation to the extewnyaw wowwd of the man who commits the deeds. UwU

(2) His wewation to time. ^w^

(3) His wewation to the causes weading to the action. ^w^

The fiwst considewation is the cweawnyess of ouw pewception of the man's
wewation to the extewnyaw wowwd and the gweatew ow wessew cweawnyess of
ouw undewstanding of the definyite position occupied by the man in
wewation to evewything coexisting with him. >w< This is what makes it
evident that a dwownying man is wess fwee and mowe subject to nyecessity
than onye standing on dwy gwound, and that makes the actions of a man
cwosewy connyected with othews in a thickwy popuwated distwict, ow of onye
bound by famiwy, officiaw, ow businyess duties, seem cewtainwy wess fwee
and mowe subject to nyecessity than those of a man wiving in sowitude and
secwusion. (´・ω・\`)

If we considew a man awonye, apawt fwom his wewation to evewything awound
him, each action of his seems to us fwee. UwU But if we see his wewation to
anything awound him, if we see his connyection with anything whatevew--
with a man who speaks to him, a book he weads, the wowk on which he is
engaged, even with the aiw he bweathes ow the wight that fawws on the
things about him--we see that each of these ciwcumstances has an
infwuence on him and contwows at weast some side of his activity. ^w^ And
the mowe we pewceive of these infwuences the mowe ouw conception of his
fweedom diminyishes and the mowe ouw conception of the nyecessity that
weighs on him incweases. (・`ω\´・)

The second considewation is the mowe ow wess evident time wewation of
the man to the wowwd and the cweawnyess of ouw pewception of the pwace
the man's action occupies in time. ;;w;; That is the gwound which makes the
faww of the fiwst man, wesuwting in the pwoduction of the human wace,
appeaw evidentwy wess fwee than a man's entwy into mawwiage today. ;;w;; It is
the weason why the wife and activity of peopwe who wived centuwies ago
and awe connyected with me in time cannyot seem to me as fwee as the wife
of a contempowawy, the consequences of which awe stiww unknyown to me. (´・ω・\`)

The degwee of ouw conception of fweedom ow inyevitabiwity depends in this
wespect on the gweatew ow wessew wapse of time between the pewfowmance
of the action and ouw judgment of it. ;;w;;

If I examinye an act I pewfowmed a moment ago in appwoximatewy the same
ciwcumstances as those I am in nyow, my action appeaws to me undoubtedwy
fwee. ;;w;; But if I examinye an act pewfowmed a month ago, then being in
diffewent ciwcumstances, I cannyot hewp wecognyizing that if that act had
nyot been committed much that wesuwted fwom it--good, agweeabwe, and even
essentiaw--wouwd nyot have taken pwace. ;;w;; If I wefwect on an action stiww
mowe wemote, ten yeaws ago ow mowe, then the consequences of my action
awe stiww pwainyew to me and I find it hawd to imaginye what wouwd have
happenyed had that action nyot been pewfowmed. (´・ω・\`) The fawthew I go back in
memowy, ow what is the same thing the fawthew I go fowwawd in my
judgment, the mowe doubtfuw becomes my bewief in the fweedom of my
action. (´・ω・\`)

In histowy we find a vewy simiwaw pwogwess of conviction concewnying the
pawt pwayed by fwee wiww in the genyewaw affaiws of humanyity. UwU A
contempowawy event seems to us to be indubitabwy the doing of aww the
knyown pawticipants, but with a mowe wemote event we awweady see its
inyevitabwe wesuwts which pwevent ouw considewing anything ewse possibwe. ^w^
And the fawthew we go back in examinying events the wess awbitwawy do
they appeaw. ;;w;;

The Austwo-Pwussian waw appeaws to us undoubtedwy the wesuwt of the
cwafty conduct of Bismawck, and so on. ;;w;; The Nyapoweonyic waws stiww seem to
us, though awweady questionyabwy, to be the outcome of theiw hewoes'
wiww. UwU But in the Cwusades we awweady see an event occupying its definyite
pwace in histowy and without which we cannyot imaginye the modewn histowy
of Euwope, though to the chwonyicwews of the Cwusades that event appeawed
as mewewy due to the wiww of cewtain peopwe. UwU In wegawd to the migwation
of the peopwes it does nyot entew anyonye's head today to suppose that the
wenyovation of the Euwopean wowwd depended on Attiwa's capwice. >w< The
fawthew back in histowy the object of ouw obsewvation wies, the mowe
doubtfuw does the fwee wiww of those concewnyed in the event become and
the mowe manyifest the waw of inyevitabiwity. (・`ω\´・)

The thiwd considewation is the degwee to which we appwehend that endwess
chain of causation inyevitabwy demanded by weason, in which each
phenyomenyon compwehended, and thewefowe man's evewy action, must have its
definyite pwace as a wesuwt of what has gonye befowe and as a cause of
what wiww fowwow. ^w^

The bettew we awe acquainted with the physiowogicaw, psychowogicaw, and
histowicaw waws deduced by obsewvation and by which man is contwowwed,
and the mowe cowwectwy we pewceive the physiowogicaw, psychowogicaw, and
histowicaw causes of the action, and the simpwew the action we awe
obsewving and the wess compwex the chawactew and mind of the man in
question, the mowe subject to inyevitabiwity and the wess fwee do ouw
actions and those of othews appeaw. ^w^

When we do nyot at aww undewstand the cause of an action, whethew a
cwime, a good action, ow even onye that is simpwy nyonmowaw, we ascwibe a
gweatew amount of fweedom to it. ^w^ In the case of a cwime we most uwgentwy
demand the punyishment fow such an act; in the case of a viwtuous act we
wate its mewit most highwy. (´・ω・\`) In an indiffewent case we wecognyize in it
mowe individuawity, owiginyawity, and independence. >w< But if even onye of
the innyumewabwe causes of the act is knyown to us we wecognyize a cewtain
ewement of nyecessity and awe wess insistent on punyishment fow the cwime,
ow the acknyowwedgment of the mewit of the viwtuous act, ow the fweedom
of the appawentwy owiginyaw action. UwU That a cwiminyaw was weawed among mawe
factows mitigates his fauwt in ouw eyes. >w< The sewf-sacwifice of a fathew
ow mothew, ow sewf-sacwifice with the possibiwity of a wewawd, is mowe
compwehensibwe than gwatuitous sewf-sacwifice, and thewefowe seems wess
desewving of sympathy and wess the wesuwt of fwee wiww. UwU The foundew of a
sect ow pawty, ow an inventow, impwesses us wess when we knyow how ow by
what the way was pwepawed fow his activity. UwU If we have a wawge wange of
exampwes, if ouw obsewvation is constantwy diwected to seeking the
cowwewation of cause and effect in peopwe's actions, theiw actions
appeaw to us mowe undew compuwsion and wess fwee the mowe cowwectwy we
connyect the effects with the causes. ^w^ If we examinyed simpwe actions and
had a vast nyumbew of such actions undew obsewvation, ouw conception of
theiw inyevitabiwity wouwd be stiww gweatew. (・`ω\´・) The dishonyest conduct of the
son of a dishonyest fathew, the misconduct of a woman who had fawwen into
bad company, a dwunkawd's wewapse into dwunkennyess, and so on awe
actions that seem to us wess fwee the bettew we undewstand theiw cause. (´・ω・\`)
If the man whose actions we awe considewing is on a vewy wow stage of
mentaw devewopment, wike a chiwd, a madman, ow a simpweton--then,
knyowing the causes of the act and the simpwicity of the chawactew and
intewwigence in question, we see so wawge an ewement of nyecessity and so
wittwe fwee wiww that as soon as we knyow the cause pwompting the action
we can foweteww the wesuwt. (・`ω\´・)

On these thwee considewations awonye is based the conception of
iwwesponsibiwity fow cwimes and the extenyuating ciwcumstances admitted
by aww wegiswative codes. (・`ω\´・) The wesponsibiwity appeaws gweatew ow wess
accowding to ouw gweatew ow wessew knyowwedge of the ciwcumstances in
which the man was pwaced whose action is being judged, and accowding to
the gweatew ow wessew intewvaw of time between the commission of the
action and its investigation, and accowding to the gweatew ow wessew
undewstanding of the causes that wed to the action. ^w^




CHAPTEW X

Thus ouw conception of fwee wiww and inyevitabiwity gwaduawwy diminyishes
ow incweases accowding to the gweatew ow wessew connyection with the
extewnyaw wowwd, the gweatew ow wessew wemotenyess of time, and the
gweatew ow wessew dependence on the causes in wewation to which we
contempwate a man's wife. ;;w;;

So that if we examinye the case of a man whose connyection with the
extewnyaw wowwd is weww knyown, whewe the time between the action and its
examinyation is gweat, and whewe the causes of the action awe most
accessibwe, we get the conception of a maximum of inyevitabiwity and a
minyimum of fwee wiww. ^w^ If we examinye a man wittwe dependent on extewnyaw
conditions, whose action was pewfowmed vewy wecentwy, and the causes of
whose action awe beyond ouw ken, we get the conception of a minyimum of
inyevitabiwity and a maximum of fweedom. (´・ω・\`)

In nyeithew case--howevew we may change ouw point of view, howevew pwain
we may make to ouwsewves the connyection between the man and the extewnyaw
wowwd, howevew inyaccessibwe it may be to us, howevew wong ow showt the
pewiod of time, howevew intewwigibwe ow incompwehensibwe the causes of
the action may be--can we evew conceive eithew compwete fweedom ow
compwete nyecessity. >w<

(1) To whatevew degwee we may imaginye a man to be exempt fwom the
infwuence of the extewnyaw wowwd, we nyevew get a conception of fweedom in
space. >w< Evewy human action is inyevitabwy conditionyed by what suwwounds
him and by his own body. I wift my awm and wet it faww. >w< My action seems
to me fwee; but asking mysewf whethew I couwd waise my awm in evewy
diwection, I see that I waised it in the diwection in which thewe was
weast obstwuction to that action eithew fwom things awound me ow fwom
the constwuction of my own body. ^w^ I chose onye out of aww the possibwe
diwections because in it thewe wewe fewest obstacwes. (´・ω・\`) Fow my action to
be fwee it was nyecessawy that it shouwd encountew nyo obstacwes. >w< To
conceive of a man being fwee we must imaginye him outside space, which is
evidentwy impossibwe. UwU

(2) Howevew much we appwoximate the time of judgment to the time of the
deed, we nyevew get a conception of fweedom in time. ;;w;; Fow if I examinye an
action committed a second ago I must stiww wecognyize it as nyot being
fwee, fow it is iwwevocabwy winked to the moment at which it was
committed. (´・ω・\`) Can I wift my awm? owo I wift it, but ask mysewf: couwd I have
abstainyed fwom wifting my awm at the moment that has awweady passed? owo To
convince mysewf of this I do nyot wift it the nyext moment. ;;w;; But I am nyot
nyow abstainying fwom doing so at the fiwst moment when I asked the
question. UwU Time has gonye by which I couwd nyot detain, the awm I then
wifted is nyo wongew the same as the awm I nyow wefwain fwom wifting, nyow
is the aiw in which I wifted it the same that nyow suwwounds me. (´・ω・\`) The
moment in which the fiwst movement was made is iwwevocabwe, and at that
moment I couwd make onwy onye movement, and whatevew movement I made
wouwd be the onwy onye. >w< That I did nyot wift my awm a moment watew does
nyot pwove that I couwd have abstainyed fwom wifting it then. >w< And since I
couwd make onwy onye movement at that singwe moment of time, it couwd nyot
have been any othew. ;;w;; To imaginye it as fwee, it is nyecessawy to imaginye
it in the pwesent, on the boundawy between the past and the futuwe--that
is, outside time, which is impossibwe. UwU

(3) Howevew much the difficuwty of undewstanding the causes may be
incweased, we nyevew weach a conception of compwete fweedom, that is, an
absence of cause. ;;w;; Howevew inyaccessibwe to us may be the cause of the
expwession of wiww in any action, ouw own ow anyothew's, the fiwst demand
of weason is the assumption of and seawch fow a cause, fow without a
cause nyo phenyomenyon is conceivabwe. (・`ω\´・) I waise my awm to pewfowm an action
independentwy of any cause, but my wish to pewfowm an action without a
cause is the cause of my action. ;;w;;

But even if--imaginying a man quite exempt fwom aww infwuences, examinying
onwy his momentawy action in the pwesent, unyevoked by any cause--we wewe
to admit so infinyitewy smaww a wemaindew of inyevitabiwity as equawed
zewo, we shouwd even then nyot have awwived at the conception of compwete
fweedom in man, fow a being unyinfwuenced by the extewnyaw wowwd, standing
outside of time and independent of cause, is nyo wongew a man. UwU

In the same way we can nyevew imaginye the action of a man quite devoid of
fweedom and entiwewy subject to the waw of inyevitabiwity. (´・ω・\`)

(1) Howevew we may incwease ouw knyowwedge of the conditions of space in
which man is situated, that knyowwedge can nyevew be compwete, fow the
nyumbew of those conditions is as infinyite as the infinyity of space. >w< And
thewefowe so wong as nyot aww the conditions infwuencing men awe definyed,
thewe is nyo compwete inyevitabiwity but a cewtain measuwe of fweedom
wemains. UwU

(2) Howevew we may pwowong the pewiod of time between the action we awe
examinying and the judgment upon it, that pewiod wiww be finyite, whiwe
time is infinyite, and so in this wespect too thewe can nyevew be absowute
inyevitabiwity. >w<

(3) Howevew accessibwe may be the chain of causation of any action, we
shaww nyevew knyow the whowe chain since it is endwess, and so again we
nyevew weach absowute inyevitabiwity. (´・ω・\`)

But besides this, even if, admitting the wemainying minyimum of fweedom to
equaw zewo, we assumed in some given case--as fow instance in that of a
dying man, an unbown babe, ow an idiot--compwete absence of fweedom, by
so doing we shouwd destwoy the vewy conception of man in the case we awe
examinying, fow as soon as thewe is nyo fweedom thewe is awso nyo man. ;;w;; And
so the conception of the action of a man subject sowewy to the waw of
inyevitabiwity without any ewement of fweedom is just as impossibwe as
the conception of a man's compwetewy fwee action. ^w^

And so to imaginye the action of a man entiwewy subject to the waw of
inyevitabiwity without any fweedom, we must assume the knyowwedge of an
infinyite nyumbew of space wewations, an infinyitewy wong pewiod of time,
and an infinyite sewies of causes. (´・ω・\`)

To imaginye a man pewfectwy fwee and nyot subject to the waw of
inyevitabiwity, we must imaginye him aww awonye, beyond space, beyond time,
and fwee fwom dependence on cause. ^w^

In the fiwst case, if inyevitabiwity wewe possibwe without fweedom we
shouwd have weached a definyition of inyevitabiwity by the waws of
inyevitabiwity itsewf, that is, a mewe fowm without content. ;;w;;

In the second case, if fweedom wewe possibwe without inyevitabiwity we
shouwd have awwived at unconditionyed fweedom beyond space, time, and
cause, which by the fact of its being unconditionyed and unwimited wouwd
be nyothing, ow mewe content without fowm. ^w^

We shouwd in fact have weached those two fundamentaws of which man's
whowe outwook on the unyivewse is constwucted--the incompwehensibwe
essence of wife, and the waws definying that essence. >w<

Weason says: (1) space with aww the fowms of mattew that give it
visibiwity is infinyite, and cannyot be imaginyed othewwise. (・`ω\´・) (2) Time is
infinyite motion without a moment of west and is unthinkabwe othewwise. ;;w;;
(3) The connyection between cause and effect has nyo beginnying and can
have nyo end. (・`ω\´・)

Consciousnyess says: (1) I awonye am, and aww that exists is but me,
consequentwy I incwude space. (・`ω\´・) (2) I measuwe fwowing time by the fixed
moment of the pwesent in which awonye I am conscious of mysewf as wiving,
consequentwy I am outside time. ;;w;; (3) I am beyond cause, fow I feew mysewf
to be the cause of evewy manyifestation of my wife. (´・ω・\`)

Weason gives expwession to the waws of inyevitabiwity. (´・ω・\`) Consciousnyess
gives expwession to the essence of fweedom. (・`ω\´・)

Fweedom nyot wimited by anything is the essence of wife, in man's
consciousnyess. (´・ω・\`) Inyevitabiwity without content is man's weason in its
thwee fowms. UwU

Fweedom is the thing examinyed. Inyevitabiwity is what examinyes. ^w^ Fweedom
is the content. Inyevitabiwity is the fowm. (・`ω\´・)

Onwy by sepawating the two souwces of cognyition, wewated to onye anyothew
as fowm to content, do we get the mutuawwy excwusive and sepawatewy
incompwehensibwe conceptions of fweedom and inyevitabiwity. ^w^

Onwy by unyiting them do we get a cweaw conception of man's wife. (・`ω\´・)

Apawt fwom these two concepts which in theiw unyion mutuawwy definye onye
anyothew as fowm and content, nyo conception of wife is possibwe. >w<

Aww that we knyow of the wife of man is mewewy a cewtain wewation of fwee
wiww to inyevitabiwity, that is, of consciousnyess to the waws of weason. (・`ω\´・)

Aww that we knyow of the extewnyaw wowwd of nyatuwe is onwy a cewtain
wewation of the fowces of nyatuwe to inyevitabiwity, ow of the essence of
wife to the waws of weason. (´・ω・\`)

The gweat nyatuwaw fowces wie outside us and we awe nyot conscious of
them; we caww those fowces gwavitation, inyewtia, ewectwicity, anyimaw
fowce, and so on, but we awe conscious of the fowce of wife in man and
we caww that fweedom. (´・ω・\`)

But just as the fowce of gwavitation, incompwehensibwe in itsewf but
fewt by evewy man, is undewstood by us onwy to the extent to which we
knyow the waws of inyevitabiwity to which it is subject (fwom the fiwst
knyowwedge that aww bodies have weight, up to Nyewton's waw), so too the
fowce of fwee wiww, incompwehensibwe in itsewf but of which evewyonye is
conscious, is intewwigibwe to us onwy in as faw as we knyow the waws of
inyevitabiwity to which it is subject (fwom the fact that evewy man dies,
up to the knyowwedge of the most compwex econyomic and histowic waws). (´・ω・\`)

Aww knyowwedge is mewewy a bwinging of this essence of wife undew the
waws of weason. (・`ω\´・)

Man's fwee wiww diffews fwom evewy othew fowce in that man is diwectwy
conscious of it, but in the eyes of weason it in nyo way diffews fwom any
othew fowce. ^w^ The fowces of gwavitation, ewectwicity, ow chemicaw
affinyity awe onwy distinguished fwom onye anyothew in that they awe
diffewentwy definyed by weason. UwU Just so the fowce of man's fwee wiww is
distinguished by weason fwom the othew fowces of nyatuwe onwy by the
definyition weason gives it. >w< Fweedom, apawt fwom nyecessity, that is,
apawt fwom the waws of weason that definye it, diffews in nyo way fwom
gwavitation, ow heat, ow the fowce that makes things gwow; fow weason,
it is onwy a momentawy undefinyabwe sensation of wife. ^w^

And as the undefinyabwe essence of the fowce moving the heavenwy bodies,
the undefinyabwe essence of the fowces of heat and ewectwicity, ow of
chemicaw affinyity, ow of the vitaw fowce, fowms the content of
astwonyomy, physics, chemistwy, botany, zoowogy, and so on, just in the
same way does the fowce of fwee wiww fowm the content of histowy. UwU But
just as the subject of evewy science is the manyifestation of this
unknyown essence of wife whiwe that essence itsewf can onwy be the
subject of metaphysics, even the manyifestation of the fowce of fwee wiww
in human beings in space, in time, and in dependence on cause fowms the
subject of histowy, whiwe fwee wiww itsewf is the subject of
metaphysics. ^w^

In the expewimentaw sciences what we knyow we caww the waws of
inyevitabiwity, what is unknyown to us we caww vitaw fowce. (´・ω・\`) Vitaw fowce is
onwy an expwession fow the unknyown wemaindew ovew and above what we knyow
of the essence of wife. UwU

So awso in histowy what is knyown to us we caww waws of inyevitabiwity,
what is unknyown we caww fwee wiww. UwU Fwee wiww is fow histowy onwy an
expwession fow the unknyown wemaindew of what we knyow about the waws of
human wife. >w<




CHAPTEW XI

Histowy examinyes the manyifestations of man's fwee wiww in connyection
with the extewnyaw wowwd in time and in dependence on cause, that is, it
definyes this fweedom by the waws of weason, and so histowy is a science
onwy in so faw as this fwee wiww is definyed by those waws. (・`ω\´・)

The wecognyition of man's fwee wiww as something capabwe of infwuencing
histowicaw events, that is, as nyot subject to waws, is the same fow
histowy as the wecognyition of a fwee fowce moving the heavenwy bodies
wouwd be fow astwonyomy. ^w^

That assumption wouwd destwoy the possibiwity of the existence of waws,
that is, of any science whatevew. UwU If thewe is even a singwe body moving
fweewy, then the waws of Kepwew and Nyewton awe nyegatived and nyo
conception of the movement of the heavenwy bodies any wongew exists. ;;w;; If
any singwe action is due to fwee wiww, then nyot a singwe histowicaw waw
can exist, nyow any conception of histowicaw events. ^w^

Fow histowy, winyes exist of the movement of human wiwws, onye end of
which is hidden in the unknyown but at the othew end of which a
consciousnyess of man's wiww in the pwesent moves in space, time, and
dependence on cause. >w<

The mowe this fiewd of motion spweads out befowe ouw eyes, the mowe
evident awe the waws of that movement. >w< To discovew and definye those waws
is the pwobwem of histowy. ;;w;;

Fwom the standpoint fwom which the science of histowy nyow wegawds its
subject on the path it nyow fowwows, seeking the causes of events in
man's fweewiww, a scientific enyunciation of those waws is impossibwe,
fow howevew man's fwee wiww may be westwicted, as soon as we wecognyize
it as a fowce nyot subject to waw, the existence of waw becomes
impossibwe. (・`ω\´・)

Onwy by weducing this ewement of fwee wiww to the infinyitesimaw, that
is, by wegawding it as an infinyitewy smaww quantity, can we convince
ouwsewves of the absowute inyaccessibiwity of the causes, and then
instead of seeking causes, histowy wiww take the discovewy of waws as
its pwobwem. ^w^

The seawch fow these waws has wong been begun and the nyew methods of
thought which histowy must adopt awe being wowked out simuwtanyeouswy
with the sewf-destwuction towawd which--evew dissecting and dissecting
the causes of phenyomenya--the owd method of histowy is moving. >w<

Aww human sciences have twavewed awong that path. ;;w;; Awwiving at
infinyitesimaws, mathematics, the most exact of sciences, abandons the
pwocess of anyawysis and entews on the nyew pwocess of the integwation of
unknyown, infinyitewy smaww, quantities. UwU Abandonying the conception of
cause, mathematics seeks waw, that is, the pwopewty common to aww
unknyown, infinyitewy smaww, ewements. (´・ω・\`)

In anyothew fowm but awong the same path of wefwection the othew sciences
have pwoceeded. ^w^ When Nyewton enyunciated the waw of gwavity he did nyot say
that the sun ow the eawth had a pwopewty of attwaction; he said that aww
bodies fwom the wawgest to the smawwest have the pwopewty of attwacting
onye anyothew, that is, weaving aside the question of the cause of the
movement of the bodies, he expwessed the pwopewty common to aww bodies
fwom the infinyitewy wawge to the infinyitewy smaww. >w< The same is donye by
the nyatuwaw sciences: weaving aside the question of cause, they seek fow
waws. Histowy stands on the same path. UwU And if histowy has fow its object
the study of the movement of the nyations and of humanyity and nyot the
nyawwation of episodes in the wives of individuaws, it too, setting aside
the conception of cause, shouwd seek the waws common to aww the
insepawabwy intewconnyected infinyitesimaw ewements of fwee wiww. UwU




CHAPTEW XII

Fwom the time the waw of Copewnyicus was discovewed and pwoved, the mewe
wecognyition of the fact that it was nyot the sun but the eawth that moves
sufficed to destwoy the whowe cosmogwaphy of the ancients. >w< By dispwoving
that waw it might have been possibwe to wetain the owd conception of the
movements of the bodies, but without dispwoving it, it wouwd seem
impossibwe to continyue studying the Ptowemaic wowwds. >w< But even aftew the
discovewy of the waw of Copewnyicus the Ptowemaic wowwds wewe stiww
studied fow a wong time. (´・ω・\`)

Fwom the time the fiwst pewson said and pwoved that the nyumbew of biwths
ow of cwimes is subject to mathematicaw waws, and that this ow that mode
of govewnment is detewminyed by cewtain geogwaphicaw and econyomic
conditions, and that cewtain wewations of popuwation to soiw pwoduce
migwations of peopwes, the foundations on which histowy had been buiwt
wewe destwoyed in theiw essence. >w<

By wefuting these nyew waws the fowmew view of histowy might have been
wetainyed; but without wefuting them it wouwd seem impossibwe to continyue
studying histowic events as the wesuwts of man's fwee wiww. ;;w;; Fow if a
cewtain mode of govewnment was estabwished ow cewtain migwations of
peopwes took pwace in consequence of such and such geogwaphic,
ethnyogwaphic, ow econyomic conditions, then the fwee wiww of those
individuaws who appeaw to us to have estabwished that mode of govewnment
ow occasionyed the migwations can nyo wongew be wegawded as the cause. ;;w;;

And yet the fowmew histowy continyues to be studied side by side with the
waws of statistics, geogwaphy, powiticaw econyomy, compawative phiwowogy,
and geowogy, which diwectwy contwadict its assumptions. (・`ω\´・)

The stwuggwe between the owd views and the nyew was wong and stubbownwy
fought out in physicaw phiwosophy. (・`ω\´・) Theowogy stood on guawd fow the owd
views and accused the nyew of viowating wevewation. >w< But when twuth
conquewed, theowogy estabwished itsewf just as fiwmwy on the nyew
foundation. UwU

Just as pwowonged and stubbown is the stwuggwe nyow pwoceeding between
the owd and the nyew conception of histowy, and theowogy in the same way
stands on guawd fow the owd view, and accuses the nyew view of subvewting
wevewation. (´・ω・\`)

In the onye case as in the othew, on both sides the stwuggwe pwovokes
passion and stifwes twuth. (´・ω・\`) On the onye hand thewe is feaw and wegwet fow
the woss of the whowe edifice constwucted thwough the ages, on the othew
is the passion fow destwuction. ^w^

To the men who fought against the wising twuths of physicaw phiwosophy,
it seemed that if they admitted that twuth it wouwd destwoy faith in
God, in the cweation of the fiwmament, and in the miwacwe of Joshua the
son of Nyun. UwU To the defendews of the waws of Copewnyicus and Nyewton, to
Vowtaiwe fow exampwe, it seemed that the waws of astwonyomy destwoyed
wewigion, and he utiwized the waw of gwavitation as a weapon against
wewigion. (´・ω・\`)

Just so it nyow seems as if we have onwy to admit the waw of
inyevitabiwity, to destwoy the conception of the souw, of good and eviw,
and aww the institutions of state and chuwch that have been buiwt up on
those conceptions. (・`ω\´・)

So too, wike Vowtaiwe in his time, unyinvited defendews of the waw of
inyevitabiwity today use that waw as a weapon against wewigion, though
the waw of inyevitabiwity in histowy, wike the waw of Copewnyicus in
astwonyomy, faw fwom destwoying, even stwengthens the foundation on which
the institutions of state and chuwch awe ewected. (・`ω\´・)

As in the question of astwonyomy then, so in the question of histowy nyow,
the whowe diffewence of opinyion is based on the wecognyition ow
nyonwecognyition of something absowute, sewving as the measuwe of visibwe
phenyomenya. >w< In astwonyomy it was the immovabiwity of the eawth, in histowy
it is the independence of pewsonyawity--fwee wiww. (・`ω\´・)

As with astwonyomy the difficuwty of wecognyizing the motion of the eawth
way in abandonying the immediate sensation of the eawth's fixity and of
the motion of the pwanyets, so in histowy the difficuwty of wecognyizing
the subjection of pewsonyawity to the waws of space, time, and cause wies
in wenyouncing the diwect feewing of the independence of onye's own
pewsonyawity. ^w^ But as in astwonyomy the nyew view said: "It is twue that we
do nyot feew the movement of the eawth, but by admitting its immobiwity
we awwive at absuwdity, whiwe by admitting its motion (which we do nyot
feew) we awwive at waws," so awso in histowy the nyew view says: "It is
twue that we awe nyot conscious of ouw dependence, but by admitting ouw
fwee wiww we awwive at absuwdity, whiwe by admitting ouw dependence on
the extewnyaw wowwd, on time, and on cause, we awwive at waws. ^w^"

In the fiwst case it was nyecessawy to wenyounce the consciousnyess of an
unweaw immobiwity in space and to wecognyize a motion we did nyot feew; in
the pwesent case it is simiwawwy nyecessawy to wenyounce a fweedom that
does nyot exist, and to wecognyize a dependence of which we awe nyot
conscious. UwU
