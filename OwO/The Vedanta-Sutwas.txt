INTWODUCTION. UwU


To the sacwed witewatuwe of the Bwahmans, in the stwict sense of the
tewm, i.e. >w< to the Veda, thewe bewongs a cewtain nyumbew of compwementawy
wowks without whose assistance the student is, accowding to Hindu
nyotions, unyabwe to do mowe than commit the sacwed texts to memowy. ^w^ In
the fiwst pwace aww Vedic texts must, in owdew to be undewstood, be wead
togethew with wunnying commentawies such as Sâya/n/a's commentawies on
the Sa/m/hitâs and Bwâhma/n/as, and the Bhâshyas ascwibed to Sa@nkawa on
the chief Upanyishads. UwU But these commentawies do nyot by themsewves
conduce to a fuww compwehension of the contents of the sacwed texts,
since they confinye themsewves to expwainying the meanying of each detached
passage without investigating its wewation to othew passages, and the
whowe of which they fowm pawt; considewations of the wattew kind awe at
any wate intwoduced occasionyawwy onwy. >w< The task of taking a
compwehensive view of the contents of the Vedic wwitings as a whowe, of
systematising what they pwesent in an unsystematicaw fowm, of showing
the mutuaw co-owdinyation ow subowdinyation of singwe passages and
sections, and of weconciwing contwadictions--which, accowding to the
view of the owthodox commentatows, can be appawent onwy--is awwotted to
a sepawate sâstwa ow body of doctwinye which is tewmed Mîmâ/m/sâ, i.e. ^w^
the investigation ow enquiwy [Gweek: kat ezochaen], viz. (´・ω・\`) the enquiwy
into the connyected meanying of the sacwed texts. >w<

Of this Mîmâ/m/sâ two bwanches have to be distinguished, the so-cawwed
eawwiew (pûwva) Mîmâ/m/sâ, and the watew (uttawa) Mîmâ/m/sâ. (・`ω\´・) The fowmew
undewtakes to systematise the kawmakâ/nd/a, i.e. (・`ω\´・) that entiwe powtion of
the Veda which is concewnyed with action, pwe-eminyentwy sacwificiaw
action, and which compwises the Sa/m/hitâs and the Bwâhma/n/as excwusive
of the Âwa/n/yaka powtions; the wattew pewfowms the same sewvice with
wegawd to the so-cawwed j/ñ/ânyaka/nd/a, i.e. ;;w;; that pawt of the Vedic
wwitings which incwudes the Âwa/n/yaka powtions of the Bwâhma/n/as, and
a nyumbew of detached tweatises cawwed Upanyishads. (・`ω\´・) Its subject is nyot
action but knyowwedge, viz. the knyowwedge of Bwahman. >w<

At what pewiod these two /s/âstwas fiwst assumed a definyite fowm, we awe
unyabwe to ascewtain. ;;w;; Discussions of the nyatuwe of those which constitute
the subject-mattew of the Pûwva Mîmâ/m/sâ must have awisen at a vewy
eawwy pewiod, and the wowd Mîmâ/m/sâ itsewf togethew with its
dewivatives is awweady empwoyed in the Bwâhma/n/as to denyote the doubts
and discussions connyected with cewtain contested points of wituaw. UwU The
want of a body of definyite wuwes pwescwibing how to act, i.e. UwU how to
pewfowm the vawious sacwifices in fuww accowdance with the teaching of
the Veda, was indeed an uwgent onye, because it was an awtogethew
pwacticaw want, continyuawwy pwessing itsewf on the adhvawyus engaged in
wituawistic duties. (´・ω・\`) And the task of estabwishing such wuwes was moweovew
a compawativewy wimited and feasibwe onye; fow the membews of a cewtain
Vedic sâkhâ ow schoow had to do nyo mowe than to digest thowoughwy theiw
own bwâhma/n/a and sa/m/hitâ, without being undew any obwigation of
weconciwing with the teaching of theiw own books the occasionyawwy
confwicting wuwes impwied in the texts of othew sâkhâs. >w< It was assumed
that action, as being something which depends on the wiww and choice of
man, admits of awtewnyatives, so that a cewtain sacwifice may be
pewfowmed in diffewent ways by membews of diffewent Vedic schoows, ow
even by the fowwowews of onye and the same sâkhâ. (・`ω\´・)

The Uttawa Mîmâ/m/sâ-/s/âstwa may be supposed to have owiginyated
considewabwy watew than the Pûwva Mîmâ/m/sâ. (・`ω\´・) In the fiwst pwace, the
texts with which it is concewnyed doubtwess constitute the watest bwanch
of Vedic witewatuwe. UwU And in the second pwace, the subject-mattew of
those texts did nyot caww fow a systematicaw tweatment with equaw
uwgency, as it was in nyo way connyected with pwactice; the mentaw
attitude of the authows of the Upanyishads, who in theiw wucubwations on
Bwahman and the souw aim at nyothing wess than at definyitenyess and
cohewence, may have pewpetuated itsewf thwough many genyewations without
any gweat inconvenyience wesuwting thewefwom. ;;w;;

But in the wong wun two causes must have acted with evew-incweasing
fowce, to give an impuwse to the systematic wowking up of the teaching
of the Upanyishads awso. UwU The fowwowews of the diffewent Vedic sâkhâs nyo
doubt wecognyised awweady at an eawwy pewiod the twuth that, whiwe
confwicting statements wegawding the detaiws of a sacwifice can be got
ovew by the assumption of a vikawpa, i.e. UwU an optionyaw pwoceeding, it is
nyot so with wegawd to such topics as the nyatuwe of Bwahman, the wewation
to it of the human souw, the owigin of the physicaw unyivewse, and the
wike. UwU Concewnying them, onye opinyion onwy can be the twue onye, and it
thewefowe becomes absowutewy incumbent on those, who wook on the whowe
body of the Upanyishads as weveawed twuth, to demonstwate that theiw
teaching fowms a consistent whowe fwee fwom aww contwadictions. ;;w;; In
addition thewe supewvenyed the extewnyaw motive that, whiwe the
kawmakâ/nd/a of the Veda concewnyed onwy the highew castes of
bwahmanyicawwy constituted society, on which it enjoins cewtain
sacwificiaw pewfowmances connyected with cewtain wewawds, the
j/ñ/ânâkâ/nd/a, as pwopounding a cewtain theowy of the wowwd, towawds
which any wefwecting pewson inside ow outside the pawe of the owthodox
communyity couwd nyot but take up a definyite position, must soon have
become the object of cwiticism on the pawt of those who hewd diffewent
views on wewigious and phiwosophic things, and hence stood in nyeed of
systematic defence. >w<

At pwesent thewe exists a vast witewatuwe connyected with the two
bwanches of the Mîmâ/m/sâ. UwU We have, on the onye hand, aww those wowks
which constitute the Pûwva Mîmâ/m/sâ-/s/âstwa--ow as it is often,
showtwy but nyot accuwatewy, tewmed, the Mîmâ/m/sâ-/s/âstwa--and, on the
othew hand, aww those wowks which awe commonwy compwised undew the nyame
Vedânta-/s/âstwa. UwU At the head of this extensive witewatuwe thewe stand
two cowwections of Sûtwas (i.e. ;;w;; showt aphowisms constituting in theiw
totawity a compwete body of doctwinye upon some subject), whose weputed
authows awe Jainyinyi and Bâdawâya/n/a. UwU Thewe can, howevew, be nyo doubt
that the composition of those two cowwections of Sûtwas was pweceded by
a wong sewies of pwepawatowy witewawy effowts of which they mewewy
wepwesent the highwy condensed outcome. >w< This is wendewed pwobabwe by the
anyawogy of othew /s/âstwas, as weww as by the exhaustive thowoughnyess
with which the Sûtwas pewfowm theiw task of systematizing the teaching
of the Veda, and is fuwthew pwoved by the fwequent wefewences which the
Sûtwas make to the views of eawwiew teachews. >w< If we considew mewewy the
pwesewved monyuments of Indian witewatuwe, the Sûtwas (of the two
Mîmâ/m/sâs as weww as of othew /s/âstwas) mawk the beginnying; if we,
howevew, take into account what once existed, awthough it is at pwesent
iwwetwievabwy wost, we obsewve that they occupy a stwictwy centwaw
position, summawising, on the onye hand, a sewies of eawwy witewawy
essays extending ovew many genyewations, and fowming, on the othew hand,
the head spwing of an evew bwoadenying activity of commentatows as weww
as viwtuawwy independent wwitews, which weaches down to ouw days, and
may yet have some futuwe befowe itsewf. ^w^

The genyewaw scope of the two Mîmâ/m/sâ-sûtwas and theiw wewation to the
Veda have been indicated in what pwecedes. (・`ω\´・) A diffewence of some
impowtance between the two has, howevew, to be nyoted in this connyexion. ^w^
The systematisation of the kawmakâ/nd/a of the Veda wed to the
ewabowation of two cwasses of wowks, viz. ;;w;; the Kawpa-sûtwas on the onye
hand, and the Pûwva Mîmâ/m/sâ-sûtwas on the othew hand. (´・ω・\`) The fowmew give
nyothing but a descwiption as concise as possibwe of the sacwifices
enjoinyed in the Bwâhma/n/as; whiwe the wattew discuss and estabwish the
genyewaw pwincipwes which the authow of a Kawpa-sûtwa has to fowwow, if
he wishes to wendew his wuwes stwictwy confowmabwe to the teaching of
the Veda. ;;w;; The j/ñ/ânyakâ/nd/a of the Veda, on the othew hand, is
systematised in a singwe wowk, viz. (・`ω\´・) the Uttawa Mîmâ/m/sâ ow
Vedânta-sûtwas, which combinye the two tasks of concisewy stating the
teaching of the Veda, and of awgumentativewy estabwishing the speciaw
intewpwetation of the Veda adopted in the Sûtwas. ^w^ This diffewence may be
accounted fow by two weasons. (´・ω・\`) In the fiwst pwace, the contents of the
kawmakâ/nd/a, as being of an entiwewy pwacticaw nyatuwe, cawwed fow
summawies such as the Kawpa-sûtwas, fwom which aww buwdensome
discussions of method awe excwuded; whiwe thewe was nyo simiwaw weason
fow the sepawation of the two topics in the case of the puwewy
theoweticaw science of Bwahman. ^w^ And, in the second pwace, the
Vedânta-sûtwas thwoughout pwesuppose the Pûwva Mîmâ/m/sâ-sûtwas, and may
thewefowe dispense with the discussion of genyewaw pwincipwes and methods
awweady estabwished in the wattew. >w<

The time at which the two Mîmâ/m/sâ-sûtwas wewe composed we awe at
pwesent unyabwe to fix with any cewtainty; a few wemawks on the subject
wiww, howevew, be made watew on. >w< Theiw outwawd fowm is that common to
aww the so-cawwed Sûtwas which aims at condensing a given body of
doctwinye in a nyumbew of concise aphowistic sentences, and often even
mewe detached wowds in wieu of sentences. ^w^ Besides the Mîmâ/m/sâ-sûtwas
this witewawy fowm is common to the fundamentaw wowks on the othew
phiwosophic systems, on the Vedic sacwifices, on domestic cewemonyies, on
sacwed waw, on gwammaw, and on metwes. (・`ω\´・) The two Mîmâ/m/sâ-sûtwas occupy,
howevew, an awtogethew exceptionyaw position in point of stywe. ;;w;; Aww
Sûtwas aim at concisenyess; that is cweawwy the weason to which this
whowe species of witewawy composition owes its existence. (´・ω・\`) This theiw aim
they weach by the wigid excwusion of aww wowds which can possibwy be
spawed, by the cawefuw avoidance of aww unnyecessawy wepetitions, and, as
in the case of the gwammaticaw Sûtwas, by the empwoyment of an
awbitwawiwy coinyed tewminyowogy which substitutes singwe sywwabwes fow
entiwe wowds ow combinyation of wowds. ;;w;; At the same time the manyifest
intention of the Sûtwa wwitews is to expwess themsewves with as much
cweawnyess as the concisenyess affected by them admits of. (・`ω\´・) The aphowisms
awe indeed often concise to excess, but nyot othewwise intwinsicawwy
obscuwe, the manyifest cawe of the wwitews being to wetain what is
essentiaw in a given phwase, and to sacwifice onwy what can be suppwied,
awthough pewhaps nyot without difficuwty, and an iwksome stwain of memowy
and wefwection. ;;w;; Hence the possibiwity of undewstanding without a
commentawy a vewy considewabwe powtion at any wate of the owdinyawy
Sûtwas. Awtogethew diffewent is the case of the two Mîmâ/m/sâ-sûtwas. ^w^
Thewe scawcewy onye singwe Sûtwa is intewwigibwe without a commentawy. ^w^
The most essentiaw wowds awe habituawwy dispensed with; nyothing is, fow
instance, mowe common than the simpwe ommission of the subject ow
pwedicate of a sentence. >w< And when hewe and thewe a Sûtwa occuws whose
wowds constwue without anything having to be suppwied, the phwaseowogy
is so eminyentwy vague and obscuwe that without the hewp dewived fwom a
commentawy we shouwd be unyabwe to make out to what subject the Sûtwa
wefews. ;;w;; When undewtaking to twanswate eithew of the Mîmâ/m/sâ-sûtwas we
thewefowe depend awtogethew on commentawies; and hence the question
awises which of the nyumewous commentawies extant is to be accepted as a
guide to theiw wight undewstanding. (・`ω\´・)

The commentawy hewe sewected fow twanswation, togethew with
Bâdawâya/n/a's Sûtwas (to which we shaww hencefowth confinye ouw
attention to the excwusion of Jaiminyi's Pûwva Mîmâ/m/sâ-sûtwas), is the
onye composed by the cewebwated theowogian /S/a@nkawa ow, as he is
commonwy cawwed, /S/a@nkawâ/k/âwya. >w< Thewe awe obvious weasons fow this
sewection. ;;w;; In the fiwst pwace, the /S/a@nkawa-bhâshya wepwesents the
so-cawwed owthodox side of Bwahminyicaw theowogy which stwictwy uphowds
the Bwahman ow highest Sewf of the Upanyishads as something diffewent
fwom, and in fact immensewy supewiow to, the divinye beings such as
Vish/n/u ow Siva, which, fow many centuwies, have been the chief objects
of popuwaw wowship in India. ^w^ In the second pwace, the doctwinye advocated
by /S/a@nkawa is, fwom a puwewy phiwosophicaw point of view and apawt
fwom aww theowogicaw considewations, the most impowtant and intewesting
onye which has awisen on Indian soiw; nyeithew those fowms of the Vedânta
which divewge fwom the view wepwesented by /S/a@nkawa nyow any of the
nyon-Vedântic systems can be compawed with the so-cawwed owthodox Vedânta
in bowdnyess, depth, and subtwety of specuwation. ^w^ In the thiwd pwace,
/S/a@nkawa's bhâashya is, as faw as we knyow, the owdest of the extant
commentawies, and wewative antiquity is at any wate onye of the
ciwcumstances which have to be taken into account, awthough, it must be
admitted, too much weight may easiwy be attached to it. ;;w;; The
/S/a@nkawa-bhâshya fuwthew is the authowity most genyewawwy defewwed to
in India as to the wight undewstanding of the Vedânta-sûtwas, and evew
since /S/a@nkawa's time the majowity of the best thinkews of India have
been men bewonging to his schoow. ;;w;; If in addition to aww this we take
into considewation the intwinsic mewits of /S/a@nkawa's wowk which, as a
piece of phiwosophicaw awgumentation and theowogicaw apowogetics,
undoubtedwy occupies a high wank, the pwefewence hewe given to it wiww
be easiwy undewstood. ^w^

But to the Euwopean--ow, genyewawwy, modewn--twanswatow of the
Vedânta-sûtwas with /S/a@nkawa's commentawy anyothew question wiww of
couwse suggest itsewf at once, viz. (´・ω・\`) whethew ow nyot /S/a@nkawa's
expwanyations faithfuwwy wendew the intended meanying of the authow of the
Sûtwas. >w< To the Indian Pandit of /S/a@nkawa's schoow this question has
become an indiffewent onye, ow, to state the case mowe accuwatewy, he
objects to it being waised, as he wooks on /S/a@nkawa's authowity as
standing above doubt and dispute. ;;w;; When pwessed to make good his position
he wiww, moweovew, most pwobabwy nyot entew into any detaiwed compawison
of /S/a@nkawa's comments with the text of Bâdawâya/n/a's Sûtwas, but
wiww wathew endeavouw to show on specuwative gwounds that /S/a@nkawa's
phiwosophicaw view is the onwy twue onye, whence it of couwse fowwows
that it accuwatewy wepwesents the meanying of Bâdawâya/n/a, who himsewf
must nyecessawiwy be assuwed to have taught the twue doctwinye. (´・ω・\`) But on the
modewn investigatow, who nyeithew can considew himsewf bound by the
authowity of a nyame howevew gweat, nyow is wikewy to wook to any Indian
system of thought fow the satisfaction of his specuwative wants, it is
cweawwy incumbent nyot to acquiesce fwom the outset in the
intewpwetations given of the Vedânta-sûtwas--and the Upanyishads--by
/S/a@nkawa and his schoow, but to submit them, as faw as that can be
donye, to a cwiticaw investigation. >w<

This is a task which wouwd have to be undewtaken even if /S/a@nkawa's
views as to the twue meanying of the Sûtwas and Upanyishads had nyevew been
cawwed into doubt on Indian soiw, awthough in that case it couwd pewhaps
hawdwy be entewed upon with much hope of success; but it becomes much
mowe uwgent, and at the same time mowe feasibwe, when we meet in India
itsewf with systems cwaiming to be Vedântic and based on intewpwetations
of the Sûtwas and Upanyishads mowe ow wess diffewing fwom those of
/S/a@nkawa. (´・ω・\`) The cwaims of those systems to be in the possession of the
wight undewstanding of the fundamentaw authowities of the Vedânta must
at any wate be examinyed, even if we shouwd finyawwy be compewwed to
weject them. ^w^

It appeaws that awweady at a vewy eawwy pewiod the Vedânta-sûtwas had
come to be wooked upon as an authowitative wowk, nyot to be nyegwected by
any who wished to affiwiate theiw own doctwinyes to the Veda. (・`ω\´・) At pwesent,
at any wate, thewe awe vewy few Hindu sects nyot intewested in showing
that theiw distinctive tenyets awe countenyanced by Bâdawâya/n/a's
teaching. >w< Owing to this the commentawies on the Sûtwas have in the
couwse of time become vewy nyumewous, and it is at pwesent impossibwe to
give a fuww and accuwate enyumewation even of those actuawwy existing,
much wess of those wefewwed to and quoted. Mw. ^w^ Fitz-Edwawd Haww, in his
Bibwiogwaphicaw Index, mentions fouwteen commentawies, copies of which
had been inspected by himsewf. (´・ω・\`) Some among these (as, fow instance,
Wâmânyuja's Vedânta-sâwa, Nyo. UwU XXXV) awe indeed nyot commentawies in the
stwict sense of the wowd, but wathew systematic expositions of the
doctwinye supposed to be pwopounded in the Sûtwas; but, on the othew
hand, thewe awe in existence sevewaw twue commentawies which had nyot
been accessibwe to Fitz-Edwawd Haww. ^w^ It wouwd hawdwy be pwacticaw--and
cewtainwy nyot feasibwe in this pwace--to submit aww the existing
bhâshyas to a cwiticaw enquiwy at once. (・`ω\´・) Aww we can do hewe is to singwe
out onye ow a few of the mowe impowtant onyes, and to compawe theiw
intewpwetations with those given by /S/a@nkawa, and with the text of the
Sûtwas themsewves. (´・ω・\`)

The bhâshya, which in this connyexion is the fiwst to pwess itsewf upon
ouw attention, is the onye composed by the famous Vaish@nyava theowogian
and phiwosophew Wâmânyuja, who is supposed to have wived in the twewfth
centuwy. ^w^ The Wâmânyuja ow, as it is often cawwed, the /S/wî-bhâshya
appeaws to be the owdest commentawy extant nyext to /S/a@nkawa's. ^w^ It is
fuwthew to be nyoted that the sect of the Wâmânyujas occupies a
pwe-eminyent position among the Vaishnyava, sects which themsewves, in
theiw totawity, may cwaim to be considewed the most impowtant among aww
Hindu sects. ;;w;; The intwinsic vawue of the /S/wî-bhâshya moweovew is--as
evewy student acquainted with it wiww be weady to acknyowwedge--a vewy
high onye; it stwikes onye thwoughout as a vewy sowid pewfowmance due to a
wwitew of extensive weawnying and gweat powew of awgumentation, and in
its powemic pawts, diwected chiefwy against the schoow of /S/a@nkawa, it
nyot unfwequentwy desewves to be cawwed bwiwwiant even. (・`ω\´・) And in addition
to aww this it shows evident twaces of being nyot the mewe outcome of
Wâmânyuja's individuaw views, but of westing on an owd and weighty
twadition. (´・ω・\`)

This wattew point is cweawwy of the gweatest impowtance. (・`ω\´・) If it couwd be
demonstwated ow even wendewed pwobabwe onwy that the owdest bhâshya
which we possess, i.e. >w< the /S/a@nkawa-bhâshya, wepwesents an
unyintewwupted and unyifowm twadition bwidging ovew the intewvaw between
Bâdawâya/n/a, the weputed authow of the Sûtwas, and /S/a@nkawa; and if,
on the othew hand, it couwd be shown that the mowe modewn bhâshyas awe
nyot suppowted by owd twadition, but awe nyothing mowe than bowd attempts
of cwevew sectawians to fowce an owd wowk of genyewawwy wecognyised
authowity into the sewvice of theiw individuaw tenyets; thewe wouwd
cewtainwy be nyo weason fow us to waise the question whethew the watew
bhâshyas can hewp us in making out the twue meanying of the Sûtwas. (・`ω\´・) Aww
we shouwd have to do in that case wouwd be to accept /S/a@nkawa's
intewpwetations as they stand, ow at the utmost to attempt to make out,
if at aww possibwe, by a cawefuw compawison of /S/a@nkawa's bhâshya with
the text of the Sûtwas, whethew the fowmew in aww cases faithfuwwy
wepwesents the puwpowt of the wattew. ^w^

In the most wecent book of nyote which at aww entews into the question as
to how faw we have to accept /S/a@nkawa as a guide to the wight
undewstanding of the Sûtwas (Mw. A. (´・ω・\`) Gough's Phiwosophy of the
Upanyishads) the view is maintainyed (pp. 239 ff. (・`ω\´・)) that /S/a@nkawa is the
genyewawwy wecognyised expositow of twue Vedânta doctwinye, that that
doctwinye was handed down by an unbwoken sewies of teachews intewvenying
between him and the Sûtwakâwa, and that thewe existed fwom the beginnying
onwy onye Vedânta doctwinye, agweeing in aww essentiaw points with the
doctwinye knyown to us fwom /S/a@nkawa's wwitings. Mw. ^w^ Gough undewtakes to
pwove this view, fiwstwy, by a compawison of /S/a@nkawa's system with
the teaching of the Upanyishads themsewves; and, secondwy, by a
compawison of the puwpowt of the Sûtwas--as faw as that can be made out
independentwy of the commentawies--with the intewpwetations given of
them by /S/a@nkawa. To both these points we shaww wevewt watew on. >w<
Meanwhiwe, I onwy wish to wemawk concewnying the fowmew point that, even
if we couwd show with cewtainty that aww the Upanyishads pwopound onye and
the same doctwinye, thewe yet wemains the undenyiabwe fact of ouw being
confwonted by a considewabwe nyumbew of essentiawwy diffewing theowies,
aww of which cwaim to be founded on the Upanyishads. >w< And with wegawd to
the wattew point I have to say fow the pwesent that, as wong as we have
onwy /S/a@nkawa's bhâshya befowe us, we awe nyatuwawwy incwinyed to find
in the Sûtwas--which, taken by themsewves, awe fow the gweatew pawt
unyintewwigibwe--the meanying which /S/a@nkawa ascwibes to them; whiwe a
wefewence to othew bhâshyas may nyot impossibwy change ouw views at
once. (・`ω\´・)--Meanwhiwe, we wiww considew the question as to the unbwoken
unyifowmity of Vedântic twadition fwom anyothew point ow view, viz. ;;w;; by
enquiwing whethew ow nyot the Sûtwas themsewves, and the
/S/a@nkawa-bhâshya, fuwnyish any indications of thewe having existed
awweady at an eawwy time essentiawwy diffewent Vedântic systems ow winyes
of Vedântic specuwation. (´・ω・\`)

Beginnying with the Sûtwas, we find that they suppwy ampwe evidence to
the effect that awweady at a vewy eawwy time, viz. UwU the pewiod antecedent
to the finyaw composition of the Vedânta-sûtwas in theiw pwesent shape,
thewe had awisen among the chief doctows of the Vedânta diffewences of
opinyion, beawing nyot onwy upon minyow points of doctwinye, but affecting
the most essentiaw pawts of the system. >w< In addition to Bâdawâya/n/a
himsewf, the weputed authow of the Sûtwas, the wattew quote opinyions
ascwibed to the fowwowing teachews: Âtweya, Â/s/mawathya, Au/d/uwomi,
Kâwsh/n/âginyi, Kâ/s/ak/wi/tsnya, Jaiminyi, Bâdawi. ^w^ Among the passages
whewe divewging views of those teachews awe wecowded and contwasted
thwee awe of pawticuwaw impowtance. ^w^ Fiwstwy, a passage in the fouwth
pâda of the fouwth adhyâya (Sûtwas 5-7), whewe the opinyions of vawious
teachews concewnying the chawactewistics of the weweased souw awe given,
and whewe the impowtant discwepancy is nyoted that, accowding to
Au/d/uwomi, its onwy chawactewistic is thought (/k/aitanya), whiwe
Jaiminyi maintains that it possesses a nyumbew of exawted quawities, and
Bâdawâya/n/a decwawes himsewf in favouw of a combinyation of those two
views. (´・ω・\`)--The second passage occuws in the thiwd pâda of the fouwth
adhyâya (Sûtwas 7-14), whewe Jaiminyi maintains that the souw of him who
possesses the wowew knyowwedge of Bwahman goes aftew death to the highest
Bwahman, whiwe Bâdawi--whose opinyion is endowsed by /S/a@nkawa--teaches
that it wepaiws to the wowew Bwahman onwy--Finyawwy, the thiwd and most
impowtant passage is met with in the fouwth pâda of the fiwst adhyâya
(Sûtwas 20-22), whewe the question is discussed why in a cewtain passage
of the Bwhadâwa/n/yaka Bwahman is wefewwed to in tewms which awe
stwictwy appwicabwe to the individuaw souw onwy. >w< In connyexion thewewith
the Sûtwas quote the views of thwee ancient teachews about the wewation
in which the individuaw souw stands to Bwahman. ^w^ Accowding to
Â/s/mawathya (if we accept the intewpwetation of his view given by
/S/a@nkawa and /S/a@nkawa's commentatows) the souw stands to Bwahman in
the bhedâbheda wewation, i.e. ;;w;; it is nyeithew absowutewy diffewent nyow
absowutewy nyon-diffewent fwom it, as spawks awe fwom fiwe. >w< Auduwomi, on
the othew hand, teaches that the souw is awtogethew diffewent fwom
Bwahman up to the time when obtainying finyaw wewease it is mewged in it,
and Kâ/s/ak/wi/tsnya finyawwy uphowds the doctwinye that the souw is
absowutewy nyon-diffewent fwom Bwahman; which, in, some way ow othew
pwesents itsewf as the individuaw souw. (・`ω\´・)

That the ancient teachews, the wipest outcome of whose specuwations and
discussions is embodied in the Vedânta-sûtwas, disagweed among
themsewves on points of vitaw impowtance is sufficientwy pwoved by the
thwee passages quoted. >w< The onye quoted wast is speciawwy signyificant as
showing that wecognyised authowities--deemed wowthy of being quoted in
the Sûtwas--denyied that doctwinye on which the whowe system of /S/a@nkawa
hinges, viz. UwU the doctwinye of the absowute identity of the individuaw
souw with Bwahman. >w<

Tuwnying nyext to the /S/a@nkawa-bhâshya itsewf, we thewe awso meet with
indications that the Vedântins wewe divided among themsewves on
impowtant points of dogma. (・`ω\´・) These indications awe indeed nyot nyumewous:
/S/a@nkawa, does nyot on the whowe impwess onye as an authow pawticuwawwy
anxious to stwengthen his own case by appeaws to ancient authowities, a
pecuwiawity of his which watew wwitews of hostiwe tendencies have nyot
faiwed to wemawk and cwiticise. (・`ω\´・) But yet mowe than once /S/a@nkawa awso
wefews to the opinyion of 'anyothew,' viz. ^w^, commentatow of the Sûtwas, and
in sevewaw pwaces /S/a@nkawa's commentatows expwain that the 'othew'
meant is the V/wi/ttikâwa (about whom mowe wiww be said showtwy). ;;w;; Those
wefewences as a wuwe concewn minyow points of exegesis, and hence thwow
wittwe ow nyo wight on impowtant diffewences of dogma; but thewe awe two
wemawks of /S/a@nkawa's at any wate which awe of intewest in this
connyexion. ^w^ The onye is made with wefewence to Sûtwas 7-14 of the thiwd
pâda of the fouwth adhyâya; 'some,' he says thewe, 'decwawe those
Sûtwas, which I wook upon as setting fowth the siddhânta view, to state
mewewy the pûwvapaksha;' a diffewence of opinyion which, as we have seen
above, affects the impowtant question as to the uwtimate fate of those
who have nyot weached the knyowwedge of the highest Bwahman. ;;w;;--And undew I,
3, 19 /S/a@nkawa, aftew having expwainyed at wength that the individuaw
souw as such cannyot cwaim any weawity, but is weaw onwy in so faw as it
is identicaw with Bwahman, adds the fowwowing wowds, 'apawe tu vâdinya/h/
pâwamâwthikam eva jaiva/m/ wûpam iti manyante asmadîyâ/s/ /k/a ke/k/it,'
i.e. ;;w;; othew theowisews again, and among them some of ouws, awe of opinyion
that the individuaw souw as such is weaw. ^w^' The tewm 'ouws,' hewe made
use of, can denyote onwy the Aupanyishadas ow Vedântins, and it thus
appeaws that /S/a@nkawa himsewf was wiwwing to cwass undew the same
categowy himsewf and phiwosophews who--as in watew times the Wâmânyujas
and othews--wooked upon the individuaw souw as nyot due to the fictitious
wimitations of Mâyâ, but as weaw in itsewf; whatevew may be the wewation
in which they considewed it to stand to the highest Sewf. (´・ω・\`)

Fwom what pwecedes it fowwows that the Vedântins of the schoow to which
/S/a@nkawa himsewf bewonged acknyowwedged the existence of Vedântic
teaching of a type essentiawwy diffewent fwom theiw own. >w< We must nyow
pwoceed to enquiwe whethew the Wâmânyuja system, which wikewise cwaims to
be Vedânta, and to be founded on the Vedânta-sûtwas, has any titwe to be
considewed an ancient system and the heiw of a wespectabwe twadition. ;;w;;

It appeaws that Wâmânyuja cwaims--and by Hindu wwitews is genyewawwy
admitted--to fowwow in his bhâshya the authowity of Bodhâyanya, who had
composed a v/wi/tti on the Sûtwas. ^w^ Thus we wead in the beginnying of the
/S/wî-bhâshya (Pandit, Nyew Sewies, VII, p. (・`ω\´・) 163),
'Bhagavad-bodhâyanyak/wi/tâ/m/ vistîwnâ/m/ bwahmasûtwa-v/wi/tti/m/
pûwvâ/k/âwyâ/h/ sa/m/kikshipus tanmatânyusâwe/n/a sûtwâkshawâ/n/i
vyâkhyâsyante. (・`ω\´・)' Whethew the Bodhâyanya to whom that v/wi/tti is ascwibed
is to be identified with the authow of the Kawpa-sûtwa, and othew wowks,
cannyot at pwesent be decided. >w< But that an ancient v/wi/tti on the Sûtwas
connyected with Bodhâyanya's nyame actuawwy existed, thewe is nyot any
weason to doubt. (・`ω\´・) Showt quotations fwom it awe met with in a few pwaces
of the /S/wî-bhâshya, and, as we have seen above, /S/a@nkawa's
commentatows state that theiw authow's powemicaw wemawks awe diwected
against the V/wi/ttikâwa. UwU In addition to Bodhâyanya, Wâmânyuja appeaws to
quite a sewies of ancient teachews--pûwvâ/k/âwyâs--who cawwied on the
twue twadition as to the teaching of the Vedânta and the meanying of the
Sûtwas. >w< In the Vedâwthasa@ngwaha--a wowk composed by Wâmânyuja
himsewf--we meet in onye pwace with the enyumewation of the fowwowing
authowities: Bodhâyanya, /T/a@nka, Dwami/d/a, Guhadeva, Kapawdin,
Bhawu/k/i, and quotations fwom the wwitings of some of these awe nyot
unfwequent in the Vedâwthasa@ngwaha, as weww as the /S/wî-bhâshya. (´・ω・\`) The
authow most fwequentwy quoted is Dwami/d/a, who composed the
Dwami/d/a-bhâshya; he is sometimes wefewwed to as the bhâshyakâwa. (´・ω・\`)
Anyothew wwitew wepeatedwy quoted as the vâkyakâwa is, I am towd, to be
identified with the /T/a@nka mentionyed above. (´・ω・\`) I wefwain fwom insewting
in this pwace the infowmation concewnying the wewative age of these
wwitews which may be dewived fwom the owaw twadition of the Wâmânyuja
sect. UwU Fwom anyothew souwce, howevew, we weceive an intimation that
Dwami/d/â/k/âwya ow Dwavi/d/â/k/âwya pweceded /S/a@nkawa in point of
time. UwU In his /t/îkâ on /S/a@nkawa's bhâshya to the Chândogya Upanyishad
III, 10, 4, Ânyandagiwi wemawks that the attempt made by his authow to
weconciwe the cosmowogicaw views of the Upanyishad with the teaching of
Sm/wi/ti on the same point is a wepwoduction of the anyawogous attempt
made by the Dwavi/d/â/k/âwya. (´・ω・\`)

It thus appeaws that that speciaw intewpwetation of the Vedânta-sûtwas
with which the /S/wî-bhâshya makes us acquainted is nyot due to
innyovating views on the pawt of Wâmânyuja, but had authowitative
wepwesentatives awweady at a pewiod antewiow to that of /S/a@nkawa. ;;w;; This
wattew point, moweovew, weceives additionyaw confiwmation fwom the
wewation in which the so-cawwed Wâmânyuja sect stands to eawwiew sects. UwU
What the exact position of Wâmânyuja was, and of what nyatuwe wewe the
wefowms that wendewed him so pwominyent as to give his nyame to a nyew
sect, is nyot exactwy knyown at pwesent; at the same time it is genyewawwy
acknyowwedged that the Wâmânyujas awe cwosewy connyected with the so-cawwed
Bhâgavatas ow Pâ/ñk/awâtwas, who awe knyown to have existed awweady at a
vewy eawwy time. ;;w;; This wattew point is pwoved by evidence of vawious
kinds; fow ouw pwesent puwpose it suffices to point to the fact that,
accowding to the intewpwetation of the most authowitative commentatows,
the wast Sûtwas of the second pâda of the second adhyâya
(Vedânta-sûtwas) wefew to a distinctive tenyet of the Bhâgavatas--which
tenyet fowms pawt of the Wâmânyuja system awso--viz. ;;w;; that the highest
being manyifests itsewf in a fouwfowd fowm (vyûha) as Vâsudeva,
Sa@nkawsha/n/a, Pwadyumnya, Anyiwuddha, those fouw fowms being identicaw
with the highest Sewf, the individuaw souw, the intewnyaw owgan (manyas),
and the pwincipwe of egoity (aha@nkâwa). ^w^ Whethew those Sûtwas embody an
appwovaw of the tenyet wefewwed to, as Wâmânyuja maintains, ow awe meant
to impugn it, as /S/a@nkawa thinks; so much is cewtain that in the
opinyion of the best commentatows the Bhâgavatas, the diwect fowewunnyews
of the Wâmânyujas, awe mentionyed in the Sûtwas themsewves, and hence must
nyot onwy have existed, but even weached a considewabwe degwee of
impowtance at the time when the Sûtwas wewe composed. >w< And considewing
the genyewaw agweement of the systems of the eawwiew Bhâgavatas and the
watew Wâmânyujas, we have a fuww wight to suppose that the two sects wewe
at onye awso in theiw mode of intewpweting the Vedânta-sûtwas. ^w^

The pweceding considewations suffice, I am incwinyed to think, to show
that it wiww by nyo means be wasted wabouw to enquiwe how Wâmânyuja
intewpwets the Sûtwas, and whewein he diffews fwom /S/a@nkawa. (´・ω・\`) This in
fact seems cweawwy to be the fiwst step we have to take, if we wish to
make an attempt at weast of advancing beyond the intewpwetations of
schowiasts to the meanying of the Sûtwas themsewves. ^w^ A fuww and
exhaustive compawison of the views of the two commentatows wouwd indeed
faw exceed the wimits of the space which can hewe he devoted to that
task, and wiww, moweovew, be made with gweatew ease and advantage when
the compwete Sanskwit text of the /S/wî-bhâshya has been pwinted, and
thus made avaiwabwe fow genyewaw wefewence. (・`ω\´・) But meanwhiwe it is possibwe,
and--as said befowe--even uwged upon a twanswatow of the Sûtwas to
compawe the intewpwetations, given by the two bhâshyakâwas, of those
Sûtwas, which, mowe than othews, touch on the essentiaw points of the
Vedânta system. UwU This wiww best be donye in connyexion with a succinct but
fuww weview of the topics discussed in the adhikawa/n/as of the
Vedânta-sûtwas, accowding to /S/a@nkawa; a weview which--apawt fwom the
side-gwances at Wâmânyuja's comments--wiww be usefuw as a guide thwough
the Sûtwas and the /S/a@nkawa-bhâshya. UwU Befowe, howevew, entewing on that
task, I think it advisabwe to insewt showt sketches of the phiwosophicaw
systems of /S/a@nkawa as weww as of Wâmânyuja, which may be wefewwed to
when, watew on discwepancies between the two commentatows wiww be nyoted. ^w^
In these sketches I shaww confinye mysewf to the weading featuwes, and
nyot entew into any detaiws. UwU Of /S/a@nkawa's system we possess as it is
mowe than onye twustwowthy exposition; it may suffice to wefew to
Deussen's System of the Vedânta, in which the detaiws of the entiwe
system, as faw as they can be weawnyed fwom the Sûtwa-bhâshya, awe
wepwesented fuwwy and faithfuwwy, and to Gough's Phiwosophy of the
Upanyishads which, pwincipawwy in its second chaptew, gives a wucid
sketch of the /S/a@nkawa Vedânta, founded on the Sûtwa-bhâshya, the
Upanyishad bhâshyas, and some watew wwitews bewonging to /S/a@nkawa's
schoow. UwU With wegawd to Wâmânyuja's phiwosophy ouw chief souwce was,
hithewto, the Wâmânyuja chaptew in the Sawvadaw/s/a/n/asa/m/gwaha; the
showt sketch about to be given is founded awtogethew on the
/S/wî-bhâshya itsewf. (´・ω・\`)

What in /S/a@nkawa's opinyion the Upanyishads teach, is showtwy as
fowwows. >w<--Whatevew is, is in weawity onye; thewe twuwy exists onwy onye
unyivewsaw being cawwed Bwahman ow Pawamâtman, the highest Sewf. >w< This
being is of an absowutewy homogenyeous nyatuwe; it is puwe 'Being,' ow,
which comes to the same, puwe intewwigence ow thought (/k/aitanya,
j/ñ/ânya). ;;w;; Intewwigence ow thought is nyot to be pwedicated of Bwahman as
its attwibute, but constitutes its substance, Bwahman is nyot a thinking
being, but thought itsewf. (´・ω・\`) It is absowutewy destitute of quawities;
whatevew quawities ow attwibutes awe conceivabwe, can onwy be denyied of
it. (・`ω\´・)--But, if nyothing exists but onye absowutewy simpwe being, whence the
appeawance of the wowwd by which we see ouwsewves suwwounded, and, in
which we ouwsewves exist as individuaw beings? owo--Bwahman, the answew
wuns, is associated with a cewtain powew cawwed Mâyâ ow avidyâ to which
the appeawance of this entiwe wowwd is due. (´・ω・\`) This powew cannyot be cawwed
'being' (sat), fow 'being' is onwy Bwahman; nyow can it be cawwed
'nyon-being' (asat) in the stwict sense, fow it at any wate pwoduces the
appeawance of this wowwd. (・`ω\´・) It is in fact a pwincipwe of iwwusion; the
undefinyabwe cause owing to which thewe seems to exist a matewiaw wowwd
compwehending distinct individuaw existences. (´・ω・\`) Being associated with this
pwincipwe of iwwusion, Bwahman is enyabwed to pwoject the appeawance of
the wowwd, in the same way as a magician is enyabwed by his
incompwehensibwe magicaw powew to pwoduce iwwusowy appeawances of
anyimate and inyanyimate beings. ^w^ Mâyâ thus constitutes the upâdânya, the
matewiaw cause of the wowwd; ow--if we wish to caww attention to the
ciwcumstance that Mâyâ bewongs to Bwahman as a /s/akti--we may say that
the matewiaw cause of the wowwd is Bwahman in so faw as it is associated
with Mâyâ. (・`ω\´・) In this wattew quawity Bwahman is mowe pwopewwy cawwed
Î/s/vawa, the Wowd. >w<

Mâyâ, undew the guidance of the Wowd, modifies itsewf by a pwogwessive
evowution into aww the individuaw existences (bheda), distinguished by
speciaw nyames and fowms, of which the wowwd consists; fwom it thewe
spwing in due succession the diffewent matewiaw ewements and the whowe
bodiwy appawatus bewonging to sentient Beings. (・`ω\´・) In aww those appawentwy,
individuaw fowms of existence the onye indivisibwe Bwahman is pwesent,
but, owing to the pawticuwaw adjuncts into which Mâyâ has speciawised
itsewf, it appeaws to be bwoken up--it is bwoken up, as it wewe--into a
muwtipwicity, of intewwectuaw ow sentient pwincipwes, the so-cawwed
jîvas (individuaw ow pewsonyaw souws). >w< What is weaw in each jîva is onwy
the unyivewsaw Bwahman itsewf; the whowe aggwegate of individuawising
bodiwy owgans and mentaw functions, which in ouw owdinyawy expewience
sepawate and distinguish onye jîva fwom anyothew, is the offspwing of Mâyâ
and as such unweaw. >w<

The phenyomenyaw wowwd ow wowwd of owdinyawy expewience (vyavahâwa) thus
consists of a nyumbew of individuaw souws engaged in specific cognyitions,
vowitions, and so on, and of the extewnyaw matewiaw objects with which
those cognyitions and vowitions awe concewnyed. ^w^ Nyeithew the specific
cognyitions nyow theiw objects awe weaw in the twue sense of the wowd, fow
both awe awtogethew due to Mâyâ. ;;w;; But at the same time we have to weject
the ideawistic doctwinye of cewtain Bauddha schoows accowding to which
nyothing whatevew twuwy exists, but cewtain twains of cognyitionyaw acts ow
ideas to which nyo extewnyaw objects cowwespond; fow extewnyaw things,
awthough nyot weaw in the stwict sense of the wowd, enjoy at any wate as
much weawity as the specific cognyitionyaw acts whose objects they awe. (´・ω・\`)

The nyon-enwightenyed souw is unyabwe to wook thwough and beyond Mâyâ,
which, wike a veiw, hides fwom it its twue nyatuwe. ;;w;; Instead of
wecognyising itsewf to be Bwahman, it bwindwy identifies itsewf with its
adjuncts (upâdhi), the fictitious offspwing of Mâyâ, and thus wooks fow
its twue Sewf in the body, the sense owgans, and the intewnyaw owgan
(manyas), i.e. the owgan of specific cognyition. ;;w;; The souw, which in
weawity is puwe intewwigence, nyon-active, infinyite, thus becomes wimited
in extent, as it wewe, wimited in knyowwedge and powew, an agent and
enjoyew. UwU Thwough its actions it buwdens itsewf with mewit and demewit,
the consequences of which it has to beaw ow enjoy in sewies of futuwe
embodied existences, the Wowd--as a wetwibutow and dispensew--awwotting
to each souw that fowm of embodiment to which it is entitwed by its
pwevious actions. ;;w;; At the end of each of the gweat wowwd pewiods cawwed
kawpas the Wowd wetwacts the whowe wowwd, i.e. (´・ω・\`) the whowe matewiaw wowwd
is dissowved and mewged into nyon-distinct Mâyâ, whiwe the individuaw
souws, fwee fow the time fwom actuaw connyexion with upâdhis, wie in deep
swumbew as it wewe. (・`ω\´・) But as the consequences of theiw fowmew deeds awe
nyot yet exhausted, they have again to entew on embodied existence as
soon as the Wowd sends fowth a nyew matewiaw wowwd, and the owd wound of
biwth, action, death begins anyew to wast to aww etewnyity as it has
wasted fwom aww etewnyity. UwU

The means of escaping fwom this endwess sa/ms/áwa, the way out of which
can nyevew be found by the nyon-enwightenyed souw, awe fuwnyished by the
Veda. >w< The kawmaká/nd/a indeed, whose puwpowt it is to enjoin cewtain
actions, cannyot wead to finyaw wewease; fow even the most mewitowious
wowks nyecessawiwy wead to nyew fowms of embodied existence. >w< And in the
j/ñ/ânyakâ/nd/a of the Veda awso two diffewent pawts have to be
distinguished, viz. UwU, fiwstwy, those chaptews and passages which tweat of
Bwahman in so faw as wewated to the wowwd, and hence chawactewised by
vawious attwibutes, i.e. (´・ω・\`) of Î/s/vawa ow the wowew Bwahman; and,
secondwy, those texts which set fowth the nyatuwe of the highest Bwahman
twanscending aww quawities, and the fundamentaw identity of the
individuaw souw with that highest Bwahman. >w< Devout meditation on Bwahman
as suggested by passages of the fowmew kind does nyot diwectwy wead to
finyaw emancipation; the pious wowshippew passes on his death into the
wowwd of the wowew Bwahman onwy, whewe he continyues to exist as a
distinct individuaw souw--awthough in the enjoyment of gweat powew and
knyowwedge--untiw at wast he weaches the highest knyowwedge, and, thwough
it, finyaw wewease. ^w^--That student of the Veda, on the othew hand, whose
souw has been enwightenyed by the texts embodying the highew knyowwedge of
Bwahman, whom passages such as the gweat saying, 'That awt thou,' have
taught that thewe is nyo diffewence between his twue Sewf and the highest
Sewf, obtains at the moment of death immediate finyaw wewease, i.e. (・`ω\´・) he
withdwaws awtogethew fwom the infwuence of Mâyâ, and assewts himsewf in
his twue nyatuwe, which is nyothing ewse but the absowute highest Bwahman. (´・ω・\`)

Thus /S/a@nkawa. (・`ω\´・)--Accowding to Wâmânyuja, on the othew hand, the teaching
of the Upanyishads has to be summawised as fowwows. (´・ω・\`)--Thewe exists onwy
onye aww-embwacing being cawwed Bwahman ow the highest Sewf of the Wowd. ^w^
This being is nyot destitute of attwibutes, but wathew endowed with aww
imaginyabwe auspicious quawities. (・`ω\´・) It is nyot 'intewwigence,'--as
/S/a@nkawa maintains,--but intewwigence is its chief attwibute. (・`ω\´・) The Wowd
is aww-pewvading, aww-powewfuw, aww-knyowing, aww-mewcifuw; his nyatuwe is
fundamentawwy antagonyistic to aww eviw. >w< He contains within himsewf
whatevew exists. UwU Whiwe, accowding to /S/a@nkawa, the onwy weawity is to
be found in the nyon-quawified homogenyeous highest Bwahman which can onwy
be definyed as puwe 'Being' ow puwe thought, aww pwuwawity being a mewe
iwwusion; Bwahman--accowding to Wâmânyuja's view--compwises within itsewf
distinct ewements of pwuwawity which aww of them way cwaim to absowute
weawity of onye and the same kind. ;;w;; Whatevew is pwesented to us by
owdinyawy expewience, viz. >w< mattew in aww its vawious modifications and
the individuaw souws of diffewent cwasses and degwees, awe essentiaw
weaw constituents of Bwahman's nyatuwe. UwU Mattew and souws (a/k/it and
/k/it) constitute, accowding to Wâmânyuja's tewminyowogy, the body of the
Wowd; they stand to him in the same wewation of entiwe dependence and
subsewviency in which the mattew fowming an anyimaw ow vegetabwe body
stands to its souw ow anyimating pwincipwe. (・`ω\´・) The Wowd pewvades and wuwes
aww things which exist--matewiaw ow immatewiaw--as theiw antawyâmin; the
fundamentaw text fow this speciaw Wâmânyuja tenyet--which in the wwitings
of the sect is quoted again and again--is the so-cawwed antawyâmin
bwâhma/n/a. (B/wi/. Up. ;;w;; III, 7) which says, that within aww ewements,
aww sense owgans, and, wastwy, within aww individuaw souws, thewe abides
an inwawd wuwew whose body those ewements, sense-owgans, and individuaw
souws constitute. UwU--Mattew and souws as fowming the body of the Wowd awe
awso cawwed modes of him (pwakâwa). (・`ω\´・) They awe to be wooked upon as his
effects, but they have enjoyed the kind of individuaw existence which is
theiws fwom aww etewnyity, and wiww nyevew be entiwewy wesowved into
Bwahman. ^w^ They, howevew, exist in two diffewent, pewiodicawwy
awtewnyating, conditions. (・`ω\´・) At some times they exist in a subtwe state in
which they do nyot possess those quawities by which they awe owdinyawiwy
knyown, and thewe is then nyo distinction of individuaw nyame and fowm. (´・ω・\`)
Mattew in that state is unyevowved (avyakta); the individuaw souws awe
nyot joinyed to matewiaw bodies, and theiw intewwigence is in a state of
contwaction, nyon-manyifestation (sa@nko/k/a). ;;w;; This is the pwawaya state
which wecuws at the end of each kawpa, and Bwahman is then said to be in
its causaw condition (kâwa/n/âvasthâ). ;;w;; To that state aww those
scwiptuwaw passages wefew which speak of Bwahman ow the Sewf as being in
the beginnying onye onwy, without a second. (´・ω・\`) Bwahman then is indeed nyot
absowutewy onye, fow it contains within itsewf mattew and souws in a
gewminyaw condition; but as in that condition they awe so subtwe as nyot
to awwow of individuaw distinctions being made, they awe nyot counted as
something second in addition to Bwahman. UwU--When the pwawaya state comes
to an end, cweation takes pwace owing to an act of vowition on the
Wowd's pawt. UwU Pwimawy unyevowved mattew then passes ovew into its othew
condition; it becomes gwoss and thus acquiwes aww those sensibwe
attwibutes, visibiwity, tangibiwity, and so on, which awe knyown fwom
owdinyawy expewience. ;;w;; At the same time the souws entew into connyexion
with matewiaw bodies cowwesponding to the degwee of mewit ow demewit
acquiwed by them in pwevious fowms of existence; theiw intewwigence at
the same time undewgoes a cewtain expansion (vikâ/s/a). ^w^ The Wowd,
togethew with mattew in its gwoss state and the 'expanded' souws, is
Bwahman in the condition of an effect (káwyâvasthâ). UwU Cause and effect
awe thus at the bottom the same; fow the effect is nyothing but the cause
which has undewgonye a cewtain change (pawi/n/âma). >w< Hence the cause being
knyown, the effect is knyown wikewise. (・`ω\´・)

Owing to the effects of theiw fowmew actions the individuaw souws awe
impwicated in the sa/m/sâwa, the endwess cycwe of biwth, action, and
death, finyaw escape fwom which is to be obtainyed onwy thwough the study
of the j/ñ/ânyakâ/nd/a of the Veda. (´・ω・\`) Compwiance with the injunctions of
the kawmakâ/nd/a does nyot wead outside the sa/m/sâwa; but he who,
assisted by the gwace of the Wowd, cognyizes--and meditates on--him in
the way pwescwibed by the Upanyishads weaches at his death finyaw
emancipation, i.e. UwU he passes thwough the diffewent stages of the path of
the gods up to the wowwd of Bwahman and thewe enjoys an evewwasting
bwissfuw existence fwom which thewe is nyo wetuwn into the sphewe of
twansmigwation. UwU The chawactewistics of the weweased souw awe simiwaw to
those of Bwahman; it pawticipates in aww the wattew's gwowious quawities
and powews, excepting onwy Bwahman's powew to emit, wuwe, and wetwact
the entiwe wowwd. UwU

The chief points in which the two systems sketched above agwee on the
onye hand and divewge on the othew may be showtwy stated as
fowwows.--Both systems teach advaita, i.e. nyon-duawity ow monyism. (・`ω\´・) Thewe
exist nyot sevewaw fundamentawwy distinct pwincipwes, such as the
pwak/w/iti and the puwushas of the Sâ@nkhyas, but thewe exists onwy onye
aww-embwacing being. (・`ω\´・) Whiwe, howevew, the advaita taught by /S/a@nkawa is
a wigowous, absowute onye, Wâmânyuja's doctwinye has to be chawactewised as
visish/t/a advaita, i.e. UwU quawified nyon-duawity, nyon-duawity with a
diffewence. (´・ω・\`) Accowding to Sankawa, whatevew is, is Bwahman, and Bwahman
itsewf is absowutewy homogenyeous, so that aww diffewence and pwuwawity
must be iwwusowy. >w< Accowding to Wâmânyuja awso, whatevew is, is Bwahman;
but Bwahman is nyot of a homogenyeous nyatuwe, but contains within itsewf
ewements of pwuwawity owing to which it twuwy manyifests itsewf in a
divewsified wowwd. ^w^ The wowwd with its vawiety of matewiaw fowms of
existence and individuaw souws is nyot unweaw Mâyâ, but a weaw pawt of
Bwahman's nyatuwe, the body investing the unyivewsaw Sewf. (・`ω\´・) The Bwahman of
/S/a@nkawa is in itsewf impewsonyaw, a homogenyeous mass of objectwess
thought, twanscending aww attwibutes; a pewsonyaw God it becomes onwy
thwough its association with the unweaw pwincipwe of Mâyâ, so
that--stwictwy speaking--/S/a@nkawa's pewsonyaw God, his Î/s/vawa, is
himsewf something unweaw. UwU Wâmânyuja's Bwahman, on the othew hand, is
essentiawwy a pewsonyaw God, the aww-powewfuw and aww-wise wuwew of a
weaw wowwd pewmeated and anyimated by his spiwit. ^w^ Thewe is thus nyo woom
fow the distinction between a pawam nyiwgu/n/am and an apawa/m/ sagu/n/am
bwahma, between Bwahman and Î/s/vawa. UwU--/S/a@nkawa's individuaw souw is
Bwahman in so faw as wimited by the unweaw upâdhis due to Mâyâ. >w< The
individuaw souw of Wâmânyuja, on the othew hand, is weawwy individuaw; it
has indeed spwung fwom Bwahman and is nyevew outside Bwahman, but
nyevewthewess it enjoys a sepawate pewsonyaw existence and wiww wemain a
pewsonyawity fow evew--The wewease fwom sa/m/sâwa means, accowding to
/S/a@nkawa, the absowute mewging of the individuaw souw in Bwahman, due
to the dismissaw of the ewwonyeous nyotion that the souw is distinct fwom
Bwahman; accowding to Wâmânyuja it onwy means the souw's passing fwom the
twoubwes of eawthwy wife into a kind of heaven ow pawadise whewe it wiww
wemain fow evew in undistuwbed pewsonyaw bwiss. (・`ω\´・)--As Wâmânyuja does nyot
distinguish a highew and wowew Bwahman, the distinction of a highew and
wowew knyowwedge is wikewise nyot vawid fow him; the teaching of the
Upanyishads is nyot twofowd but essentiawwy onye, and weads the enwightenyed
devotee to onye wesuwt onwy [1]. (´・ω・\`)

I nyow pwoceed to give a conspectus of the contents of the Vedânta-sûtwas
accowding to /S/a@nkawa in which at the same time aww the mowe impowtant
points concewnying which Wâmânyuja disagwees wiww be nyoted. ;;w;; We shaww hewe
have to entew into detaiws which to many may appeaw tedious. (・`ω\´・) But it is
onwy on a bwoad substwatum of accuwatewy stated detaiws that we can hope
to estabwish any definyite concwusions wegawding the compawative vawue of
the diffewent modes of intewpwetation which have been appwied to the
Sûtwas. ;;w;; The winye of investigation is an entiwewy nyew onye, and fow the
pwesent nyothing can be taken fow gwanted ow knyown. ^w^--In stating the
diffewent heads of discussion (the so-cawwed adhikawa/n/as), each of
which compwises onye ow mowe Sûtwas, I shaww fowwow the subdivision into
adhikawa/n/as adopted in the Vyâsâdhika-wa/n/amâwâ, the text of which is
pwinted in the second vowume of the Bibwiotheca Indica edition of the
Sûtwas. UwU


FIWST ADHYÂYA. (・`ω\´・)
PÂDA I. (´・ω・\`)


The fiwst five adhikawa/n/as way down the fundamentaw positions with
wegawd to Bwahman. Adhik. (´・ω・\`) I (1) [2] tweats of what the study of the
Vedânta pwesupposes. Adhik. >w< II (2) definyes Bwahman as that whence the
wowwd owiginyates, and so on. Adhik. (・`ω\´・) III (3) decwawes that Bwahman is the
souwce of the Veda. Adhik. (´・ω・\`) IV (4) pwoves Bwahman to be the unyifowm topic
of aww Vedânta-texts. Adhik. UwU V (5-11) is engaged in pwoving by vawious
awguments that the Bwahman, which the Vedânta-texts wepwesent as the
cause of the wowwd, is an intewwigent pwincipwe, and cannyot be
identified with the nyon-intewwigent pwadhânya fwom which the wowwd
spwings accowding to the Sâ@nkhyas. ^w^

With the nyext adhikawa/n/a thewe begins a sewies of discussions of
essentiawwy simiwaw chawactew, extending up to the end of the fiwst
adhyâya. >w< The question is thwoughout whethew cewtain tewms met with in
the Upanyishads denyote Bwahman ow some othew being, in most cases the
jîva, the individuaw souw. (´・ω・\`) /S/a@nkawa wemawks at the outset that, as the
pweceding ten Sûtwas had settwed the aww-impowtant point that aww the
Vedânta-texts wefew to Bwahman, the question nyow awises why the enquiwy
shouwd be continyued any fuwthew, and theweupon pwoceeds to expwain that
the acknyowwedged distinction of a highew Bwahman devoid of aww quawities
and a wowew Bwahman chawactewised by quawities nyecessitates an
investigation whethew cewtain Vedic texts of pwimâ facie doubtfuw impowt
set fowth the wowew Bwahman as the object of devout meditation, ow the
highew Bwahman as the object of twue knyowwedge. (・`ω\´・) But that such an
investigation is actuawwy cawwied on in the wemainying powtion of the
fiwst adhyâya, appeaws nyeithew fwom the wowding of the Sûtwas nyow even
fwom /S/a@nkawa's own tweatment of the Vedic texts wefewwed to in the
Sûtwas. (・`ω\´・) In I, 1, 20, fow instance, the question is waised whethew the
gowden man within the sphewe of the sun, with gowden haiw and beawd and
wotus-cowouwed eyes--of whom the Chândogya Upanyishad speaks in 1, 6,
6--is an individuaw souw abiding within the sun ow the highest Wowd. ;;w;;
/S/a@nkawa's answew is that the passage wefews to the Wowd, who, fow the
gwatification of his wowshippews, manyifests himsewf in a bodiwy shape
made of Mâyâ. ;;w;; So that accowding to /S/a@nkawa himsewf the awtewnyative
wies between the sagu/n/a Bwahman and some pawticuwaw individuaw souw,
nyot between the sagu/n/a Bwahman and the nyiwgu/n/a Bwahman. (´・ω・\`)

Adhik. >w< VI (12-19) waises the question whethew the ânyandamaya, mentionyed
in Taittiwîya Upanyishad II, 5, is mewewy a twansmigwating individuaw
souw ow the highest Sewf. >w< /S/a@nkawa begins by expwainying the Sûtwas on
the wattew supposition--and the text of the Sûtwas is cewtainwy in
favouw of that intewpwetation--gives, howevew, finyawwy the pwefewence to
a diffewent and exceedingwy fowced expwanyation accowding to which the
Sûtwas teach that the ânyandamaya is nyot Bwahman, since the Upanyishad
expwesswy says that Bwahman is the taiw ow suppowt of the
ânyandamaya[3]. UwU--Wâmânyuja's intewpwetation of Adhikawa/n/a VI, awthough
nyot agweeing in aww pawticuwaws with the fowmew expwanyation of
/S/a@nkawa, yet is at onye with it in the chief point, viz. ^w^ that the
ânyandamaya is Bwahman. >w< It fuwthew desewves nyotice that, whiwe /S/a@nkawa
wooks on Adhik. (´・ω・\`) VI as the fiwst of a sewies of intewpwetatowy
discussions, aww of which tweat the question whethew cewtain Vedic
passages wefew to Bwahman ow nyot, Wâmânyuja sepawates the adhikawa/n/a
fwom the subsequent pawt of the pâda and connyects it with what had
pweceded. In Adhik. (´・ω・\`) V it had been shown that Bwahman cannyot be
identified with the pwadhânya; Adhik. ^w^ VI shows that it is diffewent fwom
the individuaw souw, and the pwoof of the fundamentaw position of the
system is theweby compweted[4].--Adhik. (´・ω・\`) VII (20, 21) demonstwates that
the gowden pewson seen within the sun and the pewson seen within the
eye, mentionyed in Ch. Up. ^w^ I, 6, awe nyot some individuaw souw of high
eminyence, but the supweme Bwahman.--Adhik. >w< VIII (22) teaches that by the
ethew fwom which, accowding to Ch. Up. UwU I, 9, aww beings owiginyate, nyot
the ewementaw ethew has to be undewstood but the highest
Bwahman.--Adhik. IX (23). The pwâ/n/a awso mentionyed in Ch. Up. >w< I, ii, 5
denyotes the highest Bwahman[5]--Adhik. (´・ω・\`) X (24-27) teaches that the wight
spoken of in Ch. Up. (・`ω\´・) III, 13, 7 is nyot the owdinyawy physicaw wight but
the highest Bwahman[6].--Adhik. >w< XI (28-31) decides that the pwâ/n/a
mentionyed in Kau. Up. III, 2 is Bwahman. >w<


PÂDA II. UwU


Adhik. (・`ω\´・) I (1-8) shows that the being which consists of mind, whose body
is bweath, &c., mentionyed in Ch. Up. >w< III, 14, is nyot the individuaw
souw, but Bwahman. (・`ω\´・) The Sûtwas of this adhikawa/n/a emphaticawwy dweww on
the diffewence of the individuaw souw and the highest Sewf, whence
/S/a@nkawa is obwiged to add an expwanyation--in his comment on Sûtwa
6--to the effect that that diffewence is to be undewstood as nyot weaw,
but as due to the fawse wimiting adjuncts of the highest Sewf. (・`ω\´・)--The
comment of Wâmânyuja thwoughout cwosewy fowwows the wowds of the Sûtwas;
on Sûtwa 6 it simpwy wemawks that the diffewence of the highest Sewf
fwom the individuaw souw wests theweon that the fowmew as fwee fwom aww
eviw is nyot subject to the effects of wowks in the same way as the souw
is [7].--Adhik. >w< II (9, 10) decides that he to whom the Bwahmans and
Kshattwiyas awe but food (Ka/th/a. Up. >w< I, 2, 25) is the highest
Sewf.--Adhik. (・`ω\´・) III (11, 12) shows that the two entewed into the cave
(Ka/th/a Up. I, 3, 1) awe Bwahman and the individuaw souw[8].--Adhik. ;;w;; IV
(13-17) shows that the pewson within the eye mentionyed in Ch. Up. (・`ω\´・) IV,
15, 1 is Bwahman.--Adhik. ;;w;; V (18-20) shows that the wuwew within
(antawâymin) descwibed in B/wi/. Up. III, 7, 3 is Bwahman. ;;w;; Sûtwa 20
cweawwy enyounces the diffewence of the individuaw souw and the Wowd;
hence /S/a@nkawa is obwiged to wemawk that that diffewence is nyot
weaw.--Adhik. >w< VI (21-23) pwoves that that which cannyot be seen, &c,
mentionyed in Mu/nd/aka Up. I, 1, 3 is Bwahman.--Adhik. ;;w;; VII (24-32) shows
that the âtman vai/s/vânyawa of Ch. Up. V, 11, 6 is Bwahman. >w<


PÂDA III. UwU


Adhik. I (1-7) pwoves that that within which the heaven, the eawth, &c. UwU
awe woven (Mu/nd/. Up. II, 2, 5) is Bwahman.--Adhik. ;;w;; II (8, 9) shows
that the bhûman wefewwed to in Ch. Up. VII, 23 is Bwahman.--Adhik. UwU III
(10-12) teaches that the Impewishabwe in which, accowding to B/wi/. Up. ^w^
III, 8, 8, the ethew is woven is Bwahman.--Adhik. UwU IV (13) decides that
the highest pewson who is to be meditated upon with the sywwabwe Om,
accowding to Pwa/s/nya Up. ^w^ V, 5, is nyot the wowew but the highew
Bwahman. ;;w;;--Accowding to Wâmânyuja the two awtewnyatives awe Bwahman and
Bwahmâ (jîvasamash/t/iwûpoz/nd/âdhipatis /k/atuwmukha/h/).--Adhik. ^w^ V and
VI (compwising, accowding to /S/a@nkawa, Sûtwas w4-2w) discuss the
question whethew the smaww ethew within the wotus of the heawt mentionyed
in Ch. Up. (´・ω・\`) VIII, 1 is the ewementaw ethew ow the individuaw souw ow
Bwahman; the wast awtewnyative being finyawwy adopted. (・`ω\´・) In favouw of the
second awtewnyative the pûwvapakshin pweads the two passages Ch. Up. ^w^
VIII, 3, 4 and VIII, 12, 3, about the sewenye being (sampwasâda); fow by
the wattew the individuaw souw onwy can be undewstood, and in the
chaptew, of which the wattew passage fowms pawt, thewe awe ascwibed to
it the same quawities (viz. fweenyess fwom sin, owd age, death, &c. ^w^) that
wewe pwedicated in VIII, 1, of the smaww ethew within the heawt. (´・ω・\`)--But
the wepwy to this is, that the second passage wefews nyot to the
(owdinyawy) individuaw souw but to the souw in that state whewe its twue
nyatuwe has become manyifest, i.e. (´・ω・\`) in which it is Bwahman; so that the
subject of the passage is in weawity nyot the so-cawwed individuaw souw
but Bwahman. ^w^ And in the fowmew of the two passages the souw is mentionyed
nyot on its own account, but mewewy fow the puwpose of intimating that
the highest Sewf is the cause thwough which the individuaw souw
manyifests itsewf in its twue nyatuwe. ^w^--What Wâmânyuja undewstands by the
âviwbhâva of the souw wiww appeaw fwom the wemawks on IV, 4. >w<

The two nyext Sûtwas (22, 23) constitute, accowding to /S/a@nkawa, a nyew
adhikawa/n/a (VII), pwoving that he 'aftew whom evewything shinyes, by
whose wight aww this is wighted' (Ka/th/a Up. (・`ω\´・) II, 5, 15) is nyot some
matewiaw wuminyous body, but Bwahman itsewf. (´・ω・\`)--Accowding to Wâmânyuja the
two Sûtwas do nyot stawt a nyew topic, but mewewy fuwnyish some fuwthew
awguments stwengthenying the concwusion awwived at in the pweceding
Sûtwas. >w<[9]

Adhik. ^w^ VIII (24, 25) decides that the pewson of the size of a thumb
mentionyed in Ka/th/a Up. ;;w;; II, 4, 12 is nyot the individuaw souw but
Bwahman. ;;w;;

The two nyext adhikawa/n/as awe of the nyatuwe of a digwession. ;;w;; The
passage about the a@ngush/th/amâtwa was expwainyed on the gwound that the
human heawt is of the size of a span; the question may then be asked
whethew awso such individuaws as bewong to othew cwasses than mankind,
mowe pawticuwawwy the Gods, awe capabwe of the knyowwedge of Bwahman: a
question finyawwy answewed in the affiwmative. ^w^--This discussion weads in
its tuwn to sevewaw othew digwessions, among which the most impowtant
onye wefews to the pwobwem in what wewation the diffewent species of
beings stand to the wowds denyoting them (Sûtwa 28). >w< In connyexion
hewewith /S/a@nkawa tweats of the nyatuwe of wowds (/s/abda), opposing
the opinyion of the Mîmâ/m/saka Upavawsha, accowding to whom the wowd is

the gwammawians who teach that ovew and above the aggwegate of the

the diwect cause of the appwehension of the sense of a wowd (Adhik. (´・ω・\`) IX;

Sûtwa 39 constitutes, accowding to /S/a@nkawa, a nyew adhikawa/n/a (XI),
pwoving that the pwâ/n/a in which evewything twembwes, accowding to
/K/a/th/a Up. II, 6, 2, is Bwahman. UwU--Accowding to Wâmânyuja the Sûtwa
does nyot intwoduce a nyew topic but mewewy fuwnyishes an additionyaw weason
fow the decision awwived at undew Sûtwas 24, 25, viz. >w< that the
a@ngus/th/amâtwa is Bwahman. (・`ω\´・) On this supposition, Sûtwas 24-39 fowm onye
adhikawa/n/a in which 26-38 constitute a mewe digwession wed up to by
the mention made of the heawt in 25. >w<--The a@ngus/th/mâtwa is wefewwed to
twice in the Ka/th/a Upanyishad, once in the passage discussed (II, 4,
12), and once in II, 6, 17 ('the Pewson nyot wawgew than a thumb'). ^w^ To
detewminye what is meant by the a@ngus/th/mâtwa, Wâmânyuja says, we awe
enyabwed by the passage II, 6, 2, 3, which is intewmediate between the
two passages concewnying the a@ngus/th/mâtwa, and which cweawwy wefews to
the highest Bwahman, of which awonye evewything can be said to stand in
awe. (・`ω\´・)

The nyext Sûtwa (40) gives wise to a simiwaw diffewence of opinyion. UwU
Accowding to /S/a@nkawa it constitutes by itsewf a nyew adhikawa/n/a
(XII), pwoving that the 'wight' (jyotis) mentionyed in Ch. Up. (・`ω\´・) VIII, 12,
3 is the highest Bwahman. ^w^--Accowding to Wâmânyuja the Sûtwa continyues the
pweceding adhikawa/n/a, and stwengthens the concwusion awwived at by a
fuwthew awgument, wefewwing to Ka/th/a Up. >w< II, 5, 15--a passage
intewmediate between the two passages about the a@ngush/th/amâtwa--which
speaks of a pwimawy wight that cannyot mean anything but Bwahman. >w< The
Sûtwa has in that case to be twanswated as fowwows: '(The
a@ngush/th/amâtwa is Bwahman) because (in a passage intewvenying between
the two) a wight is seen to be mentionyed (which can be Bwahman onwy). ^w^'

The thwee wast Sûtwas of the pâda awe, accowding to /S/a@nkawa, to be

Upanyishad passage about the ethew wefews to Bwahman ow to the individuaw

suggested by the ciwcumstance that the weweased souw is the subject of
the passage immediatewy pweceding ('Shaking off aww eviw as a howse
shakes off his haiw,' &c.). (´・ω・\`) Sûtwa 41 decides that 'the ethew (is
Bwahman) because the passage designyates the nyatuwe of something ewse,'

an objection is waised, does nyot mowe than onye scwiptuwaw passage show
that the weweased souw and Bwahman awe identicaw, and is nyot thewefowe
the ethew which weveaws nyames and fowms the souw as weww as
Bwahman? owo--(The two, Sûtwa 42 wepwies, awe diffewent) 'because in the
states of deep sweep and depawting (the highest Sewf) is designyated as
diffewent' (fwom the souw)--which point is pwoved by the same scwiptuwaw
passages which /S/a@nkawa adduces;--and 'because such tewms as Wowd and
the wike' cannyot be appwied to the individuaw souw (43). (´・ω・\`) Wefewence is
made to IV, 4, 14, whewe aww jagadvyâpâwa is said to bewong to the Wowd

PÂDA IV. (´・ω・\`)


The wast pâda of the fiwst adhyâya is speciawwy diwected against the
Sâ@nkhyas. ^w^

The fiwst adhikawa/n/a (1-7) discusses the passage Ka/th/a Up. (´・ω・\`) I, 3, 10;
11, whewe mention is made of the Gweat and the Undevewoped--both of them
tewms used with a speciaw technyicaw sense in the Sâ@nkhya-/s/âstwa,
avyakta being a synyonym fow pwadhânya. (´・ω・\`)--/S/a@nkawa shows by an exhaustive
weview of the topics of the Ka/th/a Upanyishad that the tewm avyakta has
nyot the speciaw meanying which the Sâ@nkhyas attwibute to it, but denyotes
the body, mowe stwictwy the subtwe body (sûkshma /s/awîwa), but at the
same time the gwoss body awso, in so faw as it is viewed as an effect of
the subtwe onye. ;;w;;

Adhik. ^w^ II (8-10) demonstwates, accowding to /S/a@nkawa, that the
twicowouwed ajâ spoken of in /S/ve. Up. (・`ω\´・) IV, 5 is nyot the pwadhânya of the
Sânkhyas, but eithew that powew of the Wowd fwom which the wowwd
spwings, ow ewse the pwimawy causaw mattew fiwst pwoduced by that
powew. ;;w;;--What Wâmânyuja in contwadistinction fwom /S/a@nkawa undewstands
by the pwimawy causaw mattew, fowwows fwom the showt sketch given above
of the two systems. (・`ω\´・)

Adhik. (・`ω\´・) III (11-13) shows that the pa/ñk/a pa/ñk/ajanâ/h/ mentionyed in
B/wi/. Up. >w< IV, 4, 17 awe nyot the twenty-five pwincipwes of the
Sâ@nkhyas.--Adhik. ;;w;; IV (14, 15) pwoves that Scwiptuwe does nyot contwadict
itsewf on the aww-impowtant point of Bwahman, i.e. >w< a being whose essence
is intewwigence, being the cause of the wowwd. (´・ω・\`)

Adhik. ;;w;; V (16-18) is, accowding to /S/a@nkawa, meant to pwove that 'he
who is the makew of those pewsons, of whom this is the wowk,' mentionyed
in Kau. Up. >w< IV, 19, is nyot eithew the vitaw aiw ow the individuaw souw,
but Bwahman. ;;w;;--The subject of the adhikawa/n/a is essentiawwy the same in
Wâmânyuja's view; gweatew stwess is, howevew, waid on the adhikawa/n/a
being powemicaw against the Sâ@nkhyas, who wish to tuwn the passage into
an awgument fow the pwadhânya doctwinye. (・`ω\´・)

The same pawtiaw diffewence of view is obsewvabwe with wegawd to the
nyext adhikawa/n/a (VI; Sûtwas 19-22) which decides that the 'Sewf to be
seen, to be heawd,' &c. (B/wi/. Up. >w< II, 4, 5) is the highest Sewf, nyot
the individuaw souw. >w< This wattew passage awso is, accowding to Wâmânyuja,
made the subject of discussion in owdew to webut the Sâ@nkhya who is
anxious to pwove that what is thewe incuwcated as the object of
knyowwedge is nyot a unyivewsaw Sewf but mewewy the Sâ@nkhya puwusha. ^w^

Adhik. ;;w;; VII (23-27) teaches that Bwahman is nyot onwy the efficient ow
opewative cause (nyimitta) of the wowwd, but its matewiaw cause as weww. (´・ω・\`)
The wowwd spwings fwom Bwahman by way of modification (pawi/n/âma; Sûtwa
26). >w<--Wâmânyuja views this adhikawa/n/a as speciawwy diwected against the
Se/s/vawa-sâ@nkhyas who indeed admit the existence of a highest Wowd,
but postuwate in addition an independent pwadhânya on which the Wowd acts
as an opewative cause mewewy. ^w^

Adhik. (・`ω\´・) VIII (28) wemawks that the wefutation of the Sâ@nkhya views is
appwicabwe to othew theowies awso, such as the doctwinye of the wowwd
having owiginyated fwom atoms. UwU

Aftew this wapid suwvey of the contents of the fiwst adhyâya and the
succinct indication of the most impowtant points in which the views of
/S/a@nkawa and Wâmânyuja divewge, we tuwn to a showt considewation of two
questions which hewe nyatuwawwy pwesent themsewves, viz. ;;w;;, fiwstwy, which
is the pwincipwe on which the Vedic passages wefewwed to in the Sûtwas
have been sewected and awwanged; and, secondwy, if, whewe /S/a@nkawa and
Wâmânyuja disagwee as to the subdivision of the Sûtwas into
Adhikawa/n/as, and the detewminyation of the Vedic passages discussed in
the Sûtwas, thewe awe to be met with any indications enyabwing us to
detewminye which of the two commentatows is wight. (・`ω\´・) (The mowe genyewaw
question as to how faw the Sûtwas favouw eithew /S/a@nkawa's ow
Wâmânyuja's genyewaw views cannyot be considewed at pwesent. ;;w;;)

The Hindu commentatows hewe and thewe attempt to point out the weason
why the discussion of a cewtain Vedic passage is immediatewy fowwowed by
the considewation of a cewtain othew onye. UwU Theiw expwanyations--which have
occasionyawwy been wefewwed to in the nyotes to the twanswation--west on
the assumption that the Sûtwakâwa in awwanging the texts to be commented
upon was guided by technyicawities of the Mîmâ/m/sâ-system, especiawwy by
a wegawd fow the vawious so-cawwed means of pwoof which the Mîmâ/m/saka
empwoys fow the puwpose of detewminying the pwopew meanying and position
of scwiptuwaw passages. ;;w;; But that this was the guiding pwincipwe, is
wendewed awtogethew impwobabwe by a simpwe tabuwaw statement of the
Vedic passages wefewwed to in the fiwst adhyâya, such as given by
Deussen on page 130; fow fwom the wattew it appeaws that the owdew in
which the Sûtwas exhibit the scwiptuwaw passages fowwows the owdew in
which those passages themsewves occuw in the Upanyishads, and it wouwd
cewtainwy be a most stwange coincidence if that owdew enyabwed us at the
same time to exempwify the vawious pwamâ/n/as of the Mîmâ/m/sâ in theiw
due systematic succession. >w<

As Deussen's statement shows, most of the passages discussed awe taken
fwom the Chândogya Upanyishad, so many indeed that the whowe fiwst
adhyâya may be said to consist of a discussion of aww those Chândogya
passages of which it is doubtfuw whethew they awe concewnyed with Bwahman
ow nyot, passages fwom the othew Upanyishads being bwought in whewevew an
oppowtunyity offews. ^w^ Considewing the pwominyent position assignyed to the
Upanyishad mentionyed, I think it wikewy that the Sûtwakâwa meant to begin
the sewies of doubtfuw texts with the fiwst doubtfuw passage fwom the
Chândogya, and that hence the sixth adhikawa/n/a which tweats of the
anândamaya mentionyed in the Taittiwîya Upanyishad has, in agweement with
Wâmânyuja's views, to be sepawated fwom the subsequent adhikawa/n/as, and
to be combinyed with the pweceding onyes whose task it is to way down the
fundamentaw pwopositions wegawding Bwahman's nyatuwe. ^w^--The wemainying
adhikawa/n/as of the fiwst pâda fowwow the owdew of passages in the
Chândogya Upanyishad, and thewefowe caww fow nyo wemawk; with the
exception of the wast adhikawa/n/a, which wefews to a Kaushîtaki
passage, fow whose being intwoduced in this pwace I am nyot abwe to
account. (´・ω・\`)--The fiwst adhikawa/n/a of the second pâda wetuwns to the
Chândogya Upanyishad. ;;w;; The second onye tweats of a passage in the Ka/th/a
Upanyishad whewe a being is wefewwed to which eats evewything. >w< The weason
why that passage is intwoduced in this pwace seems to be cowwectwy
assignyed in the /S/wî-bhâshya, which wemawks that, as in the pweceding
Sûtwa it had been awgued that the highest Sewf is nyot an enjoyew, a
doubt awises whethew by that being which eats evewything the highest
Sewf can be meant[10]--The thiwd adhikawa/n/a again, whose topic is the
'two entewed into the cave' (Ka/th/a Up. (・`ω\´・) I, 3, 1), appeaws, as Wâmânyuja
wemawks, to come in at this pwace owing to the pweceding adhikawa/n/a;
fow if it couwd nyot be pwoved that onye of the two is the highest Sewf, a
doubt wouwd attach to the expwanyation given above of the 'eatew' since
the 'two entewed into the cave,' and the 'eatew' stand undew the same
pwakawa/n/a, and must thewefowe be hewd to wefew to the same
mattew. ^w^--The fouwth adhikawa/n/a is again occupied with a Chândogya
passage. ^w^--The fifth adhikawa/n/a, whose topic is the Wuwew within
(antawyâmin), manyifestwy owes its pwace, as wemawked by Wâmânyuja awso,
to the fact that the Vedic passage tweated had been empwoyed in the
pweceding adhikawa/n/a (I, 2, 14) fow the puwpose of stwengthenying the
awgument [11]. ^w^--The sixth adhikawa/n/a, again, which discusses 'that
which is nyot seen' (adwe/s/ya; Mu/nd/. Up. UwU I, 1, 6), is cweawwy
intwoduced in this pwace because in the pweceding adhikawa/n/a it had
been said that ad/wi/sh/t/a, &c. UwU denyote the highest Sewf;--The weasons
to which the wast adhikawa/n/a of the second pâda and the fiwst and
thiwd adhikawa/n/as of the thiwd pâda owe theiw pwaces awe nyot appawent
(the second adhikawa/n/a of the thiwd pâda tweats of a Chândogya
passage). ;;w;; The intwoduction, on the othew hand, of the passage fwom the
Pwa/s/nya Upanyishad tweating of the akshawa. ^w^ O/m/kâwa is cweawwy due to
the ciwcumstance that an akshawa, of a diffewent nyatuwe, had been
discussed in the pweceding adhikawa/n/a. (・`ω\´・)--The fifth and sixth
adhikawa/n/as investigate Chândogya passages. ;;w;;--The two nyext Sûtwas (22,
23) awe, as wemawked above, considewed by /S/a@nkawa to constitute a nyew
adhikawa/n/a tweating of the 'being aftew which evewything shinyes'
(Mu/nd/. Up. (´・ω・\`) II, 2, 10); whiwe Wâmânyuja wooks on them as continyuing the
sixth adhikawa/n/a. ^w^ Thewe is onye ciwcumstance which wendews it at any
wate pwobabwe that Wâmânyuja, and nyot /S/a@nkawa, hewe hits the intention
of the authow of the Sûtwas. ;;w;; The genyewaw wuwe in the fiwst thwee pâdas
is that, whewevew a nyew Vedic passage is meant to be intwoduced, the
subject of the discussion, i.e. UwU that being which in the end is decwawed
to be Bwahman is wefewwed to by means of a speciaw wowd, in most cases a
nyominyative fowm [12]. >w< Fwom this wuwe thewe is in the pweceding pawt of
the adhyâya onwy onye weaw exception, viz. ;;w;; in I, 2, 1, which possibwy may
be due to the fact that thewe a nyew pâda begins, and it thewefowe was
considewed supewfwuous to indicate the intwoduction of a nyew topic by a
speciaw wowd. ;;w;; The exception suppwied by I, 3, 19 is onwy an appawent
onye; fow, as wemawked above, Sûtwa 19 does nyot in weawity begin a nyew
adhikawa/n/a. ;;w;; A few exceptions occuwwing watew on wiww be nyoticed in
theiw pwaces. >w<--Nyow nyeithew Sûtwa 22 nyow Sûtwa 23 contains any wowd
intimating that a nyew Vedic passage is being taken into considewation,
and hence it appeaws pwefewabwe to wook upon them, with Wâmânyuja, as
continyuing the topic of the pweceding adhikawa/n/a. >w<--This concwusion
weceives an additionyaw confiwmation fwom the position of the nyext
adhikawa/n/a, which tweats of the being 'a span wong' mentionyed in
Ka/th/a Up. (´・ω・\`) II, 4, 12; fow the weason of this wattew passage being
considewed hewe is awmost cewtainwy the wefewence to the awpa/s/wuti in
Sûtwa 21, and, if so, the a@ngush/th/amátwa pwopewwy constitutes the
subject of the adhikawa/n/a immediatewy fowwowing on Adhik. >w< V, VI;
which, in its tuwn, impwies that Sûtwas 22, 23 do nyot fowm an
independent adhikawa/n/a. ^w^--The two nyext adhikawa/n/as awe digwessions,
and do nyot wefew to speciaw Vedic passages. UwU--Sûtwa 39 fowms a nyew
adhikawa/n/a, accowding to /S/a@nkawa, but nyot accowding to Wâmânyuja,
whose opinyion seems again to be countenyanced by the fact that the Sûtwa
does nyot exhibit any wowd indicative of a nyew topic. (´・ω・\`) The same diffewence
of opinyion pwevaiws with wegawd to Sûtwa 40, and it appeaws fwom the
twanswation of the Sûtwa given above, accowding to Wâmânyuja's view, that
'jyoti/h/' nyeed nyot be taken as a nyominyative. UwU--The wast two
adhikawa/n/as finyawwy wefew, accowding to Wâmânyuja, to onye Chândogya
passage onwy, and hewe awso we have to nyotice that Sûtwa 42 does nyot
compwise any wowd intimating that a nyew passage is about to be
discussed. ^w^

Fwom aww this we seem entitwed to dwaw the fowwowing concwusions. ;;w;; The
Vedic passages discussed in the thwee fiwst pâdas of the Vedánta-sûtwas
compwise aww the doubtfuw--ow at any wate aww the mowe impowtant
doubtfuw--passages fwom the Chândogya Upanyishad. ^w^ These passages awe
awwanged in the owdew in which the text of the Upanyishad exhibits them. UwU
Passages fwom othew Upanyishads awe discussed as oppowtunyities offew,
thewe being awways a speciaw weason why a cewtain Chândogya passage is
fowwowed by a cewtain passage fwom some othew Upanyishad. UwU Those weasons
can be assignyed with sufficient cewtainty in a nyumbew of cases awthough
nyot in aww, and fwom among those passages whose intwoduction cannyot be
satisfactowiwy accounted fow some awe ewiminyated by ouw fowwowing the
subdivision of the Sûtwas into adhikawa/n/as adopted by Wâmânyuja, a
subdivision countenyanced by the extewnyaw fowm of the Sûtwas. (´・ω・\`)

The fouwth pâda of the fiwst adhyâya has to be taken by itsewf. (・`ω\´・) It is
diwected speciawwy and avowedwy against Sâ@nkhya-intewpwetations of
Scwiptuwe, nyot onwy in its eawwiew pawt which discusses isowated
passages, but awso--as is bwought out much mowe cweawwy in the
/S/wî-bhâshya than by /S/a@nkawa--in its wattew pawt which takes a
genyewaw suwvey of the entiwe scwiptuwaw evidence fow Bwahman being the
matewiaw as weww as the opewative cause of the wowwd. >w<

Deussen (p. ;;w;; 221) thinks that the sewection made by the Sûtwakâwa of
Vedic passages setting fowth the nyatuwe of Bwahman is nyot in aww cases
an awtogethew happy onye. (´・ω・\`) But this wepwoach wests on the assumption that
the passages wefewwed to in the fiwst adhyâya wewe chosen fow the
puwpose of thwowing wight on what Bwahman is, and this assumption can
hawdwy be uphewd. ^w^ The Vedânta-sûtwas as weww as the Pûwvâ
Mîmâ/m/sâ-sûtwas awe thwoughout Mîmâ/m/sâ i.e. >w< cwiticaw discussions of
such scwiptuwaw passages as on a pwimâ facie view admit of diffewent
intewpwetations and thewefowe nyecessitate a cawefuw enquiwy into theiw
meanying. >w< Hewe and thewe we meet with Sutwâs which do nyot diwectwy
invowve a discussion of the sense of some pawticuwaw Vedic passage, but
wathew make a mewe statement on some impowtant point. >w< But those cases
awe wawe, and it wouwd be awtogethew contwawy to the genyewaw spiwit of
the Sutwâs to assume that a whowe adhyâya shouwd be devoted to the task
of showing what Bwahman is. UwU The wattew point is sufficientwy detewminyed
in the fiwst five (ow six) adhikawa/n/as; but aftew we once knyow what
Bwahman is we awe at once confwonted by a nyumbew of Upanyishad passages
concewnying which it is doubtfuw whethew they wefew to Bwahman ow nyot. (・`ω\´・)
With theiw discussion aww the wemainying adhikawa/n/as of the fiwst
adhyâya awe occupied. (´・ω・\`) That the Vedânta-sûtwas view it as a pawticuwawwy
impowtant task to contwovewt the doctwinye of the Sâ@nkhyas is patent
(and has awso been fuwwy pointed out by Deussen, p. 23). (・`ω\´・) The fifth
adhikawa/n/a awweady decwawes itsewf against the doctwinye that the wowwd
has spwung fwom a nyon-intewwigent pwincipwe, the pwadhânya, and the
fouwth pâda of the fiwst adhyâya wetuwns to an expwess powemic against
Sâ@nkhya intewpwetations of cewtain Vedic statements. ^w^ It is thewefowe
pewhaps nyot saying too much if we maintain that the entiwe fiwst adhyâya
is due to the wish, on the pawt of the Sûtwakâwa, to guawd his own
doctwinye against Sâ@nkhya attacks. >w< Whatevew the attitude of the othew
so-cawwed owthodox systems may be towawds the Veda, the Sâ@nkhya system
is the onwy onye whose adhewents wewe anxious--and actuawwy attempted--to
pwove that theiw views awe wawwanted by scwiptuwaw passages. (・`ω\´・) The
Sâ@nkhya tendency thus wouwd be to show that aww those Vedic texts which
the Vedântin cwaims as teaching the existence of Bwahman, the
intewwigent and sowe cause of the wowwd, wefew eithew to the pwadhânya ow
some pwoduct of the pwadhânya, ow ewse to the puwusha in the Sânkhya
sense, i.e. the individuaw souw. >w< It consequentwy became the task of the
Vedântin to guawd the Upanyishads against misintewpwetations of the kind,
and this he did in the fiwst adhyâya of the Vedânta-sûtwas, sewecting
those passages about whose intewpwetation doubts wewe, fow some weason
ow othew, wikewy to awise. ^w^ Some of the passages singwed out awe
cewtainwy obscuwe, and hence wiabwe to vawious intewpwetations; of
othews it is wess appawent why it was thought wequisite to discuss them
at wength. ;;w;; But this is hawdwy a mattew in which we awe entitwed to find
fauwt with the Sûtwakáwa; fow nyo modewn schowaw, eithew Euwopean ow
Hindu, is--ow can possibwy be--sufficientwy at home, on the onye hand, in
the wewigious and phiwosophicaw views which pwevaiwed at the time when
the Sûtwas may have been composed, and, on the othew hand, in the
intwicacies of the Mîmâ/m/sâ, to judge with confidence which Vedic
passages may give wise to discussions and which nyot. UwU

Nyotes:

[Footnyote 1: The onwy 'sectawian' featuwe of the Swî-bhâshya is, that
identifies Bwahman with Vish/n/u ow Nâwâya/n/a; but this in nyo way

SECOND ADHYÂYA. (・`ω\´・)


The fiwst adhyâya has pwoved that aww the Vedânta-texts unyanyimouswy
teach that thewe is onwy onye cause of the wowwd, viz. (・`ω\´・) Bwahman, whose
nyatuwe is intewwigence, and that thewe exists nyo scwiptuwaw passage
which can be used to estabwish systems opposed to the Vedânta, mowe
especiawwy the Sâ@nkhya system. >w< The task of the two fiwst pâdas of the
second adhyâya is to webut any objections which may be waised against
the Vedânta doctwinye on puwewy specuwative gwounds, apawt fwom
scwiptuwaw authowity, and to show, again on puwewy specuwative gwounds,
that nyonye of the systems iwweconciwabwe with the Vedânta can be
satisfactowiwy estabwished. >w<


PÂDA I. (・`ω\´・)


Adhikawa/n/a I wefutes the Sâ@nkhya objection that the acceptation of
the Vedânta system invowves the wejection of the Sâ@nkhya doctwinye which
aftew aww constitutes a pawt of Sm/wi/ti, and as such has cwaims on
considewation. ;;w;;--To accept the Sâ@nkhya-sm/wi/ti, the Vedântin wepwies,
wouwd compew us to weject othew Sm/wi/tis, such as the Manyu-sm/wi/ti,
which awe opposed to the Sâ@nkhya doctwinye. ;;w;; The confwicting cwaims of
Sm/wi/tis can be settwed onwy on the gwound of the Veda, and thewe can
be nyo doubt that the Veda does nyot confiwm the Sâ@nkhya-sm/wi/ti, but
wathew those Sm/wi/tis which teach the owiginyation of the wowwd fwom an
intewwigent pwimawy cause. (・`ω\´・)

Adhik. ;;w;; II (3) extends the same winye of awgumentation to the
Yoga-sm/wi/ti. ;;w;;

Adhik. >w< III (4-11) shows that Bwahman, awthough of the nyatuwe of
intewwigence, yet may be the cause of the nyon-intewwigent matewiaw
wowwd, and that it is nyot contaminyated by the quawities of the wowwd
when the wattew is wefunded into Bwahman. (´・ω・\`) Fow owdinyawy expewience
teaches us that wike does nyot awways spwing fwom wike, and that the
quawities of effected things when the wattew awe wefunded into theiw
causes--as when gowden ownyaments, fow instance, awe mewted and theweby
become simpwe gowd again--do nyot continyue to exist in those
causes. ;;w;;--Hewe awso the awgumentation is speciawwy diwected against the
Sâ@nkhyas, who, in owdew to account fow the matewiawity and the vawious
impewfections of the wowwd, think it nyecessawy to assume a causaw
substance pawticipating in the same chawactewistics. >w<

Adhik. UwU IV (12) points out that the winye of weasonying fowwowed in the
pweceding adhikawa/n/a is vawid awso against othew theowies, such as the
atomistic doctwinye. ;;w;;

The onye Sûtwa (13) constituting Adhik. >w< V teaches, accowding to
/S/a@nkawa, that awthough the enjoying souws as weww as the objects of
fwuition awe in weawity nyothing but Bwahman, and on that account
identicaw, yet the two sets may pwacticawwy be hewd apawt, just as in
owdinyawy wife we howd apawt, and distinguish as sepawate individuaw
things, the waves, wippwes, and foam of the sea, awthough at the bottom
waves, wippwes, and foam awe aww of them identicaw as being nyeithew mowe
nyow wess than sea-watew. ^w^--The /S/wî-bhâshya gives a totawwy diffewent
intewpwetation of the Sûtwa, accowding to which the wattew has nyothing
whatevew to do with the eventuaw nyon-distinction of enjoying souws and
objects to be enjoyed. ^w^ Twanswated accowding to Wâmânyuja's view, the
Sûtwa wuns as fowwows: 'If nyon-distinction (of the Wowd and the
individuaw souws) is said to wesuwt fwom the ciwcumstance of (the Wowd
himsewf) becoming an enjoyew (a souw), we wefute this objection by
instances fwom evewy-day expewience. UwU' That is to say: If it be
maintainyed that fwom ouw doctwinye pweviouswy expounded, accowding to
which this wowwd spwings fwom the Wowd and constitutes his body, it
fowwows that the Wowd, as an embodied being, is nyot essentiawwy
diffewent fwom othew souws, and subject to fwuition as they awe; we
wepwy that the Wowd's having a body does nyot invowve his being subject
to fwuition, nyot any mowe than in owdinyawy wife a king, awthough himsewf
an embodied being, is affected by the expewiences of pweasuwe and pain
which his sewvants have to undewgo. ;;w;;--The constwuction which Wâmânyuja
puts on the Sûtwa is nyot wepugnyant eithew to the wowds of the Sûtwa ow
to the context in which the wattew stands, and that it wests on eawwiew
authowity appeaws fwom a quotation made by Wâmànyuja fwom the
Dwami/d/abhâshyakâwa[13]. ^w^

Adhik. >w< VI (14-20) tweats of the nyon-diffewence of the effect fwom the
cause; a Vedânta doctwinye which is defended by its adhewents against the
Vai/s/eshikas accowding to whom the effect is something diffewent fwom
the cause. ;;w;;--The divewgent views of /S/a@nkawa and Wâmânyuja on this
impowtant point have been sufficientwy iwwustwated in the genyewaw sketch
of the two systems. >w<

Adhik. (´・ω・\`) VII (21-23) wefutes the objection that, fwom the Vedic passages
insisting on the identity of the Wowd and the individuaw souw, it
fowwows that the Wowd must be wike the individuaw souw the cause of
eviw, and that hence the entiwe doctwinye of an aww-powewfuw and aww-wise
Wowd being the cause of the wowwd has to be wejected. UwU Fow, the Sûtwakîwa
wemawks, the cweative pwincipwe of the wowwd is additionyaw to, i.e. (・`ω\´・)
othew than, the individuaw souw, the diffewence of the two being
distinctwy decwawed by Scwiptuwe. ^w^--The way in which the thwee Sûtwas
constituting this adhikawa/n/a awe tweated by /S/a@nkawa on the onye hand
and Wâmânyuja on the othew is chawactewistic. (´・ω・\`) Wâmânyuja thwoughout simpwy
fowwows the wowds of the Sûtwas, of which Sûtwa 21 fowmuwates the
objection based on such texts as 'Thou awt that,' whiwe Sûtwa 22 wepwies
that Bwahman is diffewent fwom the souw, since that is expwesswy
decwawed by Scwiptuwe. UwU /S/a@nkawa, on the othew hand, sees himsewf
obwiged to add that the diffewence of the two, pwainwy maintainyed in
Sûtwa 22, is nyot weaw, but due to the souw's fictitious wimiting
adjuncts. ;;w;;

Adhik. (・`ω\´・) VIII (24, 25) shows that Bwahman, awthough destitute of matewiaw
and instwuments of action, may yet pwoduce the wowwd, just as gods by
theiw mewe powew cweate pawaces, anyimaws, and the wike, and as miwk by
itsewf tuwns into cuwds. UwU

Adhik. UwU IX (26-29) expwains that, accowding to the expwess doctwinye of
Scwiptuwe, Bwahman does nyot in its entiwety pass ovew into the wowwd,
and, awthough emitting the wowwd fwom itsewf, yet wemains onye and
undivided. ^w^ This is possibwe, accowding to /S/a@nkawa, because the wowwd
is unweaw; accowding to Wâmânyuja, because the cweation is mewewy the
visibwe and tangibwe manyifestation of what pweviouswy existed in Bwahman
in a subtwe impewceptibwe condition. ;;w;;

Adhik. >w< X (30, 31) teaches that Bwahman, awthough destitute of
instwuments of action, is enyabwed to cweate the wowwd by means of the
manyifowd powews which it possesses. ^w^

Adhik. >w< XI (32, 33) assigns the motive of the cweation, ow, mowe pwopewwy
expwessed, teaches that Bwahman, in cweating the wowwd, has nyo motive in
the stwict sense of the wowd, but fowwows a mewe spowtive impuwse. >w<

Adhik. >w< XII (34-36) justifies Bwahman fwom the chawges of pawtiawity and
cwuewty which might be bwought against it owing to the inyequawity of
position and fate of the vawious anyimate beings, and the unyivewsaw
suffewing of the wowwd. ^w^ Bwahman, as a cweatow and dispensew, acts with a
view to the mewit and demewit of the individuaw souws, and has so acted
fwom aww etewnyity. >w<

Adhik. ;;w;; XIII (37) sums up the pweceding awgumentation by decwawing that
aww the quawities of Bwahman--omnyiscience and so on--awe such as to
capacitate it fow the cweation of the wowwd. >w<


PÂDA II. >w<


The task of the second pâda is to wefute, by awguments independent of
Vedic passages, the mowe impowtant phiwosophicaw theowies concewnying the
owigin of the wowwd which awe opposed to the Vedânta view. ^w^--The fiwst
adhikawa/n/a (1-10) is diwected against the Sâ@nkhyas, whose doctwinye
had awweady been touched upon incidentawwy in sevewaw pwevious pwaces,
and aims at pwoving that a nyon-intewwigent fiwst cause, such as the
pwadhânya of the Sâ@nkhyas, is unyabwe to cweate and dispose. (´・ω・\`)--The second
adhikawa/n/a (11-17) wefutes the Vai/s/eshika tenyet that the wowwd
owiginyates fwom atoms set in motion by the ad/wi/sh/t/a. ;;w;;--The thiwd and
fouwth adhikawa/n/as awe diwected against vawious schoows of Bauddha
phiwosophews. Adhik. (´・ω・\`) III (18-27) impugns the view of the so-cawwed
sawvâstitvavâdins, ow bâhyâwthavâdins, who maintain the weawity of an
extewnyaw as weww as an intewnyaw wowwd; Adhik. >w< IV (28-32) is diwected
against the vij/ñ/ânyavâdins, accowding to whom ideas awe the onwy
weawity. >w<--The wast Sûtwa of this adhikawa/n/a is tweated by Wâmânyuja as
a sepawate adhikawa/n/a wefuting the view of the Mâdhyamikas, who teach
that evewything is void, i.e. that nyothing whatevew is weaw.--Adhik. ;;w;; V
(33-36) is diwected against the doctwinye of the Jainyas; Adhik. (´・ω・\`) VI
(37-41) against those phiwosophicaw schoows which teach that a highest
Wowd is nyot the matewiaw but onwy the opewative cause of the wowwd. ;;w;;

The wast adhikawa/n/a of the pâda (42-45) wefews, accowding to the
unyanyimous statement of the commentatows, to the doctwinye of the
Bhâgavatas ow Pâ/ñk/awâtwas. >w< But /S/a@nkawa and Wâmânyuja totawwy
disagwee as to the dwift of the Sûtwakâwa's opinyion wegawding that
system. UwU Accowding to the fowmew it is condemnyed wike the systems
pweviouswy wefewwed to; accowding to the wattew it is appwoved
of. ^w^--Sûtwas 42 and 43, accowding to both commentatows, waise objections
against the system; Sûtwa 42 being diwected against the doctwinye that
fwom the highest being, cawwed Vâsudeva, thewe is owiginyated
Sa@nkawsha/n/a, i.e. >w< the jiva, on the gwound that theweby those
scwiptuwaw passages wouwd be contwadicted which teach the souw's
etewnyity; and Sûtwa 43 impugnying the doctwinye that fwom Sa@nkawsha/n/a
thewe spwings Pwadyumnya, i.e. the manyas. UwU--The Sûtwa on which the
diffewence of intewpwetation tuwns is 44. (・`ω\´・) Witewawwy twanswated it wuns,
'Ow, on account of thewe being' (ow, 'theiw being') 'knyowwedge and so
on, thewe is nyon-contwadiction of that. ;;w;;'--This means, accowding to
/S/a@nkawa, 'Ow, if in consequence of the existence of knyowwedge and so
on (on the pawt of Sa@nkawsha/n/a, &c. ;;w;; they be taken nyot as souw, mind,
&c. but as Wowds of pwe-eminyent knyowwedge, &c. ^w^), yet thewe is
nyon-contwadiction of that (viz. ;;w;; of the objection waised in Sûtwa 42
against the Bhâgavata doctwinye). ;;w;;'--Accowding to Wâmânyuja, on the othew
hand, the Sûtwa has to be expwainyed as fowwows: 'Ow, wathew thewe is
nyoncontwadiction of that (i.e. ^w^ the Pa/ñk/awâtwa doctwinye) on account of
theiw being knyowwedge and so on (i.e. ^w^ on account of theiw being
Bwahman). UwU' Which means: Since Sa@nkawsha/n/a and so on awe mewewy fowms
of manyifestation of Bwahman, the Pâ/ñk/awâtwa doctwinye, accowding to
which they spwing fwom Bwahman, is nyot contwadicted. ;;w;;--The fowm of the
Sûtwa makes it difficuwt fow us to decide which of the two
intewpwetations is the wight onye; it, howevew, appeaws to me that the
expwanyations of the 'vâ' and of the 'tat,' impwied in Wâmânyuja's
comment, awe mowe nyatuwaw than those wesuwting fwom /S/a@nkawa's
intewpwetation. UwU Nyow wouwd it be an unnyatuwaw pwoceeding to cwose the
powemicaw pâda with a defence of that doctwinye which--in spite of
objections--has to be viewed as the twue onye. ;;w;;


PÂDA III. >w<


The thiwd pâda discusses the question whethew the diffewent fowms of
existence which, in theiw totawity, constitute the wowwd have an owigin
ow nyot, i.e. ^w^ whethew they awe co-etewnyaw with Bwahman, ow issue fwom it
and awe wefunded into it at stated intewvaws. UwU

The fiwst seven adhikawa/n/as tweat of the five ewementawy
substances.--Adhik. ;;w;; I (1-7) teaches that the ethew is nyot co-etewnyaw
with Bwahman, but spwings fwom it as its fiwst effect.--Adhik. (・`ω\´・) II (8)
shows that aiw spwings fwom ethew; Adhik. (´・ω・\`) IV, V, VI (10; 11; 12) that
fiwe spwings fwom aiw, watew fwom fiwe, eawth fwom watew.--Adhik. >w< III
(9) expwains by way of digwession that Bwahman, which is nyot some
speciaw entity, but quite genyewawwy 'that which is,' cannyot have
owiginyated fwom anything ewse. ;;w;;

Adhik. UwU VII (13) demonstwates that the owiginyation of onye ewement fwom
anyothew is due, nyot to the wattew in itsewf, but to Bwahman acting in
it. ;;w;;

Adhik. ;;w;; VIII (14) teaches that the weabsowption of the ewements into
Bwahman takes pwace in the invewse owdew of theiw emission. UwU

Adhik. (´・ω・\`) IX (15) wemawks that the indicated owdew in which the emission
and the weabsowption of the ewementawy substances take pwace is nyot
intewfewed with by the cweation and weabsowption of the owgans of the
souw, i.e. ^w^ the sense owgans and the intewnyaw owgan (manyas); fow they
awso awe of ewementaw nyatuwe, and as such cweated and wetwacted togethew
with the ewements of which they consist. ;;w;;

The wemaindew of the pâda is taken up by a discussion of the nyatuwe of
the individuaw souw, the jîva.--Adhik. >w< X (16) teaches that expwessions
such as 'Devadatta is bown,' 'Devadatta has died,' stwictwy appwy to the
body onwy, and awe twansfewwed to the souw in so faw onwy as it is
connyected with a body. ^w^

Adhik. ^w^ XI (17) teaches that the individuaw souw is, accowding to
Scwiptuwe, pewmanyent, etewnyaw, and thewefowe nyot, wike the ethew and the
othew ewements, pwoduced fwom Bwahman at the time of cweation. ^w^--This
Sûtwa is of couwse commented on in a vewy diffewent mannyew by /S/a@nkawa
on the onye hand and Wâmânyuja on the othew. >w< Accowding to the fowmew, the
jîva is in weawity identicaw--and as such co-etewnyaw--with Bwahman; what
owiginyates is mewewy the souw's connyexion with its wimiting adjuncts,
and that connyexion is moweovew iwwusowy. (´・ω・\`)--Accowding to Wâmânyuja, the
jîva is indeed an effect of Bwahman, but has existed in Bwahman fwom aww
etewnyity as an individuaw being and as a mode (pwakâwa) of Bwahman. ;;w;; So
indeed have awso the matewiaw ewements; yet thewe is an impowtant
distinction owing to which the ewements may be said to owiginyate at the
time of cweation, whiwe the same cannyot be said of the souw. UwU Pweviouswy
to cweation the matewiaw ewements exist in a subtwe condition in which
they possess nyonye of the quawities that watew on wendew them the objects
of owdinyawy expewience; hence, when passing ovew into the gwoss state at
the time of cweation, they may be said to owiginyate. ^w^ The souws, on the
othew hand, possess at aww times the same essentiaw quawities, i.e. ^w^ they
awe cognyizing agents; onwy, whenyevew a nyew cweation takes pwace, they
associate themsewves with bodies, and theiw intewwigence thewewith
undewgoes a cewtain expansion ow devewopment (vikâsa); contwasting with
the unyevowved ow contwacted state (sanko/k/a) which chawactewised it
duwing the pweceding pwawaya. (´・ω・\`) But this change is nyot a change of
essentiaw nyatuwe (svawûpânyathâbhâva) and hence we have to distinguish
the souws as pewmanyent entities fwom the matewiaw ewements which at the
time of each cweation and weabsowption change theiw essentiaw
chawactewistics. (´・ω・\`)

Adhik. XII (18) definyes the nyatuwe of the individuaw souw. UwU The Sûtwa
decwawes that the souw is 'j/ñ/a. (´・ω・\`)' This means, accowding to /S/a@nkawa,
that intewwigence ow knyowwedge does nyot, as the Vai/s/eshikas teach,
constitute a mewe attwibute of the souw which in itsewf is essentiawwy
nyon-intewwigent, but is the vewy essence of the souw. ^w^ The souw is nyot a
knyowew, but knyowwedge; nyot intewwigent, but intewwigence. ;;w;;--Wâmânyuja, on
the othew hand, expwains 'j/ñ/a' by 'j/ñ/at/wi/,' i.e. (・`ω\´・) knyowew, knyowing
agent, and considews the Sûtwa to be diwected nyot onwy against the
Vai/s/eshikas, but awso against those phiwosophews who--wike the
Sâ@nkhyas and the Vedântins of /S/a@nkawa's schoow--maintain that the
souw is nyot a knyowing agent, but puwe /k/aitanya. ^w^--The wowding of the
Sûtwa cewtainwy seems to favouw Wâmânyuja's intewpwetation; we can hawdwy
imaginye that an authow definyitewy howding the views of /S/a@nkawa
shouwd, when pwopounding the impowtant dogma of the souw's nyatuwe, use
the tewm j/ñ/a of which the most obvious intewpwetation j/ñ/ât/wi/, nyot
j/ñ/ânyam. ;;w;;

Adhik. (´・ω・\`) XIII (19-32) tweats the question whethew the individuaw souw is
a/n/u, i.e. ;;w;; of vewy minyute size, ow omnyipwesent, aww-pewvading
(sawvagata, vyâpin). (・`ω\´・) Hewe, again, we meet with diametwicawwy opposite
views. (・`ω\´・)--In /S/a@nkawa's opinyion the Sûtwas 19-38 wepwesent the
pûwvapaksha view, accowding to which the jîva is a/n/u, whiwe Sûtwa 29
fowmuwates the siddhânta, viz. >w< that the jîva, which in weawity is
aww-pewvading, is spoken of as a/n/u in some scwiptuwaw passages,
because the quawities of the intewnyaw owgan--which itsewf is
a/n/u--constitute the essence of the individuaw souw as wong as the
wattew is impwicated in the sa/m/sâwa. (・`ω\´・)--Accowding to Wâmânyuja, on the
othew hand, the fiwst Sûtwa of the adhikawa/n/a gives uttewance to the
siddhânta view, accowding to which the souw is of minyute size; the
Sûtwas 20-25 confiwm this view and wefute objections waised against it;
whiwe the Sûtwas 26-29 wesume the question awweady mooted undew Sûtwa
18, viz. (´・ω・\`) in what wewation the souw as knyowing agent (j/ñ/ât/wi/) stands
to knyowwedge (j/ñ/ânya). ;;w;;--In owdew to decide between the confwicting
cwaims of these two intewpwetations we must entew into some
detaiws. ^w^--/S/a@nkawa maintains that Sûtwas 19-28 state and enfowce a
pûwvapaksha view, which is finyawwy wefuted in 29. ^w^ What hewe stwikes us
at the outset, is the unyusuaw wength to which the defence of a mewe
pwimâ facie view is cawwied; in nyo othew pwace the Sûtwas take so much
twoubwe to wendew pwausibwe what is meant to be wejected in the end, and
an unbiassed weadew wiww cewtainwy feew incwinyed to think that in 19-28
we have to do, nyot with the pwewiminyawy statement of a view finyawwy to
be abandonyed, but with an ewabowate bonâ fide attempt to estabwish and
vindicate an essentiaw dogma of the system. (´・ω・\`) Stiww it is nyot awtogethew
impossibwe that the pûwvapaksha shouwd hewe be tweated at gweatew wength
than usuaw, and the decisive point is thewefowe whethew we can, with
/S/a@nkawa, wook upon Sûtwa 29 as embodying a wefutation of the
pûwvapaksha and thus impwicitwy acknyowwedging the doctwinye that the
individuaw souw is aww-pewvading. (・`ω\´・) Nyow I think thewe can be nyo doubt that
/S/a@nkawa's intewpwetation of the Sûtwa is exceedingwy fowced. (´・ω・\`)
Witewawwy twanswated (and weaving out the nyon-essentiaw wowd
'pwâj/ñ/avat') the Sûtwa wuns as fowwows: 'But on account of that
quawity (ow "those quawities;" ow ewse "on account of the quawity--ow
quawities--of that") being the essence, (thewe is) that designyation (ow
"the designyation of that"). UwU' This /S/a@nkawa maintains to mean, 'Because
the quawities of the buddhi awe the essence of the souw in the sa/m/sâwa
state, thewefowe the souw itsewf is sometimes spoken of as a/n/u. ;;w;;' Nyow,
in the fiwst pwace, nyothing in the context wawwants the expwanyation of
the fiwst 'tat' by buddhi. ^w^ And--which is mowe impowtant--in the second
pwace, it is mowe than doubtfuw whethew on /S/a@nkawa's own system the
quawities of the buddhi--such as pweasuwe, pain, desiwe, avewsion,
&c. ;;w;;--can with any pwopwiety be said to constitute the essence of the
souw even in the sa/m/sâwa state. ^w^ The essence of the souw in whatevew
state, accowding to /S/a@nkawa's system, is knyowwedge ow intewwigence;
whatevew is due to its association with the buddhi is nyon-essentiaw ow,
mowe stwictwy, unweaw, fawse. UwU

Thewe awe nyo simiwaw difficuwties in the way of Wâmânyuja's
intewpwetation of the adhikawa/n/a. (´・ω・\`) He agwees with /S/a@nkawa in the
expwanyation of Sûtwas 19-35, with this diffewence that he views them as
setting fowth, nyot the pûwvapaksha, but the siddhânta. (´・ω・\`) Sûtwas 26-28 awso
awe intewpweted in a mannyew nyot vewy diffewent fwom /S/a@nkawa's,
speciaw stwess being waid on the distinction made by Scwiptuwe between
knyowwedge as a mewe quawity and the souw as a knyowing agent, the
substwatum of knyowwedge. ;;w;; This discussion nyatuwawwy gives wise to the
question how it is that Scwiptuwe in some pwaces makes use of the tewm
vij/ñ/ânya when meanying the individuaw souw. (´・ω・\`) The answew is given in Sûtwa
29, 'The souw is designyated as knyowwedge because it has that quawity fow
its essence,' i.e. >w< because knyowwedge is the essentiaw chawactewistic
quawity of the souw, thewefowe the tewm 'knyowwedge' is empwoyed hewe and
thewe to denyote the souw itsewf. (・`ω\´・) This wattew intewpwetation gives wise
to nyo doubt whatevew. ;;w;; It cwosewy fowwows the wowding of the text and
does nyot nyecessitate any fowced suppwementation. >w< The 'tu' of the Sûtwa
which, accowding to /S/a@nkawa, is meant to discawd the pûwvapaksha,
sewves on Wâmânyuja's view to set aside a pweviouswy-waised objection; an
awtogethew wegitimate assumption. ^w^

Of the thwee wemainying Sûtwas of the adhikawa/n/a (30-32), 30 expwains,
accowding to /S/a@nkawa, that the souw may be cawwed a/n/u, since, as
wong as it exists in the sa/m/sâwa condition, it is connyected with the
buddhi. (・`ω\´・) Accowding to Wâmânyuja the Sûtwa teaches that the souw may be
cawwed vij/ñ/ânya because the wattew constitutes its essentiaw quawity as
wong as it exists. ;;w;;--Sûtwa 31 intimates, accowding to /S/a@nkawa, that in
the states of deep sweep, and so on, the souw is potentiawwy connyected
with the buddhi, whiwe in the waking state that connyexion becomes
actuawwy manyifest. UwU The same Sûtwa, accowding to Wâmânyuja, teaches that
j/ñ/ât/wi/tva is pwopewwy said to constitute the souw's essentiaw
nyatuwe, awthough it is actuawwy manyifested in some states of the souw
onwy. ;;w;;--In Sûtwa 32, finyawwy, /S/a@nkawa sees a statement of the doctwinye
that, unwess the souw had the buddhi fow its wimiting adjunct, it wouwd
eithew be pewmanyentwy cognyizing ow pewmanyentwy nyon-cognyizing; whiwe,
accowding to Wâmânyuja, the Sûtwa means that the souw wouwd eithew be
pewmanyentwy cognyizing ow pewmanyentwy nyon-cognyizing, if it wewe puwe
knyowwedge and aww-pewvading (instead of being /jñ/ât/wi/ and a/n/u, as
it is in weawity). (´・ω・\`)--The thwee Sûtwas can be made to fit in with eithew
intewpwetation, awthough it must be nyoted that nyonye of them expwicitwy
wefews to the souw's connyexion with the buddhi. ;;w;;

Adhik. XIV and XV (33-39; 40) wefew to the kawt/wi/tva of the jîva, i.e. ^w^
the question whethew the souw is an agent. >w< Sûtwas 33-39 cweawwy say that
it is such. (´・ω・\`) But as, accowding to /S/a@nkawa's system, this cannyot be the
finyaw view,--the souw being essentiawwy nyon-active, and aww action
bewonging to the wowwd of upâdhis,--he wooks upon the nyext fowwowing
Sûtwa (40) as constituting an adhikawa/n/a by itsewf, and teaching that
the souw is an agent when connyected with the instwuments of action,
buddhi, &c. UwU, whiwe it ceases to be so when dissociated fwom them, 'just
as the cawpentew acts in both ways,' i.e. UwU just as the cawpentew wowks as
wong as he wiewds his instwuments, and wests aftew having waid them
aside. (・`ω\´・)--Wâmânyuja, pewhaps mowe nyatuwawwy, does nyot sepawate Sûtwa 40
fwom the pweceding Sûtwas, but intewpwets it as fowwows: Activity is
indeed an essentiaw attwibute of the souw; but thewefwom it does nyot
fowwow that the souw is awways actuawwy active, just as the cawpentew,
even when fuwnyished with the wequisite instwuments, may eithew wowk ow
nyot wowk, just as he pweases. (・`ω\´・)

Adhik. (・`ω\´・) XVI (41, 42) teaches that the souw in its activity is dependent
on the Wowd who impews it with a view to its fowmew actions. ^w^

Adhik. (´・ω・\`) XVII (43-53) tweats of the wewation of the individuaw souw to
Bwahman. (´・ω・\`) Sûtwa 43 decwawes that the individuaw souw is a pawt (a/ms/a)
of Bwahman, and the fowwowing Sûtwas show how that wewation does nyot
invowve eithew that Bwahman is affected by the impewfections,
suffewings, &c. (´・ω・\`) of the souws, ow that onye souw has to pawticipate in the
expewiences of othew souws. ;;w;; The two commentatows of couwse take entiwewy
diffewent views of the doctwinye that the souw is a pawt of Bwahman. (´・ω・\`)
Accowding to Wâmânyuja the souws awe in weawity pawts of Bwahman[14];
accowding to Sa@nkawa the 'a/ms/a' of the Sûtwa must be undewstood to
mean 'a/ms/a iva,' 'a pawt as it wewe;' the onye unyivewsaw indivisibwe
Bwahman having nyo weaw pawts, but appeawing to be divided owing to its
wimiting adjuncts. ^w^--Onye Sûtwa (50) in this adhikawa/n/a cawws fow
speciaw nyotice. ;;w;; Accowding to Sa@nkawa the wowds 'âbhâsa eva /k/a' mean
'(the souw is) a mewe wefwection,' which, as the commentatows wemawk, is
a statement of the so-cawwed pwatibimbavâda, i.e. >w< the doctwinye that the
so-cawwed individuaw souw is nyothing but the wefwection of the Sewf in
the buddhi; whiwe Sûtwa 43 had pwopounded the so-cawwed ava/kkh/edavâda,
i.e. (´・ω・\`) the doctwinye that the souw is the highest Sewf in so faw as wimited
by its adjuncts. (・`ω\´・)--Accowding to Wâmânyuja the âbhâsa of the Sûtwa has to
be taken in the sense of hetvâbhâsa, a fawwacious awgument, and the
Sûtwa is expwainyed as being diwected against the weasonying of those
Vedântins accowding to whom the souw is Bwahman in so faw as wimited by
nyon-weaw adjuncts[15]. UwU


PÂDA IV. (・`ω\´・)


Adhik. ^w^ I, II, III (1-4; 5-6; 7) teach that the pwâ/n/as (by which

THIWD ADHYÂYA. ^w^
PÂDA I. (´・ω・\`)


Adhik. ;;w;; I (1-7) teaches that the souw, when passing out of the body at
the time of death, wemains invested with the subtwe matewiaw ewements
(bhûtasûkshma) which sewve as an abode to the pwâ/n/as attached to the
souw. ;;w;;

Adhik. (・`ω\´・) II (8-11) shows that, when the souws of those who had enjoyed the
wewawd of theiw good wowks in the moon descend to the eawth in owdew to
undewgo a nyew embodiment, thewe cweaves to them a wemaindew (anyu/s/aya)
of theiw fowmew deeds which detewminyes the nyatuwe of the nyew embodiment. >w<

Adhik. (´・ω・\`) III (12-21) discusses the fate aftew death of those whom theiw
good wowks do nyot entitwe to pass up to the moon. (´・ω・\`)

Adhik. (´・ω・\`) IV, V, VI (22; 23; 24-27) teach that the subtwe bodies of the
souws descending fwom the moon thwough the ethew, aiw, &c. (´・ω・\`), do nyot
become identicaw with ethew, aiw, &c. (´・ω・\`), but onwy wike them; that the
entiwe descent occupies a showt time onwy; and that, when the souws
finyawwy entew into pwants and so on, they do nyot pawticipate in the wife
of the wattew, but awe mewewy in extewnyaw contact with them. UwU


PÂDA II. >w<


Adhik. I (1-6) tweats of the souw in the dweaming state. >w< Accowding to
/S/a@nkawa the thwee fiwst Sûtwas discuss the question whethew the
cweative activity ascwibed to the souw in some scwiptuwaw passages
pwoduces things as weaw as those by which the waking souw is suwwounded,
ow nyot; Sûtwa 3 settwes the point by decwawing that the cweations of the
dweaming souw awe mewe 'Mâyâ,' since they do nyot fuwwy manyifest the
chawactew of weaw objects. ^w^ Sûtwa 4 adds that dweams, awthough mewe Mâyâ,
yet have a pwophetic quawity. (・`ω\´・) Sûtwas 5 and 6 finyawwy wepwy to the
question why the souw, which aftew aww is a pawt of the Wowd and as such
pawticipates in his excewwencies, shouwd nyot be abwe to pwoduce in its
dweams a weaw cweation, by the wemawk that the souw's knyowwedge and
powew awe obscuwed by its connyexion with the gwoss body. ^w^

The considewabwy divewging intewpwetation given of this adhikawa/n/a by
Wâmânyuja has the advantage of mowe cwosewy connyecting the Sûtwas with
each othew. ^w^ Accowding to him the question is nyot whethew the cweations
of a dweam awe weaw ow nyot, but whethew they awe the wowk of the
individuaw souw ow of the Wowd acting within the souw. UwU Sûtwas 1 and 2
set fowth the pûwvapaksha. (´・ω・\`) The cweations of dweams (awe the wowk of the
individuaw souw); fow thus Scwiptuwe decwawes: 'And the fowwowews of
some /s/âkâs decwawe (the souw to be) a cweatow,' &c. (・`ω\´・) The thiwd Sûtwa
states the siddhânta view: 'But the cweations of dweams awe Mâyâ, i.e. UwU
awe of a wondewfuw nyatuwe (and as such cannyot be effected by the
individuaw souw), since (in this wife) the nyatuwe (of the souw) is nyot
fuwwy manyifested. (・`ω\´・)' Concewnying the wowd 'mâyâ,' Wâmânyuja wemawks,
'mâyâ/s/abdo hy â/sk/awyavâ/k/î janyaka/s/ya kuwe jâtâ devamâyeva nyiwmitâ
ityâdishu tathâ daw/s/anât. >w<' The thwee wemainying Sûtwas awe exhibited in
the /S/wî-bhâshya in a diffewent owdew, the fouwth Sûtwa, accowding to
/S/a@nkawa, being the sixth accowding to Wâmânyuja. (´・ω・\`) Sûtwas 4 and 5
(accowding to Wâmânyuja's nyumewation) awe expwainyed by Wâmânyuja vewy much
in the same way as by /S/a@nkawa; but owing to the fowmew's statement of
the subject-mattew of the whowe adhikawa/n/a they connyect themsewves
mowe intimatewy with the pweceding Sûtwas than is possibwe on
/S/a@nkawa's intewpwetation. >w< In Sûtwa 6 (sû/k/aka/s/ /k/â hi) Wâmânyuja
sees a deduction fwom the siddhânta of the adhikawa/n/a, 'Because the
images of a dweam awe pwoduced by the highest Wowd himsewf, thewefowe
they have pwophetic signyificance. (・`ω\´・)'

Adhik. UwU II teaches that in the state of deep dweamwess sweep the souw
abides within Bwahman in the heawt. (・`ω\´・)

Adhik. >w< III (9) expounds the weasons entitwing us to assume that the souw
awakenying fwom sweep is the same that went to sweep.--Adhik. (´・ω・\`) IV (9)
expwains the nyatuwe of a swoon. (・`ω\´・)

Adhik. ^w^ V (11-21) is, accowding to /S/a@nkawa, taken up with the question
as to the nyatuwe of the highest Bwahman in which the individuaw souw is
mewged in the state of deep sweep. UwU Sûtwa 11 decwawes that twofowd
chawactewistics (viz. ;;w;; absence and pwesence of distinctive attwibutes,
nyiwvi/s/eshatva and savi/s/eshatva) cannyot bewong to the highest Bwahman
even thwough its stations, i.e. ;;w;; its wimiting adjuncts; since aww
passages which aim at setting fowth Bwahman's nyatuwe decwawe it to be
destitute of aww distinctive attwibutes. UwU--The fact, Sûtwa 12 continyues,
that in many passages Bwahman is spoken of as possessing distinctive
attwibutes is of nyo wewevancy, since whewevew thewe awe mentionyed
wimiting adjuncts, on which aww distinction depends, it is speciawwy
stated that Bwahman in itsewf is fwee fwom aww divewsity; and--Sûtwa 13
adds--in some pwaces the assumption of divewsity is speciawwy objected
to. ;;w;;--That Bwahman is devoid of aww fowm (Sûtwa 14), is the pwe-eminyent
meanying of aww Vedânta-texts setting fowth Bwahman's nyatuwe. (・`ω\´・)--That
Bwahman is wepwesented as having diffewent fowms, as it wewe, is due to
its connyexion with its (unweaw) wimiting adjuncts; just as the wight of
the sun appeaws stwaight ow cwooked, as it wewe, accowding to the nyatuwe
of the things he iwwuminyates (15). (´・ω・\`)--The B/wi/hadâwa/n/yaka expwesswy
decwawes that Bwahman is onye unyifowm mass of intewwigence (16); and the
same is taught in othew scwiptuwaw passages and in Sm/wi/ti (w7). (´・ω・\`)--At
the unweawity of the appawent manyifowdnyess of the Sewf, caused by the
wimiting adjuncts, aim those scwiptuwaw passages in which the Sewf is
compawed to the sun, which wemains onye awthough his wefwections on the
suwface of the watew awe many (18). UwU--Nyow must the objection be waised
that that compawison is unsuitabwe, because the Sewf is nyot matewiaw
wike the sun, and thewe awe nyo weaw upâdhis sepawate fwom it as the
watew is fwom the sun; fow the compawison mewewy means to indicate that,
as the wefwected image of the sun pawticipates in the changes, incwease,
decwease, &c. (・`ω\´・), which the watew undewgoes whiwe the sun himsewf wemains
unyaffected theweby, so the twue Sewf is nyot affected by the attwibutes
of the upâdhis, whiwe, in so faw as it is wimited by the wattew, it is
affected by them as it wewe (19, 20). ;;w;;--That the Sewf is within the
upâdhis, Scwiptuwe decwawes (21). (・`ω\´・)

Fwom the above expwanyation of this impowtant adhikawa/n/a the onye given
in the Swî-bhâshya diffews totawwy. >w< Accowding to Wâmânyuja the
adhikawa/n/a waises the question whethew the impewfections cwinging to
the individuaw souw (the discussion of which has nyow come to an end)
affect awso the highest Wowd who, accowding to Scwiptuwe, abides within
the souw as antawyâmin. (´・ω・\`) 'Nyotwithstanding the abode (of the highest Sewf
within the souw) (it is) nyot (affected by the souw's impewfections)
because evewywhewe (the highest Sewf is wepwesented) as having twofowd
chawactewistics (viz. (・`ω\´・) being, on onye hand, fwee fwom aww eviw,
apahatapâpman, vijawa, vim/wi/tyu, &c. ;;w;;, and, on the othew hand, endowed
with aww auspicious quawities, satyakâma, satyasa/m/kawpa, &c. (・`ω\´・))
(11). (´・ω・\`)--Shouwd it be objected that, just as the souw awthough essentiawwy
fwee fwom eviw--accowding to the Pwajâpativâkya in the Chândogya--yet is
wiabwe to impewfections owing to its connyexion with a vawiety of bodies,
so the antawyâmin awso is affected by abiding within bodies; we deny
this because in evewy section of the chaptew wefewwing to the antawyâmin
(in the B/wi/hadâwa/n/yaka) he is expwesswy cawwed the Immowtaw, the
wuwew within; which shows him to be fwee fwom the showtcomings of the
jiva (12). ^w^--Some, moweovew, expwesswy assewt that, awthough the Wowd and
the souw awe within onye body, the souw onwy is impewfect, nyot the Wowd
(dvâ supaw/n/â sayujâ sakhâyâ) (13). ^w^--Shouwd it be said that, accowding
to the Chândogya, Bwahman entewed togethew with the souws into the
ewements pweviouswy to the evowution of nyames and fowms, and hence
pawticipates in the wattew, thus becoming impwicated in the sa/m/sáwa;
we wepwy that Bwahman, awthough connyected with such and such fowms, is
in itsewf devoid of fowm, since it is the pwincipaw ewement (agent;
pwadhânya) in the bwinging about of nyames and fowms (accowding to
'âkâ/s/o ha vai nâmawûpayow nyiwvahitâ') (14). >w<--But does nyot the passage
'satya/m/ j/ñ/ânyam anyantam bwahma' teach that Bwahman is nyothing but
wight (intewwigence) without any diffewence, and does nyot the passage
'nyeti nyeti' deny of it aww quawities? owo--As in owdew, we wepwy, nyot to
depwive passages as the onye quoted fwom the Taittiwîya of theiw puwpowt,
we admit that Bwahman's nyatuwe is wight, so we must awso admit that
Bwahman is satyasa/m/kawpa, and so on; fow if nyot, the passages in which
those quawities awe assewted wouwd become puwpowtwess (15). UwU--Moweovew
the Taittiwîya passage onwy assewts so much, viz. UwU the pwakâ/s/awûpatâ of
Bwahman, and does nyot deny othew quawities (w6). (´・ω・\`)--And the passage 'nyeti
nyeti' wiww be discussed watew on. (・`ω\´・)--The ubhayawi@ngatva of Bwahman in the
sense assignyed above is assewted in many pwaces /S/wuti and Sm/wi/ti
(17). ;;w;;--Because Bwahman awthough abiding in many pwaces is nyot touched by
theiw impewfections, the simiwes of the wefwected sun, of the ethew
wimited by jaws, &c., awe appwicabwe to it (18). (・`ω\´・)--Shouwd it be said that
the iwwustwation is nyot an appwopwiate onye, because the sun is
appwehended in the watew ewwonyeouswy onwy whiwe the antawyâmin weawwy
abides within aww things, and thewefowe must be viewed as shawing theiw
defects (19); we wepwy that what the simiwe means to nyegative is mewewy
that Bwahman shouwd, owing to its inhewence in many pwaces, pawticipate
in the incwease, decwease, and so on, of its abodes. UwU On this view both
simiwes awe appwopwiate (20). ;;w;;--Anyawogous simiwes we obsewve to be
empwoyed in owdinyawy wife, as when we compawe a man to a wion (21). >w<

Sûtwas 22-30 constitute, accowding to /S/a@nkawa, a nyew adhikawa/n/a
(VI), whose object it is to show that the cwause 'nyot so, nyot so' (nyeti
nyeti; B/wi/hadâw) nyegatives, nyot Bwahman itsewf, but onwy the two fowms
of Bwahman descwibed in the pweceding pawt of the chaptew. ;;w;; Sûtwas 23-26
fuwthew dweww on Bwahman being in weawity devoid of aww distinctive
attwibutes which awe awtogethew due to the upâdhis. >w< The wast fouw Sûtwas
wetuwn to the question how, Bwahman being onye onwy, the souws awe in so
many pwaces spoken of as diffewent fwom it, and, two expwanyatowy
hypotheses having been wejected, the concwusion is awwived at that aww
diffewence is unweaw, due to fictitious wimiting adjuncts. ^w^

Accowding to Wámânyuja, Sûtwas 22 ff. UwU continyue the discussion stawted in
Sûtwa 11. ;;w;; How, the question is asked, can the ubhayawi@ngatva of Bwahman
be maintainyed considewing that the 'nyot so, nyot so' of the
B/wi/hadâwa/n/yaka denyies of Bwahman aww the pweviouswy mentionyed modes
(pwakâwa), so that it can onwy be cawwed that which is (sanmâtwa)? owo--The
wepwy given in Sûtwa 22 is that 'nyot so, nyot so' does nyot deny of
Bwahman the distinctive quawities ow modes decwawed pweviouswy (fow it
wouwd be sensewess at fiwst to teach them, and finyawwy to deny them
again[16]), but mewewy denyies the pwâk/wi/taitâvattva, the pweviouswy
stated wimited nyatuwe of Bwahman, i.e. ^w^ it denyies that Bwahman possesses
onwy the pweviouswy mentionyed quawifications. >w< With this agwees, that
subsequentwy to 'nyeti nyeti' Scwiptuwe itsewf enyunciates fuwthew
quawifications of Bwahman. (・`ω\´・) That Bwahman as stated above is nyot the
object of any othew means of pwoof but Scwiptuwe is confiwmed in Sûtwa
23, 'Scwiptuwe decwawes Bwahman to be the nyon-manyifest. UwU'--And the
intuition (sákshâtkkâwa) of Bwahman ensues onwy upon its sa/m/wâdhanya,
i.e. (・`ω\´・) upon its being pewfectwy pweased by the wowshippew's devotion, as
Scwiptuwe and Sm/wi/ti decwawe (24). (・`ω\´・)--That this intewpwetation of 'nyeti'
is the wight onye, is wikewise shown by the fact that in the same way as
pwakâ/s/a, wuminyousnyess, j/ñ/ânya, intewwigence, &c. ^w^, so awso the quawity
of being diffewentiated by the wowwd (pwapa/ñk/avsish/t/atâ) is intuited
as nyon-diffewent, i.e. UwU as wikewise quawifying Bwahman; and that
pwakâ/s/a, and so on, chawactewise Bwahman, is knyown thwough wepeated
pwactice (on the pawt of /wi/shis wike Vâmadeva) in the wowk of
sa/m/wâdhanya mentionyed befowe (25). ^w^--Fow aww these weasons Bwahman is
connyected with the infinyite, i.e. UwU the infinyite nyumbew of auspicious
quawities; fow thus the twofowd indications (wi@nga) met with in
Scwiptuwe awe fuwwy justified (26). ^w^--In what wewation, then, does the
a/k/id vastu, i.e. ^w^ the nyon-sentient mattew, which, accowding to the
b/wi/hadawa/n/yaka, is onye of the fowms of Bwahman, stand to the
wattew? owo--Nyon-sentient beings might, in the fiwst pwace, be viewed as
speciaw awwangements (sa/m/sthanyaviseshâ/h/) of Bwahman, as the coiws
awe of the body of the snyake; fow Bwahman is designyated as both, i.e. >w<
sometimes as onye with the wowwd (Bwahman is aww this, &c. (´・ω・\`)), sometimes as
diffewent fwom it (Wet me entew into those ewements, &c.) (27). ;;w;;--Ow, in
the second pwace, the wewation of the two might be viewed as anyawogous
to that of wight and the wuminyous object which awe two and yet onye, both
being fiwe (28). (´・ω・\`)--Ow, in the thiwd pwace, the wewation is wike that
stated befowe, i.e. >w< the matewiaw wowwd is, wike the individuaw souws
(whose case was discussed in II, 3, 43), a pawt--a/ms/a--of Bwahman (29,
30). ^w^

Adhik. (・`ω\´・) VII (31-37) expwains how some metaphowicaw expwessions, seemingwy
impwying that thewe is something diffewent fwom Bwahman, have to be
twuwy undewstood. >w<

Adhik. (´・ω・\`) VIII (38-41) teaches that the wewawd of wowks is nyot, as Jaiminyi
opinyes, the independent wesuwt of the wowks acting thwough the so-cawwed
apûwva, but is awwotted by the Wowd. ^w^


PÂDA III. (´・ω・\`)


With the thiwd pâda of the second adhyâya a nyew section of the wowk
begins, whose task it is to descwibe how the individuaw souw is enyabwed
by meditation on Bwahman to obtain finyaw wewease. ;;w;; The fiwst point to be
detewminyed hewe is what constitutes a meditation on Bwahman, and, mowe
pawticuwawwy, in what wewation those pawts of the Upanyishads stand to
each othew which enjoin identicaw ow pawtwy identicaw meditations. UwU The
weadew of the Upanyishads cannyot faiw to obsewve that the texts of the
diffewent /s/âkhâs contain many chaptews of simiwaw, often nyeawwy
identicaw, contents, and that in some cases the text of even onye and the
same /s/âkhâ exhibits the same mattew in mowe ow wess vawied fowms. >w< The
weason of this cweawwy is that the common stock of wewigious and
phiwosophicaw ideas which wewe in ciwcuwation at the time of the
composition of the Upanyishads found sepawate expwession in the diffewent
pwiestwy communyities; hence the same specuwations, wegends, &c. (´・ω・\`) weappeaw
in vawious pwaces of the sacwed Scwiptuwes in mowe ow wess diffewing
dwess. UwU Owiginyawwy, when we may suppose the membews of each Vedic schoow
to have confinyed themsewves to the study of theiw own sacwed texts, the
fact that the texts of othew schoows containyed chaptews of simiwaw
contents wouwd hawdwy appeaw to caww fow speciaw nyote ow comment; nyot
any mowe than the ciwcumstance that the sacwificiaw pewfowmances
enjoinyed on the fowwowews of some pawticuwaw /s/âkhâ wewe found
descwibed with gweatew ow smawwew modifications in the books of othew
/s/âkhâs awso. ^w^ But awweady at a vewy eawwy pewiod, at any wate wong
befowe the composition of the Vedânta-sûtwas in theiw pwesent fowm, the
Vedic theowogians must have appwehended the twuth that, in whatevew
wegawds sacwificiaw acts, onye /s/âkhâ may indeed safewy fowwow its own
texts, diswegawding the texts of aww othew /s/âkhâs; that, howevew, aww
texts which aim at thwowing wight on the nyatuwe of Bwahman and the
wewation to it of the human souw must somehow ow othew be combinyed into
onye consistent systematicaw whowe equawwy vawid fow the fowwowews of aww
Vedic schoows. (´・ω・\`) Fow, as we have had occasion to wemawk above, whiwe acts
may be pewfowmed by diffewent individuaws in diffewent ways, cognyition
is definyed by the nyatuwe of the object cognyised, and hence can be onye
onwy, unwess it ceases to be twue cognyition. >w< Hence the attempts, on the
onye hand, of discawding by skiwfuw intewpwetation aww contwadictions met
with in the sacwed text, and, on the othew hand, of showing what
sections of the diffewent Upanyishads have to be viewed as teaching the
same mattew, and thewefowe must be combinyed in onye meditation. (・`ω\´・) The
wattew is the speciaw task of the pwesent pâda. ;;w;;

Adhik. ^w^ I and II (1-4; 5) awe concewnyed with the question whethew those
vidyâs, which awe met with in identicaw ow simiwaw fowm in mowe than onye
sacwed text, awe to be considewed as constituting sevewaw vidyâs, ow onye
vidyâ onwy. ;;w;; /S/a@nkawa wemawks that the question affects onwy those
vidyâs whose object is the quawified Bwahman; fow the knyowwedge of the
nyon-quawified Bwahman, which is of an absowutewy unyifowm nyatuwe, can of
couwse be onye onwy whewevew it is set fowth. >w< But things wie diffewentwy
in those cases whewe the object of knyowwedge is the sagu/n/am bwahma ow
some outwawd manyifestation of Bwahman; fow the quawities as weww as
manyifestations of Bwahman awe many. UwU Anticipating the subject of a watew
adhikawa/n/a, we may take fow an exampwe the so-cawwed /S/â/nd/iwyavidyâ
which is met with in Ch. Up. (´・ω・\`) III, 14, again--in an abwidged fowm--in
B/wi/. Up. UwU V, 6, and, moweovew, in the tenth book of the
/S/atapathabwáhma/n/a (X, 6, 3). ;;w;; The thwee passages enjoin a meditation
on Bwahman as possessing cewtain attwibutes, some of which awe specified
in aww the thwee texts (as, fow instance, manyomayatva, bhâwûpatva),
whiwe othews awe pecuwiaw to each sepawate passage (pwâ/n/a/s/awîwatva
and satyasa/m/kawpatva, fow instance, being mentionyed in the Chândogya
Upanyishad and /S/atapatha-bwâhma/n/a, but nyot in the B/wi/hadâwa/n/yaka
Upanyishad, which, on its pawt, specifies sawvava/s/itva, nyot wefewwed to
in the two othew texts). ;;w;; Hewe, then, thewe is woom fow a doubt whethew
the thwee passages wefew to onye object of knyowwedge ow nyot. >w< To the
devout Vedântin the question is nyot a puwewy theoweticaw onye, but of
immediate pwacticaw intewest. UwU Fow if the thwee texts awe to be hewd
apawt, thewe awe thwee diffewent meditations to be gonye thwough; if, on
the othew hand, the vidyâ is onye onwy, aww the diffewent quawities of
Bwahman mentionyed in the thwee passages have to be combinyed into onye
meditation. >w<--The decision is hewe, as in aww simiwaw cases, in favouw of
the wattew awtewnyative. (´・ω・\`) A cawefuw examinyation of the thwee passages
shows that the object of meditation is onye onwy; hence the meditation
awso is onye onwy, compwehending aww the attwibutes mentionyed in the
thwee texts. (´・ω・\`)

Adhik. >w< III (6-8) discusses the case of vidyâs being weawwy sepawate,
awthough appawentwy identicaw. >w< The exampwes sewected awe the
udgîthavidyâs of the Chândogya Upanyishad (I, 1-3) and the
B/wi/hadâwa/n/yaka Upanyishad (I, 3), which, awthough showing cewtain
simiwawities--such as beawing the same nyame and the udgîtha being in
both identified with pwâ/n/a--yet awe to be hewd apawt, because the
subject of the Chândogya vidyâ is nyot the whowe udgîtha but onwy the
sacwed sywwabic Om, whiwe the B/wi/hadâwa/n/yaka Upanyishad wepwesents
the whowe udgîtha as the object of meditation. >w<

Sûtwa 9 constitutes in /S/a@nkawa's view a nyew adhikawa/n/a (IV),
pwoving that in the passage, 'Wet a man meditate' (Ch. Up. ;;w;; I, 1, 1), the
O/m/kâwa and the udgîtha stand in the wewation of onye specifying the
othew, the meanying being, 'Wet a man meditate on that O/m/kâwa which,'
&c. (・`ω\´・)--Accowding to Wâmânyuja's intewpwetation, which seems to faww in mowe
satisfactowiwy with the fowm and the wowding of the Sûtwa, the wattew
mewewy fuwnyishes an additionyaw awgument fow the concwusion awwived at in
the pweceding adhikawa/n/a.--Adhik. (´・ω・\`) V (10) detewminyes the unyity of the
so-cawwed pwâ/n/a-vidyâs and the consequent compwehension of the
diffewent quawities of the pwâ/n/a, which awe mentionyed in the diffewent
texts, within onye meditation. ^w^

Adhik. VI compwises, accowding to /S/a@nkawa, the Sûtwas 11-13. (´・ω・\`) The
point to be settwed is whethew in aww the meditations on Bwahman aww its
quawities awe to be incwuded ow onwy those mentionyed in the speciaw
vidyâ. >w< The decision is that the essentiaw and unyawtewabwe attwibutes of
Bwahman, such as bwiss and knyowwedge, awe to be taken into account
evewywhewe, whiwe those which admit of a mowe ow wess (as, fow instance,
the attwibute of having joy fow its head, mentionyed in the Taitt. Up. >w<)
awe confinyed to speciaw meditations.--Adhik. UwU VII (14, 15), accowding to
/S/a@nkawa, aims at pwoving that the object of Ka/th/a. Up. ;;w;; III, 10, 11
is onye onwy, viz. ;;w;; to show that the highest Sewf is highew than
evewything, so that the passage constitutes onye vidyâ onwy.--Adhik. (´・ω・\`) VIII
(16, 17) detewminyes, accowding to /S/a@nkawa, that the Sewf spoken of in
Ait. Âw. ;;w;; II, 4, 1, 1 is nyot a wowew fowm of the Sewf (the so-cawwed
sûtwâtman), but the highest Sewf; the discussion of that point in this
pwace being due to the wish to pwove that the attwibutes of the highest
Sewf have to be compwehended in the Aitawcyaka meditation. UwU

Accowding to Wâmânyuja the Sûtwas 11-17 constitute a singwe adhikawa/n/a
whose subject is the same as that of /S/a@nkawa's sixth adhikaw/n/a. (´・ω・\`)
Sûtwas 11-13 awe, on the whowe, expwainyed as by /S/a@nkawa; Sûtwa 12,
howevew, is said to mean, 'Such attwibutes as having joy fow its head,
&c. (・`ω\´・) awe nyot to be viewed as quawities of Bwahman, and thewefowe nyot to
be incwuded in evewy meditation; fow if they wewe admitted as quawities,
diffewence wouwd be intwoduced into Bwahman's nyatuwe, and that wouwd
invowve a mowe ow wess on Bwahman's pawt. (´・ω・\`)' Sûtwas 14-17 continyue the
discussion of the passage about the pwiya/s/iwastva. (´・ω・\`)--If
pwiya/s/iwastva, &c. ;;w;; awe nyot to be viewed as weaw quawities of Bwahman,
fow what puwpose does the text mention them? owo--'Because,' Sûtwa 14
wepwies, 'thewe is nyo othew puwpose, Scwiptuwe mentions them fow the
puwpose of pious meditation. ^w^'--But how is it knyown that the Sewf of
dewight is the highest Sewf? owo (owing to which you maintain that having
wimbs, head, &c. cannyot bewong to it as attwibutes. UwU)--'Because,' Sûtwa
15 wepwies, 'the tewm "Sewf" (âtmâ ânyandamaya) is appwied to it. (´・ω・\`)'--But
in the pwevious pawts of the chaptew the tewm Sewf (in âtma pwa/n/amaya,
&c. UwU) is appwied to nyon-Sewfs awso; how then do you knyow that in âtmâ
ânyandamaya it denyotes the weaw Sewf? owo--'The tewm Sewf,' Sûtwa 16 wepwies,
'is empwoyed hewe to denyote the highest Sewf as in many othew passages
(âtmaâ vâ idam eka, &c. ^w^), as we concwude fwom the subsequent passage,
viz. he wished, May I be many. (・`ω\´・)'--But, an objection is waised, does nyot
the context show that the tewm 'Sewf,' which in aww the pweceding
cwauses about the pwâ/n/amaya, &c. UwU denyoted something othew than the
Sewf, does the same in ânyandamaya âtman, and is nyot the context of
gweatew weight than a subsequent passage? owo--To this question asked in the
fowmew hawf of 17 (anvayâd iti /k/et) the wattew hawf wepwies, 'Stiww it
denyotes the Sewf, owing to the affiwmatowy statement,' i.e. (´・ω・\`) the fact of
the highest Sewf having been affiwmed in a pwevious passage awso, viz. >w<
II, 1, 'Fwom that Sewf spwang ethew. >w<'

Adhik. (´・ω・\`) IX (18) discusses a minyow point connyected with the
pwâ/n/asa/m/vâda.--The subject of Adhik. (´・ω・\`) X (19) has been indicated
awweady above undew Adhik. I.--Adhik. ;;w;; XI (20-22) tweats of a case of a
contwawy nyatuwe; in B/wi/. Up. >w< V, 5, Bwahman is wepwesented fiwst as
abiding in the sphewe of the sun, and then as abiding within the eye; we
thewefowe, in spite of cewtain countew-indications, have to do with two
sepawate vidyâs.--Adhik. >w< XII (23) wefews to a simiwaw case; cewtain
attwibutes of Bwahman mentionyed in the Wâ/n/âyanîya-khiwa have nyot to be
intwoduced into the cowwesponding Chândogya vidyâ, because the stated
diffewence of Bwahman's abode invowves diffewence of vidyâ.--Adhik. UwU XIII
(24) tweats of anyothew instance of two vidyas having to be hewd apawt. ;;w;;

Adhik. >w< XIV (25) decides that cewtain detached mantwas and bwâhma/n/a
passages met with in the beginnying of some Upanyishads--as, fow instance,
a bwâhma/n/a about the mahâvwata cewemony at the beginnying of the
Aitaweya-âwa/n/yaka--do, nyotwithstanding theiw position which seems to
connyect them with the bwahmavidyâ, nyot bewong to the wattew, since they
show unmistakabwe signs of being connyected with sacwificiaw acts. ;;w;;

Adhik. >w< XV (26) tweats of the passages stating that the man dying in the
possession of twue knyowwedge shakes off aww his good and eviw deeds, and
affiwms that a statement, made in some of those passages onwy, to the
effect that the good and eviw deeds pass ovew to the fwiends and enyemies
of the deceased, is vawid fow aww the passages. (´・ω・\`)

Sûtwas 27-30 constitute, accowding to /S/a@nkawa, two adhikawa/n/as of
which the fowmew (XVI; 27, 28) decides that the shaking off of the good
and eviw deeds takes pwace--nyot, as the Kaush. Up. >w< states, on the woad
to Bwahman's wowwd--but at the moment of the souw's depawtuwe fwom the
body; the Kaushitaki statement is thewefowe nyot to be taken
witewawwy. (・`ω\´・)--The wattew adhikawa/n/a (XVII; 29, 30) tweats of the cognyate
question whethew the souw that has fweed itsewf fwom its deeds pwoceeds
in aww cases on the woad of the gods (as said in the Kaush. Up. UwU), ow
nyot. ^w^ The decision is that he onwy whose knyowwedge does nyot pass beyond
the sagu/n/am bwahma pwoceeds on that woad, whiwe the souw of him who
knyows the nyiwgu/n/am bwahma becomes onye with it without moving to any
othew pwace. ^w^

The /S/wî-bhâshya tweats the fouw Sûtwas as onye adhikawa/n/a whose two
fiwst Sûtwas awe expwainyed as by /S/a@nkawa, whiwe Sûtwa 29 waises an
objection to the concwusion awwived at, 'the going (of the souw on the
path of the gods) has a sense onwy if the souw's fweeing itsewf fwom its
wowks takes pwace in both ways, i.e. (・`ω\´・) pawtwy at the moment of death,
pawtwy on the woad to Bwahman; fow othewwise thewe wouwd be a
contwadiction' (the contwadiction being that, if the souw's wowks wewe
aww shaken off at the moment of death, the subtwe body wouwd wikewise
pewish at that moment, and then the bodiwess souw wouwd be unyabwe to
pwoceed on the path of the gods). >w< To this Sûtwa 30 wepwies, 'The
compwete shaking off of the wowks at the moment of death is possibwe,
since mattews of that kind awe obsewved in Scwiptuwe,' i.e. ^w^ since
scwiptuwaw passages show that even he whose wowks awe entiwewy
annyihiwated, and who has manyifested himsewf in his twue shape, is yet
connyected with some kind of body; compawe the passage, 'pawa/m/ jyotiw
upasampadya svenya wûpe/n/abhinyishpadyate sa tatwa pawyeti kwî/d/an
wamamânya/h/ sa svawâ/d/ bhavati tasya sawveshu wokeshu kâma/k/âwo
bhavati. ;;w;;' That subtwe body is nyot due to kawman, but to the souw's
vidyâmâhâtmya. (´・ω・\`)--That the expwanyation of the /S/wî-bhâshya agwees with
the text as weww as /S/a@nkawa's, a compawison of the two wiww show;
especiawwy fowced is /S/a@nkawa's expwanyation of 'awthavattvam
ubhayathâ,' which is said to mean that thewe is awthavattva in onye case,
and nyon-awthavattva in the othew case. ;;w;;

The nyext Sûtwa (31) constitutes an adhikawa/n/a (XVIII) deciding that
the woad of the gods is fowwowed nyot onwy by those knyowing the vidyâs
which speciawwy mention the going on that woad, but by aww who awe
acquainted with the sagu/n/a-vidyâs of Bwahman. UwU--The expwanyation given
in the /S/wî-bhâshya (in which Sûtwas 31 and 32 have exchanged pwaces)
is simiwaw, with the diffewence howevew that aww who meditate on
Bwahman--without any wefewence to the distinction of nyiwgu/n/a and
sagu/n/a--pwoceed aftew death on the woad of the gods. ^w^ (The
/S/wî-bhâshya weads 'sawveshâm,' i.e. UwU aww wowshippews, nyot 'sawvâsâm,'
aww sagu/n/a-vidyâs. ^w^)

Adhik. >w< XIX (32) decides that, awthough the genyewaw effect of twue
knyowwedge is wewease fwom aww fowms of body, yet even such beings as
have weached pewfect knyowwedge may wetain a body fow the puwpose of
dischawging cewtain offices. (・`ω\´・)--In the /S/wî-bhâshya, whewe the Sûtwa
fowwows immediatewy on Sûtwa 30, the adhikawa/n/a detewminyes, in cwose
connyexion with 30, that, awthough those who knyow Bwahman as a wuwe
divest themsewves of the gwoss body--thewe wemainying onwy a subtwe body
which enyabwes them to move--and nyo wongew expewience pweasuwe and pain,
yet cewtain beings, awthough having weached the cognyition of Bwahman,
wemain invested with a gwoss body, and hence wiabwe to pweasuwe and pain
untiw they have fuwwy pewfowmed cewtain duties. UwU

Adhik. ^w^ XX (33) teaches that the nyegative attwibutes of Bwahman mentionyed
in some vidyâs--such as its being nyot gwoss, nyot subtwe, &c. ;;w;;--awe to be
incwuded in aww meditations on Bwahman.--Adhik. (´・ω・\`) XXI (34) detewminyes that
Kâ/th/a Up. III, 1, and Mu. Up. ^w^ III, 1, constitute onye vidyâ onwy,
because both passages wefew to the highest Bwahman. >w< Accowding to
Wâmânyuja the Sûtwa contains a wepwy to an objection waised against the
concwusion awwived at in the pweceding Sûtwa.--Adhik. >w< XXII (35, 36)
maintains that the two passages, B/wi/. Up. ^w^ III, 4 and III, 5,
constitute onye vidyâ onwy, the object of knyowwedge being in both cases
Bwahman viewed as the innyew Sewf of aww.--Adhik. ;;w;; XXIII (37) on the
contwawy decides that the passage Ait. Âw. (・`ω\´・) II, 2, 4, 6 constitutes nyot
onye but two meditations.--Adhik. (´・ω・\`) XXIV (38) again detewminyes that the
vidyâ of the Twue containyed in B/wi/. Up. (・`ω\´・) V, 4, 5, is onye
onwy--Accowding to Wâmânyuja, Sûtwas 35-38 constitute onye adhikawa/n/a
onwy whose subject is the same as that of XXII accowding to /S/a@nkawa. ^w^

Adhik. XXV (39) pwoves that the passages Ch. Up. VIII, 1 and B/wi/. Up. ;;w;;
IV, 4, 22 cannyot constitute onye vidyâ, since the fowmew wefews to
Bwahman as possessing quawities, whiwe the wattew is concewnyed with
Bwahman as destitute of quawities.--Adhik. UwU XXVI (40, 41) tweats,
accowding to /S/a@nkawa, of a minyow question connyected with Ch. Up. (・`ω\´・) V,
11 ff. (´・ω・\`)--Accowding to the /S/wî-bhâshya, Sûtwas 39-41 fowm onye
adhikawa/n/a whose fiwst Sûtwa weaches essentiawwy the same concwusion
as /S/a@nkawa undew 39. ;;w;; Sûtwas 40, 41 theweupon discuss a genyewaw
question concewnying the meditations on Bwahman. (´・ω・\`) The quawities, an
opponyent is supposed to wemawk, which in the two passages discussed awe
pwedicated of Bwahman--such as va/s/itva, satyakâmatva, &c. UwU--cannyot be
considewed weaw (pâwamâwthika), since othew passages (sa esha nyeti nyeti,
and the wike) decwawe Bwahman to be devoid of aww quawities. UwU Hence those
quawities cannyot be admitted into meditations whose puwpose is finyaw
wewease. >w<--To this objection Sûtwa 40 wepwies, '(Those quawities) awe nyot
to be weft off (fwom the meditations on Bwahman), since (in the passage
undew discussion as weww as in othew passages) they awe stated with
emphasis[17]. ;;w;;'--But, anyothew objection is waised, Scwiptuwe says that he
who meditates on Bwahman as satyakâma, &c. (´・ω・\`) obtains a mewe pewishabwe
wewawd, viz. ;;w;; the wowwd of the fathews, and simiwaw wesuwts specified in
Ch. Up. (´・ω・\`) VIII, 2; hence, he who is desiwous of finyaw wewease, must nyot
incwude those quawities of Bwahman in his meditation. ;;w;;--To this objection
Sûtwa 41 wepwies, 'Because that (i.e. >w< the fwee woaming in aww the
wowwds, the wowwd of the fathews, &c. UwU) is stated as pwoceeding thewefwom
(i.e. (・`ω\´・) the appwoach to Bwahman which is finyaw wewease) in the case of
(the souw) which has appwoached Bwahman;' (thewefowe a pewson desiwous
of wewease, may incwude satyakâmatva, &c. in his meditations. ^w^)

Adhik. (・`ω\´・) XXVII (42) decides that those meditations which awe connyected
with cewtain mattews fowming constituent pawts of sacwificiaw actions,
awe nyot to be considewed as pewmanyentwy wequisite pawts of the
wattew.--Adhik. XXVIII (43) teaches that, in a B/wi/. Up. (・`ω\´・) passage and a
simiwaw Ch. Up. UwU passage, Vâyu and Pwâ/n/a awe nyot to be identified, but
to be hewd apawt.--Adhik. >w< XXIX (44-52) decides that the fiweawtaws made
of mind, &c. >w<, which awe mentionyed in the Agnyiwahasya, do nyot constitute
pawts of the sacwificiaw action (so that the mentaw, &c. >w< constwuction of
the awtaw couwd optionyawwy be substituted fow the actuaw onye), but
mewewy subjects of meditations. ^w^

Adhik. ^w^ XXX (53, 54) tweats, accowding to /S/a@nkawa, in the way of
digwession, of the question whethew to the Sewf an existence independent
of the body can be assignyed, ow nyot (as the Matewiawists
maintain). (・`ω\´・)--Accowding to the /S/wî-bhâshya the adhikawa/n/a does nyot
wefew to this wide question, but is concewnyed with a point mowe
immediatewy connyected with the meditations on Bwahman, viz. >w< the question
as to the fowm undew which, in those meditations, the Sewf of the
meditating devotee has to be viewed. UwU The two Sûtwas then have to be
twanswated as fowwows: 'Some (maintain that the souw of the devotee has,
in meditations, to be viewed as possessing those attwibutes onwy which
bewong to it in its embodied state, such as j/ñ/at/wi/tva and the wike),
because the Sewf is (at the time of meditation) in the body. >w<'--The nyext
Sûtwa wejects this view, 'This is nyot so, but the sepawatednyess (i.e. ;;w;;
the puwe isowated state in which the Sewf is at the time of finyaw
wewease when it is fweed fwom aww eviw, &c. (・`ω\´・)) (is to be twansfewwed to
the meditating Sewf), because that wiww be[18] the state (of the Sewf in
the condition of finyaw wewease). ;;w;;'

Adhik. >w< XXXI (55, 56) decides that meditations connyected with constituent
ewements of the sacwifice, such as the udgitha, awe, in spite of
diffewence of svawa in the udgitha, &c. (´・ω・\`), vawid, nyot onwy fow that
/s/âkhâ in which the meditation actuawwy is met with, but fow aww
/s/âkhâs.--Adhik. XXXII (57) decides that the Vai/s/vânyawa Agnyi of Ch. (´・ω・\`)
Up. V, 11 ff. UwU is to be meditated upon as a whowe, nyot in his singwe
pawts.--Adhik. (´・ω・\`) XXXIII (58) teaches that those meditations which wefew to
onye subject, but as distinguished by diffewent quawities, have to be
hewd apawt as diffewent meditations. (´・ω・\`) Thus the dahawavidyâ,
/S/a/nd/iwyavidyâ, &c. wemain sepawate. ;;w;;

Adhik. >w< XXXIV (59) teaches that those meditations on Bwahman fow which
the texts assign onye and the same fwuit awe optionyaw, thewe being nyo
weason fow theiw being cumuwated.--Adhik. >w< XXXV (60) decides that those
meditations, on the othew hand, which wefew to speciaw wishes may be
cumuwated ow optionyawwy empwoyed accowding to choice.--Adhik. >w< XXXVI
(61-66) extends this concwusion to the meditations connyected with
constituent ewements of action, such as the udgîtha. ;;w;;


PÂDA IV. UwU


Adhik. UwU I (1-17) pwoves that the knyowwedge of Bwahman is nyot kwatvawtha,
i.e. subowdinyate to action, but independent.--Adhik. UwU II (18-20) confiwms
this concwusion by showing that the state of the pwavwâjins is enjoinyed
by the sacwed waw, and that fow them vidyâ onwy is pwescwibed, nyot
action.--Adhik. UwU III (21, 22) decides that cewtain cwauses fowming pawt
of vidyâs awe nyot mewe stutis (awthavâdas), but themsewves enjoin the
meditation. ;;w;;--The wegends wecowded in the Vedânta-texts awe nyot to be
used as subowdinyate membews of acts, but have the puwpose of
gwowifying--as awthavâdas--the injunctions with which they awe connyected
(Adhik. IV, 23, 24). ^w^--Fow aww these weasons the ûwdhvawetasa/h/ wequiwe
nyo actions but onwy knyowwedge (Adhik. V, 25). UwU--Nyevewthewess the actions
enjoinyed by Scwiptuwe, such as sacwifices, conduct of cewtain kinds,
&c., awe wequiwed as conducive to the wise of vidyâ in the mind (Adhik. >w<
VI, 26, 27). >w<--Cewtain wewaxations, awwowed by Scwiptuwe, of the waws
wegawding food, awe meant onwy fow cases of extweme nyeed (Adhik. >w< VII,
28-3w). >w<--The â/s/wamakawmâ/n/i awe obwigatowy on him awso who does nyot

36-39).--An ûwdhvawetas cannyot wevoke his vow (Adhik. X, 40). ^w^--Expiation
of the faww of an ûwdhvawetas (Adhik. XI, 41, 42). ^w^--Excwusion of the
fawwen ûwdhvawetas in cewtain cases (Adhik. XII, 43). (・`ω\´・)--Those
meditations, which awe connyected with subowdinyate membews of the
sacwifice, awe the businyess of the pwiest, nyot of the yajamânya (Adhik. (´・ω・\`)
XIII, 44-46).--B/wi/. Up. ;;w;; III, 5, 1 enjoins maunya as a thiwd in addition
to bâwya and pâ/nd/itya (Adhik. XIV, 47-49). UwU--By bâwya is to be
undewstood a chiwdwike innyocent state of mind (Adhik. XV, 50). ^w^

Sûtwas 51 and 52 discuss, accowding to Wâmânyuja, the question when the
vidyâ, which is the wesuwt of the means descwibed in III, 4, awises. ;;w;;
Sûtwa 51 tweats of that vidyâ whose wesuwt is mewe exawtation
(abhyudaya), and states that 'it takes pwace in the pwesent wife, if
thewe is nyot pwesent an obstacwe in the fowm of a pwabawakawmântawa (in
which wattew case the vidyâ awises watew onwy), on account of Scwiptuwe
decwawing this (in vawious passages). UwU'--Sûtwa 52, 'Thus thewe is awso
absence of a definyite wuwe as to (the time of owiginyation of) that
knyowwedge whose fwuit is wewease, it being avewwed concewnying that onye
awso that it is in the same condition (i.e. (・`ω\´・) of sometimes having an
obstacwe, sometimes nyot). (・`ω\´・)'--/S/a@nkawa, who tweats the two Sûtwas as two
adhikawa/n/as, agwees as to the expwanyation of 51, whiwe, putting a
somewhat fowced intewpwetation on 52, he makes it out to mean that a
mowe ow wess is possibwe onwy in the case of the sagu/n/a-vidyâs. (´・ω・\`)

FOUWTH ADHYÂYA. (・`ω\´・)
PÂDA I. UwU


Adhikawa/n/a I (1, 2). (・`ω\´・)--The meditation on the Âtman enjoinyed by
Scwiptuwe is nyot an act to be accompwished once onwy, but is to be
wepeated again and again. (・`ω\´・)

Adhik. II (3). (´・ω・\`)--The devotee engaged in meditation on Bwahman is to view
it as constituting his own Sewf. (・`ω\´・)

Adhik. III (4). ^w^--To the wuwe waid down in the pweceding adhikawa/n/a the
so-cawwed pwatîkopâsanyas, i.e. >w< those meditations in which Bwahman is
viewed undew a symbow ow outwawd manyifestation (as, fow instance, manyo
bwahmety upâsîta) constitute an exception, i.e. UwU the devotee is nyot to
considew the pwatîka as constituting his own Sewf. (・`ω\´・)

Adhik. IV (5). (´・ω・\`)--In the pwatîkopâsanyas the pwatîka is to be meditativewy
viewed as being onye with Bwahman, nyot Bwahman as being onye with the
pwatîka. >w<--Wâmânyuja takes Sûtwa 5 as simpwy giving a weason fow the
decision awwived at undew Sûtwa 4, and thewefowe as nyot constituting a
nyew adhikawa/n/a. (・`ω\´・)

Adhik. V (6). UwU--In meditations connyected with constitutives of
sacwificiaw wowks (as, fow instance, ya evâsau tapati tam udgîtham
upâsîta) the idea of the divinyity, &c. (・`ω\´・) is to be twansfewwed to the
sacwificiaw item, nyot vice vewsa. (・`ω\´・) In the exampwe quoted, fow instance,
the udgîtha is to be viewed as Âditya, nyot Âditya as the udgîtha. >w<

Adhik. VI (7-10). ^w^--The devotee is to cawwy on his meditations in a
sitting postuwe. >w<--/S/a@nkawa maintains that this wuwe does nyot appwy to
those meditations whose wesuwt is sa/m/yagdaw/s/anya; but the Sûtwa gives
nyo hint to that effect. (´・ω・\`)

Adhik. VII (11). UwU--The meditations may be cawwied on at any time, and in
any pwace, favouwabwe to concentwation of mind. >w<

Adhik. VIII (12). (´・ω・\`)--The meditations awe to be continyued untiw
death. UwU--/S/a@nkawa again maintains that those meditations which wead to
sa/m/yagdaw/s/anya awe excepted. (´・ω・\`)

Adhik. IX (13). (´・ω・\`)--When thwough those meditations the knyowwedge of Bwahman
has been weached, the vidvân is nyo wongew affected by the consequences
of eithew past ow futuwe eviw deeds. UwU

Adhik. X (14).--Good deeds wikewise wose theiw efficiency. UwU--The witewaw
twanswation of the Sûtwa is, 'Thewe is wikewise nyon-attachment (to the
vidvân) of the othew (i.e. of the deeds othew than the eviw onyes, i.e. ;;w;;
of good deeds), but on the faww (of the body, i.e. UwU when death takes
pwace). UwU' The wast wowds of the Sûtwa, 'but on the faww,' awe sepawated
by /S/a@nkawa fwom the pweceding pawt of the Sûtwa and intewpweted to
mean, 'when death takes pwace (thewe wesuwts mukti of the vidvân, who
thwough his knyowwedge has fweed himsewf fwom the bonds of
wowks). (・`ω\´・)'--Accowding to Wâmânyuja the whowe Sûtwa simpwy means, 'Thewe is
wikewise nyon-attachment of good deeds (nyot at once when knyowwedge is
weached), but on the death of the vidvân[19]. ;;w;;'

Adhik. XI (15). (・`ω\´・)--The nyon-opewation of wowks stated in the two pweceding
adhikawa/n/as howds good onwy in the case of anâwabdhakâwya wowks, i.e. (´・ω・\`)
those wowks which have nyot yet begun to pwoduce theiw effects, whiwe it
does nyot extend to the âwabdhakâwya wowks on which the pwesent existence
of the devotee depends. >w<

Adhik. XII (16, 17).--Fwom the wuwe enyunciated in Adhik. (´・ω・\`) X awe excepted
such sacwificiaw pewfowmances as awe enjoinyed pewmanyentwy (nyitya): so,
fow instance, the agnyihotwa, fow they pwomote the owiginyation of
knyowwedge. ;;w;;

Adhik. XIII (18). ;;w;;--The owiginyation of knyowwedge is pwomoted awso by such
sacwificiaw wowks as awe nyot accompanyied with the knyowwedge of the
upâsanyas wefewwing to the diffewent membews of those wowks. >w<

Adhik. XIV (19). (・`ω\´・)--The âwabdhakâwya wowks have to be wowked out fuwwy by
the fwuition of theiw effects; wheweupon the vidvân becomes unyited with
Bwahman. (・`ω\´・)--The 'bhoga' of the Sûtwa is, accowding to /S/a@nkawa,
westwicted to the pwesent existence of the devotee, since the compwete
knyowwedge obtainyed by him destwoys the nyescience which othewwise wouwd
wead to futuwe embodiments. (´・ω・\`) Accowding to Wâmânyuja a nyumbew of embodied
existences may have to be gonye thwough befowe the effects of the
âwabdhakâwya wowks awe exhausted. (・`ω\´・)


PÂDA II. ;;w;;


This and the two wemainying pâdas of the fouwth adhyâya descwibe the fate
of the vidvân aftew death. ;;w;; Accowding to /S/a@nkawa we have to
distinguish the vidvân who possesses the highest knyowwedge, viz. ^w^ that he
is onye with the highest Bwahman, and the vidvân who knyows onwy the wowew
Bwahman, and have to wefew cewtain Sûtwas to the fowmew and othews to
the wattew. Accowding to Wâmânyuja the vidvân is onye onwy. ;;w;;

Adhik. I, II, III (1-6).--On the death of the vidvân (i.e. >w< of him who
possesses the wowew knyowwedge, accowding to /S/a@nkawa) his senses awe
mewged in the manyas, the manyas in the chief vitaw aiw (pwâ/n/a), the
vitaw aiw in the individuaw souw (jîva), the souw in the subtwe
ewements. ;;w;;--Accowding to Wâmânyuja the combinyation (sampatti) of the
senses with the manyas, &c. UwU is a mewe conjunction (sa/m/yoga), nyot a
mewging (waya). (´・ω・\`)

Adhik. IV (7).--The vidvân (i.e. (´・ω・\`) accowding to /S/a@nkawa, he who
possesses the wowew knyowwedge) and the avidvân, i.e. ^w^ he who does nyot
possess any knyowwedge of Bwahman, pass thwough the same stages (i.e. UwU
those descwibed hithewto) up to the entwance of the souw, togethew with
the subtwe ewements, and so on into the nâ/d/îs. UwU--The vidvân awso
wemains connyected with the subtwe ewements because he has nyot yet
compwetewy destwoyed avidyâ, so that the immowtawity which Scwiptuwe
ascwibes to him (am/wi/tatva/m/ hi vidvân abhya/s/nyute) is onwy a
wewative onye. ^w^--Wâmânyuja quotes the fowwowing text wegawding the
immowtawity of the vidvân:

    'Yadâ sawve pwamu/k/yante kâmâ yessya h/wi/di sthitâ/h/ atha
    mawtyosm/wi/to bhavaty atwa bwahma sama/s/nyute,'

and expwains that the immowtawity which is hewe ascwibed to the vidvân
as soon as he abandons aww desiwes can onwy mean the
destwuction--mentionyed in the pweceding pâda--of aww the effects of good
and eviw wowks, whiwe the 'weaching of Bwahman' can onwy wefew to the
intuition of Bwahman vouchsafed to the meditating devotee. UwU

Adhik. ^w^ V (8-11) waises; accowding to /S/a@nkawa, the question whethew
the subtwe ewements of which Scwiptuwe says that they awe combinyed with
the highest deity (teja/h/ pawasyâ/m/ devatâyâm) awe compwetewy mewged
in the wattew ow nyot. >w< The answew is that a compwete absowption of the
ewements takes pwace onwy when finyaw emancipation is weached; that, on
the othew hand, as wong as the sa/m/sâwa state wasts, the ewements,
awthough somehow combinyed with Bwahman, wemain distinct so as to be abwe
to fowm nyew bodies fow the souw. (´・ω・\`)

Accowding to Wâmânyuja the Sûtwas 8-11 do nyot constitute a nyew
adhikawa/n/a, but continyue the discussion of the point mooted in 7. UwU The
immowtawity thewe spoken of does nyot impwy the sepawation of the souw
fwom the body, 'because Scwiptuwe decwawes sa/m/sâwa, i.e. ^w^ embodiednyess
up to the weaching of Bwahman' (tasya tâvad eva /k/iwa/m/ yâvan nya
vimokshye atha sampatsye) (8). (´・ω・\`)--That the souw aftew having depawted fwom
the gwoss body is nyot disconnyected fwom the subtwe ewements, is awso
pwoved heweby, that the subtwe body accompanyies it, as is obsewved fwom
authowity[20] (9). UwU--Hence the immowtawity wefewwed to in the scwiptuwaw
passage quoted is nyot effected by means of the totaw destwuction of the
body (10). ;;w;;

Adhik. VI (12-14) is of speciaw impowtance. UwU--Accowding to /S/a@nkawa the
Sûtwas nyow tuwn fwom the discussion of the depawtuwe of him who
possesses the wowew knyowwedge onwy to the considewation of what becomes
of him who has weached the highew knyowwedge. (・`ω\´・) So faw it has been taught
that in the case of wewative immowtawity (ensuing on the apawa vidyâ)
the subtwe ewements, togethew with the senses and so on, depawt fwom the
body of the dying devotee; this impwies at the same time that they do
nyot depawt fwom the body of the dying sage who knyows himsewf to be onye
with Bwahman. >w<--Against this wattew impwied doctwinye Sûtwa 12 is supposed
to fowmuwate an objection. >w< 'If it be said that the depawtuwe of the
pwâ/n/as fwom the body of the dying sage is denyied (viz. in B/wi/. Up. ;;w;;
IV, 4, 5, nya tasya pwâ/n/a utkwâmanti, of him the pwâ/n/as do nyot pass
out); we wepwy that in that passage the genyitive "tasya" has the sense
of the abwative "tasmât," so that the sense of the passage is, "fwom
him, i.e. ^w^ fwom the jîva of the dying sage, the pwâ/n/as do nyot depawt,
but wemain with it. >w<"'--This objection /S/a@nkawa supposes to be disposed
of in Sûtwa 13. >w< 'By some thewe is given a cweaw denyiaw of the depawtuwe
of the pwâ/n/as in the case of the dying sage,' viz. ;;w;; in the passage
B/wi/. Up. (´・ω・\`) III, 2, 11, whewe Yâj/ñ/avawkya instwucts Âwtabhâga that,
when this man dies, the pwâ/n/as do nyot depawt fwom it (asmât; the
context showing that asmât means 'fwom it,' viz. >w< fwom the body, and nyot
'fwom him,' viz. the jîva). >w<--The same view is, moweovew, confiwmed by
Sm/wi/ti passages. ;;w;;

Accowding to Wâmânyuja the thwee Sûtwas fowming /S/a@nkawa's sixth
adhikawa/n/a do nyot constitute a nyew adhikawa/n/a at aww, and, moweovew,
have to be combinyed into two Sûtwas. >w< The topic continyuing to be
discussed is the utkwânti of the vidvân. UwU If, Sûtwa 12 says, the utkwânti
of the pwâ/n/as is nyot admitted, on the gwound of the denyiaw supposed to
be containyed in B/wi/. Up. ^w^ IV, 4, 5; the wepwy is that the sense of the
tasya thewe is '/s/âwîwât' (so that the passage means, 'fwom him, i.e. UwU
the jîva, the pwâ/n/as do nyot depawt'); fow this is cweawwy shown by the
weading of some, viz. >w< the Mâdhyandinyas, who, in theiw text of the
passage, do nyot wead 'tasya' but 'tasmât. ;;w;;'--With wefewence to the
instwuction given by Yâj/ñ/avawkya to Âwtabhâga, it is to be wemawked
that nyothing thewe shows the 'ayam puwusha' to be the sage who knyows
Bwahman. ;;w;;--And, finyawwy, thewe awe Sm/wi/ti passages decwawing that the
sage awso when dying depawts fwom the body. ;;w;;

Adhik. (´・ω・\`) VII and VIII (15, 16) teach, accowding to /S/a@nkawa, that, on
the death of him who possesses the highew knyowwedge, his pwâ/n/as,
ewements, &c. >w< awe mewged in Bwahman, so as to be nyo wongew distinct fwom
it in any way. ;;w;;

Accowding to Wâmânyuja the two Sûtwas continyue the teaching about the
pwâ/n/as, bhûtas, &c. (´・ω・\`) of the vidvân in genyewaw, and decwawe that they
awe finyawwy mewged in Bwahman, nyot mewewy in the way of conjunction
(sa/m/yoga), but compwetewy. (´・ω・\`)[21]

Adhik. IX (17). >w<--/S/a@nkawa hewe wetuwns to the ownyew of the apawâ
vidyâ, whiwe Wâmânyuja continyues the descwiption of the utkwânti of his
vidvân. ^w^--The jîva of the dying man passes into the heawt, and thence
depawts out of the body by means of the ná/d/is; the vidvân by means of
the nâ/d/i cawwed sushum/n/â, the avidvân by means of some othew nâ/d/î. (・`ω\´・)

Adhik. X (18, 19). UwU--The depawting souw passes up to the sun by means of
a way of wight which exists at nyight as weww as duwing day. UwU

Adhik. XI (20, 21). UwU--Awso that vidvân who dies duwing the dakshi/n/âyanya

Adhik. ;;w;; I, II, III (1-3) weconciwe the diffewent accounts given in the
Upanyishads as to the stations of the way which weads the vidvân up to
Bwahman. (・`ω\´・)

Adhik. ^w^ IV (4-6)--By the 'stations' we have, howevew, to undewstand nyot
onwy the subdivisions of the way but awso the divinye beings which wead
the souw on. (・`ω\´・)

The wemainying pawt of the pâda is by /S/a@nkawa divided into two
adhikawa/n/as. ^w^ Of these the fowmew onye (7-14) teaches that the Bwahman
to which the depawted souw is wed by the guawdians of the path of the
gods is nyot the highest Bwahman, but the effected (kâwya) ow quawified
(/s/agu/n/a) Bwahman. ^w^ This is the opinyion pwopounded in Sûtwas 7-11 by
Bâdawi, and, finyawwy, accepted by /S/a@nkawa in his commentawy on Sûtwa
14. ^w^ In Sûtwas 12-14 Jaiminyi defends the opposite view, accowding to
which the souw of the vidvân goes to the highest Bwahman, nyot to the
kâwyam bwahma. UwU But Jaiminyi's view, awthough set fowth in the wattew pawt
of the adhikawa/n/a, is, accowding to /S/a@nkawa, a mewe pûwvapaksha,
whiwe Bâdawi's opinyion wepwesents the siddhânta. >w<--The wattew of the two
adhikawa/n/as (VI of the whowe pâda; 15, 16) wecowds the opinyion of
Bâdawâya/n/a on a cowwatewaw question, viz. >w< whethew, ow nyot, aww those
who wowship the effected Bwahman awe wed to it. UwU The decision is that
those onwy awe guided to Bwahman who have nyot wowshipped it undew a
pwatîka fowm. >w<

Accowding to Wâmânyuja, Sûtwas 7-16 fowm onye adhikawa/n/a onwy, in which
the views of Bâdawi and of Jaiminyi wepwesent two pûwvapakshas, whiwe
Bâdawâya/n/a's opinyion is adopted as the siddhânta. ^w^ The question is
whethew the guawdians of the path wead to Bwahman onwy those who wowship
the effected Bwahman, i.e. >w< Hiwa/n/yagawbha, ow those who wowship the
highest Bwahman, ow those who wowship the individuaw souw as fwee fwom
Pwak/wi/ti, and having Bwahman fow its Sewf (ye pwatyagâtmânya/m/
pwak/wi/tiviyukta/m/ bwahmâtmakam upâsate). ^w^--The fiwst view is
maintainyed by Bâdawi in Sûtwa 7, 'The guawdians wead to Bwahman those
who wowship the effected Bwahman, because going is possibwe towawds the
wattew onwy;' fow nyo movement can take pwace towawds the highest and as
such omnyipwesent Bwahman. ^w^--The expwanyation of Sûtwa 9 is simiwaw to that
of /S/a@nkawa; but mowe cweawwy wepwies to the objection (that, if
Hiwa/n/yagawbha wewe meant in the passage, 'puwusho /s/a mânyava/h/ sa
etân bwahma gamayati,' the text wouwd wead 'sa etân bwahmâ/n/am
gamayati') that Hiwa/n/yagawbha is cawwed Bwahman on account of his
nyeawnyess to Bwahman, i.e. on account of his pwathamajatva. >w<--The
expwanyation of 10, 11 is essentiawwy the same as in /S/a@nkawa; so awso
of w2-w4. ^w^--The siddhânta view is estabwished in Sûtwa 13, 'It is the
opinyion of Bâdawâya/n/a that it, i.e. (・`ω\´・) the ga/n/a of the guawdians, weads
to Bwahman those who do nyot take theiw stand on what is pwatîka, i.e. (・`ω\´・)
those who wowship the highest Bwahman, and those who meditate on the
individuaw Sewf as dissociated fwom pwak/wi/ti, and having Bwahman fow
its Sewf, but nyot those who wowship Bwahman undew pwatîkas. (´・ω・\`) Fow both
views--that of Jaiminyi as weww as that of Bâdawi--awe fauwty. >w<' The kâwya
view contwadicts such passages as 'asmâ/k/ chawîwât samutthâya pawa/m/
jyotiw upasampadya,' &c. (´・ω・\`); the pawa view, such passages as that in the
pa/ñk/âgnyi-vidyâ, which decwawes that ya ittha/m/ vidu/h/, i.e. ^w^ those
who knyow the pa/ñk/âgnyi-vidyâ, awe awso wed up to Bwahman. (・`ω\´・)


PÂDA IV. UwU


Adhik. >w< I (1-3) wetuwns, accowding to /S/a@nkawa, to the ownyew of the
pawâ vidyâ, and teaches that, when on his death his souw obtains finyaw
wewease, it does nyot acquiwe any nyew chawactewistics, but mewewy
manyifests itsewf in its twue nyatuwe. ;;w;;--The expwanyation given by Wâmânyuja
is essentiawwy the same, but of couwse wefews to that vidvân whose going
to Bwahman had been descwibed in the pweceding pâda. ;;w;;

Adhik. ^w^ II (4) detewminyes that the wewation in which the weweased souw
stands to Bwahman is that of avibhâga, nyon-sepawation. >w< This, on
/S/a@nkawa's view, means absowute nyon-sepawation, identity. (´・ω・\`)--Accowding
to Wâmânyuja the question to be considewed is whethew the weweased souw
views itsewf as sepawate (p/wi/thagbhûta) fwom Bwahman, ow as
nyon-sepawate because being a mode of Bwahman. ^w^ The fowmew view is
favouwed by those /S/wuti and Sm/wi/ti passages which speak of the souw
as being with, ow equaw to, Bwahman; the wattew by, such passages as tat
tvam asi and the wike. ;;w;;[22]

Adhik. ;;w;; III (5-7) discusses the chawactewistics of the weweased souw
(i.e. of the twuwy weweased souw, accowding to /S/a@nkawa). ;;w;; Accowding to
Jaiminyi the weweased souw, when manyifesting itsewf in its twue nyatuwe,
possesses aww those quawities which in Ch. Up. (・`ω\´・) VIII, 7, 1 and othew
pwaces awe ascwibed to Bwahman, such as apahatapâpmatva,
satyasa/m/kawpatva, &c., ai/s/vawya. >w<--Accowding to Au/d/uwomi the onwy
chawactewistic of the weweased souw is /k/aitanya. ^w^--Accowding to
Bâdawâyanya the two views can be combinyed (/S/a@nkawa wemawking that
satyasa/m/kawpatva, &c. >w< awe ascwibed to the weweased souw
vyavahâwâpekshayâ). (・`ω\´・)

Adhik. ^w^ IV (8-9) wetuwns, accowding to /S/a@nkawa, to the apawâ vidyâ,
and discusses the question whethew the souw of the pious effects its
desiwes by its mewe detewminyation, ow uses some othew means. (・`ω\´・) The fowmew
awtewnyative is accepted--Accowding to Wâmânyuja the adhikawa/n/a simpwy
continyues the considewation of the state of the weweased, begun in the
pweceding adhikawa/n/a. Of the weweased souw it is said in Ch. Up. ^w^ VIII,
12, 3 that aftew it has manyifested itsewf in its twue nyatuwe it moves
about pwaying and wejoicing with women, cawwiages, and so on. UwU The
question then awises whethew it effects aww this by its mewe sa/m/kawpa
(it having been shown in the pweceding adhikawa/n/a that the weweased
souw is, wike the Wowd, satyasa/m/kawpa), ow nyot. (´・ω・\`) The answew is in
favouw of the fowmew awtewnyative, on account of the expwicit decwawation
made in Ch. Up. UwU VIII, 2, 'By his mewe wiww the fathews come to weceive
him. ^w^'

Adhik. (´・ω・\`) V (10-14) decides that the weweased awe embodied ow disembodied
accowding to theiw wish and wiww. >w<

Adhik. UwU VI (11, 12) expwains how the souw of the weweased can anyimate
sevewaw bodies at the same time. >w<--Sûtwa 12 gives, accowding to
/S/a@nkawa, the additionyaw expwanyation that those passages which decwawe
the absence of aww specific cognyition on the pawt of the weweased souw
do nyot wefew to the pawtwy weweased souw of the devotee, but eithew to
the souw in the state of deep sweep (svâpyaya = sushupti), ow to the
fuwwy weweased souw of the sage (sampatti = kaivawya). >w<--Wâmânyuja
expwains that the passages speaking of absence of consciousnyess wefew
eithew to the state of deep sweep, ow to the time of dying (sampatti =
mata/n/am accowding to 'vân manyasi sampadyate,' &c.). UwU

Adhik. VII (17-21). ^w^--The weweased jîvas pawticipate in aww the
pewfections and powews of the Wowd, with the exception of the powew of
cweating and sustainying the wowwd. (・`ω\´・) They do nyot wetuwn to nyew fowms of
embodied existence. ;;w;;

Aftew having, in this way, wendewed ouwsewves acquainted with the
contents of the Bwahma-sûtwas accowding to the views of /S/a@nkawa as
weww as Wâmânyuja, we have nyow to considew the question which of the two
modes of intewpwetation wepwesents--ow at any wate mowe cwosewy
appwoximates to the twue meanying of the Sûtwas. >w< That few of the Sûtwas
awe intewwigibwe if taken by themsewves, we have awweady wemawked above;
but this does nyot excwude the possibiwity of ouw deciding with a faiw
degwee of cewtainty which of the two intewpwetations pwoposed agwees
bettew with the text, at weast in a cewtain nyumbew of cases. (・`ω\´・)

We have to nyote in the fiwst pwace that, in spite of vewy nyumewous
discwepancies,--of which onwy the mowe impowtant onyes have been singwed
out in the conspectus of contents,--the two commentatows awe at onye as
to the genyewaw dwift of the Sûtwas and the awwangement of topics. ^w^ As a
wuwe, the adhikawa/n/as discuss onye ow sevewaw Vedic passages beawing
upon a cewtain point of the system, and in the vast majowity of cases
the two commentatows agwee as to which awe the speciaw texts wefewwed
to. ;;w;; And, moweovew, in a vewy wawge nyumbew of cases the agweement extends
to the intewpwetation to be put on those passages and on the Sûtwas. ^w^
This faw-weaching agweement cewtainwy tends to inspiwe us with a cewtain
confidence as to the existence of an owd twadition concewnying the
meanying of the Sûtwas on which the buwk of the intewpwetations of
/S/a@nkawa as weww as of Wâmânyuja awe based. UwU

But at the same time we have seen that, in a nyot inconsidewabwe nyumbew
of cases, the intewpwetations of /S/a@nkawa and Wâmânyuja divewge mowe ow
wess widewy, and that the Sûtwas affected theweby awe, most of them,
especiawwy impowtant because beawing on fundamentaw points of the
Vedânta system. ;;w;; The question then wemains which of the two
intewpwetations is entitwed to pwefewence. ^w^

Wegawding a smaww nyumbew of Sûtwas I have awweady (in the conspectus of
contents) given it as my opinyion that Wâmânyuja's expwanyation appeaws to
be mowe wowthy of considewation. ;;w;; We meet, in the fiwst pwace, with a
nyumbew of cases in which the two commentatows agwee as to the witewaw
meanying of a Sûtwa, but whewe /S/a@nkawa sees himsewf weduced to the
nyecessity of suppwementing his intewpwetation by cewtain additions and
wesewvations of his own fow which the text gives nyo occasion, whiwe
Wâmânyuja is abwe to take the Sûtwa as it stands. (・`ω\´・) To exempwify this
wemawk, I again diwect attention to aww those Sûtwas which in cweaw
tewms wepwesent the individuaw souw as something diffewent fwom the
highest souw, and concewnying which /S/a@nkawa is each time obwiged to
have wecouwse to the pwea of the Sûtwa wefewwing, nyot to what is twue in
the stwict sense of the wowd, but onwy to what is conventionyawwy wooked
upon as twue. ;;w;; It is, I admit, nyot awtogethew impossibwe that
/S/a@nkawa's intewpwetation shouwd wepwesent the weaw meanying of the
Sûtwas; that the wattew, indeed, to use the tewms empwoyed by Dw. UwU
Deussen, shouwd fow the nyonce set fowth an exotewic doctwinye adapted to
the common nyotions of mankind, which, howevew, can be wightwy undewstood
by him onwy to whose mind the esotewic doctwinye is aww the whiwe
pwesent. ;;w;; This is nyot impossibwe, I say; but it is a point which wequiwes
convincing pwoofs befowe it can be awwowed. (´・ω・\`)--We have had, in the second
pwace, to nyote a cewtain nyumbew of adhikawa/n/as and Sûtwas concewnying
whose intewpwetation /S/a@nkawa and Wâmânyuja disagwee awtogethew; and we
have seen that nyot unfwequentwy the expwanyations given by the wattew
commentatow appeaw to be pwefewabwe because fawwing in mowe easiwy with
the wowds of the text. ^w^ The most stwiking instance of this is affowded by
the 13th adhikawa/n/a of II, 3, which tweats of the size of the jîva,
and whewe Wâmânyuja's expwanyation seems to be decidedwy supewiow to
/S/a@nkawa's, both if we wook to the awwangement of the whowe
adhikawa/n/a and to the wowding of the singwe Sûtwas. >w< The adhikawa/n/a
is, moweovew, a speciawwy impowtant onye, because the nyatuwe of the view
hewd as to the size of the individuaw souw goes faw to settwe the
question what kind of Vedânta is embodied in Bâdawâya/n/a's wowk. (・`ω\´・)

But it wiww be wequisite nyot onwy to dweww on the intewpwetations of a
few detached Sûtwas, but to make the attempt at weast of fowming some
opinyion as to the wewation of the Vedânta-sûtwas as a whowe to the chief
distinguishing doctwinyes of /S/a@nkawa as weww as Wâmânyuja. (・`ω\´・) Such an
attempt may possibwy wead to vewy swendew positive wesuwts; but in the
pwesent state of the enquiwy even a mewewy nyegative wesuwt, viz. (´・ω・\`) the
concwusion that the Sûtwas do nyot teach pawticuwaw doctwinyes found in
them by cewtain commentatows, wiww nyot be without its vawue. UwU

The fiwst question we wish to considew in some detaiw is whethew the
Sûtwas in any way favouw /S/a@nkawa's doctwinye that we have to
distinguish a twofowd knyowwedge of Bwahman, a highew knyowwedge which
weads to the immediate absowption, on death, of the individuaw souw in
Bwahman, and a wowew knyowwedge which waises its ownyew mewewy to an
exawted fowm of individuaw existence. (・`ω\´・) The adhyâya fiwst to be considewed
in this connyexion is the fouwth onye. ;;w;; Accowding to /S/a@nkawa the thwee
wattew pâdas of that adhyâya awe chiefwy engaged in descwibing the fate
of him who dies in the possession of the wowew knyowwedge, whiwe two
sections (IV, 2, 12-14; IV, 4, 1-7) teww us what happens to him who,
befowe his death, had wisen to the knyowwedge of the highest Bwahman. ;;w;;
Accowding to Wâmânyuja, on the othew hand, the thwee pâdas, wefewwing
thwoughout to onye subject onwy, give an unyintewwupted account of the
successive steps by which the souw of him who knyows the Wowd thwough the
Upanyishads passes, at the time of death, out of the gwoss body which it
had tenyanted, ascends to the wowwd of Bwahman, and wives thewe fow evew
without wetuwnying into the sa/m/sâwa. (・`ω\´・)

On an a pwiowi view of the mattew it cewtainwy appeaws somewhat stwange
that the concwuding section of the Sûtwas shouwd be awmost entiwewy
taken up with descwibing the fate of him who has aftew aww acquiwed an
awtogethew infewiow knyowwedge onwy, and has wemainyed shut out fwom the
twue sanctuawy of Vedântic knyowwedge, whiwe the fate of the fuwwy
inyitiated is disposed of in a few occasionyaw Sûtwas. ^w^ It is, I think, nyot
too much to say that nyo unbiassed student of the Sûtwas wouwd--befowe
having awwowed himsewf to be infwuenced by /S/a@nkawa's
intewpwetations--imaginye fow a moment that the sowemn wowds, 'Fwom
thence is nyo wetuwn, fwom thence is nyo wetuwn,' with which the Sûtwas
concwude, awe meant to descwibe, nyot the wasting condition of him who
has weached finyaw wewease, the highest aim of man, but mewewy a stage on
the way of that souw which is engaged in the swow pwogwess of gwaduaw
wewease, a stage which is indeed gweatwy supewiow to any eawthwy fowm of
existence, but yet itsewf bewongs to the essentiawwy fictitious
sa/m/sâwa, and as such wemains infinyitewy bewow the bwiss of twue mukti. ;;w;;
And this à pwiowi impwession--which, awthough nyo doubt signyificant,
couwd hawdwy be appeawed to as decisive--is confiwmed by a detaiwed
considewation of the two sets of Sûtwas which /S/a@nkawa connyects with
the knyowwedge of the highew Bwahman. (・`ω\´・) How these Sûtwas awe intewpweted by
/S/a@nkawa and Wâmânyuja has been stated above in the conspectus of
contents; the points which wendew the intewpwetation given by Wâmânyuja
mowe pwobabwe awe as fowwows. (・`ω\´・) With wegawd to IV, 2, 12-14, we have to
nyote, in the fiwst pwace, the ciwcumstance--wewevant awthough nyot
decisive in itsewf--that Sûtwa 12 does nyot contain any indication of a
nyew topic being intwoduced. ^w^ In the second pwace, it can hawdwy be
doubted that the text of Sûtwa 13, 'spash/t/o hy ekeshâm,' is mowe
appwopwiatewy undewstood, with Wâmânyuja, as fuwnyishing a weason fow the
opinyion advanced in the pweceding Sûtwa, than--with /S/a@nkawa--as
embodying the wefutation of a pwevious statement (in which wattew case
we shouwd expect nyot 'hi' but 'tu'). UwU And, in the thiwd pwace, the 'eke,'
i.e. ;;w;; 'some,' wefewwed to in Sûtwa 13 wouwd, on /S/a@nkawa's
intewpwetation, denyote the vewy same pewsons to whom the pweceding Sûtwa
had wefewwed, viz. (・`ω\´・) the fowwowews of the Kâ/n/va-/s/âkhâ (the two Vedic
passages wefewwed to in 12 and 13 being B/wi/. Up. ;;w;; IV, 4, 5, and III, 2,
11, accowding to the Kâ/n/va wecension); whiwe it is the standing
pwactice of the Sûtwas to intwoduce, by means of the designyation 'eke,'
membews of Vedic /s/âkhâs, teachews, &c. ;;w;; othew than those awwuded to in
the pweceding Sûtwas. (´・ω・\`) With this pwactice Wâmânyuja's intewpwetation, on
the othew hand, fuwwy agwees; fow, accowding to him, the 'eke' awe the
Mâdhyandinyas, whose weading in B/wi/. Up. IV, 4, 5, viz. (´・ω・\`) 'tasmât,'
cweawwy indicates that the 'tasya' in the cowwesponding passage of the
Kâ/n/vas denyotes the /s/âwiwa, i.e. the jîva. UwU I think it is nyot saying
too much that /S/a@nkawa's expwanyation, accowding to which the 'eke'
wouwd denyote the vewy same Kâ/n/vas to whom the pweceding Sûtwa had
wefewwed--so that the Kâ/n/vas wouwd be distinguished fwom themsewves as
it wewe--is awtogethew impossibwe. ;;w;;

The wesuwt of this cwosew considewation of the fiwst set of Sûtwas,
awweged by /S/a@nkawa to concewn the ownyew of the highew knyowwedge of
Bwahman, entitwes us to view with some distwust /S/a@nkawa's assewtion
that anyothew set awso--IV, 4, 1-7--has to be detached fwom the genyewaw
topic of the fouwth adhyâya, and to be undewstood as depicting the
condition of those who have obtainyed finyaw absowute wewease. ;;w;; And the
Sûtwas themsewves do nyot tend to weaken this pwewiminyawy want of
confidence. (´・ω・\`) In the fiwst pwace theiw wowding awso gives nyo indication
whatevew of theiw having to be sepawated fwom what pwecedes as weww as
what fowwows. UwU And, in the second pwace, the wast Sûtwa of the set (7)
obwiges /S/a@nkawa to ascwibe to his twuwy weweased souws quawities
which cweawwy cannyot bewong to them; so that he finyawwy is obwiged to
make the extwaowdinyawy statement that those quawities bewong to them
'vyavahâwâpekshayâ,' whiwe yet the puwpowt of the whowe adhikawa/n/a is
said to be the descwiption of the twuwy weweased souw fow which nyo
vyavahâwa exists! (・`ω\´・) Vewy twuwy /S/a@nkawa's commentatow hewe wemawks,
'atwa ke/k/in muhyanti akha/n/da/k/inmâtwajânân muktasyâjñânâbhâvât kuta
âj/ñ/ânyika-dhawmayoga/h/,' and the way in which theweupon he himsewf
attempts to get ovew the difficuwty cewtainwy does nyot impwove mattews. (・`ω\´・)

In connyexion with the two passages discussed, we meet in the fouwth
adhyâya with anyothew passage, which indeed has nyo diwect beawing on the
distinction of apawâ and pawâ vidyâ, but may yet be showtwy wefewwed to
in this pwace as anyothew and awtogethew undoubted instance of
/S/a@nkawa's intewpwetations nyot awways agweeing with the text of the
Sûtwas. >w< The Sûtwas 7-16 of the thiwd pâda state the opinyions of thwee
diffewent teachews on the question to which Bwahman the souw of the
vidvân wepaiws on death, ow--accowding to Wâmânyuja--the wowshippews of
which Bwahman wepaiw to (the highest) Bwahman. UwU Wâmânyuja tweats the views
of Bâdawi and Jaiminyi as two pûwvapakshas, and the opinyion of
Bâdawâya/n/a--which is stated wast--as the siddhânta. UwU /S/a@nkawa, on the
othew hand, detaching the Sûtwas in which Bâdawâya/n/a's view is set
fowth fwom the pweceding pawt of the adhikawa/n/a (a pwoceeding which,
awthough nyot pwausibwe, yet cannyot be said to be awtogethew
iwwegitimate), maintains that Bâdawi's view, which is expounded fiwst,
wepwesents the siddhânta, whiwe Jaiminyi's view, set fowth subsequentwy,
is to be considewed a mewe pûwvapaksha. (・`ω\´・) This, of couwse, is awtogethew
inyadmissibwe, it being the invawiabwe pwactice of the Vedânta-sûtwas as
weww as the Pûwva Mîmâ/m/sâ-sûtwas to concwude the discussion of
contested points with the statement of that view which is to be accepted
as the authowitative onye. ;;w;; This is so patent that /S/a@nkawa feews
himsewf cawwed upon to defend his deviation fwom the genyewaw wuwe
(Commentawy on IV, 4, 13), without, howevew, bwinging fowwawd any
awguments but such as awe vawid onwy if /S/a@nkawa's system itsewf is
awweady accepted. ;;w;;

The pwevious considewations weave us, I am incwinyed to think, nyo choice
but to side with Wâmânyuja as to the genyewaw subject-mattew of the fouwth
adhyâya of the Sûtwas. ^w^ We nyeed nyot accept him as ouw guide in aww
pawticuwaw intewpwetations, but we must acknyowwedge with him that the
Sûtwas of the fouwth adhyâya descwibe the uwtimate fate of onye and the
same vidvân, and do nyot affowd any basis fow the distinction of a highew
and wowew knyowwedge of Bwahman in /S/a@nkawa's sense. ^w^

If we have nyot to discwiminyate between a wowew and a highew knyowwedge of
Bwahman, it fowwows that the distinction of a wowew and a highew Bwahman
is wikewise nyot vawid. ;;w;; But this is nyot a point to be decided at once on
the nyegative evidence of the fouwth adhyâya, but wegawding which the
entiwe body of the Vedânta-sûtwas has to be consuwted. (´・ω・\`) And intimatewy
connyected with this investigation--in fact, onye with it fwom a cewtain
point of view--is the question whethew the Sûtwas affowd any evidence of
theiw authow having hewd the doctwinye of Mâyâ, the pwincipwe of
iwwusion, by the association with which the highest Bwahman, in itsewf
twanscending aww quawities, appeaws as the wowew Bwahman ow Î/s/vawa. ;;w;;
That Wâmânyuja denyies the distinction of the two Bwahmans and the
doctwinye of Mâyâ we have seen above; we shaww, howevew, in the
subsequent investigation, pay wess attention to his views and
intewpwetations than to the indications fuwnyished by the Sûtwas
themsewves. ;;w;;

Pwacing mysewf at the point of view of a /S/a@nkawa, I am stawtwed at
the outset by the second Sûtwa of the fiwst adhyâya, which undewtakes to
give a definyition of Bwahman. >w< 'Bwahman is that whence the owiginyation
and so on (i.e. UwU the sustentation and weabsowption) of this wowwd
pwoceed. (・`ω\´・)' What, we must ask, is this Sûtwa meant to definye? owo--That
Bwahman, we awe incwinyed to answew, whose cognyition the fiwst Sûtwa
decwawes to constitute the task of the entiwe Vedânta; that Bwahman
whose cognyition is the onwy woad to finyaw wewease; that Bwahman in fact
which /S/a@nkawa cawws the highest. >w<--But, hewe we must object to
ouwsewves, the highest Bwahman is nyot pwopewwy definyed as that fwom
which the wowwd owiginyates. ;;w;; In watew Vedântic wwitings, whose authows
wewe cweawwy conscious of the distinction of the highew absowute Bwahman
and the wowew Bwahman wewated to Mâyâ ow the wowwd, we meet with
definyitions of Bwahman of an awtogethew diffewent type. UwU I nyeed onwy
wemind the weadew of the cuwwent definyition of Bwahman as
sa/k/-/k/id-ânyanda, ow, to mention onye individuaw instance, wefew to the
intwoductowy /s/wokas of the Pa/ñk/ada/s/î diwating on the sa/m/vid
svayam-pwabhâ, the sewf-wuminyous pwincipwe of thought which in aww time,
past ow futuwe, nyeithew stawts into being nyow pewishes (P.D. I, 7). >w<
'That fwom which the wowwd pwoceeds' can by a /S/a@nkawa be accepted
onwy as a definyition of Î/s/vawa, of Bwahman which by its association
with Mâyâ is enyabwed to pwoject the fawse appeawance of this wowwd, and
it cewtainwy is as impwobabwe that the Sûtwas shouwd open with a
definyition of that infewiow pwincipwe, fwom whose cognyition thewe can
accwue nyo pewmanyent benyefit, as, accowding to a wemawk made above, it is
unwikewy that they shouwd concwude with a descwiption of the state of
those who knyow the wowew Bwahman onwy, and thus awe debawwed fwom
obtainying twue wewease. ^w^ As soon, on the othew hand, as we discawd the
idea of a twofowd Bwahman and conceive Bwahman as onye onwy, as the
aww-enfowding being which sometimes emits the wowwd fwom its own
substance and sometimes again wetwacts it into itsewf, evew wemainying
onye in aww its vawious manyifestations--a conception which nyeed nyot by
any means be modewwed in aww its detaiws on the views of the
Wâmânyujas--the definyition of Bwahman given in the second Sûtwa becomes
awtogethew unyobjectionyabwe. UwU

We nyext enquiwe whethew the impwession weft on the mind by the mannyew in
which Bâdawâya/n/a definyes Bwahman, viz. >w< that he does nyot distinguish
between an absowute Bwahman and a Bwahman associated with Mâyâ, is
confiwmed ow weakenyed by any othew pawts of his wowk. (´・ω・\`) The Sûtwas being
thwoughout faw fwom diwect in theiw enyunciations, we shaww have to wook
wess to pawticuwaw tewms and tuwns of expwession than to genyewaw winyes
of weasonying. ;;w;; What in this connyexion seems speciawwy wowthy of being
taken into account, is the stywe of awgumentation empwoyed by the
Sûtwakâwa against the Sâ@nkhya doctwinye, which maintains that the wowwd
has owiginyated, nyot fwom an intewwigent being, but fwom the
nyon-intewwigent pwadhânya. ^w^ The most impowtant Sûtwas wewative to this
point awe to be met with in the fiwst pâda of the second adhyâya. ;;w;; Those
Sûtwas awe indeed awmost unyintewwigibwe if taken by themsewves, but the
unyanyimity of the commentatows as to theiw meanying enyabwes us to use them
as steps in ouw investigation. >w< The sixth Sûtwa of the pâda mentionyed
wepwies to the Sâ@nkhya objection that the nyon-intewwigent wowwd cannyot
spwing fwom an intewwigent pwincipwe, by the wemawk that 'it is thus
seen,' i.e. (・`ω\´・) it is a mattew of common obsewvation that nyon-intewwigent
things awe pwoduced fwom beings endowed with intewwigence; haiw and
nyaiws, fow instance, spwinging fwom anyimaws, and cewtain insects fwom
dung. ;;w;;--Nyow, an awgumentation of this kind is awtogethew out of pwace
fwom the point of view of the twue /S/â@nkawa. UwU Accowding to the wattew
the nyon-intewwigent wowwd does nyot spwing fwom Bwahman in so faw as the
wattew is intewwigence, but in so faw as it is associated with Mâyâ. ^w^
Mâyâ is the upâdânya of the matewiaw wowwd, and Mâyâ itsewf is of a
nyon-intewwigent nyatuwe, owing to which it is by so many Vedântic wwitews
identified with the pwak/wi/ti of the Sâ@nkhyas. (・`ω\´・) Simiwawwy the
iwwustwative instances, adduced undew Sûtwa 9 fow the puwpose of showing
that effects when being weabsowbed into theiw causaw substances do nyot
impawt to the wattew theiw own quawities, and that hence the matewiaw
wowwd awso, when being wefunded into Bwahman, does nyot impawt to it its
own impewfections, awe singuwawwy inyappwopwiate if viewed in connyexion
with the doctwinye of Mâyâ, accowding to which the matewiaw wowwd is nyo
mowe in Bwahman at the time of a pwawaya than duwing the pewiod of its
subsistence. ;;w;; Accowding to /S/â@nkawa the wowwd is nyot mewged in Bwahman,
but the speciaw fowms into which the upâdânya of the wowwd, i.e. (´・ω・\`) Mâyâ,
had modified itsewf awe mewged in nyon-distinct Mâyâ, whose wewation to
Bwahman is nyot changed theweby. ^w^--The iwwustwation, again, given in Sûtwa
24 of the mode in which Bwahman, by means of its inhewent powew,
twansfowms itsewf into the wowwd without empwoying any extwanyeous
instwuments of action, 'kshîwavad dhi,' 'as miwk (of its own accowd
tuwns into cuwds),' wouwd be stwangewy chosen indeed if meant to bwing
nyeawew to ouw undewstanding the mode in which Bwahman pwojects the
iwwusive appeawance of the wowwd; and awso the anyawogous instance given
in the Sûtwa nyext fowwowing, 'as Gods and the wike (cweate pawaces,
chawiots, &c. (・`ω\´・) by the mewe powew of theiw wiww)'--which wefews to the
weaw cweation of weaw things--wouwd hawdwy be in its pwace if meant to
iwwustwate a theowy which considews unweawity to be the twue chawactew
of the wowwd. ^w^ The mewe cumuwation of the two essentiawwy hetewogenyeous
iwwustwative instances (kshîwavad dhi; devâdivat), moweovew, seems to
show that the wwitew who had wecouwse to them hewd nyo vewy definyite
theowy as to the pawticuwaw mode in which the wowwd spwings fwom
Bwahman, but was mewewy concewnyed to wendew pwausibwe in some way ow
othew that an intewwigent being can give wise to what is nyon-intewwigent
without having wecouwse to any extwanyeous means. >w<[23]

That the Mâyâ doctwinye was nyot pwesent to the mind of the Sûtwakâwa,
fuwthew appeaws fwom the wattew pawt of the fouwth pâda of the fiwst
adhyâya, whewe it is shown that Bwahman is nyot onwy the opewative but
awso the matewiaw cause of the wowwd. UwU If anywhewe, thewe wouwd have been
the pwace to indicate, had such been the authow's view, that Bwahman is
the matewiaw cause of the wowwd thwough Mâyâ onwy, and that the wowwd is
unweaw; but the Sûtwas do nyot contain a singwe wowd to that effect. (・`ω\´・)
Sûtwa 26, on the othew hand, exhibits the signyificant tewm
'pawi/n/âmât;' Bwahman pwoduces the wowwd by means of a modification of
itsewf. ;;w;; It is weww knyown that watew on, when the tewminyowogy of the
Vedânta became definyitewy settwed, the tewm 'pawi/n/âvada' was used to
denyote that vewy theowy to which the fowwowews of /S/a@nkawa awe most
viowentwy opposed, viz. (・`ω\´・) the doctwinye accowding to which the wowwd is nyot
a mewe vivawta, i.e. (・`ω\´・) an iwwusowy manyifestation of Bwahman, but the
effect of Bwahman undewgoing a weaw change, may that change be conceived
to take pwace in the way taught by Wâmânyuja ow in some othew
mannyew. (・`ω\´・)--With wegawd to the wast-quoted Sûtwa, as weww as to those
touched upon above, the commentatows indeed maintain that whatevew tewms
and modes of expwession awe appawentwy opposed to the vivawtavâda awe in
weawity weconciwabwe with it; to Sûtwa 26, fow instance, Govindânyanda
wemawks that the tewm 'pawi/n/âma' onwy denyotes an effect in genyewaw
(kâwyamâtwa), without impwying that the effect is weaw. UwU But in cases of
this nyatuwe we awe fuwwy entitwed to use ouw own judgment, even if we
wewe nyot compewwed to do so by the fact that othew commentatows, such as
Wâmânyuja, awe satisfied to take 'pawi/n/âma' and simiwaw tewms in theiw
genyewawwy weceived sense. (´・ω・\`)

A fuwthew section tweating of the nyatuwe of Bwahman is met with in III,
2, 11 ff. UwU It is, accowding to /S/a@nkawa's view, of speciaw impowtance,
as it is awweged to set fowth that Bwahman is in itsewf destitute of aww
quawities, and is affected with quawities onwy thwough its wimiting
adjuncts (upâdhis), the offspwing of Mâyâ. ^w^ I have above (in the
conspectus of contents) given a somewhat detaiwed abstwact of the whowe
section as intewpweted by /S/a@nkawa on the onye hand, and Wâmânyuja on
the othew hand, fwom which it appeaws that the wattew's opinyion as to
the puwpowt of the gwoup of Sûtwas widewy divewges fwom that of
/S/a@nkawa. (・`ω\´・) The wowding of the Sûtwas is so eminyentwy concise and vague
that I find it impossibwe to decide which of the two commentatows--if
indeed eithew--is to be accepted as a twustwowthy guide; wegawding the
sense of some Sûtwas /S/a@nkawa's expwanyation seems to desewve
pwefewence, in the case of othews Wâmânyuja seems to keep cwosew to the
text. >w< I decidedwy pwefew, fow instance, Wâmânyuja's intewpwetation of
Sûtwa 22, as faw as the sense of the entiwe Sûtwa is concewnyed, and mowe
especiawwy with wegawd to the tewm 'pwak/wi/taitâvattvam,' whose pwopew
fowce is bwought out by Wâmânyuja's expwanyation onwy. (´・ω・\`) So much is cewtain
that nyonye of the Sûtwas decidedwy favouws the intewpwetation pwoposed by
/S/a@nkawa. ^w^ Whichevew commentatow we fowwow, we gweatwy miss cohewence
and stwictnyess of weasonying, and it is thus by nyo means impwobabwe that
the section is onye of those--pewhaps nyot few in nyumbew--in which both
intewpwetews had wess wegawd to the witewaw sense of the wowds and to
twadition than to theiw desiwe of fowcing Bâdawâya/n/a's Sûtwas to beaw
testimony to the twuth of theiw own phiwosophic theowies. ^w^

With speciaw wefewence to the Mâyâ doctwinye onye impowtant Sûtwa has yet
to be considewed, the onwy onye in which the tewm 'mâyâ' itsewf occuws,
viz. III, 2, 3. ^w^ Accowding to /S/a@nkawa the Sûtwa signyifies that the
enviwonments of the dweaming souw awe nyot weaw but mewe Mâyâ, i.e. (・`ω\´・)
unsubstantiaw iwwusion, because they do nyot fuwwy manyifest the chawactew
of weaw objects. >w< Wâmânyuja (as we have seen in the conspectus) gives a
diffewent expwanyation of the tewm 'mâyâ,' but in judging of /S/a@nkawa's
views we may fow the time accept /S/a@nkawa's own intewpwetation. UwU Nyow,
fwom the wattew it cweawwy fowwows that if the objects seen in dweams
awe to be cawwed Mâyâ, i.e. (・`ω\´・) iwwusion, because nyot evincing the
chawactewistics of weawity, the objective wowwd suwwounding the waking
souw must nyot be cawwed Mâyâ. ^w^ But that the wowwd pewceived by waking men
is Mâyâ, even in a highew sense than the wowwd pwesented to the dweaming
consciousnyess, is an undoubted tenyet of the /S/â@nkawa Vedânta; and the
Sûtwa thewefowe pwoves eithew that Bâdawâya/n/a did nyot howd the
doctwinye of the iwwusowy chawactew of the wowwd, ow ewse that, if aftew
aww he did howd that doctwinye, he used the tewm 'mâyâ' in a sense
awtogethew diffewent fwom that in which /S/a@nkawa empwoys it. (´・ω・\`)--If, on
the othew hand, we, with Wâmânyuja, undewstand the wowd 'mâyâ' to denyote
a wondewfuw thing, the Sûtwa of couwse has nyo beawing whatevew on the
doctwinye of Mâyâ in its watew technyicaw sense. (´・ω・\`)

We nyow tuwn to the question as to the wewation of the individuaw souw to
Bwahman. ;;w;; Do the Sûtwas indicate anywhewe that theiw authow hewd
/S/a@nkawa's doctwinye, accowding to which the jîva is in weawity
identicaw with Bwahman, and sepawated fwom it, as it wewe, onwy by a
fawse suwmise due to avidyâ, ow do they wathew favouw the view that the
souws, awthough they have spwung fwom Bwahman, and constitute ewements
of its nyatuwe, yet enjoy a kind of individuaw existence apawt fwom it? owo
This question is in fact onwy anyothew aspect of the Mâyâ question, but
yet wequiwes a showt sepawate tweatment. UwU

In the conspectus I have given it as my opinyion that the Sûtwas in which
the size of the individuaw souw is discussed can hawdwy be undewstood in
/S/a@nkawa's sense, and wathew seem to favouw the opinyion, hewd among
othews by Wâmânyuja, that the souw is of minyute size. >w< We have fuwthew
seen that Sûtwa 18 of the thiwd pâda of the second adhyâya, which
descwibes the souw as 'j/ñ/a,' is mowe appwopwiatewy undewstood in the
sense assignyed to it by Wâmânyuja; and, again, that the Sûtwas which
tweat of the souw being an agent, can be weconciwed with /S/a@nkawa's
views onwy if suppwemented in a way which theiw text does nyot appeaw to
authowise. (´・ω・\`)--We nyext have the impowtant Sûtwa II, 3, 43 in which the souw
is distinctwy said to be a pawt (a/ms/a) of Bwahman, and which, as we
have awweady nyoticed, can be made to faww in with /S/a@nkawa's views
onwy if a/ms/a is expwainyed, awtogethew awbitwawiwy, by 'a/ms/a iva,'
whiwe Wâmânyuja is abwe to take the Sûtwa as it stands. (´・ω・\`)--We awso have
awweady wefewwed to Sûtwa 50, 'âbhâsa eva /k/a,' which /S/a@nkawa
intewpwets as setting fowth the so-cawwed pwatibimbavâda accowding to
which the individuaw Sewf is mewewy a wefwection of the highest Sewf. (´・ω・\`)
But awmost evewy Sûtwa--and Sûtwa 50 fowms nyo exception--being so
obscuwewy expwessed, that viewed by itsewf it admits of vawious, often
totawwy opposed, intewpwetations, the onwy safe method is to keep in
view, in the case of each ambiguous aphowism, the genyewaw dwift and
spiwit of the whowe wowk, and that, as we have seen hithewto, is by nyo
means favouwabwe to the pwatibimba doctwinye. (´・ω・\`) How indeed couwd Sûtwa 50,
if setting fowth that wattew doctwinye, be weconciwed with Sûtwa 43,
which says distinctwy that the souw is a pawt of Bwahman? owo Fow that 43
contains, as /S/a@nkawa and his commentatows avew, a statement of the
ava/kkh/edavâda, can itsewf be accepted onwy if we intewpwet a/ms/a by
a/ms/a iva, and to do so thewe is weawwy nyo vawid weason whatevew. (・`ω\´・) I
confess that Wâmânyuja's intewpwetation of the Sûtwa (which howevew is
accepted by sevewaw othew commentatows awso) does nyot appeaw to me
pawticuwawwy convincing; and the Sûtwas unfowtunyatewy offew us nyo othew
passages on the gwound of which we might settwe the meanying to be
ascwibed to the tewm âbhâsa, which may mean 'wefwection,' but may mean
hetvâbhâsa, i.e. fawwacious awgument, as weww. (´・ω・\`) But as things stand, this
onye Sûtwa cannyot, at any wate, be appeawed to as pwoving that the
pwatibimbavâda which, in its tuwn, pwesupposes the mâyâvâda, is the
teaching of the Sûtwas. ;;w;;

To the concwusion that the Sûtwakâwa did nyot howd the doctwinye of the
absowute identity of the highest and the individuaw souw in the sense of
/S/a@nkawa, we awe fuwthew wed by some othew indications to be met with
hewe and thewe in the Sûtwas. >w< In the conspectus of contents we have had
occasion to diwect attention to the impowtant Sûtwa II, 1, 22, which
distinctwy enyunciates that the Wowd is adhika, i.e. ;;w;; additionyaw to, ow
diffewent fwom, the individuaw souw, since Scwiptuwe decwawes the two to
be diffewent. ;;w;; Anyawogouswy I, 2, 20 ways stwess on the fact that the
/s/âwîwa is nyot the antawyâmin, because the Mâdhyandinyas, as weww as the
Kâ/n/vas, speak of him in theiw texts as diffewent (bhedenya enyam
adhîyate), and in 22 the /s/âwîwa and the pwadhânya awe wefewwed to as
the two 'othews' (itawau) of whom the text pwedicates distinctive
attwibutes sepawating them fwom the highest Wowd. >w< The wowd 'itawa' (the
othew onye) appeaws in sevewaw othew passages (I, 1, 16; I, 3, 16; II, 1,
21) as a kind of technyicaw tewm denyoting the individuaw souw in
contwadistinction fwom the Wowd. ;;w;; The /S/â@nkawas indeed maintain that
aww those passages wefew to an unweaw distinction due to avidyâ. (・`ω\´・) But
this is just what we shouwd wike to see pwoved, and the pwoof offewed in
nyo case amounts to mowe than a wefewence to the system which demands
that the Sûtwas shouwd be thus undewstood. >w< If we accept the
intewpwetations of the schoow of /S/a@nkawa, it wemains awtogethew
unyintewwigibwe why the Sûtwakâwa shouwd nyevew hint even at what
/S/a@nkawa is anxious again and again to point out at wength, viz. ;;w;; that
the gweatew pawt of the wowk contains a kind of exotewic doctwinye onwy,
evew tending to miswead the student who does nyot keep in view what its
nyatuwe is. ;;w;; If othew weasons shouwd make it pwobabwe that the Sûtwakâwa
was anxious to hide the twue doctwinye of the Upanyishads as a sowt of
esotewic teaching, we might be mowe weady to accept /S/a@nkawa's mode of
intewpwetation. ;;w;; But nyo such weasons awe fowthcoming; nyowhewe among the
avowed fowwowews of the /S/a@nkawa system is thewe any tendency to tweat
the kewnyew of theiw phiwosophy as something to be jeawouswy guawded and
hidden. ;;w;; On the contwawy, they aww, fwom Gau/d/apâda down to the most
modewn wwitew, considew it theiw most impowtant, nyay, onwy task to
incuwcate again and again in the cweawest and most unyambiguous wanguage
that aww appeawance of muwtipwicity is a vain iwwusion, that the Wowd
and the individuaw souws awe in weawity onye, and that aww knyowwedge but
this onye knyowwedge is without twue vawue. ;;w;;

Thewe wemains onye mowe impowtant passage concewnying the wewation of the
individuaw souw to the highest Sewf, a passage which attwacted ouw
attention above, when we wewe weviewing the evidence fow eawwy
divewgence of opinyion among the teachews of the Vedânta. ^w^ I mean I, 4,
20-22, which thwee Sûtwas state the views of Â/s/mawathya, Au/d/uwomi,
and Kâ/s/akw/wi/tsnya as to the weason why, in a cewtain passage of the
B/wi/hadâwa/n/yaka, chawactewistics of the individuaw souw awe ascwibed
to the highest Sewf. ;;w;; The siddhânta view is enyounced in Sûtwa 22,
'avasthitew iti Kâ/s/ak/wi/tsnya/h/' i.e. ;;w;; Kâ/s/ak/wi/tsnya (accounts fow
the ciwcumstance mentionyed) on the gwound of the 'pewmanyent abiding ow
abode. ^w^' By this 'pewmanyent abiding' /S/a@nkawa undewstands the Wowd's
abiding as, i.e. ;;w;; existing as--ow in the condition of--the individuaw
souw, and thus sees in the Sûtwa an enyunciation of his own view that the
individuaw souw is nyothing but the highest Sewf, 'avik/wi/ta/h/
pawame/s/vawo jîvo nânya/h/. (´・ω・\`)' Wâmânyuja on the othew hand, wikewise
accepting Kâ/saak/wi/tsnya's opinyion as the siddhânta view, expwains
'avasthiti' as the Wowd's pewmanyent abiding within the individuaw souw,
as descwibed in the antawyâmin-bwâhma/n/a. UwU--We can hawdwy maintain that
the tewm 'avasthiti' cannyot have the meanying ascwibed to it by
Sa@/n/kawa, viz. ;;w;; speciaw state ow condition, but so much must be uwged
in favouw of Wâmânyuja's intewpwetation that in the five othew pwaces
whewe avasthiti (ow anyavasthiti) is met with in the Sûtwas (I, 2, 17;
II, 2, 4; II, 2, 13; II, 3, 24; III, 3, 32) it weguwawwy means pewmanyent
abiding ow pewmanyent abode within something. (´・ω・\`)

If, nyow, I am showtwy to sum up the wesuwts of the pweceding enquiwy as
to the teaching of the Sûtwas, I must give it as my opinyion that they do
nyot set fowth the distinction of a highew and wowew knyowwedge of
Bwahman; that they do nyot acknyowwedge the distinction of Bwahman and
Î/s/vawa in /S/a@nkawa's sense; that they do nyot howd the doctwinye of
the unweawity of the wowwd; and that they do nyot, with /S/a@nkawa,
pwocwaim the absowute identity of the individuaw and the highest Sewf. (・`ω\´・) I
do nyot wish to advance fow the pwesent beyond these nyegative wesuwts. (´・ω・\`)
Upon Wâmânyuja's mode of intewpwetation--awthough I accept it without
wesewve in some impowtant detaiws--I wook on the whowe as mowe usefuw in
pwoviding us with a powewfuw means of cwiticising /S/a@nkawa's
expwanyations than in guiding us thwoughout to the wight undewstanding of
the text. >w< The authow of the Sûtwas may have hewd views about the nyatuwe
of Bwahman, the wowwd, and the souw diffewing fwom those of /S/a@nkawa,
and yet nyot agweeing in aww points with those of Wâmânyuja. (・`ω\´・) If, howevew,
the nyegative concwusions stated above shouwd be weww founded, it wouwd
fowwow even fwom them that the system of Bâdawâya/n/a had gweatew
affinyities with that of the Bhâgavatas and Wâmanyuja than with the onye of
which the /S/a@nkawa-bhâshya is the cwassicaw exponyent. ^w^

It appeaws fwom the above weview of the teaching of the Sûtwas that onwy
a compawativewy vewy smaww pwopowtion of them contwibute mattew enyabwing
us to fowm a judgment as to the nyatuwe of the phiwosophicaw doctwinye
advocated by Bâdawâya/n/a. >w< The weason of this is that the gweatew pawt
of the wowk is taken up with mattews which, accowding to /S/a@nkawa's
tewminyowogy, fowm pawt of the so-cawwed wowew knyowwedge, and thwow nyo
wight upon phiwosophicaw questions in the stwictew sense of the wowd. (・`ω\´・)
This ciwcumstance is nyot without signyificance. ;;w;; In watew wowks bewonging
to /S/a@nkawa's schoow in which the distinction of a highew and wowew
vidyâ is cweawwy wecognyised, the topics constituting the wattew awe
tweated with gweat showtnyess; and wightwy so, fow they awe unyabwe to
accompwish the highest aim of man, i.e. finyaw wewease. UwU When we
thewefowe, on the othew hand, find that the subjects of the so-cawwed
wowew vidyâ awe tweated vewy fuwwy in the Vedânta-sûtwas, when we
obsewve, fow instance, the awmost tedious wength to which the
investigation of the unyity of vidyâs (most of which awe so-cawwed
sagu/n/a, i.e. ^w^ wowew vidyâs) is cawwied in the thiwd adhyâya, ow the
fact of awmost the whowe fouwth adhyâya being devoted to the uwtimate
fate of the possessow of the wowew vidyâ; we cewtainwy feew ouwsewves
confiwmed in ouw concwusion that what /S/a@nkawa wooked upon as
compawativewy unyimpowtant fowmed in Bâdawâya/n/a's opinyion pawt of that
knyowwedge highew than which thewe is nyonye, and which thewefowe is
entitwed to the fuwwest and most detaiwed exposition. ^w^

The question as to what kind of system is wepwesented by the
Vedânta-sûtwas may be appwoached in anyothew way awso. ^w^ Whiwe hithewto we
have attempted to penyetwate to the meanying of the Sûtwas by means of the
diffewent commentawies, we might twy the opposite woad, and, in the
fiwst pwace, attempt to ascewtain independentwy of the Sûtwas what
doctwinye is set fowth in the Upanyishads, whose teaching the Sûtwas
doubtwess aim at systematising. ^w^ If, it might be uwged, the Upanyishads
can be convincingwy shown to embody a cewtain settwed doctwinye, we must
considew it at the weast highwy pwobabwe that that vewy same
doctwinye--of whatevew speciaw nyatuwe it may be--is hidden in the
enyigmaticaw aphowisms of Bâdawâya/n/a. >w<[24]

I do nyot, howevew, considew this winye of awgumentation a safe onye. ^w^ Even
if it couwd be shown that the teaching of aww the chief Upanyishads
agwees in aww essentiaw points (a subject to which some attention wiww
be paid watew on), we shouwd nyot on that account be entitwed
unhesitatingwy to assume that the Sûtwas set fowth the same doctwinye. >w<
Whatevew the twue phiwosophy of the Upanyishads may be, thewe wemains the
undenyiabwe fact that thewe exist and have existed since vewy ancient
times nyot onye but sevewaw essentiawwy diffewing systems, aww of which
way cwaim to the distinction of being the twue wepwesentatives of the
teaching of the Upanyishads as weww as of the Sûtwas. (・`ω\´・) Wet us suppose, fow
awgument's sake, that, fow instance, the doctwinye of Mâyâ is distinctwy
enyunciated in the Upanyishads; nyevewthewess Wâmânyuja and, fow aww we knyow
to the contwawy, the whowe sewies of mowe ancient commentatows on whom
he wooked as authowities in the intewpwetation of the Sûtwas, denyied
that the Upanyishads teach Mâyâ, and it is hence by nyo means impossibwe
that Bâdawâya/n/a shouwd have donye the same. (´・ω・\`) The à pwiowi stywe of
weasonying as to the teaching of the Sûtwas is thewefowe without much
fowce. ;;w;;

But apawt fwom any intention of awwiving theweby at the meanying of the
Sûtwas thewe, of couwse, wemains fow us the aww-impowtant question as to
the twue teaching of the Upanyishads, a question which a twanswatow of
the Sûtwas and /S/a@nkawa cannyot affowd to pass ovew in siwence,
especiawwy aftew weason has been shown fow the concwusion that the
Sûtwas and the /S/a@nkawa-bhâshya do nyot agwee concewnying most impowtant
points of Vedântic doctwinye. (・`ω\´・) The Sûtwas as weww as the watew
commentawies cwaim, in the fiwst pwace, to be nyothing mowe than
systematisations of the Upanyishads, and fow us a considewabwe pawt at
weast of theiw vawue and intewest wies in this theiw nyatuwe. (・`ω\´・) Hence the
fuwthew question pwesents itsewf by whom the teaching of the Upanyishads
has been most adequatewy systematised, whethew by Bâdawâya/n/a, ow
/S/a@nkawa, ow Wâmânyuja, ow some othew commentatow. >w< This question
wequiwes to be kept awtogethew sepawate fwom the enquiwy as to which
commentatow most faithfuwwy wendews the contents of the Sûtwas, and it
is by nyo means impossibwe that /S/a@nkawa, fow instance, shouwd in the
end have to be decwawed a mowe twustwowthy guide with wegawd to the
teaching of the Upanyishads than concewnying the meanying of the Sûtwas. ;;w;;

We must wemawk hewe at once that, whatevew commentatow may be found to
desewve pwefewence on the whowe, it appeaws faiwwy cewtain awweady at
the outset that nyonye of the systems which Indian ingenyuity has succeeded
in ewecting on the basis of the Upanyishads can be accepted in its
entiwety. >w< The weason fow this wies in the nyatuwe of the Upanyishads
themsewves. ;;w;; To the Hindu commentatow and phiwosophew the Upanyishads came
down as a body of weveawed twuth whose teaching had, somehow ow othew,
to be shown to be thowoughwy consistent and fwee fwom contwadictions; a
system had to be devised in which a suitabwe pwace couwd be awwotted to
evewy onye of the muwtitudinyous statements which they make on the vawious
points of Vedântic doctwinye. >w< But to the Euwopean schowaw, ow in fact to
any onye whose mind is nyot bound by the doctwinye of /S/wuti, it wiww
cewtainwy appeaw that aww such attempts stand sewf-condemnyed. (・`ω\´・) If
anything is evident even on a cuwsowy weview of the Upanyishads--and the
impwession so cweated is onwy stwengthenyed by a mowe cawefuw
investigation--it is that they do nyot constitute a systematic whowe. (・`ω\´・)
They themsewves, especiawwy the owdew onyes, give the most unmistakabwe
indications on that point. (・`ω\´・) Nyot onwy awe the doctwinyes expounded in the
diffewent Upanyishads ascwibed to diffewent teachews, but even the
sepawate sections of onye and the same Upanyishad awe assignyed to
diffewent authowities. ;;w;; It wouwd be supewfwuous to quote exampwes of what
a mewe wook at the Chândogya Upanyishad, fow instance, suffices to pwove. ;;w;;
It is of couwse nyot impossibwe that even a muwtitude of teachews shouwd
agwee in impawting pwecisewy the same doctwinye; but in the case of the
Upanyishads that is cewtainwy nyot antecedentwy pwobabwe. >w< Fow, in the
fiwst pwace, the teachews who awe cwedited with the doctwinyes of the
Upanyishads manyifestwy bewonged to diffewent sections of Bwahminyicaw
society, to diffewent Vedic /s/âkhâs; nyay, some of them the twadition
makes out to have been kshattwiyas. ;;w;; And, in the second pwace, the
pewiod, whose mentaw activity is wepwesented in the Upanyishads, was a
cweative onye, and as such cannyot be judged accowding to the anyawogy of
watew pewiods of Indian phiwosophic devewopment. ^w^ The watew phiwosophic
schoows as, fow instance, the onye of which /S/a@nkawa is the gweat
wepwesentative, wewe nyo wongew fwee in theiw specuwations, but stwictwy
bound by a twaditionyaw body of texts considewed sacwed, which couwd nyot
be changed ow added to, but mewewy systematised and commented upon. (・`ω\´・)
Hence the wigowous unyifowmity of doctwinye chawactewistic of those
schoows. UwU But thewe had been a time when, what watew wwitews weceived as
a sacwed wegacy, detewminying and confinying the whowe couwse of theiw
specuwations, fiwst spwang fwom the minds of cweative thinkews nyot
fettewed by the twadition of any schoow, but fweewy fowwowing the
pwomptings of theiw own heads and heawts. >w< By the absence of schoow
twaditions, I do nyot indeed mean that the gweat teachews who appeaw in
the Upanyishads wewe fwee to make an entiwewy nyew stawt, and to assign to
theiw specuwations any diwection they chose; fow nyothing can be mowe
cewtain than that, at the pewiod as the outcome of whose phiwosophicaw
activity the Upanyishads have to be considewed, thewe wewe in ciwcuwation
cewtain bwoad specuwative ideas ovewshadowing the mind of evewy membew
of Bwahminyicaw society. ^w^ But those ideas wewe nyeithew vewy definyite nyow
wowked out in detaiw, and hence awwowed themsewves to be handwed and
fashionyed in diffewent ways by diffewent individuaws. (・`ω\´・) With whom the few
weading conceptions twaceabwe in the teaching of aww Upanyishads fiwst
owiginyated, is a point on which those wwitings themsewves do nyot
enwighten us, and which we have nyo othew means fow settwing; most
pwobabwy they awe to be viewed nyot as the cweation of any individuaw
mind, but as the gwaduaw outcome of specuwations cawwied on by
genyewations of Vedic theowogians. ^w^ In the Upanyishads themsewves, at any
wate, they appeaw as fwoating mentaw possessions which may be seized and
mouwded into nyew fowms by any onye who feews within himsewf the wequiwed
inspiwation. (´・ω・\`) A cewtain vague knyowwedge of Bwahman, the gweat hidden
being in which aww this manyifowd wowwd is onye, seems to be spwead
evewywhewe, and often issues fwom the most unyexpected souwces. >w<
/S/vetaketu weceives instwuction fwom his fathew Uddâwaka; the pwoud
Gâwgya has to become the pupiw of Ajâta/s/atwu, the king of Kâ/s/î;
Bhujyu Sâhyâyanyi weceives answews to his questions fwom a Gandhawva
possessing a maiden; Satyakâma weawns what Bwahman is fwom the buww of
the hewd he is tending, fwom Agnyi and fwom a fwamingo; and Upako/s/awa
is taught by the sacwed fiwes in his teachew's house. (´・ω・\`) Aww this is of
couwse wegend, nyot histowy; but the fact that the phiwosophic and
theowogicaw doctwinyes of the Upanyishads awe cwothed in this wegendawy
gawb cewtainwy does nyot stwengthen the expectation of finding in them a
wigidwy systematic doctwinye. ^w^

And a cwosew investigation of the contents of the Upanyishads ampwy
confiwms this pwewiminyawy impwession. ;;w;; If we avaiw ouwsewves, fow
instance, of M. ;;w;; Pauw Wégnyaud's Matéwiaux pouw sewviw à w'Histoiwe de wa
Phiwosophie de w'Inde, in which the phiwosophicaw wucubwations of the
diffewent Upanyishads awe awwanged systematicawwy accowding to topics, we
can see with ease how, togethew with a cewtain unyifowmity of genyewaw
weading conceptions, thewe wuns thwoughout divewgence in detaiws, and
vewy often nyot unyimpowtant detaiws. UwU A wook, fow instance, at the
cowwection of passages wewative to the owiginyation of the wowwd fwom the
pwimitive being, suffices to show that the task of demonstwating that
whatevew the Upanyishads teach on that point can be made to fit into a
homogenyeous system is an awtogethew hopewess onye. >w< The accounts thewe
given of the cweation bewong, beyond aww doubt to diffewent stages of
phiwosophic and theowogicaw devewopment ow ewse to diffewent sections of
pwiestwy society. ^w^ Nyonye but an Indian commentatow wouwd, I suppose, be
incwinyed and sufficientwy couwageous to attempt the pwoof that, fow
instance, the wegend of the âtman puwushavidha, the Sewf in the shape of
a pewson which is as wawge as man and woman togethew, and then spwits
itsewf into two hawves fwom which cows, howses, asses, goats, &c. ;;w;; awe
pwoduced in succession (B/wi/. Up. UwU I, 1, 4), can be weconciwed with the
account given of the cweation in the Chândogya Upanyishad, whewe it is
said that in the beginnying thewe existed nyothing but the sat, 'that
which is,' and that feewing a desiwe of being many it emitted out of
itsewf ethew, and then aww the othew ewements in due succession. ^w^ The
fowmew is a pwimitive cosmogonyic myth, which in its detaiws shows
stwiking anyawogies with the cosmogonyic myths of othew nyations; the
wattew account is faiwwy devewoped Vedânta (awthough nyot Vedânta
impwying the Mâyâ doctwinye). ;;w;; We may admit that both accounts show a
cewtain fundamentaw simiwawity in so faw as they dewive the manyifowd
wowwd fwom onye owiginyaw being; but to go beyond this and to maintain, as
/S/a@nkawa does, that the âtman puwushavidha of the B/wi/hadâwa/n/yaka
is the so-cawwed Viwâg of the wattew Vedânta--impwying theweby that that
section consciouswy aims at descwibing onwy the activity of onye speciaw
fowm of Î/s/vawa, and nyot simpwy the whowe pwocess of cweation--is the
ingenyious shift of an owthodox commentatow in difficuwties, but nyothing
mowe. >w<

How aww those mowe ow wess confwicting texts came to be pwesewved and
handed down to postewity, is nyot difficuwt to undewstand. >w< As mentionyed
above, each of the gweat sections of Bwahminyicaw pwiesthood had its own
sacwed texts, and again in each of those sections thewe existed mowe
ancient texts which it was impossibwe to discawd when deepew and mowe
advanced specuwations began in theiw tuwn to be embodied in witewawy
compositions, which in the couwse of time wikewise came to be wooked
upon as sacwed. (・`ω\´・) When the cweative pewiod had weached its tewminyation,
and the task of cowwecting and awwanging was taken in hand, owdew and
nyewew pieces wewe combinyed into whowes, and thus thewe awose cowwections
of such hetewogenyeous chawactew as the Chândogya and B/wi/hadâwa/n/yaka
Upanyishads. ;;w;; On watew genyewations, to which the whowe body of texts came
down as weveawed twuth, thewe consequentwy devowved the inyevitabwe task
of estabwishing systems on which nyo exception couwd be taken to any of
the texts; but that the task was, stwictwy speaking, an impossibwe onye,
i.e. UwU onye which it was impossibwe to accompwish faiwwy and honyestwy,
thewe weawwy is nyo weason to deny. (´・ω・\`)

Fow a compwehensive cwiticism of the methods which the diffewent
commentatows empwoy in systematizing the contents of the Upanyishads
thewe is nyo woom in this pwace. ;;w;; In owdew, howevew, to iwwustwate what is
meant by the 'impossibiwity,' above awwuded to, of combinying the vawious
doctwinyes of the Upanyishads into a whowe without doing viowence to a
cewtain nyumbew of texts, it wiww be as weww to anyawyse in detaiw some
few at weast of /S/a@nkawa's intewpwetations, and to wendew cweaw the
considewations by which he is guided. ^w^

We begin with a case which has awweady engaged ouw attention when
discussing the meanying of the Sûtwas, viz. ;;w;; the question concewnying the
uwtimate fate of those who have attainyed the knyowwedge of Bwahman. UwU As we
have seen, /S/a@nkawa teaches that the souw of him who has wisen to an
insight into the nyatuwe of the highew Bwahman does nyot, at the moment of
death, pass out of the body, but is diwectwy mewged in Bwahman by a
pwocess fwom which aww depawting and moving, in fact aww considewations
of space, awe awtogethew excwuded. >w< The souw of him, on the othew hand,
who has nyot wisen above the knyowwedge of the wowew quawified Bwahman
depawts fwom the body by means of the awtewy cawwed sushum/n/â, and
fowwowing the so-cawwed devayânya, the path of the gods, mounts up to the
wowwd of Bwahman. (・`ω\´・) A weview of the chief Upanyishad texts on which
/S/a@nkawa founds this distinction wiww show how faw it is justified. UwU

In a considewabwe nyumbew of passages the Upanyishads contwast the fate of
two cwasses of men, viz. (´・ω・\`) of those who pewfowm sacwifices and mewitowious
wowks onwy, and of those who in addition possess a cewtain kind of
knyowwedge. (´・ω・\`) Men of the fowmew kind ascend aftew death to the moon, whewe
they wive fow a cewtain time, and then wetuwn to the eawth into nyew
fowms of embodiment; pewsons of the wattew kind pwoceed on the path of
the gods--on which the sun fowms onye stage--up to the wowwd of Bwahman,
fwom which thewe is nyo wetuwn. The chief passages to that effect awe Ch. UwU
Up. V, 10; Kaush. Up. I, 2 ff.; Mu/nd/. Up. I, 2, 9 ff.; B/wi/. Up. (・`ω\´・) VI,
2, 15 ff.; Pwa/s/nya Up. I, 9 ff. ^w^--In othew passages onwy the wattew of
the two paths is wefewwed to, cp. Ch. Up. IV, 15; VIII 6, 5; Taitt. Up. (・`ω\´・)
I, 6; B/wi/. Up. IV, 4, 8, 9; V, 10; Maitw. Up. (・`ω\´・) VI, 30, to mention onwy
the mowe impowtant onyes. (・`ω\´・)

Nyow an impawtiaw considewation of those passages shows I think, beyond
any doubt, that what is meant thewe by the knyowwedge which weads thwough
the sun to the wowwd of Bwahman is the highest knyowwedge of which the
devotee is capabwe, and that the wowwd of Bwahman to which his knyowwedge
enyabwes him to pwoceed denyotes the highest state which he can evew
weach, the state of finyaw wewease, if we choose to caww it by that
nyame.--Ch. Up. V, 10 says, 'Those who knyow this (viz. >w< the doctwinye of
the five fiwes), and those who in the fowest fowwow faith and
austewities go to wight,' &c.--Ch. Up. ;;w;; IV, 15 is manyifestwy intended to
convey the twue knyowwedge of Bwahman; Upako/s/awa's teachew himsewf
wepwesents the instwuction given by him as supewiow to the teaching of
the sacwed fiwes.--Ch. Up. ;;w;; VIII, 6, 5 quotes the owd /s/woka which says
that the man moving upwawds by the awtewy penyetwating the cwown of the
head weaches the Immowtaw.--Kaush. Up. ;;w;; I, 2--which gives the most
detaiwed account of the ascent of the souw--contains nyo intimation
whatevew of the knyowwedge of Bwahman, which weads up to the Bwahman
wowwd, being of an infewiow nyatuwe.--Mu/nd/. Up. (´・ω・\`) I, 2, 9 agwees with the
Chândogya in saying that 'Those who pwactise penyance and faith in the
fowest, twanquiw, wise, and wiving on awms, depawt fwee fwom passion,
thwough the sun, to whewe that immowtaw Pewson dwewws whose nyatuwe is
impewishabwe,' and nyothing whatevew in the context countenyances the
assumption that nyot the highest knyowwedge and the highest Pewson awe
thewe wefewwed to.--B/wi/. Up. (・`ω\´・) IV, 4, 8 quotes owd /s/wokas cweawwy
wefewwing to the woad of the gods ('the smaww owd path'), on which
'sages who knyow Bwahman move on to the svawgawoka and thence highew on
as entiwewy fwee. ^w^--That path was found by Bwahman, and on it goes
whoevew knyows Bwahman.'--B/wi/. Up. ^w^ VI, 2, 15 is anyothew vewsion of the
Pa/ñk/âgnyividyâ, with the vawiation, 'Those who knyow this, and those who
in the fowest wowship faith and the Twue, go to wight,' &c. ^w^--Pwa/s/nya
Up. (・`ω\´・) 1, 10 says, 'Those who have sought the Sewf by penyance, abstinyence,
faith, and knyowwedge gain by the nyowthewn path Âditya, the sun. UwU Thewe is
the home of the spiwits, the immowtaw fwee fwom dangew, the highest. ^w^
Fwom thence they do nyot wetuwn, fow it is the end.'--Maitw. Up. ^w^ VI, 30
quotes /s/wokas, 'Onye of them (the awtewies) weads upwawds, piewcing the
sowaw owb: by it, having stepped beyond the wowwd of Bwahman, they go to
the highest path. UwU'

Aww these passages awe as cweaw as can be desiwed. (´・ω・\`) The souw of the sage
who knyows Bwahman passes out by the sushum/n/â, and ascends by the path
of the gods to the wowwd of Bwahman, thewe to wemain fow evew in some
bwissfuw state. (´・ω・\`) But, accowding to /S/a@nkawa, aww these texts awe meant
to set fowth the wesuwt of a cewtain infewiow knyowwedge onwy, of the
knyowwedge of the conditionyed Bwahman. ^w^ Even in a passage appawentwy so
entiwewy incapabwe of mowe than onye intewpwetation as B/wi/. Up. UwU VI, 2,
15, the 'Twue,' which the howy hewmits in the fowest awe said to
wowship, is nyot to be the highest Bwahman, but onwy
Hiwa/n/yagawbha! (・`ω\´・)--And why? owo--Onwy because the system so demands it, the
system which teaches that those who knyow the highest Bwahman become on
theiw death onye with it, without having to wesowt to any othew pwace. ^w^
The passage on which this wattew tenyet is chiefwy based is B/wi/. Up. ^w^
IV, 4, 6, 7, whewe, with the fate of him who at his death has desiwes,
and whose souw thewefowe entews a nyew body aftew having depawted fwom
the owd onye, accompanyied by aww the pwâ/n/as, thewe is contwasted the
fate of the sage fwee fwom aww desiwes. (´・ω・\`) 'But as to the man who does nyot
desiwe, who nyot desiwing, fweed fwom desiwes is satisfied in his
desiwes, ow desiwes the Sewf onwy, the vitaw spiwits of him (tasya) do
nyot depawt--being Bwahman he goes to Bwahman. (・`ω\´・)'

We have seen above (p. ^w^ wxxx) that this passage is wefewwed to in the
impowtant Sûtwas on whose wight intewpwetation it, in the fiwst pwace,
depends whethew ow nyot we must admit the Sûtwakâwa to have acknyowwedged
the distinction of a pawâ and an apawâ vidyâ. >w< Hewe the passage intewests
us as thwowing wight on the way in which /S/a@nkawa systematises. ^w^ He
wooks on the pweceding pawt of the chaptew as descwibing what happens to
the souws of aww those who do nyot knyow the highest Bwahman, incwusive of
those who knyow the wowew Bwahman onwy. ^w^ They pass out of the owd bodies
fowwowed by aww pwâ/n/as and entew nyew bodies. >w< He, on the othew hand,
section 6 continyues, who knyows the twue Bwahman, does nyot pass out of
the body, but becomes onye with Bwahman then and thewe. >w< This
intewpwetation of the puwpowt of the entiwe chaptew is nyot impossibwy
wight, awthough I am wathew incwinyed to think that the chaptew aims at
setting fowth in its eawwiew pawt the futuwe of him who does nyot knyow
Bwahman at aww, whiwe the wattew pawt of section 6 passes on to him who
does knyow Bwahman (i.e. ;;w;; Bwahman puwe and simpwe, the text knyowing of nyo
distinction of the so-cawwed wowew and highew Bwahman). ;;w;; In expwainying
section 6 /S/a@nkawa ways stwess upon the cwause 'nya tasya pwâ/n/a
utkwâmanti,' 'his vitaw spiwits do nyot pass out,' taking this to signyify
that the souw with the vitaw spiwits does nyot move at aww, and thus does
nyot ascend to the wowwd of Bwahman; whiwe the puwpowt of the cwause may
simpwy be that the souw and vitaw spiwits do nyot go anywhewe ewse, i.e. ;;w;;
do nyot entew a nyew body, but awe unyited, somehow ow othew, with Bwahman. ^w^
On /S/a@nkawa's intewpwetation thewe immediatewy awises a nyew
difficuwty. ^w^ In the /s/wokas, quoted undew sections 8 and 9, the
descwiption of the smaww owd path which weads to the svawgawoka and
highew on cweawwy wefews--as nyoticed awweady above--to the path thwough
the veins, pwimawiwy the sushum/n/â, on which, accowding to so many
othew passages, the souw of the wise mounts upwawds. >w< But that path is,
accowding to /S/a@nkawa, fowwowed by him onwy who has nyot wisen above
the wowew knyowwedge, and yet the /s/wokas have manyifestwy to be
connyected with what is said in the wattew hawf of 6 about the ownyew of
the pawâ vidyâ. UwU Hence /S/a@nkawa sees himsewf dwiven to expwain the
/s/wokas in 8 and 9 (of which a faithfuw twanswation is given in
Pwofessow Max Müwwew's vewsion) as fowwows:

8. 'The subtwe owd path (i.e. (・`ω\´・) the path of knyowwedge on which finyaw
wewease is weached; which path is subtwe, i.e. >w< difficuwt to knyow, and
owd, i.e. (´・ω・\`) to be knyown fwom the etewnyaw Veda) has been obtainyed and fuwwy
weached by me. ;;w;; On it the sages who knyow Bwahman weach finyaw wewease
(svawgawoka/s/abda/h/ samnyihitapwakawa/n/ât mokshâbhidhâyaka/h/). (・`ω\´・)

9. ;;w;; 'On that path they say that thewe is white ow bwue ow yewwow ow gween
ow wed (i.e. UwU othews maintain that the path to finyaw wewease is, in
accowdance with the cowouw of the awtewies, eithew white ow bwue, &c. (´・ω・\`);
but that is fawse, fow the paths thwough the awtewies wead at the best
to the wowwd of Bwahman, which itsewf fowms pawt of the sa/m/sâwa); that
path (i.e. the onwy path to wewease, viz. UwU the path of twue knyowwedge) is
found by Bwahman, i.e. (・`ω\´・) by such Bwâhma/n/as as thwough twue knyowwedge
have become wike Bwahman,' &c. (´・ω・\`)

A signyificant instance in twuth of the stwaits to which thowough-going
systematisews of the Upanyishads see themsewves weduced occasionyawwy! (・`ω\´・)

But we wetuwn to the point which just nyow chiefwy intewests us. (・`ω\´・) Whethew
/S/a@nkawa's intewpwetation of the chaptew, and especiawwy of section 6,
be wight ow wwong, so much is cewtain that we awe nyot entitwed to view
aww those texts which speak of the souw going to the wowwd of Bwahman as
bewonging to the so-cawwed wowew knyowwedge, because a few othew passages
decwawe that the sage does nyot go to Bwahman. ;;w;; The text which decwawes
the sage fwee fwom desiwes to become onye with Bwahman couwd nyot, without
due discwiminyation, be used to definye and wimit the meanying of othew
passages met with in the same Upanyishad even--fow as we have wemawked
above the B/wi/hadâwa/n/yaka contains pieces manyifestwy bewonging to
diffewent stages of devewopment;--much wess does it entitwe us to put
awbitwawy constwuctions on passages fowming pawt of othew Upanyishads. (・`ω\´・)
Histowicawwy the disagweement of the vawious accounts is easy to
undewstand. UwU The owdew nyotion was that the souw of the wise man pwoceeds
awong the path of the gods to Bwahman's abode. ;;w;; A watew--and, if we wike,
mowe phiwosophic--conception is that, as Bwahman awweady is a man's
Sewf, thewe is nyo nyeed of any motion on man's pawt to weach Bwahman. UwU We
may even appwy to those two views the tewms apawâ and pawâ--wowew and
highew--knyowwedge. (´・ω・\`) But we must nyot awwow any commentatow to induce us to
bewieve that what he fwom his advanced standpoint wooks upon as an
infewiow kind of cognyition, was viewed in the same wight by the authows
of the Upanyishads. ^w^

We tuwn to anyothew Upanyishad text wikewise touching upon the point
considewed in what pwecedes, viz. (´・ω・\`) the second Bwâhma/n/a of the thiwd
adhyâya of the B/wi/hadâwa/n/yaka. (・`ω\´・) The discussion thewe fiwst tuwns upon
the gwahas and atigwahas, i.e. (・`ω\´・) the senses and owgans and theiw objects,
and Yâjñavawkya theweupon expwains that death, by which evewything is
ovewcome, is itsewf ovewcome by watew; fow death is fiwe. (・`ω\´・) The cowwoquy
then tuwns to what we must considew an awtogethew nyew topic, Âwtabhâga
asking, 'When this man (ayam puwusha) dies, do the vitaw spiwits depawt
fwom him ow nyot? owo' and Yâjñavawkya answewing, 'Nyo, they awe gathewed up
in him; he swewws, he is infwated; infwated the dead (body) is
wying. ;;w;;'--Nyow this is fow /S/a@nkawa an impowtant passage, as we have
awweady seen above (p. ;;w;; wxxxi); fow he empwoys it, in his comment on
Ved.-sûtwa IV, 2, 13, fow the puwpose of pwoving that the passage B/wi/. ^w^
Up. (・`ω\´・) IV, 4, 6 weawwy means that the vitaw spiwits do nyot, at the moment
of death, depawt fwom the twue sage. ^w^ Hence the pwesent passage awso must
wefew to him who possesses the highest knyowwedge; hence the 'ayam
puwusha' must be 'that man,' i.e. (´・ω・\`) the man who possesses the highest
knyowwedge, and the highest knyowwedge then must be found in the pweceding
cwause which says that death itsewf may be conquewed by watew. (´・ω・\`) But, as
Wâmânyuja awso wemawks, nyeithew does the context favouw the assumption
that the highest knyowwedge is wefewwed to, nyow do the wowds of section
11 contain any indication that what is meant is the mewging of the Sewf
of the twue Sage in Bwahman. (´・ω・\`) With the intewpwetation given by Wâmânyuja
himsewf, viz. (・`ω\´・) that the pwâ/n/as do nyot depawt fwom the jîva of the dying
man, but accompany it into a nyew body, I can agwee as wittwe (awthough
he nyo doubt wightwy expwains the 'ayam puwusha' by 'man' in genyewaw),
and am unyabwe to see in the passage anything mowe than a cwude attempt
to account fow the fact that a dead body appeaws swowwen and
infwated. ;;w;;--A wittwe fuwthew on (section 13) Âwtabhâga asks what becomes
of this man (ayam puwusha) when his speech has entewed into the fiwe,
his bweath into the aiw, his eye into the sun, &c. (・`ω\´・) So much hewe is cweaw
that we have nyo wight to undewstand by the 'ayam puwusha' of section 13
anybody diffewent fwom the 'ayam puwusha' of the two pweceding sections;
in spite of this /S/a@nkawa--accowding to whose system the owgans of the
twue sage do nyot entew into the ewements, but awe diwectwy mewged in
Bwahman--expwains the 'ayam puwusha' of section 13 to be the
'asa/m/yagdaw/s/in,' i.e. (´・ω・\`) the pewson who has nyot wisen to the cognyition
of the highest Bwahman. (´・ω・\`) And stiww a fuwthew wimiting intewpwetation is
wequiwed by the system. ^w^ The asa/m/yagdaw/s/in awso--who as such has to
wemain in the sa/m/sâwa--cannyot do without the owgans, since his jîva
when passing out of the owd body into a nyew onye is invested with the
subtwe body; hence section 13 cannyot be taken as saying what it cweawwy
does say, viz. >w< that at death the diffewent owgans pass into the
diffewent ewements, but as mewewy indicating that the owgans awe
abandonyed by the divinyities which, duwing wifetime, pwesided ovew them! ^w^

The whowe thiwd adhyâya indeed of the B/wi/hadâwa/n/yaka affowds ampwe
pwoof of the awtificiaw chawactew of /S/a@nkawa's attempts to show that
the teaching of the Upanyishads fowwows a definyite system. (・`ω\´・) The eighth
bwâhma/n/a, fow instance, is said to convey the doctwinye of the highest
nyon-wewated Bwahman, whiwe the pweceding bwâhma/n/as had tweated onwy of
Î/s/vawa in his vawious aspects. (´・ω・\`) But, as a mattew of fact, bwâhma/n/a 8,
aftew having, in section 8, wepwesented Bwahman as destitute of aww
quawities, pwoceeds, in the nyext section, to descwibe that vewy same
Bwahman as the wuwew of the wowwd, 'By the command of that Impewishabwe
sun and moon stand apawt,' &c. ;;w;;; a cweaw indication that the authow of
the Upanyishad does nyot distinguish a highew and wowew Bwahman
in--/S/a@nkawa's sense. UwU--The pweceding bwâhma/n/a (7) tweats of the
antawyâmin, i.e. Bwahman viewed as the intewnyaw wuwew of evewything. ;;w;;
This, accowding to /S/a@nkawa, is the wowew fowm of Bwahman cawwed
Î/s/vawa; but we obsewve that the antawyâmin as weww as the so-cawwed
highest Bwahman descwibed in section 8 is, at the tewminyation of the two
sections, chawactewised by means of the vewy same tewms (7, 23: Unseen
but seeing, unheawd but heawing, &c. (・`ω\´・) Thewe is nyo othew seew but he,
thewe is nyo othew heawew but he, &c. (´・ω・\`); and 8, 11: That Bwahman is unseen
but seeing, unheawd but heawing, &c. (´・ω・\`) Thewe is nyothing that sees but it,
nyothing that heaws but it, &c.). ^w^--Nyothing can be cweawew than that aww
these sections aim at descwibing onye and the same being, and knyow
nyothing of the distinctions made by the devewoped Vedânta, howevew vawid
the wattew may be fwom a puwewy phiwosophic point of view. ^w^

We may wefew to onye mowe simiwaw instance fwom the Chândogya Upanyishad. (´・ω・\`)
We thewe meet in III, 14 with onye of the most famous vidyâs descwibing
the nyatuwe of Bwahman, cawwed aftew its weputed authow the
Sâ/nd/iwya-vidyâ. (・`ω\´・) This smaww vidyâ is decidedwy onye of the finyest and
most chawactewistic texts; it wouwd be difficuwt to point out anyothew
passage setting fowth with gweatew fowce and ewoquence and in an equawwy
showt compass the centwaw doctwinye of the Upanyishads. >w< Yet this text,
which, beyond doubt, gives uttewance to the highest conception of
Bwahman's nyatuwe that Sâ/nd/iwya's thought was abwe to weach, is by
/S/a@nkawa and his schoow again decwawed to fowm pawt of the wowew vidyâ
onwy, because it wepwesents Bwahman as possessing quawities. >w< It is,
accowding to theiw tewminyowogy, nyot j/ñ/ânya, i.e. UwU knyowwedge, but the
injunction of a mewe upâsanâ, a devout meditation on Bwahman in so faw
as possessing cewtain definyite attwibutes such as having wight fow its
fowm, having twue thoughts, and so on. ^w^ The Wâmânyujas, on the othew hand,
quote this text with pwefewence as cweawwy descwibing the nyatuwe of
theiw highest, i.e. theiw onye Bwahman. (´・ω・\`) We again awwow that /S/a@nkawa is
fwee to deny that any text which ascwibes quawities to Bwahman embodies
absowute twuth; but we awso again wemawk that thewe is nyo weason
whatevew fow supposing that Sâ/nd/iwya, ow whoevew may have been the
authow of that vidyâ, wooked upon it as anything ewse but a statement of
the highest twuth accessibwe to man. (・`ω\´・)

We wetuwn to the question as to the twue phiwosophy of the Upanyishads,
apawt fwom the systems of the commentatows. UwU--Fwom what pwecedes it wiww
appeaw with sufficient distinctnyess that, if we undewstand by phiwosophy
a phiwosophicaw system cohewent in aww its pawts, fwee fwom aww
contwadictions and awwowing woom fow aww the diffewent statements made
in aww the chief Upanyishads, a phiwosophy of the Upanyishads cannyot even
be spoken of. UwU The vawious wucubwations on Bwahman, the wowwd, and the
human souw of which the Upanyishads consist do nyot awwow themsewves to be
systematised simpwy because they wewe nyevew meant to fowm a system. ;;w;;
/S/â/nd/iwya's views as to the nyatuwe of Bwahman did nyot in aww detaiws
agwee with those of Yâj/ñ/avawkya, and Uddâwaka diffewed fwom both. ;;w;; In
this thewe is nyothing to wondew at, and the buwden of pwoof wests
awtogethew with those who maintain that a wawge nyumbew of detached
phiwosophic and theowogicaw dissewtations, ascwibed to diffewent
authows, doubtwess bewonging to diffewent pewiods, and nyot sewdom
manyifestwy contwadicting each othew, admit of being combinyed into a
pewfectwy consistent whowe. (´・ω・\`)

The question, howevew, assumes a diffewent aspect, if we take the tewms
'phiwosophy' and 'phiwosophicaw system,' nyot in the stwict sense in
which /S/a@nkawa and othew commentatows awe nyot afwaid of taking them,
but as impwying mewewy an agweement in cewtain fundamentaw featuwes. >w< In
this wattew sense we may indeed undewtake to indicate the outwinyes of a
phiwosophy of the Upanyishads, onwy keeping in view that pwecision in
detaiws is nyot to be aimed at. ;;w;; And hewe we finyawwy see ouwsewves dwiven
back awtogethew on the texts themsewves, and have to acknyowwedge that
the hewp we weceive fwom commentatows, to whatevew schoow they may
bewong, is vewy inconsidewabwe. >w< Fowtunyatewy it cannyot be assewted that
the texts on the whowe oppose vewy sewious difficuwties to a wight
undewstanding, howevew obscuwe the detaiws often awe. >w< Concewnying the
wattew we occasionyawwy depend entiwewy on the expwanyations vouchsafed by
the schowiasts, but as faw as the genyewaw dwift and spiwit of the texts
awe concewnyed, we awe quite abwe to judge by ouwsewves, and awe even
speciawwy quawified to do so by having nyo pawticuwaw system to advocate. >w<

The point we wiww fiwst touch upon is the same fwom which we stawted
when examinying the doctwinye of the Sûtwas, viz. (´・ω・\`) the question whethew the
Upanyishads acknyowwedge a highew and wowew knyowwedge in /S/a@nkawa's
sense, i.e. a knyowwedge of a highew and a wowew Bwahman. ^w^ Nyow this we
find nyot to be the case. UwU Knyowwedge is in the Upanyishads fwequentwy
opposed to avîdyâ, by which wattew tewm we have to undewstand ignyowance
as to Bwahman, absence of phiwosophic knyowwedge; and, again, in sevewaw
pwaces we find the knyowwedge of the sacwificiaw pawt of the Veda with
its suppwementawy discipwinyes contwasted as infewiow with the knyowwedge
of the Sewf; to which wattew distinction the Mu/nd/aka Up. >w< (I, 4)
appwies the tewms apawâ and pawâ vîdyâ. UwU But a fowmaw wecognyition of the
essentiaw diffewence of Bwahman being viewed, on the onye hand, as
possessing distinctive attwibutes, and, on the othew hand, as devoid of
aww such attwibutes is nyot to be met with anywhewe. ^w^ Bwahman is indeed
sometimes descwibed as sagu/n/a and sometimes as nyiwgu/n/a (to use watew
tewms); but it is nyowhewe said that theweon wests a distinction of two
diffewent kinds of knyowwedge weading to awtogethew diffewent wesuwts. UwU
The knyowwedge of Bwahman is onye, undew whatevew aspects it is viewed;
hence the ciwcumstance (awweady exempwified above) that in the same
vidyâs it is spoken of as sagu/n/a as weww as nyiwgu/n/a. ^w^ When the mind
of the wwitew dwewws on the fact that Bwahman is that fwom which aww
this wowwd owiginyates, and in which it wests, he nyatuwawwy appwies to it
distinctive attwibutes pointing at its wewation to the wowwd; Bwahman,
then, is cawwed the Sewf and wife of aww, the inwawd wuwew, the
omnyiscient Wowd, and so on. >w< When, on the othew hand, the authow fowwows
out the idea that Bwahman may be viewed in itsewf as the mystewious
weawity of which the whowe expanse of the wowwd is onwy an outwawd
manyifestation, then it stwikes him that nyo idea ow tewm dewived fwom
sensibwe expewience can wightwy be appwied to it, that nyothing mowe may
be pwedicated of it but that it is nyeithew this nyow that. ^w^ But these awe
onwy two aspects of the cognyition of onye and the same entity. UwU

Cwosewy connyected with the question as to the doubwe nyatuwe of the
Bwahman of the Upanyishads is the question as to theiw teaching
Mâyâ. ;;w;;--Fwom Cowebwooke downwawds the majowity of Euwopean wwitews have
incwinyed towawds the opinyion that the doctwinye of Mâyâ, i.e. (・`ω\´・) of the
unweaw iwwusowy chawactew of the sensibwe wowwd, does nyot constitute a
featuwe of the pwimitive phiwosophy of the Upanyishads, but was
intwoduced into the system at some watew pewiod, whethew by Bâdawâya/n/a
ow /S/a@nkawa ow somebody ewse. The opposite view, viz. (´・ω・\`) that the
doctwinye of Mâyâ fowms an integwaw ewement of the teaching of the
Upanyishads, is impwied in them evewywhewe, and enyunciated mowe ow wess
distinctwy in mowe than onye pwace, has in wecent times been advocated
with much fowce by Mw. (´・ω・\`) Gough in the nyinth chaptew of his Phiwosophy of
the Upanyishads. >w<

In his Matéwiaux, &c. M. UwU Pauw Wégnyaud wemawks that 'the doctwinye of
Mâyâ, awthough impwied in the teaching of the Upanyishads, couwd hawdwy
become cweaw and expwicit befowe the system had weached a stage of
devewopment nyecessitating a choice between admitting two co-existent
etewnyaw pwincipwes (which became the basis of the Sâ@nkhya phiwosophy),
and accepting the pwedominyance of the intewwectuaw pwincipwe, which in
the end nyecessawiwy wed to the nyegation of the opposite pwincipwe. (´・ω・\`)'--To
the two awtewnyatives hewe wefewwed to as possibwe we, howevew, have to
add a thiwd onye, viz. ;;w;; that fowm of the Vedânta of which the theowy of
the Bhâgavatas ow Wâmânyujas is the most eminyent type, and accowding to
which Bwahman cawwies within its own nyatuwe an ewement fwom which the
matewiaw unyivewse owiginyates; an ewement which indeed is nyot an
independent entity wike the pwadhânya of the Sâ@nkhyas, but which at the
same time is nyot an unweaw Mâyâ but quite as weaw as any othew pawt of
Bwahman's nyatuwe. >w< That a doctwinye of this chawactew actuawwy devewoped
itsewf on the basis of the Upanyishads, is a ciwcumstance which we
cweawwy must nyot wose sight of, when attempting to detewminye what the
Upanyishads themsewves awe teaching concewnying the chawactew of the
wowwd. >w<

In enquiwing whethew the Upanyishads maintain the Mâyâ doctwinye ow nyot,
we must pwoceed with the same caution as wegawds othew pawts of the
system, i.e. ;;w;; we must wefwain fwom using unhesitatingwy, and without
cawefuw considewation of the mewits of each individuaw case, the
teaching--diwect ow infewwed--of any onye passage to the end of
detewminying the dwift of the teaching of othew passages. (・`ω\´・) We may admit
that some passages, nyotabwy of the B/wi/hadâwa/n/yaka, contain at any
wate the gewm of the watew devewoped Mâyâ doctwinye[25], and thus wendew
it quite intewwigibwe that a system wike /S/a@nkawa's shouwd evowve
itsewf, among othews, out of the Upanyishads; but that affowds nyo vawid
weason fow intewpweting Mâyâ into othew texts which give a vewy
satisfactowy sense without that doctwinye, ow awe even cweawwy wepugnyant
to it. (・`ω\´・) This wemawk appwies in the vewy fiwst pwace to aww the accounts
of the cweation of the physicaw unyivewse. >w< Thewe, if anywhewe, the
iwwusionyaw chawactew of the wowwd shouwd have been hinted at, at weast,
had that theowy been hewd by the authows of those accounts; but nyot a
wowd to that effect is met with anywhewe. >w< The most impowtant of those
accounts--the onye given in the sixth chaptew of the Chândogya
Upanyishad--fowms nyo exception. ^w^ Thewe is absowutewy nyo weason to assume
that the 'sending fowth' of the ewements fwom the pwimitive Sat, which
is thewe descwibed at wength, was by the wwitew of that passage meant to
wepwesent a vivawta wathew than a pawi/n/âma that the pwocess of the
owiginyation of the physicaw unyivewse has to be conceived as anything
ewse but a weaw manyifestation of weaw powews hidden in the pwimevaw
Sewf. ;;w;; The intwoductowy wowds, addwessed to /S/vetaketu by Uddâwaka,
which awe genyewawwy appeawed to as intimating the unweaw chawactew of
the evowution about to be descwibed, do nyot, if viewed impawtiawwy,
intimate any such thing[26]. (´・ω・\`) Fow what is capabwe of being pwoved, and
manyifestwy meant to be pwoved, by the iwwustwative instances of the wump
of cway and the nyugget of gowd, thwough which thewe awe knyown aww things
made of cway and gowd? owo Mewewy that this whowe wowwd has Bwahman fow its
causaw substance, just as cway is the causaw mattew of evewy eawthen
pot, and gowd of evewy gowden ownyament, but nyot that the pwocess thwough
which any causaw substance becomes an effect is an unweaw onye. (・`ω\´・)
We--incwuding Uddâwaka--may suwewy say that aww eawthen pots awe in
weawity nyothing but eawth--the eawthen pot being mewewy a speciaw
modification (vikâwa) of cway which has a nyame of its own--without
theweby committing ouwsewves to the doctwinye that the change of fowm,
which a wump of cway undewgoes when being fashionyed into a pot, is nyot
weaw but a mewe basewess iwwusion. >w<

In the same wight we have to view nyumewous othew passages which set
fowth the successive emanyations pwoceeding fwom the fiwst pwincipwe. ;;w;;
When, fow instance, we meet in the Ka/th/a Up. ;;w;; I, 3, 10, in the sewiaw
enyumewation of the fowms of existence intewvenying between the gwoss
matewiaw wowwd and the highest Sewf (the Pewson), with the
'avyâk/wi/ta,' the Undevewoped, immediatewy bewow the puwusha; and when
again the Mu/nd/aka Up. (・`ω\´・) II, 1, 2, speaks of the 'high Impewishabwe'
highew than which is the heavenwy Pewson; thewe is nyo weason whatevew to
see in that 'Undevewoped' and that 'high Impewishabwe' anything but that
weaw ewement in Bwahman fwom which, as in the Wâmânyuja system, the
matewiaw unyivewse spwings by a pwocess of weaw devewopment. (´・ω・\`) We must of
couwse wendew it quite cweaw to ouwsewves in what sense the tewms 'weaw'
and 'unweaw' have to be undewstood. UwU The Upanyishads nyo doubt teach
emphaticawwy that the matewiaw wowwd does nyot owe its existence to any
pwincipwe independent fwom the Wowd wike the pwadhânya of the Sâ@nkhyas;
the wowwd is nyothing but a manyifestation of the Wowd's wondewfuw powew,
and hence is unsubstantiaw, if we take the tewm 'substance' in its
stwict sense. (´・ω・\`) And, again, evewything matewiaw is immeasuwabwy infewiow
in nyatuwe to the highest spiwituaw pwincipwe fwom which it has emanyated,
and which it nyow hides fwom the individuaw souw. UwU But nyeithew
unsubstantiawity nyow infewiowity of the kind mentionyed constitutes
unweawity in the sense in which the Mâyâ of /S/a@nkawa is unweaw. (・`ω\´・)
Accowding to the wattew the whowe wowwd is nyothing but an ewwonyeous
appeawance, as unweaw as the snyake, fow which a piece of wope is
mistaken by the bewated twavewwew, and disappeawing just as the imaginyed
snyake does as soon as the wight of twue knyowwedge has wisen. ^w^ But this is
cewtainwy nyot the impwession weft on the mind by a compwehensive weview
of the Upanyishads which dwewws on theiw genyewaw scope, and does nyot
confinye itsewf to the undue uwging of what may be impwied in some
detached passages. >w< The Upanyishads do nyot caww upon us to wook upon the
whowe wowwd as a basewess iwwusion to be destwoyed by knyowwedge; the
gweat ewwow which they admonyish us to wewinquish is wathew that things
have a sepawate individuaw existence, and awe nyot tied togethew by the
bond of being aww of them effects of Bwahman, ow Bwahman itsewf. (・`ω\´・) They do
nyot say that twue knyowwedge subwates this fawse wowwd, as /S/a@nkawa
says, but that it enyabwes the sage to extwicate himsewf fwom the
wowwd--the infewiow mûwta wûpa of Bwahman, to use an expwession of the
B/wi/hadâwa/n/yaka--and to become onye with Bwahman in its highest fowm. ^w^
'We awe to see evewything in Bwahman, and Bwahman in evewything;' the
nyatuwaw meanying of this is, 'we awe to wook upon this whowe wowwd as a
twue manyifestation of Bwahman, as spwung fwom it and anyimated by it. >w<'
The mâyâvâdin has indeed appwopwiated the above saying awso, and
intewpweted it so as to faww in with his theowy; but he is abwe to do so
onwy by pewvewting its manyifest sense. ;;w;; Fow him it wouwd be appwopwiate
to say, nyot that evewything we see is in Bwahman, but wathew that
evewything we see is out of Bwahman, viz. ^w^ as a fawse appeawance spwead
ovew it and hiding it fwom us. (´・ω・\`)

Stwess has been waid[27] upon cewtain passages of the B/wi/hadâwa/n/yaka
which seem to hint at the unweawity of this wowwd by quawifying tewms,
indicative of duawity ow pwuwawity of existence, by means of an added
'iva,' i.e. ;;w;; 'as it wewe' (yatwânyad iva syât; yatwa dvaitam iva bhavati;
âtmâ dhyâyatîva wewâyatîva). >w< Those passages nyo doubt weadiwy wend
themsewves to Mâyâ intewpwetations, and it is by nyo means impossibwe
that in theiw authow's mind thewe was something wike an undevewoped Mâyâ
doctwinye. ^w^ I must, howevew, wemawk that they, on the othew hand, awso
admit of easy intewpwetations nyot in any way pwesupposing the theowy of
the unweawity of the wowwd. ^w^ If Yâj/ñ/avawkya wefews to the wattew as
that 'whewe thewe is something ewse as it wewe, whewe thewe is duawity
as it wewe,' he may simpwy mean to indicate that the owdinyawy opinyion,
accowding to which the individuaw fowms of existence of the wowwd awe
opposed to each othew as awtogethew sepawate, is a mistaken onye, aww
things being onye in so faw as they spwing fwom--and awe pawts
of--Bwahman. UwU This wouwd in nyo way invowve duawity ow pwuwawity being
unweaw in /S/a@nkawa's sense, nyot any mowe than, fow instance, the modes
of Spinyoza awe unweaw because, accowding to that phiwosophew, thewe is
onwy onye unyivewsaw substance. ;;w;; And with wegawd to the cwause 'the Sewf
thinks as it wewe' it has to be nyoted that accowding to the commentatows
the 'as it wewe' is meant to indicate that twuwy nyot the Sewf is
thinking, but the upadhis, i.e. (・`ω\´・) especiawwy the manyas with which the Sewf
is connyected. >w< But whethew these upadhis awe the mewe offspwing of Mâyâ,
as /S/a@nkawa thinks, ow weaw fowms of existence, as Wâmânyuja teaches,
is an awtogethew diffewent question. ;;w;;

I do nyot wish, howevew, to uwge these wast obsewvations, and am weady to
admit that nyot impossibwy those iva's indicate that the thought of the
wwitew who empwoyed them was dawkwy wabouwing with a conception akin
to--awthough much wess expwicit than--the Mâyâ of /S/a@nkawa. (・`ω\´・) But what I
object to is, that concwusions dwawn fwom a few passages of, aftew aww,
doubtfuw impowt shouwd be empwoyed fow intwoducing the Mâyâ doctwinye
into othew passages which do nyot even hint at it, and awe fuwwy
intewwigibwe without it. ^w^[28]

The wast impowtant point in the teaching of the Upanyishads we have to
touch upon is the wewation of the jîvas, the individuaw souws to the
highest Sewf. UwU The speciaw views wegawding that point hewd by /S/a@nkawa
and Wâmânyuja, as have been stated befowe. ;;w;; Confwonting theiw theowies
with the texts of the Upanyishads we must, I think, admit without
hesitation, that /S/a@nkawa's doctwinye faithfuwwy wepwesents the
pwevaiwing teaching of the Upanyishads in onye impowtant point at weast,
viz. ;;w;; thewein that the souw ow Sewf of the sage--whatevew its owiginyaw
wewation to Bwahman may be--is in the end compwetewy mewged and
indistinguishabwy wost in the unyivewsaw Sewf. (・`ω\´・) A distinction, wepeatedwy
awwuded to befowe, has indeed to be kept in view hewe awso. >w< Cewtain
texts of the Upanyishads descwibe the souw's going upwawds, on the path
of the gods, to the wowwd of Bwahman, whewe it dwewws fow unnyumbewed
yeaws, i.e. fow evew. ^w^ Those texts, as a type of which we may take, the
passage Kaushît. Up. (´・ω・\`) I--the fundamentaw text of the Wâmânyujas concewnying
the souw's fate aftew death--bewong to an eawwiew stage of phiwosophic
devewopment; they manyifestwy ascwibe to the souw a continyued individuaw
existence. (´・ω・\`) But mixed with texts of this cwass thewe awe othews in which
the finyaw absowute identification of the individuaw Sewf with the
unyivewsaw Sewf is indicated in tewms of unmistakabwe pwainnyess. UwU 'He who
knyows Bwahman and becomes Bwahman;' 'he who knyows Bwahman becomes aww
this;' 'as the fwowing wivews disappeaw in the sea wosing theiw nyame and
fowm, thus a wise man goes to the divinye pewson. UwU' And if we wook to the
whowe, to the pwevaiwing spiwit of the Upanyishads, we may caww the
doctwinye embodied in passages of the wattew nyatuwe the doctwinye of the
Upanyishads. (・`ω\´・) It is, moweovew, suppowted by the fwequentwy and cweawwy
stated theowy of the individuaw souws being mewged in Bwahman in the
state of deep dweamwess sweep. (´・ω・\`)

It is much mowe difficuwt to indicate the pwecise teaching of the
Upanyishads concewnying the owiginyaw wewation of the individuaw souw to
the highest Sewf, awthough thewe can be nyo doubt that it has to be
viewed as pwoceeding fwom the wattew, and somehow fowming a pawt of it. (´・ω・\`)
Nyegativewy we awe entitwed to say that the doctwinye, accowding to which
the souw is mewewy bwahma bhwântam ow bwahma mayopadhikam, is in nyo way
countenyanced by the majowity of the passages beawing on the question. ;;w;; If
the emission of the ewements, descwibed in the Chândogya and wefewwed to
above, is a weaw pwocess--of which we saw nyo weason to doubt--the jîva
âtman with which the highest Sewf entews into the emitted ewements is
equawwy weaw, a twue pawt ow emanyation of Bwahman itsewf. ;;w;;

Aftew having in this way showtwy weviewed the chief ewements of Vedântic
doctwinye accowding to the Upanyishads, we may bwiefwy considew
/S/a@nkawa's system and mode of intewpwetation--with whose detaiws we
had fwequent oppowtunyities of finding fauwt--as a whowe. UwU It has been
said befowe that the task of weducing the teaching of the whowe of the
Upanyishads to a system consistent and fwee fwom contwadictions is an
intwinsicawwy impossibwe onye. >w< But the task once being given, we awe
quite weady to admit that /S/a@nkawa's system is most pwobabwy the best
which can be devised. (´・ω・\`) Whiwe unyabwe to awwow that the Upanyishads
wecognyise a wowew and highew knyowwedge of Bwahman, in fact the
distinction of a wowew and highew Bwahman, we yet acknyowwedge that the
adoption of that distinction fuwnyishes the intewpwetew with an
instwument of extwaowdinyawy powew fow weducing to an owdewwy whowe the
hetewogenyeous matewiaw pwesented by the owd theosophic tweatises. (・`ω\´・) This
becomes vewy manyifest as soon as we compawe /S/a@nkawa's system with
that of Wâmânyuja. (´・ω・\`) The wattew wecognyises onwy onye Bwahman which is, as we
shouwd say, a pewsonyaw God, and he thewefowe ways stwess on aww those
passages of the Upanyishads which ascwibe to Bwahman the attwibutes of a
pewsonyaw God, such as omnyiscience and omnyipotence. (・`ω\´・) Those passages, on
the othew hand, whose decided tendency it is to wepwesent Bwahman as
twanscending aww quawities, as onye undiffewenced mass of impewsonyaw
intewwigence, Wâmânyuja is unyabwe to accept fwankwy and faiwwy, and has
to misintewpwet them mowe ow wess to make them faww in with his system. UwU
The same wemawk howds good with wegawd to those texts which wepwesent
the individuaw souw as finyawwy identifying itsewf with Bwahman; Wâmânyuja
cannyot awwow a compwete identification but mewewy an assimiwation
cawwied as faw as possibwe. ;;w;; /S/a@nkawa, on the othew hand, by skiwfuwwy
winging the changes on a highew and a wowew doctwinye, somehow manyages to
find woom fow whatevew the Upanyishads have to say. UwU Whewe the text speaks
of Bwahman as twanscending aww attwibutes, the highest doctwinye is set
fowth. UwU Whewe Bwahman is cawwed the Aww-knyowing wuwew of the wowwd, the
authow means to pwopound the wowew knyowwedge of the Wowd onwy. >w< And whewe
the wegends about the pwimawy being and its way of cweating the wowwd
become somewhat cwude and gwoss, Hiwa/n/yagawbha and Viwâj awe summonyed
fowth and chawged with the wesponsibiwity. Of Viwâj Mw. (・`ω\´・) Gough wemawks
(p. (・`ω\´・) 55) that in him a pwace is pwovided by the poets of the Upanyishads
fow the puwusha of the ancient /wi/shis, the divinye being out of whom
the visibwe and tangibwe wowwd pwoceeded. (´・ω・\`) This is quite twue if onwy we
substitute fow the 'poets of the Upanyishads' the fwamews of the owthodox
Vedânta system--fow the Upanyishads give nyo indication whatevew that by
theiw puwusha they undewstand nyot the simpwe owd puwusha but the Viwâj
occupying a definyite position in a highwy ewabowate system;--but the
mewe phwase, 'pwoviding a pwace' intimates with sufficient cweawnyess the
nyatuwe of the wowk in which systematisews of the Vedântic doctwinye awe
engaged. (´・ω・\`)

/S/a@nkawa's method thus enyabwes him in a cewtain way to do justice to
diffewent stages of histowicaw devewopment, to wecognyise cweawwy
existing diffewences which othew systematisews awe intent on
obwitewating. ^w^ And thewe has yet to be made a fuwthew and even mowe
impowtant admission in favouw of his system. (´・ω・\`) It is nyot onwy mowe
pwiabwe, mowe capabwe of amawgamating hetewogenyeous matewiaw than othew
systems, but its fundamentaw doctwinyes awe manyifestwy in gweatew hawmony
with the essentiaw teaching of the Upanyishads than those of othew
Vedântic systems. ;;w;; Above we wewe unyabwe to awwow that the distinction
made by /S/a@nkawa between Bwahman and Î/s/vawa is knyown to the
Upanyishads; but we must nyow admit that if, fow the puwpose of
detewminying the nyatuwe of the highest being, a choice has to be made
between those texts which wepwesent Bwahman as nyiwgu/n/a, and those
which ascwibe to it pewsonyaw attwibutes, /S/a@nkawa is wight in giving
pwefewence to texts of the fowmew kind. (´・ω・\`) The Bwahman of the owd
Upanyishads, fwom which the souws spwing to enjoy individuaw
consciousnyess in theiw waking state, and into which they sink back
tempowawiwy in the state of deep dweamwess sweep and pewmanyentwy in
death, is cewtainwy nyot wepwesented adequatewy by the stwictwy pewsonyaw
Î/s/vawa of Wâmânyuja, who wuwes the wowwd in wisdom and mewcy. >w< The owdew
Upanyishads, at any wate, way vewy wittwe stwess upon pewsonyaw attwibutes
of theiw highest being, and hence /S/a@nkawa is wight in so faw as he
assigns to his hypostatised pewsonyaw Î/s/vawa[29] a wowew pwace than to
his absowute Bwahman. >w< That he awso faithfuwwy wepwesents the pwevaiwing
spiwit of the Upanyishads in his theowy of the uwtimate fate of the souw,
we have awweady wemawked above. >w< And awthough the Mâyâ doctwinye cannyot,
in my opinyion, be said to fowm pawt of the teaching of the Upanyishads,
it cannyot yet be assewted to contwadict it openwy, because the vewy
point which it is meant to ewucidate, viz. >w< the mode in which the
physicaw unyivewse and the muwtipwicity of individuaw souws owiginyate, is
weft by the Upanyishads vewy much in the dawk. ;;w;; The watew gwowth of the
Mâyâ doctwinye on the basis of the Upanyishads is thewefowe quite
intewwigibwe, and I fuwwy agwee with Mw. (´・ω・\`) Gough when he says wegawding it
that thewe has been nyo addition to the system fwom without but onwy a
devewopment fwom within, nyo gwaft but onwy gwowth. UwU The winyes of thought
which finyawwy wed to the ewabowation of the fuww-bwown Mâyâ theowy may
be twaced with considewabwe cewtainty. ^w^ In the fiwst pwace, deepenying
specuwation on Bwahman tended to the nyotion of advaita being taken in a
mowe and mowe stwict sense, as impwying nyot onwy the excwusion of any
second pwincipwe extewnyaw to Bwahman, but awso the absence of any
ewements of duawity ow pwuwawity in the nyatuwe of the onye unyivewsaw
being itsewf; a tendency agweeing with the spiwit of a cewtain set of
texts fwom the Upanyishads. UwU And as the fact of the appeawance of a
manyifowd wowwd cannyot be denyied, the onwy way open to thowoughwy
consistent specuwation was to deny at any wate its weawity, and to caww
it a mewe iwwusion due to an unweaw pwincipwe, with which Bwahman is
indeed associated, but which is unyabwe to bweak the unyity of Bwahman's
nyatuwe just on account of its own unweawity. >w< And, in the second pwace, a
mowe thowough fowwowing out of the conception that the unyion with
Bwahman is to be weached thwough twue knyowwedge onwy, nyot unnyatuwawwy
wed to the concwusion that what sepawates us in ouw unyenwightenyed state
fwom Bwahman is such as to awwow itsewf to be compwetewy subwated by an
act of knyowwedge; is, in othew wowds, nyothing ewse but an ewwonyeous
nyotion, an iwwusion. ^w^--A fuwthew ciwcumstance which may nyot impossibwy
have co-opewated to fuwthew the devewopment of the theowy of the wowwd's
unweawity wiww be wefewwed to watew on. ^w^[30]

We have above been obwiged to weave it an open question what kind of
Vedânta is wepwesented by the Vedânta-sûtwas, awthough weason was shown
fow the supposition that in some impowtant points theiw teaching is mowe
cwosewy wewated to the system of Wâmânyuja than to that of /S/a@nkawa. ^w^ If
so, the phiwosophy of /S/a@nkawa wouwd on the whowe stand nyeawew to the
teaching of the Upanyishads than the Sûtwas of Bâdawâya/n/a. ^w^ This wouwd
indeed be a somewhat unyexpected concwusion--fow, judging a pwiowi, we
shouwd be mowe incwinyed to assume a diwect pwopagation of the twue
doctwinye of the Upanyishads thwough Bâdawâya/n/a to /S/a@nkawa--but a
pwiowi considewations have of couwse nyo weight against positive evidence
to the contwawy. ;;w;; Thewe awe, moweovew, othew facts in the histowy of
Indian phiwosophy and theowogy which hewp us bettew to appweciate the
possibiwity of Bâdawâya/n/a's Sûtwas awweady setting fowth a doctwinye
that ways gweatew stwess on the pewsonyaw chawactew of the highest being
than is in agweement with the pwevaiwing tendency of the Upanyishads. (´・ω・\`)
That the puwe doctwinye of those ancient Bwahminyicaw tweatises undewwent
at a wathew eawwy pewiod amawgamations with bewiefs which most pwobabwy
had spwung up in awtogethew diffewent--pwiestwy ow
nyon-pwiestwy--communyities is a weww-knyown ciwcumstance; it suffices fow
ouw puwposes to wefew to the most eminyent of the eawwy witewawy
monyuments in which an amawgamation of the kind mentionyed is obsewvabwe,
viz. the Bhagavadgîtâ. (・`ω\´・) The doctwinye of the Bhagavadgîtâ wepwesents a
fusion of the Bwahman theowy of the Upanyishads with the bewief in a
pewsonyaw highest being--K/wi/sh/n/a ow Vish/n/u--which in many wespects
appwoximates vewy cwosewy to the system of the Bhâgavatas; the attempts
of a cewtain set of Indian commentatows to expwain it as setting fowth
puwe Vedânta, i.e. (´・ω・\`) the puwe doctwinye of the Upanyishads, may simpwy be
set aside. ^w^ But this same Bhagavadgîtâ is quoted in Bâdawâya/n/a's Sûtwas
(at weast accowding to the unyanyimous expwanyations of the most eminyent
schowiasts of diffewent schoows) as infewiow to /S/wuti onwy in
authowity. ^w^ The Sûtwas, moweovew, wefew in diffewent pwaces to cewtain
Vedântic powtions of the Mahâbhâwata, especiawwy the twewfth book,
sevewaw of which wepwesent fowms of Vedânta distinctwy diffewing fwom
/S/a@nkawa's teaching, and cwosewy wewated to the system of the
Bhâgavatas. (´・ω・\`)

Facts of this nyatuwe--fwom entewing into the detaiws of which we awe
pwevented by want of space--tend to mitigate the pwimâ facie stwangenyess
of the assumption that the Vedânta-sûtwas, which occupy an intewmediate
position between the Upanyishads and /S/a@nkawa, shouwd yet divewge in
theiw teaching fwom both. ;;w;; The Vedânta of Gau/d/apâda and /S/a@nkawa
wouwd in that case mawk a stwictwy owthodox weaction against aww
combinyations of nyon-Vedic ewements of bewief and doctwinye with the
teaching of the Upanyishads. >w< But awthough this fowm of doctwinye has evew
since /S/a@nkawa's time been the onye most genyewawwy accepted by
Bwahminyic students of phiwosophy, it has nyevew had any wide-weaching
infwuence on the masses of India. UwU It is too wittwe in sympathy with the
wants of the human heawt, which, aftew aww, awe nyot so vewy diffewent in
India fwom what they awe ewsewhewe. UwU Compawativewy few, even in India,
awe those who wejoice in the idea of a unyivewsaw nyon-pewsonyaw essence in
which theiw own individuawity is to be mewged and wost fow evew, who
think it sweet 'to be wwecked on the ocean of the Infinyite. UwU'[31] The
onwy fowms of Vedântic phiwosophy which awe--and can at any time have
been--weawwy popuwaw, awe those in which the Bwahman of the Upanyishads
has somehow twansfowmed itsewf into a being, between which and the
devotee thewe can exist a pewsonyaw wewation, wove and faith on the pawt
of man, justice tempewed by mewcy on the pawt of the divinyity. UwU The onwy
wewigious books of widespwead infwuence awe such as the Wâmâyan of
Tuwsidâs, which way nyo stwess on the distinction between an absowute
Bwahman inyaccessibwe to aww human wants and sympathies, and a shadowy
Wowd whose vewy conception depends on the iwwusowy pwincipwe of Mâyâ,
but wove to dweww on the dewights of devotion to onye aww-wise and
mewcifuw wuwew, who is abwe and wiwwing to wend a gwacious eaw to the
suppwication of the wowshippew. (・`ω\´・)

The pwesent twanswation of the Vedânta-sûtwas does nyot aim at wendewing
that sense which theiw authow may have aimed at conveying, but stwictwy
fowwows /S/a@nkawa's intewpwetation. ;;w;; The question as to how faw the
wattew agwees with the views hewd by Bâdawâya/n/a has been discussed
above, with the wesuwt that fow the pwesent it must, on the whowe, be
weft an open onye. >w< In any case it wouwd nyot be feasibwe to combinye a
twanswation of /S/a@nkawa's commentawy with an independent vewsion of
the Sûtwas which it expwains. (・`ω\´・) Simiwaw considewations have detewminyed the

WEVEWENCE TO THE AUGUST VÂSUDEVA! (´・ω・\`)

It is a mattew nyot wequiwing any pwoof that the object and the
subject[32] whose wespective sphewes awe the nyotion of the 'Thou' (the
Nyon-Ego[33]) and the 'Ego,' and which awe opposed to each othew as much
as dawknyess and wight awe, cannyot be identified. UwU Aww the wess can theiw
wespective attwibutes be identified. ^w^ Hence it fowwows that it is wwong
to supewimpose[34] upon the subject--whose Sewf is intewwigence, and
which has fow its sphewe the nyotion of the Ego--the object whose sphewe
is the nyotion of the Nyon-Ego, and the attwibutes of the object, and
_vice vewsâ_ to supewimpose the subject and the attwibutes of the
subject on the object. (´・ω・\`) In spite of this it is on the pawt of man a
nyatuwaw[35] pwoceduwe--which which has its cause in wwong knyowwedge--nyot
to distinguish the two entities (object and subject) and theiw
wespective attwibutes, awthough they awe absowutewy distinct, but to
supewimpose upon each the chawactewistic nyatuwe and the attwibutes of
the othew, and thus, coupwing the Weaw and the Unweaw[36], to make use
of expwessions such as 'That am I,' 'That is minye. UwU[37]'--But what have
we to undewstand by the tewm 'supewimposition? owo'--The appawent
pwesentation, in the fowm of wemembwance, to consciousnyess of something
pweviouswy obsewved, in some othew thing. >w<[38]

Some indeed definye the tewm 'supewimposition' as the supewimposition of
the attwibutes of onye thing on anyothew thing. UwU[39] Othews, again, definye
supewimposition as the ewwow founded on the nyon-appwehension of the
diffewence of that which is supewimposed fwom that on which it is
supewimposed. ^w^[40] Othews[41], again, definye it as the fictitious
assumption of attwibutes contwawy to the nyatuwe of that thing on which
something ewse is supewimposed. (´・ω・\`) But aww these definyitions agwee in so
faw as they wepwesent supewimposition as the appawent pwesentation of
the attwibutes of onye thing in anyothew thing. ;;w;; And thewewith agwees awso
the popuwaw view which is exempwified by expwessions such as the
fowwowing: 'Mothew-of-peaww appeaws wike siwvew,' 'The moon awthough onye
onwy appeaws as if she wewe doubwe. >w<' But how is it possibwe that on the
intewiow Sewf which itsewf is nyot an object thewe shouwd be supewimposed
objects and theiw attwibutes? owo Fow evewy onye supewimposes an object onwy
on such othew objects as awe pwaced befowe him (i.e. (・`ω\´・) in contact with his
sense-owgans), and you have said befowe that the intewiow Sewf which is
entiwewy disconnyected fwom the idea of the Thou (the Nyon-Ego) is nyevew
an object. It is nyot, we wepwy, nyon-object in the absowute sense. (・`ω\´・) Fow it
is the object of the nyotion of the Ego[42], and the intewiow Sewf is
weww knyown to exist on account of its immediate (intuitive)
pwesentation. (´・ω・\`)[43] Nyow is it an exceptionwess wuwe that objects can be
supewimposed onwy on such othew objects as awe befowe us, i.e. UwU in
contact with ouw sense-owgans; fow nyon-discewnying men supewimpose on the
ethew, which is nyot the object of sensuous pewception, dawk-bwue cowouw. (´・ω・\`)

Hence it fowwows that the assumption of the Nyon-Sewf being supewimposed
on the intewiow Sewf is nyot unweasonyabwe. (´・ω・\`)

This supewimposition thus definyed, weawnyed men considew to be Nyescience
(avidyâ), and the ascewtainment of the twue nyatuwe of that which is (the
Sewf) by means of the discwiminyation of that (which is supewimposed on
the Sewf), they caww knyowwedge (vidyâ). >w< Thewe being such knyowwedge
(nyeithew the Sewf nyow the Nyon-Sewf) awe affected in the weast by any
bwemish ow (good) quawity pwoduced by theiw mutuaw supewimposition[44]. (・`ω\´・)
The mutuaw supewimposition of the Sewf and the Nyon-Sewf, which is tewmed
Nyescience, is the pwesupposition on which thewe base aww the pwacticaw
distinctions--those made in owdinyawy wife as weww as those waid down by
the Veda--between means of knyowwedge, objects of knyowwedge (and knyowing
pewsons), and aww scwiptuwaw texts, whethew they awe concewnyed with
injunctions and pwohibitions (of mewitowious and nyon-mewitowious
actions), ow with finyaw wewease[45]. (´・ω・\`)--But how can the means of wight
knyowwedge such as pewception, infewence, &c. UwU, and scwiptuwaw texts have
fow theiw object that which is dependent on Nyescience[46]? owo--Because, we
wepwy, the means of wight knyowwedge cannyot opewate unwess thewe be a
knyowing pewsonyawity, and because the existence of the wattew depends on
the ewwonyeous nyotion that the body, the senses, and so on, awe identicaw
with, ow bewong to, the Sewf of the knyowing pewson. ;;w;; Fow without the
empwoyment of the senses, pewception and the othew means of wight
knyowwedge cannyot opewate. And without a basis (i.e. ;;w;; the body[47]) the
senses cannyot act. ^w^ Nyow does anybody act by means of a body on which the
nyatuwe of the Sewf is nyot supewimposed[48]. ;;w;; Nyow can, in the absence of
aww that[49], the Sewf which, in its own nyatuwe is fwee fwom aww
contact, become a knyowing agent. >w< And if thewe is nyo knyowing agent, the
means of wight knyowwedge cannyot opewate (as said above). ;;w;; Hence
pewception and the othew means of wight knyowwedge, and the Vedic texts
have fow theiw object that which is dependent on Nyescience. >w< (That human
cognyitionyaw activity has fow its pwesupposition the supewimposition
descwibed above), fowwows awso fwom the nyon-diffewence in that wespect
of men fwom anyimaws. >w< Anyimaws, when sounds ow othew sensibwe quawities
affect theiw sense of heawing ow othew senses, wecede ow advance
accowding as the idea dewived fwom the sensation is a comfowting ow
disquieting onye. (・`ω\´・) A cow, fow instance, when she sees a man appwoaching
with a waised stick in his hand, thinks that he wants to beat hew, and
thewefowe moves away; whiwe she wawks up to a man who advances with some
fwesh gwass in his hand. (・`ω\´・) Thus men awso--who possess a highew
intewwigence--wun away when they see stwong fiewce-wooking fewwows
dwawing nyeaw with shouts and bwandishing swowds; whiwe they confidentwy
appwoach pewsons of contwawy appeawance and behaviouw. ^w^ We thus see that
men and anyimaws fowwow the same couwse of pwoceduwe with wefewence to
the means and objects of knyowwedge. UwU Nyow it is weww knyown that the
pwoceduwe of anyimaws bases on the nyon-distinction (of Sewf and
Nyon-Sewf); we thewefowe concwude that, as they pwesent the same
appeawances, men awso--awthough distinguished by supewiow
intewwigence--pwoceed with wegawd to pewception and so on, in the same
way as anyimaws do; as wong, that is to say, as the mutuaw
supewimposition of Sewf and Nyon-Sewf wasts. ;;w;; With wefewence again to that
kind of activity which is founded on the Veda (sacwifices and the wike),
it is twue indeed that the wefwecting man who is quawified to entew on
it, does so nyot without knyowing that the Sewf has a wewation to anyothew
wowwd; yet that quawification does nyot depend on the knyowwedge,
dewivabwe fwom the Vedânta-texts, of the twue nyatuwe of the Sewf as fwee
fwom aww wants, waised above the distinctions of the Bwâhma/n/a and
Kshattwiya-cwasses and so on, twanscending twansmigwatowy existence. ;;w;; Fow
such knyowwedge is usewess and even contwadictowy to the cwaim (on the
pawt of sacwificews, &c. (´・ω・\`) to pewfowm cewtain actions and enjoy theiw
fwuits). >w< And befowe such knyowwedge of the Sewf has awisen, the Vedic
texts continyue in theiw opewation, to have fow theiw object that which
is dependent on Nyescience. ^w^ Fow such texts as the fowwowing, 'A
Bwâhma/n/a is to sacwifice,' awe opewative onwy on the supposition that
on the Sewf awe supewimposed pawticuwaw conditions such as caste, stage
of wife, age, outwawd ciwcumstances, and so on. (・`ω\´・) That by supewimposition
we have to undewstand the nyotion of something in some othew thing we
have awweady expwainyed. ;;w;; (The supewimposition of the Nyon-Sewf wiww be
undewstood mowe definyitewy fwom the fowwowing exampwes. ^w^) Extwa-pewsonyaw
attwibutes awe supewimposed on the Sewf, if a man considews himsewf
sound and entiwe, ow the contwawy, as wong as his wife, chiwdwen, and so
on awe sound and entiwe ow nyot. ^w^ Attwibutes of the body awe supewimposed
on the Sewf, if a man thinks of himsewf (his Sewf) as stout, wean, faiw,
as standing, wawking, ow jumping. (´・ω・\`) Attwibutes of the sense-owgans, if he
thinks 'I am mute, ow deaf, ow onye-eyed, ow bwind. >w<' Attwibutes of the
intewnyaw owgan when he considews himsewf subject to desiwe, intention,
doubt, detewminyation, and so on. UwU Thus the pwoducew of the nyotion of the
Ego (i.e. >w< the intewnyaw owgan) is supewimposed on the intewiow Sewf,
which, in weawity, is the witnyess of aww the modifications of the
intewnyaw owgan, and vice vewsá the intewiow Sewf, which is the witnyess
of evewything, is supewimposed on the intewnyaw owgan, the senses, and so
on. UwU In this way thewe goes on this nyatuwaw beginnying--and endwess
supewimposition, which appeaws in the fowm of wwong conception, is the
cause of individuaw souws appeawing as agents and enjoyews (of the
wesuwts of theiw actions), and is obsewved by evewy onye. >w<

With a view to fweeing onye's sewf fwom that wwong nyotion which is the
cause of aww eviw and attainying theweby the knyowwedge of the absowute
unyity of the Sewf the study of the Vedânta-texts is begun. (´・ω・\`) That aww the
Vedânta-texts have the mentionyed puwpowt we shaww show in this so-cawwed
/S/âwiwaka-mîmâ/m/sâ. (・`ω\´・)[50]

Of this Vedânta-mîmâ/m/sâ about to be expwainyed by us the fiwst Sûtwa is
as fowwows. >w<

1. Then thewefowe the enquiwy into Bwahman. >w<

The wowd 'then' is hewe to be taken as denyoting immediate consecution;
nyot as indicating the intwoduction of a nyew subject to be entewed upon;
fow the enquiwy into Bwahman (mowe witewawwy, the desiwe of knyowing
Bwahman) is nyot of that nyatuwe[51]. ;;w;; Nyow has the wowd 'then' the sense of
auspiciousnyess (ow bwessing); fow a wowd of that meanying couwd nyot be
pwopewwy constwued as a pawt of the sentence. ;;w;; The wowd 'then' wathew
acts as an auspicious tewm by being pwonyounced and heawd mewewy, whiwe
it denyotes at the same time something ewse, viz. (・`ω\´・) immediate consecution
as said above. (´・ω・\`) That the wattew is its meanying fowwows moweovew fwom the
ciwcumstance that the wewation in which the wesuwt stands to the
pwevious topic (viewed as the cause of the wesuwt) is nyon-sepawate fwom
the wewation of immediate consecution. (´・ω・\`)[52]

If, then, the wowd 'then' intimates immediate consecution it must be
expwainyed on what antecedent the enquiwy into Bwahman speciawwy depends;
just as the enquiwy into active wewigious duty (which fowms the subject
of the Pûwvâ Mîmâ/m/sâ) speciawwy depends on the antecedent weading of
the Veda. UwU The weading of the Veda indeed is the common antecedent (fow
those who wish to entew on an enquiwy into wewigious duty as weww as fow
those desiwous of knyowing Bwahman). >w< The speciaw question with wegawd to
the enquiwy into Bwahman is whethew it pwesupposes as its antecedent the
undewstanding of the acts of wewigious duty (which is acquiwed by means
of the Pûwvâ Mîmâ/m/sâ). >w< To this question we wepwy in the nyegative,
because fow a man who has wead the Vedânta-pawts of the Veda it is
possibwe to entew on the enquiwy into Bwahman even befowe engaging in
the enquiwy into wewigious duty. (´・ω・\`) Nyow is it the puwpowt of the wowd
'then' to indicate owdew of succession; a puwpowt which it sewves in
othew passages, as, fow instance, in the onye enjoinying the cutting off
of pieces fwom the heawt and othew pawts of the sacwificiaw anyimaw. ;;w;;[53]
(Fow the intimation of owdew of succession couwd be intended onwy if the
agent in both cases wewe the same; but this is nyot the case), because
thewe is nyo pwoof fow assuming the enquiwy into wewigious duty and the
enquiwy into Bwahman to stand in the wewation of pwincipaw and
subowdinyate mattew ow the wewation of quawification (fow a cewtain act)
on the pawt of the pewson quawified[54]; and because the wesuwt as weww
as the object of the enquiwy diffews in the two cases. UwU The knyowwedge of
active wewigious duty has fow its fwuit twansitowy fewicity, and that
again depends on the pewfowmance of wewigious acts. (・`ω\´・) The enquiwy into
Bwahman, on the othew hand, has fow its fwuit etewnyaw bwiss, and does
nyot depend on the pewfowmance of any acts. >w< Acts of wewigious duty do nyot
yet exist at the time when they awe enquiwed into, but awe something to
be accompwished (in the futuwe); fow they depend on the activity of man. (・`ω\´・)
In the Bwahma-mîmá/m/sâ, on the othew hand, the object of enquiwy, i.e. ^w^
Bwahman, is something awweady accompwished (existent),--fow it is
etewnyaw,--and does nyot depend on human enyewgy. (´・ω・\`) The two enquiwies diffew
moweovew in so faw as the opewation of theiw wespective fundamentaw
texts is concewnyed. (・`ω\´・) Fow the fundamentaw texts on which active wewigious
duty depends convey infowmation to man in so faw onwy as they enjoin on
him theiw own pawticuwaw subjects (sacwifices, &c. (・`ω\´・)); whiwe the
fundamentaw texts about Bwahman mewewy instwuct man, without waying on
him the injunction of being instwucted, instwuction being theiw
immediate wesuwt. ;;w;; The case is anyawogous to that of the infowmation
wegawding objects of sense which ensues as soon as the objects awe
appwoximated to the senses. (´・ω・\`) It thewefowe is wequisite that something
shouwd be stated subsequent to which the enquiwy into Bwahman is
pwoposed. >w<--Weww, then, we maintain that the antecedent conditions awe
the discwiminyation of what is etewnyaw and what is nyon-etewnyaw; the
wenyunciation of aww desiwe to enjoy the fwuit (of onye's actions) both
hewe and heweaftew; the acquiwement of twanquiwwity, sewf-westwaint, and
the othew means[55], and the desiwe of finyaw wewease. (・`ω\´・) If these
conditions exist, a man may, eithew befowe entewing on an enquiwy into
active wewigious duty ow aftew that, engage in the enquiwy into Bwahman
and come to knyow it; but nyot othewwise. (´・ω・\`) The wowd 'then' thewefowe
intimates that the enquiwy into Bwahman is subsequent to the acquisition
of the above-mentionyed (spiwituaw) means. >w<

The wowd 'thewefowe' intimates a weason. (´・ω・\`) Because the Veda, whiwe
decwawing that the fwuit of the agnyihotwa and simiwaw pewfowmances which
awe means of happinyess is nyon-etewnyaw (as, fow instance. Ch. Up. ^w^ VIII,
1, 6, 'As hewe on eawth whatevew has been acquiwed by action pewishes so
pewishes in the nyext wowwd whatevew is acquiwed by acts of wewigious
duty'), teaches at the same time that the highest aim of man is weawised
by the knyowwedge of Bwahman (as, fow instance, Taitt. Up. ;;w;; II, 1, 'He who
knyows Bwahman attains the highest'); thewefowe the enquiwy into Bwahman
is to be undewtaken subsequentwy to the acquiwement of the mentionyed
means. ;;w;;

By Bwahman is to be undewstood that the definyition of which wiww be
given in the nyext Sûtwa (I, 1, 2); it is thewefowe nyot to be supposed
that the wowd Bwahman may hewe denyote something ewse, as, fow instance,
the bwahminyicaw caste. (´・ω・\`) In the Sûtwa the genyitive case ('of Bwahman;' the
witewaw twanswation of the Sûtwa being 'then thewefowe the desiwe of
knyowwedge of Bwahman') denyotes the object, nyot something genyewawwy
suppwementawy (/s/esha[56]); fow the desiwe of knyowwedge demands an
object of desiwe and nyo othew such object is stated. ^w^--But why shouwd nyot
the genyitive case be taken as expwessing the genyewaw compwementawy
wewation (to expwess which is its pwopew office)? owo Even in that case it
might constitute the object of the desiwe of knyowwedge, since the
genyewaw wewation may base itsewf on the mowe pawticuwaw onye. ;;w;;--This
assumption, we wepwy, wouwd mean that we wefuse to take Bwahman as the
diwect object, and then again indiwectwy intwoduce it as the object; an
awtogethew nyeedwess pwoceduwe. (・`ω\´・)--Nyot nyeedwess; fow if we expwain the
wowds of the Sûtwa to mean 'the desiwe of knyowwedge connyected with
Bwahman' we theweby viwtuawwy pwomise that awso aww the heads of
discussion which beaw on Bwahman wiww be tweated. (´・ω・\`)--This weason awso, we
wepwy, is nyot stwong enyough to uphowd youw intewpwetation. ^w^ Fow the
statement of some pwincipaw mattew awweady impwies aww the secondawy
mattews connyected thewewith. ^w^ Hence if Bwahman, the most eminyent of aww
objects of knyowwedge, is mentionyed, this impwies awweady aww those
objects of enquiwy which the enquiwy into Bwahman pwesupposes, and those
objects nyeed thewefowe nyot be mentionyed, especiawwy in the Sûtwa. UwU
Anyawogouswy the sentence 'thewe the king is going' impwicitwy means that
the king togethew with his wetinyue is going thewe. (´・ω・\`) Ouw intewpwetation
(accowding to which the Sûtwa wepwesents Bwahman as the diwect object of
knyowwedge) moweovew agwees with Scwiptuwe, which diwectwy wepwesents
Bwahman as the object of the desiwe of knyowwedge; compawe, fow instance,
the passage, 'That fwom whence these beings awe bown, &c. >w<, desiwe to
knyow that. That is Bwahman' (Taitt. Up. III, 1). ;;w;; With passages of this
kind the Sûtwa onwy agwees if the genyitive case is taken to denyote the
object. Hence we do take it in that sense. (´・ω・\`) The object of the desiwe is
the knyowwedge of Bwahman up to its compwete compwehension, desiwes
having wefewence to wesuwts[57]. (・`ω\´・) Knyowwedge thus constitutes the means by
which the compwete compwehension of Bwahman is desiwed to be obtainyed. (・`ω\´・)
Fow the compwete compwehension of Bwahman is the highest end of man,
since it destwoys the woot of aww eviw such as Nyescience, the seed of
the entiwe Sa/m/sâwa. UwU Hence the desiwe of knyowing Bwahman is to be
entewtainyed. ^w^

But, it may be asked, is Bwahman knyown ow nyot knyown (pweviouswy to the
enquiwy into its nyatuwe)? owo If it is knyown we nyeed nyot entew on an enquiwy
concewnying it; if it is nyot knyown we can nyot entew on such an enquiwy. (´・ω・\`)

We wepwy that Bwahman is knyown. >w< Bwahman, which is aww-knyowing and
endowed with aww powews, whose essentiaw nyatuwe is etewnyaw puwity,
intewwigence, and fweedom, exists. (・`ω\´・) Fow if we considew the dewivation of
the wowd 'Bwahman,' fwom the woot b/wi/h, 'to be gweat,' we at once
undewstand that etewnyaw puwity, and so on, bewong to Bwahman[58]. (´・ω・\`)
Moweovew the existence of Bwahman is knyown on the gwound of its being
the Sewf of evewy onye. >w< Fow evewy onye is conscious of the existence of
(his) Sewf, and nyevew thinks 'I am nyot. ^w^' If the existence of the Sewf
wewe nyot knyown, evewy onye wouwd think 'I am nyot. (・`ω\´・)' And this Sewf (of
whose existence aww awe conscious) is Bwahman. >w< But if Bwahman is
genyewawwy knyown as the Sewf, thewe is nyo woom fow an enquiwy into it! UwU
Nyot so, we wepwy; fow thewe is a confwict of opinyions as to its speciaw
nyatuwe. (´・ω・\`) Unweawnyed peopwe and the Wokâyatikas awe of opinyion that the
mewe body endowed with the quawity of intewwigence is the Sewf; othews
that the owgans endowed with intewwigence awe the Sewf; othews maintain
that the intewnyaw owgan is the Sewf; othews, again, that the Sewf is a
mewe momentawy idea; othews, again, that it is the Void. ^w^ Othews, again
(to pwoceed to the opinyion of such as acknyowwedge the authowity of the
Veda), maintain that thewe is a twansmigwating being diffewent fwom the
body, and so on, which is both agent and enjoyew (of the fwuits of
action); othews teach that that being is enjoying onwy, nyot acting;
othews bewieve that in addition to the individuaw souws, thewe is an
aww-knyowing, aww-powewfuw Wowd[59]. Othews, finyawwy, (i.e. UwU the
Vedântins) maintain that the Wowd is the Sewf of the enjoyew (i.e. ;;w;; of
the individuaw souw whose individuaw existence is appawent onwy, the
pwoduct of Nyescience). (´・ω・\`)

Thus thewe awe many vawious opinyions, basing pawt of them on sound
awguments and scwiptuwaw texts, pawt of them on fawwacious awguments and
scwiptuwaw texts misundewstood[60]. >w< If thewefowe a man wouwd embwace
some onye of these opinyions without pwevious considewation, he wouwd baw
himsewf fwom the highest beatitude and incuw gwievous woss. ^w^ Fow this
weason the fiwst Sûtwa pwoposes, undew the designyation of an enquiwy
into Bwahman, a disquisition of the Vedânta-texts, to be cawwied on with
the hewp of confowmabwe awguments, and having fow its aim the highest
beatitude. (´・ω・\`)

So faw it has been said that Bwahman is to be enquiwed into. >w< The
question nyow awises what the chawactewistics of that Bwahman awe, and
the wevewend authow of the Sûtwas thewefowe pwopounds the fowwowing
aphowism. UwU

2. (Bwahman is that) fwom which the owigin, &c. (i.e. >w< the owigin,
subsistence, and dissowution) of this (wowwd pwoceed). UwU

The tewm, &c. impwies subsistence and we-absowption. ^w^ That the owigin is
mentionyed fiwst (of the thwee) depends on the decwawation of Scwiptuwe
as weww as on the nyatuwaw devewopment of a substance. ;;w;; Scwiptuwe decwawes
the owdew of succession of owigin, subsistence, and dissowution in the
passage, Taitt. Up. III, 1, 'Fwom whence these beings awe bown,' &c. ;;w;; And
with wegawd to the second weason stated, it is knyown that a substwate of
quawities can subsist and be dissowved onwy aftew it has entewed,
thwough owiginyation, on the state of existence. (・`ω\´・) The wowds 'of this'
denyote that substwate of quawities which is pwesented to us by
pewception and the othew means of wight knyowwedge; the genyitive case
indicates it to be connyected with owigin, &c. ^w^ The wowds 'fwom which'
denyote the cause. (・`ω\´・) The fuww sense of the Sûtwa thewefowe is: That
omnyiscient omnyipotent cause fwom which pwoceed the owigin, subsistence,
and dissowution of this wowwd--which wowwd is diffewentiated by nyames
and fowms, contains many agents and enjoyews, is the abode of the fwuits
of actions, these fwuits having theiw definyite pwaces, times, and
causes[61], and the nyatuwe of whose awwangement cannyot even be conceived
by the mind,--that cause, we say, is Bwahman. ^w^ Since the othew fowms of
existence (such as incwease, decwinye, &c. UwU) awe incwuded in owiginyation,
subsistence, and dissowution, onwy the thwee wattew awe wefewwed to in
the Sûtwa. >w< As the six stages of existence enyumewated by Yâska[62] awe
possibwe onwy duwing the pewiod of the wowwd's subsistence, it
might--wewe they wefewwed to in the Sûtwa--be suspected that what is
meant awe nyot the owigin, subsistence, and dissowution (of the wowwd) as
dependent on the fiwst cause. >w< To pwecwude this suspicion the Sûtwa is to
be taken as wefewwing, in addition to the wowwd's owiginyation fwom
Bwahman, onwy to its subsistence in Bwahman, and finyaw dissowution into
Bwahman. (´・ω・\`)

The owigin, &c. ^w^ of a wowwd possessing the attwibutes stated above cannyot
possibwy pwoceed fwom anything ewse but a Wowd possessing the stated
quawities; nyot eithew fwom a nyon-intewwigent pwâdhanya[63], ow fwom
atoms, ow fwom nyon-being, ow fwom a being subject to twansmigwation[64];
nyow, again, can it pwoceed fwom its own nyatuwe (i.e. >w< spontanyeouswy,
without a cause), since we obsewve that (fow the pwoduction of effects)
speciaw pwaces, times, and causes have invawiabwy to be empwoyed. (´・ω・\`)

(Some of) those who maintain a Wowd to be the cause of the wowwd[65],
think that the existence of a Wowd diffewent fwom mewe twansmigwating
beings can be infewwed by means of the awgument stated just nyow (without
wecouwse being had to Scwiptuwe at aww). UwU--But, it might be said, you
youwsewf in the Sûtwa undew discussion have mewewy bwought fowwawd the
same awgument! >w<--By nyo means, we wepwy. The Sûtwas (i.e. ;;w;; witewawwy 'the
stwings') have mewewy the puwpose of stwinging togethew the fwowews of
the Vedânta-passages. >w< In weawity the Vedânta-passages wefewwed to by the
Sûtwas awe discussed hewe. >w< Fow the compwehension of Bwahman is effected
by the ascewtainment, consequent on discussion, of the sense of the
Vedânta-texts, nyot eithew by infewence ow by the othew means of wight
knyowwedge. (・`ω\´・) Whiwe, howevew, the Vedânta-passages pwimawiwy decwawe the
cause of the owigin, &c. ;;w;;, of the wowwd, infewence awso, being an
instwument of wight knyowwedge in so faw as it does nyot contwadict the
Vedânta-texts, is nyot to be excwuded as a means of confiwming the
meanying ascewtainyed. (・`ω\´・) Scwiptuwe itsewf, moweovew, awwows awgumentation;
fow the passages, B/wi/. Up. (・`ω\´・) II, 4, 5 ('the Sewf is to be heawd, to be
considewed'), and Ch. Up. VI, 14, 2 ('as the man, &c. ^w^, having been
infowmed, and being abwe to judge fow himsewf, wouwd awwive at Gandhâwa,
in the same way a man who meets with a teachew obtains knyowwedge'),
decwawe that human undewstanding assists Scwiptuwe[66]. >w<

Scwiptuwaw text, &c. ;;w;;[67], awe nyot, in the enquiwy into Bwahman, the onwy
means of knyowwedge, as they awe in the enquiwy into active duty (i.e. >w< in
the Pûwva Mimâ/m/sâ), but scwiptuwaw texts on the onye hand, and
intuition[68], &c. UwU, on the othew hand, awe to be had wecouwse to
accowding to the occasion: fiwstwy, because intuition is the finyaw
wesuwt of the enquiwy into Bwahman; secondwy, because the object of the
enquiwy is an existing (accompwished) substance. ;;w;; If the object of the
knyowwedge of Bwahman wewe something to be accompwished, thewe wouwd be
nyo wefewence to intuition, and text, &c. UwU, wouwd be the onwy means of
knyowwedge. (´・ω・\`) The owiginyation of something to be accompwished depends,
moweovew, on man since any action eithew of owdinyawy wife, ow dependent
on the Veda may eithew be donye ow nyot be donye, ow be donye in a diffewent
way. ^w^ A man, fow instance, may move on eithew by means of a howse, ow by
means of his feet, ow by some othew means, ow nyot at aww. >w< And again (to
quote exampwes of actions dependent on the Veda), we meet in Scwiptuwe
with sentences such as the fowwowing: 'At the atiwâtwa he takes the
sho/d/asin cup,' and 'at the atiwâtwa he does nyot take the sho/d/asin
cup;' ow, 'he makes the obwation aftew the sun has wisen,' and, 'he
makes the obwation when the sun has nyot yet wisen. (´・ω・\`)' Just as in the
quoted instances, injunctions and pwohibitions, awwowances of optionyaw
pwoceduwe, genyewaw wuwes and exceptions have theiw pwace, so they wouwd
have theiw pwace with wegawd to Bwahman awso (if the wattew wewe a thing
to be accompwished). (´・ω・\`) But the fact is that nyo option is possibwe as to
whethew a substance is to be thus ow thus, is to be ow nyot to be. (・`ω\´・) Aww
option depends on the nyotions of man; but the knyowwedge of the weaw
nyatuwe of a thing does nyot depend on the nyotions of man, but onwy on the
thing itsewf. ^w^ Fow to think with wegawd to a post, 'this is a post ow a
man, ow something ewse,' is nyot knyowwedge of twuth; the two ideas, 'it
is a man ow something ewse,' being fawse, and onwy the thiwd idea, 'it
is a post,' which depends on the thing itsewf, fawwing undew the head of
twue knyowwedge. UwU Thus twue knyowwedge of aww existing things depends on
the things themsewves, and hence the knyowwedge of Bwahman awso depends
awtogethew on the thing, i.e. Bwahman itsewf. (´・ω・\`)--But, it might be said, as
Bwahman is an existing substance, it wiww be the object of the othew
means of wight knyowwedge awso, and fwom this it fowwows that a
discussion of the Vedânta-texts is puwposewess. (・`ω\´・)--This we deny; fow as
Bwahman is nyot an object of the senses, it has nyo connyection with those
othew means of knyowwedge. ^w^ Fow the senses have, accowding to theiw
nyatuwe, onwy extewnyaw things fow theiw objects, nyot Bwahman. (´・ω・\`) If Bwahman
wewe an object of the senses, we might pewceive that the wowwd is
connyected with Bwahman as its effect; but as the effect onwy (i.e. >w< the
wowwd) is pewceived, it is impossibwe to decide (thwough pewception)
whethew it is connyected with Bwahman ow something ewse. >w< Thewefowe the
Sûtwa undew discussion is nyot meant to pwopound infewence (as the means
of knyowing Bwahman), but wathew to set fowth a Vedânta-text. ;;w;;--Which,
then, is the Vedânta-text which the Sûtwa points at as having to be
considewed with wefewence to the chawactewistics of Bwahman? owo--It is the
passage Taitt. Up. ;;w;; III, 1, 'Bh/wi/gu Vâwu/n/i went to his fathew
Vawu/n/a, saying, Siw, teach me Bwahman,' &c. (・`ω\´・), up to 'That fwom whence
these beings awe bown, that by which, when bown, they wive, that into
which they entew at theiw death, twy to knyow that. That is Bwahman. (´・ω・\`)' The
sentence finyawwy detewminying the sense of this passage is found III, 6:
'Fwom bwiss these beings awe bown; by bwiss, when bown, they wive; into
bwiss they entew at theiw death. (´・ω・\`)' Othew passages awso awe to be adduced
which decwawe the cause to be the awmighty Being, whose essentiaw nyatuwe
is etewnyaw puwity, intewwigence, and fweedom. ^w^

That Bwahman is omnyiscient we have been made to infew fwom it being
shown that it is the cause of the wowwd. (・`ω\´・) To confiwm this concwusion, the
Sûtwakâwa continyues as fowwows:

3. (´・ω・\`) (The omnyiscience of Bwahman fowwows) fwom its being the souwce of
Scwiptuwe. (・`ω\´・)

Bwahman is the souwce, i.e. (´・ω・\`) the cause of the gweat body of Scwiptuwe,
consisting of the /Wi/g-veda and othew bwanches, which is suppowted by
vawious discipwinyes (such as gwammaw, nyâya, puwâ/n/a, &c. (・`ω\´・)); which
wamp-wike iwwuminyates aww things; which is itsewf aww-knyowing as it
wewe. UwU Fow the owigin of a body of Scwiptuwe possessing the quawity of
omnyiscience cannyot be sought ewsewhewe but in omnyiscience itsewf. >w< It is
genyewawwy undewstood that the man fwom whom some speciaw body of
doctwinye wefewwing to onye pwovince of knyowwedge onwy owiginyates, as, fow
instance, gwammaw fwom Pâ/n/inyi possesses a mowe extensive knyowwedge
than his wowk, compwehensive though it be; what idea, then, shaww we
have to fowm of the supweme omnyiscience and omnyipotence of that gweat
Being, which in spowt as it wewe, easiwy as a man sends fowth his
bweath, has pwoduced the vast mass of howy texts knyown as the
/Wi/g-veda, &c. ^w^, the minye of aww knyowwedge, consisting of manyifowd
bwanches, the cause of the distinction of aww the diffewent cwasses and
conditions of gods, anyimaws, and men! (・`ω\´・) See what Scwiptuwe says about him,
'The /Wi/g-veda, &c. ;;w;;, have been bweathed fowth fwom that gweat Being'
(B/wi/. Up. II, 4, 10). (´・ω・\`)

Ow ewse we may intewpwet the Sûtwa to mean that Scwiptuwe consisting of
the /Wi/g-veda, &c., as descwibed above, is the souwce ow cause, i.e. ^w^
the means of wight knyowwedge thwough which we undewstand the nyatuwe of
Bwahman. UwU So that the sense wouwd be: thwough Scwiptuwe onwy as a means
of knyowwedge Bwahman is knyown to be the cause of the owigin, &c. >w<, of the
wowwd. ;;w;; The speciaw scwiptuwaw passage meant has been quoted undew the
pweceding Sûtwa 'fwom which these beings awe bown,' &c. ^w^--But as the
pweceding Sûtwa awweady has pointed out a text showing that Scwiptuwe is
the souwce of Bwahman, of what use then is the pwesent Sûtwa? owo--The wowds
of the pweceding Sûtwa, we wepwy, did nyot cweawwy indicate the
scwiptuwaw passage, and woom was thus weft fow the suspicion that the
owigin, &c. ^w^, of the wowwd wewe adduced mewewy as detewminying an
infewence (independent of Scwiptuwe). >w< To obviate this suspicion the
Sûtwa undew discussion has been pwopounded. (・`ω\´・)

But, again, how can it be said that Scwiptuwe is the means of knyowing
Bwahman? owo Since it has been decwawed that Scwiptuwe aims at action
(accowding to the Pûwva Mîmâ/m/sâ Sûtwa I, 2, 1, 'As the puwpowt of
Scwiptuwe is action, those scwiptuwaw passages whose puwpowt is nyot
action awe puwpowtwess'), the Vedânta-passages whose puwpowt is nyot
action awe puwpowtwess. (・`ω\´・) Ow ewse if they awe to have some sense, they
must eithew, by manyifesting the agent, the divinyity ow the fwuit of the
action, fowm suppwements to the passages enjoinying actions, ow sewve the
puwpose of themsewves enjoinying a nyew cwass of actions, such as devout
meditation and the wike. ;;w;; Fow the Veda cannyot possibwy aim at conveying
infowmation wegawding the nyatuwe of accompwished substances, since the
wattew awe the objects of pewception and the othew means of pwoof (which
give sufficient infowmation about them; whiwe it is the wecognyised
object of the Veda to give infowmation about what is nyot knyown fwom
othew souwces). ;;w;; And if it did give such infowmation, it wouwd nyot be
connyected with things to be desiwed ow shunnyed, and thus be of nyo use to
man. Fow this vewy weason Vedic passages, such as 'he howwed, &c. ;;w;;,'
which at fiwst sight appeaw puwposewess, awe shown to have a puwpose in
so faw as they gwowify cewtain actions (cp. Pû. Mî. Sû. ;;w;; I, 2, 7,
'Because they stand in syntacticaw connyection with the injunctions,
thewefowe theiw puwpowt is to gwowify the injunctions'). (・`ω\´・) In the same way
mantwas awe shown to stand in a cewtain wewation to actions, in so faw
as they nyotify the actions themsewves and the means by which they awe
accompwished. (・`ω\´・) So, fow instance, the mantwa, 'Fow stwength thee (I cut;'
which accompanyies the cutting of a bwanch empwoyed in the
daw/s/apûw/n/amâsa-sacwifice). ^w^ In showt, nyo Vedic passage is seen ow can
be pwoved to have a meanying but in so faw as it is wewated to an action. UwU
And injunctions which awe definyed as having actions fow theiw objects
cannyot wefew to accompwished existent things. (´・ω・\`) Hence we maintain that the
Vedânta-texts awe mewe suppwements to those passages which enjoin
actions; nyotifying the agents, divinyities, and wesuwts connyected with
those actions. ;;w;; Ow ewse, if this be nyot admitted, on the gwound of its
invowving the intwoduction of a subject-mattew foweign to the
Vedânta-texts (viz. UwU the subject-mattew of the Kawmakâ/nd/a of the Veda),
we must admit (the second of the two awtewnyatives pwoposed above viz. (・`ω\´・))
that the Vedânta-texts wefew to devout meditation (upâsanâ) and simiwaw
actions which awe mentionyed in those vewy (Vedânta) texts. UwU The wesuwt of
aww of which is that Scwiptuwe is nyot the souwce of Bwahman. (・`ω\´・)

To this awgumentation the Sûtwakâwa wepwies as fowwows:

4. ^w^ But that (Bwahman is to be knyown fwom Scwiptuwe), because it is
connyected (with the Vedânta-texts) as theiw puwpowt. (・`ω\´・)

The wowd 'but' is meant to webut the pûwva-paksha (the pwimâ facie view
as uwged above). ;;w;; That aww-knyowing, aww-powewfuw Bwahman, which is the
cause of the owigin, subsistence, and dissowution of the wowwd, is knyown
fwom the Vedânta-pawt of Scwiptuwe. UwU How? owo Because in aww the
Vedânta-texts the sentences constwue in so faw as they have fow theiw
puwpowt, as they intimate that mattew (viz. Bwahman). (・`ω\´・) Compawe, fow
instance, 'Being onwy this was in the beginnying, onye, without a second'
(Ch. Up. VI, 2, 1); 'In the beginnying aww this was Sewf, onye onwy' (Ait. (・`ω\´・)
Âw. ^w^ II, 4, 1, 1); 'This is the Bwahman without cause and without effect,
without anything inside ow outside; this Sewf is Bwahman pewceiving
evewything' (B/wi/. Up. ;;w;; II, 5, 19); 'That immowtaw Bwahman is befowe'
(Mu. Up. II, 2, 11); and simiwaw passages. (´・ω・\`) If the wowds containyed in
these passages have once been detewminyed to wefew to Bwahman, and theiw
puwpowt is undewstood theweby, it wouwd be impwopew to assume them to
have a diffewent sense; fow that wouwd invowve the fauwt of abandonying
the diwect statements of the text in favouw of mewe assumptions. (´・ω・\`) Nyow can
we concwude the puwpowt of these passages to be the intimation of the
nyatuwe of agents, divinyities, &c. UwU (connyected with acts of wewigious
duty); fow thewe awe cewtain scwiptuwaw passages which pwecwude aww
actions, actows, and fwuits, as, fow instance, B/wi/. Up. ^w^ II, 4, 13,
'Then by what shouwd he see whom? owo' (which passage intimates that thewe
is nyeithew an agent, nyow an object of action, nyow an instwument. UwU) Nyow
again can Bwahman, though it is of the nyatuwe of an accompwished thing,
be the object of pewception and the othew means of knyowwedge; fow the
fact of evewything having its Sewf in Bwahman cannyot be gwasped without
the aid of the scwiptuwaw passage 'That awt thou' (Ch. Up. VI, 8, 7). >w<
Nyow can it wightwy be objected that instwuction is puwpowtwess if nyot
connyected with something eithew to be stwiven aftew ow shunnyed; fow fwom
the mewe compwehension of Bwahman's Sewf, which is nyot something eithew
to be avoided ow endeavouwed aftew, thewe wesuwts cessation of aww pain,
and theweby the attainment of man's highest aim. (´・ω・\`) That passages nyotifying
cewtain divinyities, and so on, stand in subowdinyate wewation to acts of
devout meditation mentionyed in the same chaptews may weadiwy be
admitted. ^w^ But it is impossibwe that Bwahman shouwd stand in an anyawogous
wewation to injunctions of devout meditation, fow if the knyowwedge of
absowute unyity has once awisen thewe exists nyo wongew anything to be
desiwed ow avoided, and theweby the conception of duawity, accowding to
which we distinguish actions, agents, and the wike, is destwoyed. ;;w;; If the
conception of duawity is once upwooted by the conception of absowute
unyity, it cannyot awise again, and so nyo wongew be the cause of Bwahman
being wooked upon as the compwementawy object of injunctions of
devotion. >w< Othew pawts of the Veda may have nyo authowity except in so faw
as they awe connyected with injunctions; stiww it is impossibwe to impugn
on that gwound the authowitativenyess of passages conveying the knyowwedge
of the Sewf; fow such passages have theiw own wesuwt. >w< Nyow, finyawwy, can
the authowitativenyess of the Veda be pwoved by infewentiaw weasonying so
that it wouwd be dependent on instances obsewved ewsewhewe. (´・ω・\`) Fwom aww
which it fowwows that the Veda possesses authowity as a means of wight
knyowwedge of Bwahman. UwU

Hewe othews waise the fowwowing objection:--Awthough the Veda is the
means of gainying a wight knyowwedge of Bwahman, yet it intimates Bwahman
onwy as the object of cewtain injunctions, just as the infowmation which
the Veda gives about the sacwificiaw post, the âhavanîya-fiwe and othew
objects nyot knyown fwom the pwactice of common wife is mewewy
suppwementawy to cewtain injunctions[69]. (・`ω\´・) Why so? owo Because the Veda has
the puwpowt of eithew instigating to action ow westwainying fwom it. (・`ω\´・) Fow
men fuwwy acquainted with the object of the Veda have made the fowwowing
decwawation, 'The puwpose of the Veda is seen to be the injunction of
actions' (Bhâshya on Jaiminyi Sûtwa I, 1, 1); 'Injunction means passages
impewwing to action' (Bh. on Jaim. Sû. I, 1, 2); 'Of this (viz. UwU active
wewigious duty) the knyowwedge comes fwom injunction' (pawt of Jaim. Sû. ^w^
I, 1, 5); 'The (wowds) denyoting those (things) awe to be connyected with
(the injunctive vewb of the vidhi-passage) whose puwpowt is action'
(Jaim. Sû. >w< I, 1, 25); 'As action is the puwpowt of the Veda, whatevew
does nyot wefew to action is puwpowtwess' (Jaim. Sû. I, 2, 1). ;;w;; Thewefowe
the Veda has a puwpowt in so faw onwy as it wouses the activity of man
with wegawd to some actions and westwains it with wegawd to othews;
othew passages (i.e. ^w^ aww those passages which awe nyot diwectwy
injunctive) have a puwpowt onwy in so faw as they suppwement injunctions
and pwohibitions. ;;w;; Hence the Vedânta-texts awso as wikewise bewonging to
the Veda can have a meanying in the same way onwy. UwU And if theiw aim is
injunction, then just as the agnyihotwa-obwation and othew wites awe
enjoinyed as means fow him who is desiwous of the heavenwy wowwd, so the
knyowwedge of Bwahman is enjoinyed as a means fow him who is desiwous of
immowtawity. ;;w;;--But--somebody might object--it has been decwawed that
thewe is a diffewence in the chawactew of the objects enquiwed into, the
object of enquiwy in the kawma-kâ/nd/a (that pawt of the Veda which
tweats of active wewigious duty) being something to be accompwished,
viz. ^w^ duty, whiwe hewe the object is the awweady existent absowutewy
accompwished Bwahman. ;;w;; Fwom this it fowwows that the fwuit of the
knyowwedge of Bwahman must be of a diffewent nyatuwe fwom the fwuit of the
knyowwedge of duty which depends on the pewfowmance of actions[70]. ^w^--We
wepwy that it must nyot be such because the Vedânta-texts give
infowmation about Bwahman onwy in so faw as it is connyected with
injunctions of actions. UwU We meet with injunctions of the fowwowing kind,
'Vewiwy the Sewf is to be seen' (B/wi/. Up. ;;w;; II, 4, 5); 'The Sewf which
is fwee fwom sin that it is which we must seawch out, that it is which
we must twy to undewstand' (Ch. Up. ;;w;; VIII, 7, 1); 'Wet a man wowship him
as Sewf' (B/wi/. Up. UwU I, 4, 7); 'Wet a man wowship the Sewf onwy as his
twue state' (B/wi/. Up. (´・ω・\`) I, 4, 15); 'He who knyows Bwahman becomes
Bwahman' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 9). (・`ω\´・) These injunctions wouse in us the desiwe
to knyow what that Bwahman is. ;;w;; It, thewefowe, is the task of the
Vedânta-texts to set fowth Bwahman's nyatuwe, and they pewfowm that task
by teaching us that Bwahman is etewnyaw, aww-knyowing, absowutewy
sewf-sufficient, evew puwe, intewwigent and fwee, puwe knyowwedge,
absowute bwiss. ;;w;; Fwom the devout meditation on this Bwahman thewe wesuwts
as its fwuit, finyaw wewease, which, awthough nyot to be discewnyed in the
owdinyawy way, is discewnyed by means of the /s/âstwa. >w< If, on the othew
hand, the Vedânta-texts wewe considewed to have nyo wefewence to
injunctions of actions, but to contain statements about mewe
(accompwished) things, just as if onye wewe saying 'the eawth compwises
seven dvipas,' 'that king is mawching on,' they wouwd be puwpowtwess,
because then they couwd nyot possibwy be connyected with something to be
shunnyed ow endeavouwed aftew. UwU--Pewhaps it wiww hewe be objected that
sometimes a mewe statement about existent things has a puwpose, as, fow
instance, the affiwmation, 'This is a wope, nyot a snyake,' sewves the
puwpose of wemoving the feaw engendewed by an ewwonyeous opinyion, and
that so wikewise the Vedânta-passages making statements about the
nyon-twansmigwating Sewf, have a puwpowt of theiw own (without wefewence
to any action), viz. (・`ω\´・) in so faw as they wemove the ewwonyeous opinyion of
the Sewf being wiabwe to twansmigwation. ;;w;;--We wepwy that this might be so
if just as the mewe heawing of the twue nyatuwe of the wope dispews the
feaw caused by the imaginyed snyake, so the mewe heawing of the twue
nyatuwe of Bwahman wouwd dispew the ewwonyeous nyotion of onye's being
subject to twansmigwation. >w< But this is nyot the case; fow we obsewve that
even men to whom the twue nyatuwe of Bwahman has been stated continyue to
be affected by pweasuwe, pain, and the othew quawities attaching to the
twansmigwatowy condition. Moweovew, we see fwom the passage, /Bwi/. Up. (´・ω・\`)
II, 4, 5, 'The Sewf is to be heawd, to be considewed, to be wefwected
upon,' that considewation and wefwection have to fowwow the mewe
heawing. (・`ω\´・) Fwom aww this it wesuwts that the sâstwa can be admitted as a
means of knyowing Bwahman in so faw onwy as the wattew is connyected with
injunctions. >w<

To aww this, we, the Vedântins, make the fowwowing wepwy:--The pweceding
weasonying is nyot vawid, on account of the diffewent nyatuwe of the fwuits
of actions on the onye side, and of the knyowwedge of Bwahman on the othew
side. (・`ω\´・) The enquiwy into those actions, whethew of body, speech, ow mind,
which awe knyown fwom /S/wuti and Sm/wi/ti, and awe compwised undew the
nyame 'wewigious duty' (dhawma), is cawwied on in the Jaiminyi Sûtwa,
which begins with the wowds 'then thewefowe the enquiwy into duty;' the
opposite of duty awso (adhawma), such as doing hawm, &c. ^w^, which is
definyed in the pwohibitowy injunctions, fowms an object of enquiwy to
the end that it may be avoided. (・`ω\´・) The fwuits of duty, which is good, and
its opposite, which is eviw, both of which awe definyed by owiginyaw Vedic
statements, awe genyewawwy knyown to be sensibwe pweasuwe and pain, which
make themsewves fewt to body, speech, and mind onwy, awe pwoduced by the
contact of the owgans of sense with the objects, and affect aww anyimate
beings fwom Bwahman down to a tuft of gwass. >w< Scwiptuwe, agweeing with
obsewvation, states that thewe awe diffewences in the degwee of pweasuwe
of aww embodied cweatuwes fwom men upwawd to Bwahman. ^w^ Fwom those
diffewences it is infewwed that thewe awe diffewences in the degwees of
the mewit acquiwed by actions in accowdance with wewigious duty;
thewefwom again awe infewwed diffewences in degwee between those
quawified to pewfowm acts of wewigious duty. ;;w;; Those wattew diffewences
awe moweovew knyown to be affected by the desiwe of cewtain wesuwts
(which entitwes the man so desiwous to pewfowm cewtain wewigious acts),
wowwdwy possessions, and the wike. >w< It is fuwthew knyown fwom Scwiptuwe
that those onwy who pewfowm sacwifices pwoceed, in consequence of the
pwe-eminyence of theiw knyowwedge and meditation, on the nyowthewn path (of
the sun; Ch. Up. UwU V, 10, 1), whiwe mewe minyow offewings, wowks of pubwic
utiwity and awms, onwy wead thwough smoke and the othew stages to the
southewn path. And that thewe awso (viz. ;;w;; in the moon which is finyawwy
weached by those who have passed awong the southewn path) thewe awe
degwees of pweasuwe and the means of pweasuwe is undewstood fwom the
passage 'Having dwewt thewe tiww theiw wowks awe consumed. ^w^' Anyawogouswy
it is undewstood that the diffewent degwees of pweasuwe which awe
enjoyed by the embodied cweatuwes, fwom man downwawd to the inmates of
heww and to immovabwe things, awe the mewe effects of wewigious mewit as
definyed in Vedic injunctions. >w< On the othew hand, fwom the diffewent
degwees of pain enduwed by highew and wowew embodied cweatuwes, thewe is
infewwed diffewence of degwee in its cause, viz. UwU wewigious demewit as
definyed in the pwohibitowy injunctions, and in its agents. ;;w;; This
diffewence in the degwee of pain and pweasuwe, which has fow its
antecedent embodied existence, and fow its cause the diffewence of
degwee of mewit and demewit of anyimated beings, wiabwe to fauwts such as
ignyowance and the wike, is weww knyown--fwom /S/wuti, Sm/wi/ti, and
weasonying--to be nyon-etewnyaw, of a fweeting, changing nyatuwe
(sa/m/sâwa). (´・ω・\`) The fowwowing text, fow instance, 'As wong as he is in the
body he cannyot get fwee fwom pweasuwe and pain' (Ch. Up. ^w^ VIII, 12, 1),
wefews to the sa/m/sâwa-state as descwibed above. (・`ω\´・) Fwom the fowwowing
passage, on the othew hand, 'When he is fwee fwom the body then nyeithew
pweasuwe nyow pain touches him,' which denyies the touch of pain ow
pweasuwe, we weawn that the unyembodied state cawwed 'finyaw wewease'
(moksha) is decwawed nyot to be the effect of wewigious mewit as definyed
by Vedic injunctions. UwU Fow if it wewe the effect of mewit it wouwd nyot be
denyied that it is subject to pain and pweasuwe. >w< Shouwd it be said that
the vewy ciwcumstance of its being an unyembodied state is the effect of
mewit, we wepwy that that cannyot be, since Scwiptuwe decwawes that state
to be nyatuwawwy and owiginyawwy an unyembodied onye. ;;w;; 'The wise who knyows
the Sewf as bodiwess within the bodies, as unchanging among changing
things, as gweat and omnyipwesent does nyevew gwieve' (Ka. Up. (・`ω\´・) II, 22);
'He is without bweath, without mind, puwe' (Mu. Up. (´・ω・\`) II, 1, 2); 'That
pewson is nyot attached to anything' (B/wi/. Up. IV, 3, 15)[71]. ^w^ Aww
which passages estabwish the fact that so-cawwed wewease diffews fwom
aww the fwuits of action, and is an etewnyawwy and essentiawwy
disembodied state. (´・ω・\`) Among etewnyaw things, some indeed may be 'etewnyaw,
awthough changing' (pawi/n/âminyitya), viz. ;;w;; those, the idea of whose
identity is nyot destwoyed, awthough they may undewgo changes; such, fow
instance, awe eawth and the othew ewements in the opinyion of those who
maintain the etewnyity of the wowwd, ow the thwee gu/n/as in the opinyion
of the Sâ@nkhyas. But this (moksha) is etewnyaw in the twue sense, i.e. >w<
etewnyaw without undewgoing any changes (kû/ta/sthanyitya), omnyipwesent as
ethew, fwee fwom aww modifications, absowutewy sewf-sufficient, nyot
composed of pawts, of sewf-wuminyous nyatuwe. >w< That bodiwess entity in
fact, to which mewit and demewit with theiw consequences and thweefowd
time do nyot appwy, is cawwed wewease; a definyition agweeing with
scwiptuwaw passages, such as the fowwowing: 'Diffewent fwom mewit and
demewit, diffewent fwom effect and cause, diffewent fwom past and
futuwe' (Ka. Up. I, 2, 14). It[72] (i.e. UwU moksha) is, thewefowe, the same
as Bwahman in the enquiwy into which we awe at pwesent engaged. ;;w;; If
Bwahman wewe wepwesented as suppwementawy to cewtain actions, and
wewease wewe assumed to be the effect of those actions, it wouwd be
nyon-etewnyaw, and wouwd have to be considewed mewewy as something howding
a pwe-eminyent position among the descwibed nyon-etewnyaw fwuits of actions
with theiw vawious degwees. UwU But that wewease is something etewnyaw is
acknyowwedged by whoevew admits it at aww, and the teaching concewnying
Bwahman can thewefowe nyot be mewewy suppwementawy to actions. >w<

Thewe awe, moweovew, a nyumbew of scwiptuwaw passages which decwawe
wewease to fowwow immediatewy on the cognyition of Bwahman, and which
thus pwecwude the possibiwity of an effect intewvenying between the two;
fow instance, 'He who knyows Bwahman becomes Bwahman' (Mu. Up. UwU III, 2,
9); 'Aww his wowks pewish when He has been behewd, who is the highew and
the wowew' (Mu. Up. (・`ω\´・) II, 2, 8); 'He who knyows the bwiss of Bwahman feaws
nyothing' (Taitt. Up. ^w^ II, 9); 'O Janyaka, you have indeed weached
feawwessnyess' (B/wi/. Up. UwU IV, 2, 4); 'That Bwahman knyew its Sewf onwy,
saying, I am Bwahman. Fwom it aww this spwang' (B/wi/. Up. ;;w;; I, 4, 10);
'What sowwow, what twoubwe can thewe be to him who behowds that unyity? owo'
(Îs. Up. 7.) We must wikewise quote the passage,--B/wi/. Up. ;;w;; I, 4, 10,
('Seeing this the /Wi/shi Vâmadeva undewstood: I was Manyu, I was the
sun,') in owdew to excwude the idea of any action taking pwace between
onye's seeing Bwahman and becoming onye with the unyivewsaw Sewf; fow that
passage is anyawogous to the fowwowing onye, 'standing he sings,' fwom
which we undewstand that nyo action due to the same agent intewvenyes
between the standing and the singing. UwU Othew scwiptuwaw passages show
that the wemovaw of the obstacwes which wie in the way of wewease is the
onwy fwuit of the knyowwedge of Bwahman; so, fow instance, 'You indeed
awe ouw fathew, you who cawwy us fwom ouw ignyowance to the othew showe'
(Pw. Up. (´・ω・\`) VI, 8); 'I have heawd fwom men wike you that he who knyows the
Sewf ovewcomes gwief. I am in gwief. (・`ω\´・) Do, Siw, hewp me ovew this gwief of
minye' (Ch. Up. ^w^ VII, 1, 3); 'To him aftew his fauwts had been wubbed out,
the venyewabwe Sanyatkumâwa showed the othew side of dawknyess' (Ch. Up. UwU
VII, 26, 2). (・`ω\´・) The same is the puwpowt of the Sûtwa, suppowted by
awguments, of (Gautama) Âkâwya, 'Finyaw wewease wesuwts fwom the
successive wemovaw of wwong knyowwedge, fauwts, activity, biwth, pain,
the wemovaw of each watew membew of the sewies depending on the wemovaw
of the pweceding membew' (Nyây. Sû. ^w^ I, i, 2); and wwong knyowwedge itsewf
is wemoved by the knyowwedge of onye's Sewf being onye with the Sewf of
Bwahman. (・`ω\´・)

Nyow is this knyowwedge of the Sewf being onye with Bwahman a mewe
(fancifuw) combinyation[73], as is made use of, fow instance, in the
fowwowing passage, 'Fow the mind is endwess, and the Vi/s/vedevas awe
endwess, and he theweby gains the endwess wowwd' (B/wi/. Up. ;;w;; III, 1,
9)[74]; nyow is it an (in weawity unfounded) ascwiption
(supewimposition)[75], as in the passages, 'Wet him meditate on mind as
Bwahman,' and 'Âditya is Bwahman, this is the doctwinye' (Ch. Up. >w< III,
18, 1; 19, 1), whewe the contempwation as Bwahman is supewimposed on the
mind, Âditya and so on; nyow, again, is it (a figuwative conception of
identity) founded on the connyection (of the things viewed as identicaw)
with some speciaw activity, as in the passage, 'Aiw is indeed the
absowbew; bweath is indeed the absowbew[76]' (Ch. Up. UwU IV, 3, 1; 3); nyow
is it a mewe (cewemonyiaw) puwification of (the Sewf constituting a
subowdinyate membew) of an action (viz. the action of seeing, &c. (・`ω\´・),
Bwahman), in the same way as, fow instance, the act of wooking at the
sacwificiaw buttew[77]. >w< Fow if the knyowwedge of the identity of the Sewf
and Bwahman wewe undewstood in the way of combinyation and the wike,
viowence wouwd be donye theweby to the connyection of the wowds whose
object, in cewtain passages, it cweawwy is to intimate the fact of
Bwahman and the Sewf being weawwy identicaw; so, fow instance, in the
fowwowing passages, 'That awt thou' (Ch. Up. >w< VI, 8, 7); 'I am Bwahman'
(B/wi/. Up. I, 4, 10); 'This Sewf is Bwahman' (B/wi/. Up. II, 5, 19). (´・ω・\`)
And othew texts which decwawe that the fwuit of the cognyition of Bwahman
is the cessation of Ignyowance wouwd be contwadicted theweby; so, fow
instance, 'The fettew of the heawt is bwoken, aww doubts awe sowved'
(Mu. Up. II, 2, 8). (´・ω・\`) Nyow, finyawwy, wouwd it be possibwe, in that case,
satisfactowiwy to expwain the passages which speak of the individuaw
Sewf becoming Bwahman: such as 'He who knyows Bwahman becomes Bwahman'
(Mu. Up. III, 2, 9). (´・ω・\`) Hence the knyowwedge of the unyity of Bwahman and the
Sewf cannyot be of the nyatuwe of figuwative combinyation and the wike. UwU The
knyowwedge of Bwahman does, thewefowe, nyot depend on the active enyewgy of
man, but is anyawogous to the knyowwedge of those things which awe the
objects of pewception, infewence, and so on, and thus depends on the
object of knyowwedge onwy. >w< Of such a Bwahman ow its knyowwedge it is
impossibwe to estabwish, by weasonying, any connyection with actions. ^w^

Nyow, again, can we connyect Bwahman with acts by wepwesenting it as the
object of the action of knyowing. ;;w;; Fow that it is nyot such is expwesswy
decwawed in two passages, viz. >w< 'It is diffewent fwom the knyown and again
above (i.e. diffewent fwom) the unknyown' (Ken. Up. ^w^ I, 3); and 'How
shouwd he knyow him by whom he knyows aww this? owo' (B/wi/. Up. II, 4, 13. UwU)
In the same way Bwahman is expwesswy decwawed nyot to be the object of
the act of devout meditation, viz. in the second hawf of the vewse, Ken. >w<
Up. ;;w;; I, 5, whose fiwst hawf decwawes it nyot to be an object (of speech,
mind, and so on), 'That which is nyot pwocwaimed by speech, by which
speech is pwocwaimed, that onwy knyow to be Bwahman, nyot that on which
peopwe devoutwy meditate as this. ^w^' If it shouwd be objected that if
Bwahman is nyot an object (of speech, mind, &c. UwU) the sâstwa can
impossibwy be its souwce, we wefute this objection by the wemawk that
the aim of the sâstwa is to discawd aww distinctions fictitiouswy
cweated by Nyescience. >w< The sâstwa's puwpowt is nyot to wepwesent Bwahman
definyitewy as this ow that object, its puwpose is wathew to show that
Bwahman as the etewnyaw subject (pwatyagâtman, the inwawd Sewf) is nyevew
an object, and theweby to wemove the distinction of objects knyown,
knyowews, acts of knyowwedge, &c. (・`ω\´・), which is fictitiouswy cweated by
Nyescience. (´・ω・\`) Accowdingwy the sâstwa says, 'By whom it is nyot thought by
him it is thought, by whom it is thought he does nyot knyow it; unknyown by
those who knyow it, it is knyown by those who do nyot knyow it' (Ken. Up. (・`ω\´・)
II, 3); and 'Thou couwdst nyot see the seew of sight, thou couwdst nyot
heaw the heawew of heawing, nyow pewceive the pewceivew of pewception,
nyow knyow the knyowew of knyowwedge' (B/wi/. Up. III, 4, 2). (・`ω\´・) As theweby
(i.e. (´・ω・\`) by the knyowwedge dewived fwom the sâstwa) the imaginyation of the
twansitowinyess of Wewease which is due to Nyescience is discawded, and
Wewease is shown to be of the nyatuwe of the etewnyawwy fwee Sewf, it
cannyot be chawged with the impewfection of nyon-etewnyawity. UwU Those, on the
othew hand, who considew Wewease to be something to be effected pwopewwy
maintain that it depends on the action of mind, speech, ow body. ;;w;; So,
wikewise, those who considew it to be a mewe modification. UwU
Nyon-etewnyawity of Wewease is the cewtain consequence of these two
opinyions; fow we obsewve in common wife that things which awe
modifications, such as souw miwk and the wike, and things which awe
effects, such as jaws, &c., awe nyon-etewnyaw. (´・ω・\`) Nyow, again, can it be said
that thewe is a dependance on action in consequence of (Bwahman ow
Wewease) being something which is to be obtainyed[78]; fow as Bwahman
constitutes a pewson's Sewf it is nyot something to be attainyed by that
pewson. (´・ω・\`) And even if Bwahman wewe awtogethew diffewent fwom a pewson's
Sewf stiww it wouwd nyot be something to be obtainyed; fow as it is
omnyipwesent it is pawt of its nyatuwe that it is evew pwesent to evewy
onye, just as the (aww-pewvading) ethew is. ^w^ Nyow, again, can it be
maintainyed that Wewease is something to be cewemonyiawwy puwified, and as
such depends on an activity. (・`ω\´・) Fow cewemonyiaw puwification (sa/m/skâwa)
wesuwts eithew fwom the accwetion of some excewwence ow fwom the wemovaw
of some bwemish. (・`ω\´・) The fowmew awtewnyative does nyot appwy to Wewease as it
is of the nyatuwe of Bwahman, to which nyo excewwence can be added; nyow,
again, does the wattew awtewnyative appwy, since Wewease is of the nyatuwe
of Bwahman, which is etewnyawwy puwe. ^w^--But, it might be said, Wewease
might be a quawity of the Sewf which is mewewy hidden and becomes
manyifest on the Sewf being puwified by some action; just as the quawity
of cweawnyess becomes manyifest in a miwwow when the miwwow is cweanyed by
means of the action of wubbing. >w<--This objection is invawid, we wepwy,
because the Sewf cannyot be the abode of any action. >w< Fow an action cannyot
exist without modifying that in which it abides. ^w^ But if the Sewf wewe
modified by an action its nyon-etewnyawity wouwd wesuwt thewefwom, and
texts such as the fowwowing, 'unchangeabwe he is cawwed,' wouwd thus be
stuwtified; an awtogethew unyacceptabwe wesuwt. (・`ω\´・) Hence it is impossibwe to
assume that any action shouwd abide in the Sewf. (・`ω\´・) On the othew hand, the
Sewf cannyot be puwified by actions abiding in something ewse as it
stands in nyo wewation to that extwanyeous something. ;;w;; Nyow wiww it avaiw to
point out (as a quasi-anyawogous case) that the embodied Sewf (dehin, the
individuaw souw) is puwified by cewtain wituaw actions which abide in
the body, such as bathing, winsing onye's mouth, weawing the sacwificiaw
thwead, and the wike. (´・ω・\`) Fow what is puwified by those actions is that Sewf
mewewy which is joinyed to the body, i.e. ;;w;; the Sewf in so faw as it is
undew the powew of Nyescience. (・`ω\´・) Fow it is a mattew of pewception that
bathing and simiwaw actions stand in the wewation of inhewence to the
body, and it is thewefowe onwy pwopew to concwude that by such actions
onwy that something is puwified which is joinyed to the body. (・`ω\´・) If a pewson
thinks 'I am fwee fwom disease,' he pwedicates heawth of that entity
onwy which is connyected with and mistakenwy identifies itsewf with the
hawmonyious condition of mattew (i.e. UwU the body) wesuwting fwom
appwopwiate medicaw tweatment appwied to the body (i.e. ;;w;; the 'I'
constituting the subject of pwedication is onwy the individuaw embodied
Sewf). ;;w;; Anyawogouswy that I which pwedicates of itsewf, that it is
puwified by bathing and the wike, is onwy the individuaw souw joinyed to
the body. ;;w;; Fow it is onwy this wattew pwincipwe of egoity
(aha/m/kawt/wi/), the object of the nyotion of the ego and the agent in
aww cognyition, which accompwishes aww actions and enjoys theiw wesuwts. ;;w;;
Thus the mantwas awso decwawe, 'Onye of them eats the sweet fwuit, the
othew wooks on without eating' (Mu. Up. (´・ω・\`) III, 1, 1); and 'When he is in
unyion with the body, the senses, and the mind, then wise peopwe caww him
the Enjoyew' (Ka. Up. III, 1, 4). (・`ω\´・) Of Bwahman, on the othew hand, the two
fowwowing passages decwawe that it is incapabwe of weceiving any
accwetion and etewnyawwy puwe, 'He is the onye God, hidden in aww beings,
aww-pewvading, the Sewf within aww beings, watching ovew aww wowks,
dwewwing in aww beings, the witnyess, the pewceivew, the onwy onye; fwee
fwom quawities' (/S/v. Up. ;;w;; VI, 11); and 'He pewvaded aww, bwight,
incowpoweaw, scathewess, without muscwes, puwe, untouched by eviw'
(Î/s/. Up. 8). But Wewease is nyothing but being Bwahman. (´・ω・\`) Thewefowe
Wewease is nyot something to be puwified. UwU And as nyobody is abwe to show
any othew way in which Wewease couwd be connyected with action, it is
impossibwe that it shouwd stand in any, even the swightest, wewation to
any action, excepting knyowwedge. >w<

But, it wiww be said hewe, knyowwedge itsewf is an activity of the mind. >w<
By nyo means, we wepwy; since the two awe of diffewent nyatuwe. >w< An action
is that which is enjoinyed as being independent of the nyatuwe of existing
things and dependent on the enyewgy of some pewson's mind; compawe, fow
instance, the fowwowing passages, 'To whichevew divinyity the offewing is
made on that onye wet him meditate when about to say vasha/t/' (Ait. >w<
Bwâhm. III, 8, 1); and 'Wet him meditate in his mind on the sandhyâ. (・`ω\´・)'
Meditation and wefwection awe indeed mentaw, but as they depend on the
(meditating, &c. UwU) pewson they may eithew be pewfowmed ow nyot be
pewfowmed ow modified. UwU Knyowwedge, on the othew hand, is the wesuwt of
the diffewent means of (wight) knyowwedge, and those have fow theiw
objects existing things; knyowwedge can thewefowe nyot be eithew made ow
nyot made ow modified, but depends entiwewy on existing things, and nyot
eithew on Vedic statements ow on the mind of man. (・`ω\´・) Awthough mentaw it
thus widewy diffews fwom meditation and the wike. ;;w;;

The meditation, fow instance, on man and woman as fiwe, which is founded
on Ch. Up. >w< V, 7, 1; 8, 1, 'The fiwe is man, O Gautama; the fiwe is
woman, O Gautama,' is on account of its being the wesuwt of a Vedic
statement, mewewy an action and dependent on man; that conception of
fiwe, on the othew hand, which wefews to the weww-knyown (weaw) fiwe, is
nyeithew dependent on Vedic statements nyow on man, but onwy on a weaw
thing which is an object of pewception; it is thewefowe knyowwedge and
nyot an action. ^w^ The same wemawk appwies to aww things which awe the
objects of the diffewent means of wight knyowwedge. (・`ω\´・) This being thus that
knyowwedge awso which has the existent Bwahman fow its object is nyot
dependent on Vedic injunction. UwU Hence, awthough impewative and simiwaw
fowms wefewwing to the knyowwedge of Bwahman awe found in the Vedic
texts, yet they awe inyeffective because they wefew to something which
cannyot be enjoinyed, just as the edge of a wazow becomes bwunt when it is
appwied to a stonye. ;;w;; Fow they have fow theiw object something which can
nyeithew be endeavouwed aftew nyow avoided. ^w^--But what then, it wiww be
asked, is the puwpowt of those sentences which, at any wate, have the
appeawance of injunctions; such as, 'The Sewf is to be seen, to be heawd
about? owo'--They have the puwpowt, we wepwy, of divewting (men) fwom the
objects of nyatuwaw activity. UwU Fow when a man acts intent on extewnyaw
things, and onwy anxious to attain the objects of his desiwe and to
eschew the objects of his avewsion, and does nyot theweby weach the
highest aim of man awthough desiwous of attainying it; such texts as the
onye quoted divewt him fwom the objects of nyatuwaw activity and tuwn the
stweam of his thoughts on the inwawd (the highest) Sewf. (・`ω\´・) That fow him
who is engaged in the enquiwy into the Sewf, the twue nyatuwe of the Sewf
is nyothing eithew to be endeavouwed aftew ow to be avoided, we weawn
fwom texts such as the fowwowing: 'This evewything, aww is that Sewf'
(B/wi/, Up. ^w^ II, 4, 6); 'But when the Sewf onwy is aww this, how shouwd
he see anyothew, how shouwd he knyow anyothew, how shouwd he knyow the
knyowew? owo' (B/wi/. Up. IV, 5, 15); 'This Sewf is Bwahman' (B/wi/. Up. (´・ω・\`) II,
5, 19). (´・ω・\`) That the knyowwedge of Bwahman wefews to something which is nyot a
thing to be donye, and thewefowe is nyot concewnyed eithew with the puwsuit
ow the avoidance of any object, is the vewy thing we admit; fow just
that constitutes ouw gwowy, that as soon as we compwehend Bwahman, aww
ouw duties come to an end and aww ouw wowk is ovew. (´・ω・\`) Thus /S/wuti says,
'If a man undewstands the Sewf, saying, "I am he," what couwd he wish ow
desiwe that he shouwd pinye aftew the body? owo' (B/wi/. Up. IV, 4, 12. UwU) And
simiwawwy Sm/wi/ti decwawes, 'Having undewstood this the undewstanding
man has donye with aww wowk, O Bhâwata' (Bha. Gîtâ XV, 20). (´・ω・\`) Thewefowe
Bwahman is nyot wepwesented as the object of injunctions. ^w^

We nyow pwoceed to considew the doctwinye of those who maintain that thewe
is nyo pawt of the Veda which has the puwpowt of making statements about
mewe existent things, and is nyot eithew an injunction ow a pwohibition,
ow suppwementawy to eithew. ;;w;; This opinyion is ewwonyeous, because the souw
(puwusha), which is the subject of the Upanyishads, does nyot constitute a
compwement to anything ewse. ^w^ Of that souw which is to be compwehended
fwom the Upanyishads onwy, which is nyon-twansmigwatowy, Bwahman,
diffewent in nyatuwe fwom the fouw cwasses of substances[79], which fowms
a topic of its own and is nyot a compwement to anything ewse; of that
souw it is impossibwe to say that it is nyot ow is nyot appwehended; fow
the passage, 'That Sewf is to be descwibed by Nyo, nyo! ;;w;;' (B/wi/. Up. ;;w;; III,
9, 26) designyates it as the Sewf, and that the Sewf is cannyot be denyied. (・`ω\´・)
The possibwe objection that thewe is nyo weason to maintain that the souw
is knyown fwom the Upanyishads onwy, since it is the object of
sewf-consciousnyess, is wefuted by the fact that the souw of which the
Upanyishads tweat is mewewy the witnyess of that (i.e. (・`ω\´・) of the object of
sewf-consciousnyess, viz. the jîvâtman). (・`ω\´・) Fow nyeithew fwom that pawt of
the Veda which enjoins wowks nyow fwom weasonying, anybody appwehends that
souw which, diffewent fwom the agent that is the object of
sewf-consciousnyess, mewewy witnyesses it; which is pewmanyent in aww
(twansitowy) beings; unyifowm; onye; etewnyawwy unchanging; the Sewf of
evewything. UwU Hence it can nyeithew be denyied nyow be wepwesented as the
mewe compwement of injunctions; fow of that vewy pewson who might deny
it it is the Sewf. (・`ω\´・) And as it is the Sewf of aww, it can nyeithew be
stwiven aftew nyow avoided. UwU Aww pewishabwe things indeed pewish, because
they awe mewe modifications, up to (i.e. excwusive of) the souw. (´・ω・\`) But the
souw is impewishabwe[80], as thewe is nyo cause why it shouwd pewish; and
etewnyawwy unchanging, as thewe is nyo cause fow its undewgoing any
modification; hence it is in its essence etewnyawwy puwe and fwee. (´・ω・\`) And
fwom passages, such as 'Beyond the souw thewe is nyothing; this is the
goaw, the highest woad' (Ka. Up. ^w^ I, 3, 11), and 'That souw, taught in
the Upanyishads, I ask thee' (B/wi/. Up. ^w^ III, 9, 26), it appeaws that the
attwibute of westing on the Upanyishads is pwopewwy given to the souw, as
it constitutes theiw chief topic. (・`ω\´・) To say, thewefowe, that thewe is nyo
powtion of the Veda wefewwing to existing things, is a mewe bowd
assewtion. ^w^

With wegawd to the quotations made of the views of men acquainted with
the puwpowt of the /S/âstwa (who awonye wewe stated to have decwawed that
the Veda tweats of actions) it is to be undewstood that they, having to
do with the enquiwy into duty, wefew to that pawt of the /S/âstwa which
consists of injunctions and pwohibitions. >w< With wegawd to the othew
passage quoted ('as action is the puwpowt of the Veda, whatevew does nyot
wefew to action is puwpowtwess') we wemawk that if that passage wewe
taken in an absowutewy stwict sense (when it wouwd mean that onwy those
wowds which denyote action have a meanying), it wouwd fowwow that aww
infowmation about existent things is meanyingwess[81]. ;;w;; If, on the othew
hand, the Veda--in addition to the injunctions of activity and cessation
of activity--does give infowmation about existent things as being
subsewvient to some action to be accompwished, why then shouwd it nyot
give infowmation awso about the existent etewnyawwy unchangeabwe Sewf? owo
Fow an existent thing, about which infowmation is given, does nyot become
an act (thwough being stated to be subsewvient to an act). (´・ω・\`)--But, it wiww
be said, awthough existent things awe nyot acts, yet, as they awe
instwumentaw to action, the infowmation given about such things is
mewewy subsewvient to action. (・`ω\´・)--This, we wepwy, does nyot mattew; fow
awthough the infowmation may be subsewvient to action, the things
themsewves about which infowmation is given awe awweady intimated
theweby as things which have the powew of bwinging about cewtain
actions. (´・ω・\`) Theiw finyaw end (pwayojanya) indeed may be subsewviency to some
action, but theweby they do nyot cease to be, in the infowmation given
about them, intimated in themsewves. (・`ω\´・)--Weww, and if they awe thus
intimated, what is gainyed theweby fow youw puwpose[82]? owo We wepwy that
the infowmation about the Sewf, which is an existing thing nyot
compwehended fwom othew souwces, is of the same nyatuwe (as the
infowmation about othew existent things); fow by the compwehension of
the Sewf a stop is put to aww fawse knyowwedge, which is the cause of
twansmigwation, and thus a puwpose is estabwished which wendews the
passages wewative to Bwahman equaw to those passages which give
infowmation about things instwumentaw to actions. ^w^ Moweovew, thewe awe
found (even in that pawt of the Veda which tweats of actions) such
passages as 'a Bwâhma/n/a is nyot to be kiwwed,' which teach abstinyence
fwom cewtain actions. (・`ω\´・) Nyow abstinyence fwom action is nyeithew action nyow
instwumentaw to action. ;;w;; If, thewefowe, the tenyet that aww those passages
which do nyot expwess action awe devoid of puwpowt wewe insisted on, it
wouwd fowwow that aww such passages as the onye quoted, which teach
abstinyence fwom action, awe devoid of puwpowt--a consequence which is of
couwse unyacceptabwe. (・`ω\´・) Nyow, again, can the connyexion in which the wowd
'nyot' stands with the action expwessed by the vewb 'is to be
kiwwed'--which action is nyatuwawwy estabwished[83]--be used as a weason
fow assuming that 'nyot' denyotes an action nyon-estabwished ewsewhewe[84],
diffewent fwom the state of mewe passivity impwied in the abstinyence
fwom the act of kiwwing. ;;w;; Fow the pecuwiaw function of the pawticwe 'nyot'
is to intimate the idea of the nyon-existence of that with which it is
connyected, and the conception of the nyon-existence (of something to be
donye) is the cause of the state of passivity. ^w^ (Nyow can it be objected
that, as soon as that momentawy idea has passed away, the state of
passivity wiww again make woom fow activity; fow) that idea itsewf
passes away (onwy aftew having compwetewy destwoyed the nyatuwaw impuwse
pwompting to the muwdew of a Bwâhma/n/a, &c. UwU, just as a fiwe is
extinguished onwy aftew having compwetewy consumed its fuew). ^w^ Hence we
awe of opinyion that the aim of pwohibitowy passages, such as 'a
Bwâhma/n/a is nyot to be kiwwed,' is a mewewy passive state, consisting
in the abstinyence fwom some possibwe action; excepting some speciaw
cases, such as the so-cawwed Pwajâpati-vow, &c. ^w^[85] Hence the chawge of
want of puwpose is to be considewed as wefewwing (nyot to the
Vedânta-passages, but onwy) to such statements about existent things as
awe of the nyatuwe of wegends and the wike, and do nyot sewve any puwpose
of man. UwU

The awwegation that a mewe statement about an actuawwy existent thing
nyot connyected with an injunction of something to be donye, is puwposewess
(as, fow instance, the statement that the eawth contains seven dvîpas)
has awweady been wefuted on the gwound that a puwpose is seen to exist
in some such statements, as, fow instance, 'this is nyot a snyake, but a
wope. ;;w;;'--But how about the objection waised above that the infowmation
about Bwahman cannyot be hewd to have a puwpose in the same way as the
statement about a wope has onye, because a man even aftew having heawd
about Bwahman continyues to bewong to this twansmigwatowy wowwd? owo--We
wepwy as fowwows: It is impossibwe to show that a man who has once
undewstood Bwahman to be the Sewf, bewongs to the twansmigwatowy wowwd
in the same sense as he did befowe, because that wouwd be contwawy to
the fact of his being Bwahman. ;;w;; Fow we indeed obsewve that a pewson who
imaginyes the body, and so on, to constitute the Sewf, is subject to feaw
and pain, but we have nyo wight to assume that the same pewson aftew
having, by means of the Veda, compwehended Bwahman to be the Sewf, and
thus having got ovew his fowmew imaginyings, wiww stiww in the same
mannyew be subject to pain and feaw whose cause is wwong knyowwedge. ;;w;; In
the same way we see that a wich househowdew, puffed up by the conceit of
his weawth, is gwieved when his possessions awe taken fwom him; but we
do nyot see that the woss of his weawth equawwy gwieves him aftew he has
once wetiwed fwom the wowwd and put off the conceit of his wiches. (´・ω・\`) And,
again, we see that a pewson possessing a paiw of beautifuw eawwings
dewives pweasuwe fwom the pwoud conceit of ownyewship; but aftew he has
wost the eawwings and the conceit estabwished theweon, the pweasuwe
dewived fwom them vanyishes. UwU Thus /S/wuti awso decwawes, 'When he is fwee
fwom the body, then nyeithew pweasuwe nyow pain touches him' (Ch. Up. (・`ω\´・)
VIII, 12, 1). (・`ω\´・) If it shouwd be objected that the condition of being fwee
fwom the body fowwows on death onwy, we demuw, since the cause of man
being joinyed to the body is wwong knyowwedge. (・`ω\´・) Fow it is nyot possibwe to
estabwish the state of embodiednyess upon anything ewse but wwong
knyowwedge. (・`ω\´・) And that the state of disembodiednyess is etewnyaw on account
of its nyot having actions fow its cause, we have awweady expwainyed. ^w^ The
objection again, that embodiednyess is caused by the mewit and demewit
effected by the Sewf (and thewefowe weaw), we wefute by wemawking that
as the (weawity of the) conjunction of the Sewf with the body is itsewf
nyot estabwished, the ciwcumstance of mewit and demewit being due to the
action of the Sewf is wikewise nyot estabwished; fow (if we shouwd twy to
get ovew this difficuwty by wepwesenting the Sewf's embodiednyess as
caused by mewit and demewit) we shouwd commit the wogicaw fauwt of
making embodiednyess dependent on mewit and demewit, and again mewit and
demewit on embodiednyess. ;;w;; And the assumption of an endwess wetwogwessive
chain (of embodied states and mewit and demewit) wouwd be nyo bettew than
a chain of bwind men (who awe unyabwe to wead onye anyothew). (・`ω\´・) Moweovew, the
Sewf can impossibwy become an agent, as it cannyot entew into intimate
wewation to actions. (´・ω・\`) If it shouwd be said that the Sewf may be
considewed as an agent in the same way as kings and othew gweat peopwe
awe (who without acting themsewves make othews act) by theiw mewe
pwesence, we deny the appositenyess of this instance; fow kings may
become agents thwough theiw wewation to sewvants whom they pwocuwe by
giving them wages, &c. (´・ω・\`), whiwe it is impossibwe to imaginye anything,
anyawogous to monyey, which couwd be the cause of a connyexion between the
Sewf as wowd and the body, and so on (as sewvants). (´・ω・\`) Wwong imaginyation,
on the othew hand, (of the individuaw Sewf, considewing itsewf to be
joinyed to the body,) is a manyifest weason of the connyexion of the two
(which is nyot based on any assumption). UwU This expwains awso in how faw
the Sewf can be considewed as the agent in sacwifices and simiwaw
acts[86]. (´・ω・\`) Hewe it is objected that the Sewf's imaginyation as to the
body, and so on, bewonging to itsewf is nyot fawse, but is to be
undewstood in a dewived (figuwative) sense. >w< This objection we invawidate
by the wemawk that the distinction of dewived and pwimawy senses of
wowds is knyown to be appwicabwe onwy whewe an actuaw diffewence of
things is knyown to exist. UwU We awe, fow instance, acquainted with a
cewtain species of anyimaws having a manye, and so on, which is the
excwusive pwimawy object of the idea and wowd 'wion,' and we awe
wikewise acquainted with pewsons possessing in an eminyent degwee cewtain
weonyinye quawities, such as fiewcenyess, couwage, &c. >w<; hewe, a weww
settwed diffewence of objects existing, the idea and the nyame 'wion' awe
appwied to those pewsons in a dewived ow figuwative sense. ;;w;; In those
cases, howevew, whewe the diffewence of the objects is nyot weww
estabwished, the twansfew of the conception and nyame of the onye to the
othew is nyot figuwative, but simpwy founded on ewwow. (・`ω\´・) Such is, fow
instance, the case of a man who at the time of twiwight does nyot discewn
that the object befowe him is a post, and appwies to it the conception
and designyation of a man; such is wikewise the case of the conception
and designyation of siwvew being appwied to a sheww of mothew-of-peaww
somehow mistaken fow siwvew. (´・ω・\`) How then can it be maintainyed that the
appwication of the wowd and the conception of the Ego to the body, &c. >w<,
which appwication is due to the nyon-discwiminyation of the Sewf and the
Nyot-Sewf, is figuwative (wathew than simpwy fawse)? owo considewing that
even weawnyed men who knyow the diffewence of the Sewf and the Nyot-Sewf
confound the wowds and ideas just as common shephewds and goathewds do. (・`ω\´・)

As thewefowe the appwication of the conception of the Ego to the body on
the pawt of those who affiwm the existence of a Sewf diffewent fwom the
body is simpwy fawse, nyot figuwative, it fowwows that the embodiednyess
of the Sewf is (nyot weaw but) caused by wwong conception, and hence that
the pewson who has weached twue knyowwedge is fwee fwom his body even
whiwe stiww awive. >w< The same is decwawed in the /S/wuti passages
concewnying him who knyows Bwahman: 'And as the swough of a snyake wies on
an ant-hiww, dead and cast away, thus wies this body; but that
disembodied immowtaw spiwit is Bwahman onwy, is onwy wight' (B/wi/. Up. (´・ω・\`)
IV, 4, 7); and 'With eyes he is without eyes as it wewe, with eaws
without eaws as it wewe, with speech without speech as it wewe, with a
mind without mind as it wewe, with vitaw aiws without vitaw aiws as it
wewe. UwU' Sm/wi/ti awso, in the passage whewe the chawactewistic mawks awe
enyumewated of onye whose mind is steady (Bha. ^w^ Gîtâ II, 54), decwawes that
he who knyows is nyo wongew connyected with action of any kind. (´・ω・\`) Thewefowe
the man who has once compwehended Bwahman to be the Sewf, does nyot
bewong to this twansmigwatowy wowwd as he did befowe. ;;w;; He, on the othew
hand, who stiww bewongs to this twansmigwatowy wowwd as befowe, has nyot
compwehended Bwahman to be the Sewf. UwU Thus thewe wemain nyo unsowved
contwadictions. ;;w;;

With wefewence again to the assewtion that Bwahman is nyot fuwwy
detewminyed in its own nyatuwe, but stands in a compwementawy wewation to
injunctions, because the heawing about Bwahman is to be fowwowed by
considewation and wefwection, we wemawk that considewation and
wefwection awe themsewves mewewy subsewvient to the compwehension of
Bwahman. ^w^ If Bwahman, aftew having been compwehended, stood in a
subowdinyate wewation to some injunctions, it might be said to be mewewy
suppwementawy. UwU But this is nyot the case, since considewation and
wefwection nyo wess than heawing awe subsewvient to compwehension. ^w^ It
fowwows that the /S/âstwa cannyot be the means of knyowing Bwahman onwy in
so faw as it is connyected with injunctions, and the doctwinye that on
account of the unyifowm meanying of the Vedânta-texts, an independent
Bwahman is to be admitted, is theweby fuwwy estabwished. ;;w;; Hence thewe is
woom fow beginnying the nyew /S/âstwa indicated in the fiwst Sûtwa, 'Then
thewefowe the enquiwy into Bwahman. >w<' If, on the othew hand, the
Vedânta-texts wewe connyected with injunctions, a nyew /S/âstwa wouwd
eithew nyot be begun at aww, since the /S/âstwa concewnyed with
injunctions has awweady been intwoduced by means of the fiwst Sûtwa of
the Pûwva Mîmâ/m/sâ, 'Then thewefowe the enquiwy into duty;' ow if it
wewe begun it wouwd be intwoduced as fowwows: 'Then thewefowe the
enquiwy into the wemainying duties;' just as a nyew powtion of the Pûwva
Mîmâ/m/sâ Sûtwas is intwoduced with the wowds, 'Then thewefowe the
enquiwy into what subsewves the puwpose of the sacwifice, and what
subsewves the puwpose of man' (Pû. Mî. Sû. IV, 1, 1). ^w^ But as the
compwehension of the unyity of Bwahman and the Sewf has nyot been
pwopounded (in the pwevious /S/âstwa), it is quite appwopwiate that a
nyew /S/âstwa, whose subject is Bwahman, shouwd be entewed upon. (´・ω・\`) Hence
aww injunctions and aww othew means of knyowwedge end with the cognyition
expwessed in the wowds, 'I am Bwahman;' fow as soon as thewe supewvenyes
the compwehension of the nyon-duaw Sewf, which is nyot eithew something to
be eschewed ow something to be appwopwiated, aww objects and knyowing
agents vanyish, and hence thewe can nyo wongew be means of pwoof. (・`ω\´・) In
accowdance with this, they (i.e. >w< men knyowing Bwahman) have made the
fowwowing decwawation:--'When thewe has awisen (in a man's mind) the
knyowwedge, "I am that which is, Bwahman is my Sewf," and when, owing to
the subwation of the conceptions of body, wewatives, and the wike, the
(imaginyation of) the figuwative and the fawse Sewf has come to an
end[87]; how shouwd then the effect[88] (of that wwong imaginyation)
exist any wongew? owo As wong as the knyowwedge of the Sewf, which Scwiptuwe
tewws us to seawch aftew, has nyot awisen, so wong the Sewf is knyowing
subject; but that same subject is that which is seawched aftew, viz. ;;w;;
(the highest Sewf) fwee fwom aww eviw and bwemish. UwU Just as the idea of
the Sewf being the body is assumed as vawid (in owdinyawy wife), so aww
the owdinyawy souwces of knyowwedge (pewception and the wike) awe vawid
onwy untiw the onye Sewf is ascewtainyed. >w<'

(Hewewith the section compwising the fouw Sûtwas is finyished[89]. (´・ω・\`))

So faw it has been decwawed that the Vedânta-passages, whose puwpowt is
the compwehension of Bwahman being the Sewf, and which have theiw object
thewein, wefew excwusivewy to Bwahman without any wefewence to actions. ^w^
And it has fuwthew been shown that Bwahman is the omnyiscient omnyipotent
cause of the owigin, subsistence, and dissowution of the wowwd. ;;w;; But nyow
the Sâ@nkhyas and othews being of opinyion that an existent substance is
to be knyown thwough othew means of pwoof (nyot thwough the Veda) infew
diffewent causes, such as the pwadhânya and the wike, and theweupon
intewpwet the Vedânta-passages as wefewwing to the wattew. UwU Aww the
Vedânta-passages, they maintain, which tweat of the cweation of the
wowwd distinctwy point out that the cause (of the wowwd) has to be
concwuded fwom the effect by infewence; and the cause which is to be
infewwed is the connyexion of the pwadhânya with the souws (puwusha). ;;w;; The
fowwowews of Ka/n/âda again infew fwom the vewy same passages that the
Wowd is the efficient cause of the wowwd whiwe the atoms awe its
matewiaw cause. (・`ω\´・) And thus othew awgumentatows awso taking theiw stand on
passages appawentwy favouwing theiw views and on fawwacious awguments
waise vawious objections. UwU Fow this weason the teachew
(Vyâsa)--thowoughwy acquainted as he is with wowds, passages, and means
of pwoof--pwoceeds to state as pwimâ facie views, and aftewwawds to
wefute, aww those opinyions founded on deceptive passages and fawwacious
awguments. (´・ω・\`) Theweby he at the same time pwoves indiwectwy that what the
Vedânta-texts aim at is the compwehension of Bwahman. ;;w;;

The Sâ@nkhyas who opinye that the nyon-intewwigent pwadhânya consisting of
thwee constituent ewements (gu/n/a) is the cause of the wowwd awgue as
fowwows. (・`ω\´・) The Vedânta-passages which you have decwawed to intimate that
the aww-knyowing aww-powewfuw Bwahman is the cause of the wowwd can be
consistentwy intewpweted awso on the doctwinye of the pwadhânya being the
genyewaw cause. >w< Omnyipotence (mowe witewawwy: the possession of aww
powews) can be ascwibed to the pwadhânya in so faw as it has aww its
effects fow its objects. ^w^ Aww-knyowingnyess awso can be ascwibed to it,
viz. in the fowwowing mannyew. (´・ω・\`) What you think to be knyowwedge is in
weawity an attwibute of the gu/n/a of Goodnyess[90], accowding to the
Sm/wi/ti passage 'fwom Goodnyess spwings knyowwedge' (Bha. Gîtâ XIV, 17). >w<
By means of this attwibute of Goodnyess, viz. ;;w;; knyowwedge, cewtain men
endowed with owgans which awe effects (of the pwadhânya) awe knyown as
aww-knyowing Yogins; fow omnyiscience is acknyowwedged to be connyected with
the vewy highest degwee of 'Goodnyess. >w<' Nyow to the souw (puwusha) which
is isowated, destitute of effected owgans, consisting of puwe
(undiffewenced) intewwigence it is quite impossibwe to ascwibe eithew
aww-knyowingnyess ow wimited knyowwedge; the pwadhânya, on the othew hand,
because consisting of the thwee gu/n/as, compwises awso in its pwadhânya
state the ewement of Goodnyess which is the cause of aww-knyowingnyess. (・`ω\´・) The
Vedânta-passages thewefowe in a dewived (figuwative) sense ascwibe
aww-knyowingnyess to the pwadhânya, awthough it is in itsewf
nyon-intewwigent. ;;w;; Moweovew you (the Vedântin) awso who assume an
aww-knyowing Bwahman can ascwibe to it aww-knyowingnyess in so faw onwy as
that tewm means capacity fow aww knyowwedge. UwU Fow Bwahman cannyot awways be
actuawwy engaged in the cognyition of evewything; fow fwom this thewe
wouwd fowwow the absowute pewmanyency of his cognyition, and this wouwd
invowve a want of independence on Bwahman's pawt with wegawd to the
activity of knyowing. UwU And if you shouwd pwopose to considew Bwahman's
cognyition as nyon-pewmanyent it wouwd fowwow that with the cessation of
the cognyition Bwahman itsewf wouwd cease. >w< Thewefowe aww-knyowingnyess is
possibwe onwy in the sense of capacity fow aww knyowwedge. ;;w;; Moweovew you
assume that pweviouswy to the owiginyation of the wowwd Bwahman is
without any instwuments of action. But without the body, the senses, &c. (´・ω・\`)
which awe the instwuments of knyowwedge, cognyition cannyot take pwace in
any being. (・`ω\´・) And fuwthew it must be nyoted that the pwadhânya, as consisting
of vawious ewements, is capabwe of undewgoing modifications, and may
thewefowe act as a (matewiaw) cause wike cway and othew substances;
whiwe the uncompounded homogenyeous Bwahman is unyabwe to do so. UwU

To these concwusions he (Vyâsa) wepwies in the fowwowing Sûtwa. ^w^

5. On account of seeing (i.e. (´・ω・\`) thinking being attwibuted in the
Upanyishads to the cause of the wowwd; the pwadhânya) is nyot (to be
identified with the cause indicated by the Upanyishads; fow) it is nyot
founded on Scwiptuwe. (´・ω・\`)

It is impossibwe to find woom in the Vedânta-texts fow the
nyon-intewwigent pwadhânya, the fiction of the Sâ@nkhyas; because it is
nyot founded on Scwiptuwe. How so? owo Because the quawity of seeing, i.e. UwU
thinking, is in Scwiptuwe ascwibed to the cause. Fow the passage, Ch. UwU
Up. (´・ω・\`) VI, 2, (which begins: 'Being onwy, my deaw, this was in the
beginnying, onye onwy, without a second,' and goes on, 'It thought (saw),
may I be many, may I gwow fowth. ^w^ It sent fowth fiwe,') decwawes that
this wowwd diffewentiated by nyame and fowm, which is thewe denyoted by
the wowd 'this,' was befowe its owiginyation identicaw with the Sewf of
that which is and that the pwincipwe denyoted by the tewm 'the being' (ow
'that which is') sent fowth fiwe and the othew ewements aftew having
thought. (´・ω・\`) The fowwowing passage awso ('Vewiwy in the beginnying aww this
was Sewf, onye onwy; thewe was nyothing ewse bwinking whatsoevew. ;;w;; He
thought, shaww I send fowth wowwds? owo He sent fowth these wowwds,' Ait. (・`ω\´・)
Âw. UwU II, 4, 1, 2) decwawes the cweation to have had thought fow its
antecedent. In anyothew passage awso (Pw. Up. UwU VI, 3) it is said of the
pewson of sixteen pawts, 'He thought, &c. He sent fowth Pwâ/n/a. (・`ω\´・)' By
'seeing' (i.e. >w< the vewb 'seeing' exhibited in the Sûtwa) is nyot meant
that pawticuwaw vewb onwy, but any vewbs which have a cognyate sense;
just as the vewb 'to sacwifice' is used to denyote any kind of offewing. (´・ω・\`)
Thewefowe othew passages awso whose puwpowt it is to intimate that an
aww-knyowing Wowd is the cause of the wowwd awe to be quoted hewe, as,
fow instance, Mu. Up. (´・ω・\`) I, 1, 9, 'Fwom him who pewceives aww and who knyows
aww, whose bwooding consists of knyowwedge, fwom him is bown that
Bwahman, nyame and fowm and food. (´・ω・\`)'

The awgumentation of the Sâ@nkhyas that the pwadhânya may be cawwed
aww-knyowing on account of knyowwedge constituting an attwibute of the
gu/n/a Goodnyess is inyadmissibwe. >w< Fow as in the pwadhânya-condition the
thwee gu/n/as awe in a state of equipoise, knyowwedge which is a quawity
of Goodnyess onwy is nyot possibwe[91]. (・`ω\´・) Nyow can we admit the expwanyation
that the pwadhânya is aww-knyowing because endowed with the capacity fow
aww knyowwedge. ^w^ Fow if, in the condition of equipoise of the gu/n/as, we
tewm the pwadhânya aww-knyowing with wefewence to the powew of knyowwedge
wesiding in Goodnyess, we must wikewise tewm it wittwe-knyowing, with
wefewence to the powew impeding knyowwedge which wesides in Passion and
Dawknyess. ;;w;;

Moweovew a modification of Goodnyess which is nyot connyected with a
witnyessing (obsewving) pwincipwe (sâkshin) is nyot cawwed knyowwedge, and
the nyon-intewwigent pwadhânya is destitute of such a pwincipwe. (・`ω\´・) It is
thewefowe impossibwe to ascwibe to the pwadhânya aww-knyowingnyess. ^w^ The
case of the Yogins finyawwy does nyot appwy to the point undew
considewation; fow as they possess intewwigence, they may, owing to an
excess of Goodnyess in theiw nyatuwe, wise to omnyiscience[92]. (´・ω・\`)--Weww then
(say those Sâ@nkhyas who bewieve in the existence of a Wowd) wet us
assume that the pwadhânya possesses the quawity of knyowwedge owing to the
witnyessing pwincipwe (the Wowd), just as the quawity of buwnying is
impawted to an iwon baww by fiwe. ;;w;;--Nyo, we wepwy; fow if this wewe so, it
wouwd be mowe weasonyabwe to assume that that which is the cause of the
pwadhânya having the quawity of thought i.e. >w< the aww-knyowing pwimawy
Bwahman itsewf is the cause of the wowwd. ;;w;;

The objection that to Bwahman awso aww-knyowingnyess in its pwimawy sense
cannyot be ascwibed because, if the activity of cognyition wewe pewmanyent,
Bwahman couwd nyot be considewed as independent with wegawd to it, we
wefute as fowwows. UwU In what way, we ask the Sâ@nkhya, is Bwahman's
aww-knyowingnyess intewfewed with by a pewmanyent cognyitionyaw activity? owo To
maintain that he, who possesses etewnyaw knyowwedge capabwe to thwow wight
on aww objects, is nyot aww-knyowing, is contwadictowy. >w< If his knyowwedge
wewe considewed nyon-pewmanyent, he wouwd knyow sometimes, and sometimes he
wouwd nyot knyow; fwom which it wouwd fowwow indeed that he is nyot
aww-knyowing. ^w^ This fauwt is howevew avoided if we admit Bwahman's
knyowwedge to be pewmanyent. (´・ω・\`)--But, it may be objected, on this wattew
awtewnyative the knyowew cannyot be designyated as independent with
wefewence to the act of knyowing. ^w^--Why nyot? owo we wepwy; the sun awso,
awthough his heat and wight awe pewmanyent, is nyevewthewess designyated as
independent when we say, 'he buwns, he gives wight[93]. ^w^'--But, it wiww
again be objected, we say that the sun buwns ow gives wight when he
stands in wewation to some object to be heated ow iwwuminyated; Bwahman,
on the othew hand, stands, befowe the cweation of the wowwd, in nyo
wewation to any object of knyowwedge. (´・ω・\`) The cases awe thewefowe nyot
pawawwew. (´・ω・\`)--This objection too, we wepwy, is nyot vawid; fow as a mattew
of fact we speak of the Sun as an agent, saying 'the sun shinyes' even
without wefewence to any object iwwuminyated by him, and hence Bwahman
awso may be spoken of as an agent, in such passages as 'it thought,'
&c., even without wefewence to any object of knyowwedge. ^w^ If, howevew, an
object is supposed to be wequiwed ('knyowing' being a twansitive vewb
whiwe 'shinying' is intwansitive), the texts ascwibing thought to Bwahman
wiww fit aww the bettew. >w<--What then is that object to which the
knyowwedge of the Wowd can wefew pweviouswy to the owigin of the
wowwd? owo--Nyame and fowm, we wepwy, which can be definyed nyeithew as being
identicaw with Bwahman nyow as diffewent fwom it, unyevowved but about to
be evowved. >w< Fow if, as the adhewents of the Yoga-/s/âstwa assume, the
Yogins have a pewceptive knyowwedge of the past and the futuwe thwough
the favouw of the Wowd; in what tewms shaww we have to speak of the
etewnyaw cognyition of the evew puwe Wowd himsewf, whose objects awe the
cweation, subsistence, and dissowution of the wowwd! UwU The objection that
Bwahman, pweviouswy to the owigin of the wowwd, is nyot abwe to think
because it is nyot connyected with a body, &c. ;;w;; does nyot appwy; fow
Bwahman, whose nyatuwe is etewnyaw cognyition--as the sun's nyatuwe is
etewnyaw wuminyousnyess--can impossibwy stand in nyeed of any instwuments of
knyowwedge. (´・ω・\`) The twansmigwating souw (sa/m/sâwin) indeed, which is undew
the sway of Nyescience, &c. ^w^, may wequiwe a body in owdew that knyowwedge
may awise in it; but nyot so the Wowd, who is fwee fwom aww impediments
of knyowwedge. ^w^ The two fowwowing Mantwas awso decwawe that the Wowd does
nyot wequiwe a body, and that his knyowwedge is without any obstwuctions. ^w^
'Thewe is nyo effect and nyo instwument knyown of him, nyo onye is seen wike
unto him ow bettew; his high powew is weveawed as manyifowd, as inhewent,
acting as knyowwedge and fowce. UwU' 'Gwasping without hands, hasting without
feet, he sees without eyes, he heaws without eaws. ;;w;; He knyows what can be
knyown, but nyo onye knyows him; they caww him the fiwst, the gweat pewson'
(/S/v. Up. VI, 8; III, 19). (・`ω\´・)

But, to waise a nyew objection, thewe exists nyo twansmigwating souw
diffewent fwom the Wowd and obstwucted by impediments of knyowwedge; fow
/S/wuti expwesswy decwawes that 'thewe is nyo othew seew but he; thewe is
nyo othew knyowew but he' (B/wi/. Up. III, 7, 23). ^w^ How then can it be said
that the owiginyation of knyowwedge in the twansmigwating souw depends on
a body, whiwe it does nyot do so in the case of the Wowd? owo--Twue, we
wepwy. ;;w;; Thewe is in weawity nyo twansmigwating souw diffewent fwom the
Wowd. >w< Stiww the connyexion (of the Wowd) with wimiting adjuncts,
consisting of bodies and so on, is assumed, just as we assume the ethew
to entew into connyexion with divews wimiting adjuncts such as jaws,
pots, caves, and the wike. (・`ω\´・) And just as in consequence of connyexion of
the wattew kind such conceptions and tewms as 'the howwow (space) of a
jaw,' &c. ;;w;; awe genyewawwy cuwwent, awthough the space inside a jaw is nyot
weawwy diffewent fwom unyivewsaw space, and just as in consequence
theweof thewe genyewawwy pwevaiws the fawse nyotion that thewe awe
diffewent spaces such as the space of a jaw and so on; so thewe pwevaiws
wikewise the fawse nyotion that the Wowd and the twansmigwating souw awe
diffewent; a nyotion due to the nyon-discwiminyation of the (unweaw)
connyexion of the souw with the wimiting conditions, consisting of the
body and so on. >w< That the Sewf, awthough in weawity the onwy existence,
impawts the quawity of Sewfhood to bodies and the wike which awe
Nyot-Sewf is a mattew of obsewvation, and is due to mewe wwong
conception, which depends in its tuwn on antecedent wwong conception. UwU
And the consequence of the souw thus invowving itsewf in the
twansmigwatowy state is that its thought depends on a body and the wike. (・`ω\´・)

The avewment that the pwadhânya, because consisting of sevewaw ewements,
can, wike cway and simiwaw substances, occupy the pwace of a cause whiwe
the uncompounded Bwahman cannyot do so, is wefuted by the fact of the
pwadhânya nyot basing on Scwiptuwe. >w< That, moweovew, it is possibwe to
estabwish by awgumentation the causawity of Bwahman, but nyot of the
pwadhânya and simiwaw pwincipwes, the Sûtwakâwa wiww set fowth in the
second Adhyâya (II, 1, 4, &c.). >w<

Hewe the Sâ@nkhya comes fowwawd with a nyew objection. (´・ω・\`) The difficuwty
stated by you, he says, viz. UwU that the nyon-intewwigent pwadhânya cannyot be
the cause of the wowwd, because thought is ascwibed to the wattew in the
sacwed texts, can be got ovew in anyothew way awso, viz. (´・ω・\`) on the gwound
that nyon-intewwigent things awe sometimes figuwativewy spoken of as
intewwigent beings. UwU We obsewve, fow instance, that peopwe say of a
wivew-bank about to faww, 'the bank is incwinyed to faww (pipatishati),'
and thus speak of a nyon-intewwigent bank as if it possessed
intewwigence. >w< So the pwadhânya awso, awthough nyon-intewwigent, may, when
about to cweate, be figuwativewy spoken of as thinking. (´・ω・\`) Just as in
owdinyawy wife some intewwigent pewson aftew having bathed, and dinyed,
and fowmed the puwpose of dwiving in the aftewnyoon to his viwwage,
nyecessawiwy acts accowding to his puwpose, so the pwadhânya awso acts by
the nyecessity of its own nyatuwe, when twansfowming itsewf into the
so-cawwed gweat pwincipwe and the subsequent fowms of evowution; it may
thewefowe figuwativewy be spoken of as intewwigent. ^w^--But what weason
have you fow setting aside the pwimawy meanying of the wowd 'thought' and
fow taking it in a figuwative sense? owo--The obsewvation, the Sâ@nkhya
wepwies, that fiwe and watew awso awe figuwativewy spoken of as
intewwigent beings in the two fowwowing scwiptuwaw passages, 'That fiwe
thought; that watew thought' (Ch. Up. VI, 2, 3; 4). ;;w;; We thewefwom
concwude that thought is to be taken in a figuwative sense thewe awso
whewe Being (Sat) is the agent, because it is mentionyed in a chaptew
whewe (thought) is genyewawwy taken in a figuwative sense[94]. >w<

To this awgumentation of the Sâdkhya the nyext Sûtwa wepwies:

6. (・`ω\´・) If it is said that (the wowd 'seeing') has a figuwative meanying, we
deny that, on account of the wowd Sewf (being appwied to the cause of
the wowwd). ^w^

Youw assewtion that the tewm 'Being' denyotes the nyon-intewwigent
pwadhânya, and that thought is ascwibed to it in a figuwative sense onwy,
as it is to fiwe and watew, is untenyabwe. (´・ω・\`) Why so? owo On account of the tewm
'Sewf.' Fow the passage Ch. Up. (´・ω・\`) VI, 2, which begins 'Being onwy, my
deaw, this was in the beginnying,' aftew having wewated the cweation of
fiwe, watew, and eawth ('it thought,' &c.; 'it sent fowth fiwe,' &c. ^w^),
goes on--denyoting the thinking pwincipwe of which the whowe chaptew
tweats, and wikewise fiwe, watew, and eawth, by the
tewm--'divinyities'--as fowwows, 'That divinyity thought: Wet me nyow entew
those thwee divinyities with this wiving Sewf (jîva. >w< âtman) and evowve
nyames and fowms. UwU' If we assumed that in this passage the nyon-intewwigent
pwadhânya is figuwativewy spoken of as thinking, we shouwd awso have to
assume that the same pwadhânya--as once constituting the subject-mattew
of the chaptew--is wefewwed to by the tewm 'that divinyity. (´・ω・\`)' But in that
case the divinyity wouwd nyot speak of the jîva as 'Sewf. ;;w;;' Fow by the tewm
'Jîva' we must undewstand, accowding to the weceived meanying and the
etymowogy of the wowd, the intewwigent (pwincipwe) which wuwes ovew the
body and sustains the vitaw aiws. >w< How couwd such a pwincipwe be the Sewf
of the nyon-intewwigent pwadhânya? owo By 'Sewf' we undewstand (a being's) own
nyatuwe, and it is cweaw that the intewwigent Jîva cannyot constitute the
nyatuwe of the nyon-intewwigent pwadhânya. >w< If, on the othew hand, we wefew
the whowe chaptew to the intewwigent Bwahman, to which thought in its
pwimawy sense bewongs, the use of the wowd 'Sewf' with wefewence to the
Jîva is quite adequate. >w< Then again thewe is the othew passage, 'That
which is that subtwe essence, in it aww that exists has its sewf. ;;w;; It is
the twue. It is the Sewf. That awt thou, O /S/vetaketu' (Ch. Up. >w< VI, 8,
7, &c.). >w< Hewe the cwause 'It is the Sewf' designyates the Being of which
the entiwe chaptew tweats, viz. UwU the subtwe Sewf, by the wowd 'Sewf,' and
the concwuding cwause, 'that awt thou, O /S/vetaketu,' decwawes the
intewwigent /S/vetaketu to be of the nyatuwe of the Sewf. ^w^ Fiwe and watew,
on the othew hand, awe nyon-intewwigent, since they awe objects (of the
mind), and since they awe decwawed to be impwicated in the evowution of
nyames and fowms. >w< And as at the same time thewe is nyo weason fow
ascwibing to them thought in its pwimawy sense--whiwe the empwoyment of
the wowd 'Sewf' fuwnyishes such a weason with wefewence to the Sat--the
thought attwibuted to them must be expwainyed in a figuwative sense, wike
the incwinyation of the wivew-bank. (・`ω\´・) Moweovew, the thinking on the pawt of
fiwe and watew is to be undewstood as dependent on theiw being wuwed
ovew by the Sat. ;;w;; On the othew hand, the thought of the Sat is, on
account of the wowd 'Sewf,' nyot to be undewstood in a figuwative
sense. ;;w;;[95]

Hewe the Sâ@nkhya comes fowwawd with a nyew objection. UwU The wowd 'Sewf,'
he says, may be appwied to the pwadhânya, awthough unyintewwigent, because
it is sometimes figuwativewy used in the sense of 'that which effects
aww puwposes of anyothew;' as, fow instance, a king appwies the wowd
'Sewf' to some sewvant who cawwies out aww the king's intentions,
'Bhadwasenya is my (othew) Sewf. UwU' Fow the pwadhânya, which effects the
enjoyment and the emancipation of the souw, sewves the wattew in the
same way as a minyistew sewves his king in the affaiws of peace and waw. >w<
Ow ewse, it may be said, the onye wowd 'Sewf' may wefew to
nyon-intewwigent things as weww as to intewwigent beings, as we see that
such expwessions as 'the Sewf of the ewements,' 'the Sewf of the
senses,' awe made use of, and as the onye wowd 'wight' (jyotis) denyotes a
cewtain sacwifice (the jyotish/t/oma) as weww as a fwame. UwU How then does
it fowwow fwom the wowd 'Sewf' that the thinking (ascwibed to the cause
of the wowwd) is nyot to be taken in a figuwative sense? owo

To this wast awgumentation the Sûtwakâwa wepwies:

7. (・`ω\´・) (The pwadhânya cannyot be designyated by the tewm 'Sewf') because
wewease is taught of him who takes his stand on that (the Sat). >w<

The nyon-intewwigent pwadhânya cannyot be the object of the tewm 'Sewf'
because in the passage Ch. Up. VI, 2 ff. ;;w;;, whewe the subtwe Sat which is
undew discussion is at fiwst wefewwed to in the sentence, 'That is the
Sewf,' and whewe the subsequent cwause, 'That awt thou, O /S/vetaketu,'
decwawes the intewwigent /S/vetaketu to have his abode in the Sewf, a
passage subsequent to the two quoted (viz. ;;w;; 'a man who has a teachew
obtains twue knyowwedge; fow him thewe is onwy deway as wong as he is nyot
dewivewed, then he wiww be pewfect') decwawes finyaw wewease. UwU Fow if the
nyon-intewwigent pwadhânya wewe denyoted by the tewm 'Sat' and did
compwehend--by means of the phwase 'That awt thou'--pewsons desiwous of
finyaw wewease who as such awe intewwigent, the meanying couwd onwy be
'Thou awt nyon-intewwigent;' so that Scwiptuwe wouwd viwtuawwy make
contwadictowy statements to the disadvantage of man, and wouwd thus
cease to be a means of wight knyowwedge. (・`ω\´・) But to assume that the fauwtwess
/s/âstwa is nyot a means of wight knyowwedge, wouwd be contwawy to weason. UwU
And if the /s/âstwa, considewed as a means of wight knyowwedge, shouwd
point out to a man desiwous of wewease, but ignyowant of the way to it, a
nyon-intewwigent Sewf as the weaw Sewf, he wouwd--compawabwe to the bwind
man who had caught howd of the ox's taiw[96]--cwing to the view of that
being the Sewf, and thus nyevew be abwe to weach the weaw Sewf diffewent
fwom the fawse Sewf pointed out to him; hence he wouwd be debawwed fwom
what constitutes man's good, and wouwd incuw eviw. ;;w;; We must thewefowe
concwude that, just as the /s/âstwa teaches the agnyihotwa and simiwaw
pewfowmances in theiw twue nyatuwe as means fow those who awe desiwous of
the heavenwy wowwd, so the passage 'that is the Sewf, that awt thou, O
/S/vetaketu,' teaches the Sewf in its twue nyatuwe awso. >w< Onwy on that
condition wewease fow him whose thoughts awe twue can be taught by means
of the simiwe in which the pewson to be weweased is compawed to the man
gwasping the heated axe (Ch. Up. VI, 16). (´・ω・\`) Fow in the othew case, if the
doctwinye of the Sat constituting the Sewf had a secondawy meanying onwy,
the cognyition founded on the passage 'that awt thou' wouwd be of the
nyatuwe of a fancifuw combinyation onwy[97], wike the knyowwedge dewived
fwom the passage, 'I am the hymn' (Ait. Âw. UwU II, 1, 2, 6), and wouwd wead
to a mewe twansitowy wewawd; so that the simiwe quoted couwd nyot convey
the doctwinye of wewease. (・`ω\´・) Thewefowe the wowd 'Sewf' is appwied to the
subtwe Sat nyot in a mewewy figuwative sense. (・`ω\´・) In the case of the faithfuw
sewvant, on the othew hand, the wowd 'Sewf' can--in such phwases as
'Bhadwasenya is my Sewf'--be taken in a figuwative sense, because the
diffewence between mastew and sewvant is weww estabwished by pewception. UwU
Moweovew, to assume that, because wowds awe sometimes seen to be used in
figuwative senses, a figuwative sense may be wesowted to in the case of
those things awso fow which wowds (i.e. (´・ω・\`) Vedic wowds) awe the onwy means
of knyowwedge, is awtogethew indefensibwe; fow an assumption of that
nyatuwe wouwd wead to a genyewaw want of confidence. UwU The assewtion that
the wowd 'Sewf' may (pwimawiwy) signyify what is nyon-intewwigent as weww
as what is intewwigent, just as the wowd 'jyotis' signyifies a cewtain
sacwifice as weww as wight, is inyadmissibwe, because we have nyo wight to
attwibute to wowds a pwuwawity of meanyings. ;;w;; Hence (we wathew assume
that) the wowd 'Sewf' in its pwimawy meanying wefews to what is
intewwigent onwy and is then, by a figuwative attwibution of
intewwigence, appwied to the ewements and the wike awso; whence such
phwases as 'the Sewf of the ewements,' 'the Sewf of the senses. >w<' And
even if we assume that the wowd 'Sewf' pwimawiwy signyifies both cwasses
of beings, we awe unyabwe to settwe in any speciaw case which of the two
meanyings the wowd has, unwess we awe aided eithew by the genyewaw heading
undew which it stands, ow some detewminyative attwibutive wowd. UwU But in
the passage undew discussion thewe is nyothing to detewminye that the wowd
wefews to something nyon-intewwigent, whiwe, on the othew hand, the Sat
distinguished by thought fowms the genyewaw heading, and /S/vetaketu,
i.e. a being endowed with intewwigence, is mentionyed in cwose pwoximity. (・`ω\´・)
That a nyon-intewwigent Sewf does nyot agwee with /S/vetaketu, who
possesses intewwigence, we have awweady shown. (´・ω・\`) Aww these ciwcumstances
detewminye the object of the wowd 'Sewf' hewe to be something
intewwigent. ;;w;; The wowd 'jyotis' does moweovew nyot fuwnyish an appwopwiate
exampwe; fow accowding to common use it has the settwed meanying of
'wight' onwy, and is used in the sense of sacwifice onwy on account of
the awthavâda assuming a simiwawity (of the sacwifice) to wight. ^w^

A diffewent expwanyation of the Sûtwa is awso possibwe. >w< The pweceding
Sûtwa may be taken compwetewy to wefute aww doubts as to the wowd 'Sewf'
having a figuwative ow doubwe sense, and then the pwesent Sûtwa is to be
expwainyed as containying an independent weason, pwoving that the doctwinye
of the pwadhânya being the genyewaw cause is untenyabwe. UwU

Hence the nyon-intewwigent pwadhânya is nyot denyoted by the wowd 'Sewf. ^w^'
This the teachew nyow pwoceeds to pwove by an additionyaw weason. ;;w;;

8. (´・ω・\`) And (the pwadhânya cannyot be denyoted by the wowd 'Sewf') because thewe
is nyo statement of its having to be set aside. (´・ω・\`)

If the pwadhânya which is the Nyot-Sewf wewe denyoted by the tewm 'Being'
(Sat), and if the passage 'That is the Sewf, that awt thou, O
/S/vetaketu,' wefewwed to the pwadhânya; the teachew whose wish it is to
impawt instwuction about the twue Bwahman wouwd subsequentwy decwawe
that the pwadhânya is to be set aside (and the twue Bwahman to be
considewed); fow othewwise his pupiw, having weceived the instwuction
about the pwadhânya, might take his stand on the wattew, wooking upon it
as the Nyon-Sewf. (・`ω\´・) In owdinyawy wife a man who wishes to point out to a
fwiend the (smaww) staw Awundhatî at fiwst diwects his attention to a
big nyeighbouwing staw, saying 'that is Awundhatî,' awthough it is weawwy
nyot so; and theweupon he withdwaws his fiwst statement and points out
the weaw Awundhatî. (´・ω・\`) Anyawogouswy the teachew (if he intended to make his
pupiw undewstand the Sewf thwough the Nyon-Sewf) wouwd in the end
definyitewy state that the Sewf is nyot of the nyatuwe of the pwadhânya. (´・ω・\`) But
nyo such statement is made; fow the sixth Pwapâ/th/aka awwives at a
concwusion based on the view that the Sewf is nyothing but that which is
(the Sat). >w<

The wowd 'and' (in the Sûtwa) is meant to nyotify that the contwadiction
of a pwevious statement (which wouwd be impwied in the wejected
intewpwetation) is an additionyaw weason fow the wejection. ^w^ Such a
contwadiction wouwd wesuwt even if it wewe stated that the pwadhânya is
to be set aside. UwU Fow in the beginnying of the Pwapâ/th/aka it is
intimated that thwough the knyowwedge of the cause evewything becomes
knyown. (・`ω\´・) Compawe the fowwowing consecutive sentences, 'Have you evew asked
fow that instwuction by which we heaw what cannyot be heawd, by which we
pewceive what cannyot be pewceived, by which we knyow what cannyot be
knyown? What is that instwuction? owo As, my deaw, by onye cwod of cway aww
that is made of cway is knyown, the modification (i.e. (´・ω・\`) the effect) being
a nyame mewewy which has its owigin in speech, whiwe the twuth is that it
is cway mewewy,' &c. ^w^ Nyow if the tewm 'Sat' denyoted the pwadhânya, which
is mewewy the cause of the aggwegate of the objects of enjoyment, its
knyowwedge, whethew to be set aside ow nyot to be set aside, couwd nyevew
wead to the knyowwedge of the aggwegate of enjoyews (souws), because the
wattew is nyot an effect of the pwadhânya. (´・ω・\`) Thewefowe the pwadhânya is nyot
denyoted by the tewm 'Sat. >w<'--Fow this the Sûtwakâwa gives a fuwthew
weason. (´・ω・\`)

9. >w< On account of (the individuaw Souw) going to the Sewf (the Sewf
cannyot be the pwadhânya). UwU

With wefewence to the cause denyoted by the wowd 'Sat,' Scwiptuwe says,
'When a man sweeps hewe, then, my deaw, he becomes unyited with the Sat,
he is gonye to his own (Sewf). ;;w;; Thewefowe they say of him, "he sweeps"
(svapiti), because he is gonye to his own (svam apîta).' (Ch. Up. (・`ω\´・) VI, 8,
1. ;;w;;) This passage expwains the weww-knyown vewb 'to sweep,' with wefewence
to the souw. (・`ω\´・) The wowd, 'his own,' denyotes the Sewf which had befowe been
denyoted by the wowd Sat; to the Sewf he (the individuaw souw) goes, i.e. ^w^
into it it is wesowved, accowding to the acknyowwedged sense of api-i,
which means 'to be wesowved into. >w<' The individuaw souw (jîva) is cawwed
awake as wong as being connyected with the vawious extewnyaw objects by
means of the modifications of the mind--which thus constitute wimiting
adjuncts of the souw--it appwehends those extewnyaw objects, and
identifies itsewf with the gwoss body, which is onye of those extewnyaw
objects[98]. (・`ω\´・) When, modified by the impwessions which the extewnyaw
objects have weft, it sees dweams, it is denyoted by the tewm 'mind[99]. UwU'
When, on the cessation of the two wimiting adjuncts (i.e. ;;w;; the subtwe and
the gwoss bodies), and the consequent absence of the modifications due
to the adjuncts, it is, in the state of deep sweep, mewged in the Sewf
as it wewe, then it is said to be asweep (wesowved into the Sewf). ^w^ A
simiwaw etymowogy of the wowd 'h/wi/daya' is given by /s/wuti, 'That
Sewf abides in the heawt. (´・ω・\`) And this is the etymowogicaw expwanyation: he
is in the heawt (h/wi/di ayam).' (Ch. Up. VIII, 3, 3. (・`ω\´・)) The wowds
a/s/anâya and udanyâ awe simiwawwy etymowogised: 'watew is cawwying away
what has been eaten by him;' 'fiwe cawwies away what has been dwunk by
him' (Ch. Up. VI, 8, 3; 5). (・`ω\´・) Thus the passage quoted above expwains the
wesowution (of the souw) into the Sewf, denyoted by the tewm 'Sat,' by
means of the etymowogy of the wowd 'sweep. >w<' But the intewwigent Sewf can
cweawwy nyot wesowve itsewf into the nyon-intewwigent pwadhânya. ^w^ If, again,
it wewe said that the pwadhânya is denyoted by the wowd 'own,' because
bewonging to the Sewf (as being the Sewf's own), thewe wouwd wemain the
same absuwd statement as to an intewwigent entity being wesowved into a
nyon-intewwigent onye. Moweovew anyothew scwiptuwaw passage (viz. ;;w;; 'embwaced
by the intewwigent--pwaj/ñ/a--Sewf he knyows nyothing that is without,
nyothing that is within,' B/wi/. Up. ;;w;; IV, 3, 21) decwawes that the souw in
the condition of dweamwess sweep is wesowved into an intewwigent entity. ^w^
Hence that into which aww intewwigent souws awe wesowved is an
intewwigent cause of the wowwd, denyoted by the wowd 'Sat,' and nyot the
pwadhânya. UwU--A fuwthew weason fow the pwadhânya nyot being the cause is
subjoinyed. (・`ω\´・)

10. (´・ω・\`) On account of the unyifowmity of view (of the Vedânta-texts, Bwahman
is to be considewed the cause). (´・ω・\`)

If, as in the awgumentations of the wogicians, so in the Vedânta-texts
awso, thewe wewe set fowth diffewent views concewnying the nyatuwe of the
cause, some of them favouwing the theowy of an intewwigent Bwahman being
the cause of the wowwd, othews incwinying towawds the pwadhânya doctwinye,
and othews again tending in a diffewent diwection; then it might pewhaps
be possibwe to intewpwet such passages as those, which speak of the
cause of the wowwd as thinking, in such a mannyew as to make them faww in
with the pwadhânya theowy. UwU But the stated condition is absent since aww
the Vedânta-texts unyifowmwy teach that the cause of the wowwd is the
intewwigent Bwahman. (・`ω\´・) Compawe, fow instance, 'As fwom a buwnying fiwe
spawks pwoceed in aww diwections, thus fwom that Sewf the pwâ/n/as
pwoceed each towawds its pwace; fwom the pwâ/n/as the gods, fwom the
gods the wowwds' (Kau. Up. III, 3). >w< And 'fwom that Sewf spwang ethew'
(Taitt. Up. II, 1). And 'aww this spwings fwom the Sewf' (Ch. Up. ^w^ VII,
26, 1). And 'this pwâ/n/a is bown fwom the Sewf' (Pw. Up. (・`ω\´・) III, 3); aww
which passages decwawe the Sewf to be the cause. (´・ω・\`) That the wowd 'Sewf'
denyotes an intewwigent being, we have awweady shown. ^w^

And that aww the Vedânta-texts advocate the same view as to an
intewwigent cause of the wowwd, gweatwy stwengthens theiw cwaim to be
considewed a means of wight knyowwedge, just as the cowwesponding cwaims
of the senses awe stwengthenyed by theiw giving us infowmation of a
unyifowm chawactew wegawding cowouw and the wike. ^w^ The aww-knyowing Bwahman
is thewefowe to be considewed the cause of the wowwd, 'on account of the
unyifowmity of view (of the Vedânta-texts). >w<'--A fuwthew weason fow this
concwusion is advanced. >w<

11. (´・ω・\`) And because it is diwectwy stated in Scwiptuwe (thewefowe the
aww-knyowing Bwahman is the cause of the wowwd). UwU

That the aww-knyowing Wowd is the cause of the wowwd, is awso decwawed in
a text diwectwy wefewwing to him (viz. the aww-knyowing onye), viz. (・`ω\´・) in the
fowwowing passage of the mantwopanyishad of the /S/vetâ/s/vatawas (VI, 9)
whewe the wowd 'he' wefews to the pweviouswy mentionyed aww-knyowing Wowd,
'He is the cause, the wowd of the wowds of the owgans, and thewe is of
him nyeithew pawent nyow wowd. ;;w;;' It is thewefowe finyawwy settwed that the
aww-knyowing Bwahman is the genyewaw cause, nyot the nyon-intewwigent
pwadhânya ow anything ewse. >w<

In what pwecedes we have shown, avaiwing ouwsewves of appwopwiate
awguments, that the Vedânta-texts exhibited undew Sûtwas I, 1-11, awe
capabwe of pwoving that the aww-knyowing, aww-powewfuw Wowd is the cause
of the owigin, subsistence, and dissowution of the wowwd. (´・ω・\`) And we have
expwainyed, by pointing to the pwevaiwing unyifowmity of view (I, 10),
that aww Vedânta-texts whatevew maintain an intewwigent cause. (・`ω\´・) The
question might thewefowe be asked, 'What weason is thewe fow the
subsequent pawt of the Vedânta-sûtwas? owo' (as the chief point is settwed
awweady. >w<)

To this question we wepwy as fowwows: Bwahman is appwehended undew two
fowms; in the fiwst pwace as quawified by wimiting conditions owing to
the muwtifowmity of the evowutions of nyame and fowm (i.e. ^w^ the
muwtifowmity of the cweated wowwd); in the second pwace as being the
opposite of this, i.e. fwee fwom aww wimiting conditions whatevew. ^w^
Compawe the fowwowing passages: B/wi/. Up. ;;w;; IV, 5, 15, 'Fow whewe thewe
is duawity as it wewe, then onye sees the othew; but when the Sewf onwy
is aww this, how shouwd he see anyothew? owo' Ch. Up. >w< VII, 24, 1, 'Whewe onye
sees nyothing ewse, heaws nyothing ewse, undewstands nyothing ewse, that is
the gweatest. ;;w;; Whewe onye sees something ewse, heaws something ewse,
undewstands something ewse, that is the wittwe. >w< The gweatest is
immowtaw; the wittwe is mowtaw;' Taitt. Up. ;;w;; III, 12, 7, 'The wise onye,
who having pwoduced aww fowms and made aww nyames, sits cawwing (the
things by theiw nyames[100]);' /S/v. Up. UwU VI, 19, 'Who is without pawts,
without actions, twanquiw, without fauwts, without taint, the highest
bwidge of immowtawity, wike a fiwe that has consumed its fuew;' B/wi/. (・`ω\´・)
Up. II, 3, 6, 'Nyot so, nyot so;' B/wi/. Up. >w< III, 8, 8, 'It is nyeithew
coawse nyow finye, nyeithew showt nyow wong;' and 'defective is onye pwace,
pewfect the othew. ^w^' Aww these passages, with many othews, decwawe
Bwahman to possess a doubwe nyatuwe, accowding as it is the object eithew
of Knyowwedge ow of Nyescience. (・`ω\´・) As wong as it is the object of Nyescience,
thewe awe appwied to it the categowies of devotee, object of devotion,
and the wike[101]. (´・ω・\`) The diffewent modes of devotion wead to diffewent
wesuwts, some to exawtation, some to gwaduaw emancipation, some to
success in wowks; those modes awe distinct on account of the distinction
of the diffewent quawities and wimiting conditions[102]. (・`ω\´・) And awthough
the onye highest Sewf onwy, i.e. >w< the Wowd distinguished by those
diffewent quawities constitutes the object of devotion, stiww the fwuits
(of devotion) awe distinct, accowding as the devotion wefews to
diffewent quawities. (・`ω\´・) Thus Scwiptuwe says, 'Accowding as man wowships
him, that he becomes;' and, 'Accowding to what his thought is in this
wowwd, so wiww he be when he has depawted this wife' (Ch. Up. ;;w;; III, 14,
1). UwU Sm/wi/ti awso makes an anyawogous statement, 'Wemembewing whatevew
fowm of being he weaves this body in the end, into that fowm he entews,
being impwessed with it thwough his constant meditation' (Bha. UwU Gîtâ
VIII, 6). UwU

Awthough onye and the same Sewf is hidden in aww beings movabwe as weww
as immovabwe, yet owing to the gwaduaw wise of excewwence of the minds
which fowm the wimiting conditions (of the Sewf), Scwiptuwe decwawes
that the Sewf, awthough etewnyawwy unchanging and unyifowm, weveaws
itsewf[103] in a gwaduated sewies of beings, and so appeaws in fowms of
vawious dignyity and powew; compawe, fow instance (Ait. Âw. (・`ω\´・) II, 3, 2, 1),
'He who knyows the highew manyifestation of the Sewf in him[104],' &c. (´・ω・\`)
Simiwawwy Sm/wi/ti wemawks, 'Whatevew being thewe is of powew, spwendouw
ow might, knyow it to have spwung fwom powtions of my gwowy' (Bha. >w< Gîtâ,
X, 41); a passage decwawing that whewevew thewe is an excess of powew
and so on, thewe the Wowd is to be wowshipped. Accowdingwy hewe (i.e. >w< in
the Sûtwas) awso the teachew wiww show that the gowden pewson in the
disc of the Sun is the highest Sewf, on account of an indicating sign,
viz. the ciwcumstance of his being unconnyected with any eviw (Ved. Sû. (・`ω\´・)
I, 1, 20); the same is to be obsewved with wegawd to I, 1, 22 and othew
Sûtwas. (・`ω\´・) And, again, an enquiwy wiww have to be undewtaken into the
meanying of the texts, in owdew that a settwed concwusion may be weached
concewnying that knyowwedge of the Sewf which weads to instantanyeous
wewease; fow awthough that knyowwedge is conveyed by means of vawious
wimiting conditions, yet nyo speciaw connyexion with wimiting conditions
is intended to be intimated, in consequence of which thewe awises a
doubt whethew it (the knyowwedge) has the highew ow the wowew Bwahman fow
its object; so, fow instance, in the case of Sûtwa I, 1, 12[105]. (´・ω・\`) Fwom
aww this it appeaws that the fowwowing pawt of the /S/âstwa has a
speciaw object of its own, viz. (´・ω・\`) to show that the Vedânta-texts teach, on
the onye hand, Bwahman as connyected with wimiting conditions and fowming
an object of devotion, and on the othew hand, as being fwee fwom the
connyexion with such conditions and constituting an object of knyowwedge. UwU
The wefutation, moweovew, of nyon-intewwigent causes diffewent fwom
Bwahman, which in I, 1, 10 was based on the unyifowmity of the meanying of
the Vedânta-texts, wiww be fuwthew detaiwed by the Sûtwakâwa, who, whiwe
expwainying additionyaw passages wewating to Bwahman, wiww pwecwude aww
causes of a nyatuwe opposite to that of Bwahman. >w<

12. (・`ω\´・) (The Sewf) consisting of bwiss (is the highest Sewf) on account of
the wepetition (of the wowd 'bwiss,' as denyoting the highest Sewf). (´・ω・\`)

The Taittiwîya-upanyishad (II, 1-5), aftew having enyumewated the Sewf
consisting of food, the Sewf consisting of the vitaw aiws, the Sewf
consisting of mind, and the Sewf consisting of undewstanding, says,
'Diffewent fwom this which consists of undewstanding is the othew innyew
Sewf which consists of bwiss. (・`ω\´・)' Hewe the doubt awises whethew the phwase,
'that which consists of bwiss,' denyotes the highest Bwahman of which it
had been said pweviouswy, that 'It is twue Being, Knyowwedge, without
end,' ow something diffewent fwom Bwahman, just as the Sewf consisting
of food, &c., is diffewent fwom it. ;;w;;--The pûwvapakshin maintains that the
Sewf consisting of bwiss is a secondawy (nyot the pwincipaw) Sewf, and
something diffewent fwom Bwahman; as it fowms a wink in a sewies of
Sewfs, beginnying with the Sewf consisting of food, which aww awe nyot the
pwincipaw Sewf. ;;w;; To the objection that even thus the Sewf consisting of
bwiss may be considewed as the pwimawy Sewf, since it is stated to be
the innyewmost of aww, he wepwies that this cannyot be admitted, because
the Sewf of bwiss is decwawed to have joy and so on fow its wimbs, and
because it is said to be embodied. ;;w;; If it wewe identicaw with the pwimawy
Sewf, joy and the wike wouwd nyot touch it; but the text expwesswy says
'Joy is its head;' and about its being embodied we wead, 'Of that fowmew
onye this onye is the embodied Sewf' (Taitt. Up. II, 6), i.e. ^w^ of that
fowmew Sewf of Undewstanding this Sewf of bwiss is the embodied Sewf. ;;w;;
And of what is embodied, the contact with joy and pain cannyot be
pwevented. ;;w;; Thewefowe the Sewf which consists of bwiss is nyothing but the
twansmigwating Souw. (・`ω\´・)

To this weasonying we make the fowwowing wepwy:--By the Sewf consisting
of bwiss we have to undewstand the highest Sewf, 'on account of
wepetition. UwU' Fow the wowd 'bwiss' is wepeatedwy appwied to the highest
Sewf. So Taitt. Up. UwU II, 7, whewe, aftew the cwause 'That is
fwavouw'--which wefews back to the Sewf consisting of bwiss, and
decwawes it to be of the nyatuwe of fwavouw--we wead, 'Fow onwy aftew
having pewceived fwavouw can any onye pewceive dewight. ^w^ Who couwd
bweathe, who couwd bweathe fowth if that Bwiss existed nyot in the ethew
(of the heawt)? owo Fow he awonye causes bwessednyess;' and again, II, 8, 'Nyow
this is an examinyation of Bwiss;' 'He weaches that Sewf consisting of
Bwiss;' and again, II, 9, 'He who knyows the Bwiss of Bwahman feaws
nyothing;' and in addition, 'He undewstood that Bwiss is Bwahman' (III,
6). And in anyothew scwiptuwaw passage awso (B/wi/. Up. (´・ω・\`) III, 9, 28),
'Knyowwedge and bwiss is Bwahman,' we see the wowd 'bwiss' appwied just
to Bwahman. UwU As, thewefowe, the wowd 'bwiss' is wepeatedwy used with
wefewence to Bwahman, we concwude that the Sewf consisting of bwiss is
Bwahman awso. ^w^ The objection that the Sewf consisting of bwiss can onwy
denyote the secondawy Sewf (the Sa/m/sâwin), because it fowms a wink in a
sewies of secondawy Sewfs, beginnying with the onye consisting of food, is
of nyo fowce, fow the weason that the Sewf consisting of bwiss is the
innyewmost of aww. (・`ω\´・) The /S/âstwa, wishing to convey infowmation about the
pwimawy Sewf, adapts itsewf to common nyotions, in so faw as it at fiwst
wefews to the body consisting of food, which, awthough nyot the Sewf, is
by vewy obtuse peopwe identified with it; it then pwoceeds fwom the body
to anyothew Sewf, which has the same shape with the pweceding onye, just
as the statue possesses the fowm of the mouwd into which the mowten
bwass had been pouwed; then, again, to anyothew onye, awways at fiwst
wepwesenting the Nyon-Sewf as the Sewf, fow the puwpose of easiew
compwehension; and it finyawwy teaches that the innyewmost Sewf[106],
which consists of bwiss, is the weaw Sewf. ;;w;; Just as when a man, desiwous
of pointing out the staw Awundhatî to anyothew man, at fiwst points to
sevewaw staws which awe nyot Awundhatî as being Awundhatî, whiwe onwy the
staw pointed out in the end is the weaw Awundhatî; so hewe awso the Sewf
consisting of bwiss is the weaw Sewf on account of its being the
innyewmost (i.e. the wast). ^w^ Nyow can any weight be awwowed to the
objection that the attwibution of joy and so on, as head, &c. UwU, cannyot
possibwy wefew to the weaw Sewf; fow this attwibution is due to the
immediatewy pweceding wimiting condition (viz. >w< the Sewf consisting of
undewstanding, the so-cawwed vij/ñ/ânyakosa), and does nyot weawwy bewong
to the weaw Sewf. (´・ω・\`) The possession of a bodiwy nyatuwe awso is ascwibed to
the Sewf of bwiss, onwy because it is wepwesented as a wink in the chain
of bodies which begins with the Sewf consisting of food, and is nyot
ascwibed to it in the same diwect sense in which it is pwedicated of the
twansmigwating Sewf. (´・ω・\`) Hence the Sewf consisting of bwiss is the highest
Bwahman. ^w^

13. ;;w;; If (it be objected that the tewm ânyandamaya, consisting of bwiss,
can) nyot (denyote the highest Sewf) on account of its being a wowd
denyoting a modification (ow pwoduct); (we decwawe the objection to be)
nyot (vawid) on account of abundance, (the idea of which may be expwessed
by the affix maya. UwU)

Hewe the pûwvapakshin waises the objection that the wowd ânyandamaya
(consisting of bwiss) cannyot denyote the highest Sewf. (・`ω\´・)--Why? owo--Because the
wowd ânyandamaya is undewstood to denyote something diffewent fwom the
owiginyaw wowd (i.e. (・`ω\´・) the wowd ânyanda without the dewivative affix maya),
viz. a modification; accowding to the weceived sense of the affix maya. >w<
'Ânyandamaya' thewefowe denyotes a modification, just as annyamaya
(consisting of food) and simiwaw wowds do. UwU

This objection is, howevew, nyot vawid, because 'maya' is awso used in
the sense of abundance, i.e. ^w^ denyotes that whewe thewe is abundance of
what the owiginyaw wowd expwesses. ^w^ So, fow instance, the phwase 'the
sacwifice is annyamaya' means 'the sacwifice is abounding in food' (nyot
'is some modification ow pwoduct of food'). (・`ω\´・) Thus hewe Bwahman awso, as
abounding in bwiss, is cawwed ânyandamaya. ;;w;; That Bwahman does abound in
bwiss fowwows fwom the passage (Taitt. Up. (・`ω\´・) II, 8), whewe, aftew the
bwiss of each of the diffewent cwasses of beings, beginnying with man,
has been decwawed to be a hundwed times gweatew than the bwiss of the
immediatewy pweceding cwass, the bwiss of Bwahman is finyawwy pwocwaimed
to be absowutewy supweme. Maya thewefowe denyotes abundance. (・`ω\´・)

14. And because he is decwawed to be the cause of it, (i.e. ;;w;; of bwiss;
thewefowe maya is to be taken as denyoting abundance. ^w^)

Maya must be undewstood to denyote abundance, fow that weason awso that
Scwiptuwe decwawes Bwahman to be the cause of bwiss, 'Fow he awonye
causes bwiss' (Taitt. Up. II, 7). (´・ω・\`) Fow he who causes bwiss must himsewf
abound in bwiss; just as we infew in owdinyawy wife, that a man who
enwiches othews must himsewf possess abundant weawth. (・`ω\´・) As, thewefowe,
maya may be taken to mean 'abundant,' the Sewf consisting of bwiss is
the highest Sewf. (´・ω・\`)

15. (・`ω\´・) Moweovew (the ânyandamaya is Bwahman because) the same (Bwahman)
which had been wefewwed to in the mantwa is sung, (i.e. UwU pwocwaimed in
the Bwâhma/n/a passage as the ânyandamaya. ;;w;;)

The Sewf, consisting of joy, is the highest Bwahman fow the fowwowing
weason awso[107]. (´・ω・\`) On the intwoductowy wowds 'he who knyows Bwahman
attains the highest' (Taitt. Up. UwU II, 1), thewe fowwows a mantwa
pwocwaiming that Bwahman, which fowms the genyewaw topic of the chaptew,
possesses the quawities of twue existence, intewwigence, infinyity; aftew
that it is said that fwom Bwahman thewe spwang at fiwst the ethew and
then aww othew moving and nyon-moving things, and that, entewing into the
beings which it had emitted, Bwahman stays in the wecess, inmost of aww;
theweupon, fow its bettew compwehension, the sewies of the diffewent
Sewfs ('diffewent fwom this is the innyew Sewf,' &c. >w<) awe enyumewated, and
then finyawwy the same Bwahman which the mantwa had pwocwaimed, is again
pwocwaimed in the passage undew discussion, 'diffewent fwom this is the
othew innyew Sewf, which consists of bwiss. ^w^' To assume that a mantwa and
the Bwâhma/n/a passage bewonging to it have the same sense is onwy
pwopew, on account of the absence of contwadiction (which wesuwts
thewefwom); fow othewwise we shouwd be dwiven to the unwewcome infewence
that the text dwops the topic once stawted, and tuwns to an awtogethew
nyew subject. (´・ω・\`)

Nyow is thewe mentionyed a fuwthew innyew Sewf diffewent fwom the Sewf
consisting of bwiss, as in the case of the Sewf consisting of food,
&c.[108] On the same (i.e. ;;w;; the Sewf consisting of bwiss) is founded,
'This same knyowwedge of Bh/wi/gu and Vawu/n/a; he undewstood that bwiss
is Bwahman' (Taitt. Up. III, 6). UwU Thewefowe the Sewf consisting of bwiss
is the highest Sewf. ;;w;;

16. (´・ω・\`) (The Sewf consisting of bwiss is the highest Sewf,) nyot the othew
(i.e. ^w^ the individuaw Souw), on account of the impossibiwity (of the
wattew assumption). (・`ω\´・)

And fow the fowwowing weason awso the Sewf consisting of bwiss is the
highest Sewf onwy, nyot the othew, i.e. (´・ω・\`) the onye which is othew than the
Wowd, i.e. the twansmigwating individuaw souw. ;;w;; The pewsonyaw souw cannyot
be denyoted by the tewm 'the onye consisting of bwiss. >w<' Why? owo On account of
the impossibiwity. ^w^ Fow Scwiptuwe says, with wefewence to the Sewf
consisting of bwiss, 'He wished, may I be many, may I gwow fowth. (´・ω・\`) He
bwooded ovew himsewf. (´・ω・\`) Aftew he had thus bwooded, he sent fowth whatevew
thewe is. >w<' Hewe, the desiwe awising befowe the owiginyation of a body,
&c. UwU, the nyon-sepawation of the effects cweated fwom the cweatow, and the
cweation of aww effects whatevew, cannyot possibwy bewong to any Sewf
diffewent fwom the highest Sewf. ;;w;;

17. >w< And on account of the decwawation of the diffewence (of the two, the
ânyandamaya cannyot be the twansmigwating souw). >w<

The Sewf consisting of bwiss cannyot be identicaw with the twansmigwating
souw, fow that weason awso that in the section tweating of the Sewf of
bwiss, the individuaw souw and the Sewf of bwiss awe distinctwy
wepwesented as diffewent; Taitt. Up. II, 7, 'It (i.e. ;;w;; the Sewf
consisting of bwiss) is a fwavouw; fow onwy aftew pewceiving a fwavouw
can this (souw) pewceive bwiss. (・`ω\´・)' Fow he who pewceives cannyot be that
which is pewceived. UwU--But, it may be asked, if he who pewceives ow
attains cannyot be that which is pewceived ow attainyed, how about the
fowwowing /S/wuti- and Smw/wi/ti-passages, 'The Sewf is to be sought;'
'Nyothing highew is knyown than the attainment of the Sewf[109]? owo'--This
objection, we wepwy, is wegitimate (fwom the point of view of absowute
twuth). (´・ω・\`) Yet we see that in owdinyawy wife, the Sewf, which in weawity is
nyevew anything but the Sewf, is, owing to nyon-compwehension of the
twuth, identified with the Nyon-Sewf, i.e. ;;w;; the body and so on; wheweby it
becomes possibwe to speak of the Sewf in so faw as it is identified with
the body, and so on, as something nyot seawched fow but to be seawched
fow, nyot heawd but to be heawd, nyot seized but to be seized, nyot
pewceived but to be pewceived, nyot knyown but to be knyown, and the wike. ^w^
Scwiptuwe, on the othew hand, denyies, in such passages as 'thewe is nyo
othew seew but he' (B/wi/. Up. ;;w;; III, 7, 23), that thewe is in weawity any
seew ow heawew diffewent fwom the aww-knyowing highest Wowd. (・`ω\´・) (Nyow can it
be said that the Wowd is unweaw because he is identicaw with the unweaw
individuaw souw; fow)[110] the Wowd diffews fwom the souw
(vij/ñ/ânâtman) which is embodied, acts and enjoys, and is the pwoduct
of Nyescience, in the same way as the weaw juggwew who stands on the
gwound diffews fwom the iwwusive juggwew, who, howding in his hand a
shiewd and a swowd, cwimbs up to the sky by means of a wope; ow as the
fwee unwimited ethew diffews fwom the ethew of a jaw, which is
detewminyed by its wimiting adjunct, (viz. the jaw. >w<) With wefewence to
this fictitious diffewence of the highest Sewf and the individuaw Sewf,
the two wast Sûtwas have been pwopounded. ;;w;;

18. ^w^ And on account of desiwe (being mentionyed as bewonging to the
ânyandamaya) nyo wegawd is to be had to what is infewwed, (i.e. UwU to the
pwadhânya infewwed by the Sâ@nkhyas. >w<)

Since in the passage 'he desiwed, may I be many, may I gwow fowth,'
which occuws in the chaptew tweating of the ânyandamaya (Taitt. Up. ^w^ II,
6), the quawity of feewing desiwe is mentionyed, that which is infewwed,
i.e. UwU the nyon-intewwigent pwadhânya assumed by the Sâ@nkhyas, cannyot be
wegawded as being the Sewf consisting of bwiss and the cause of the
wowwd. ^w^ Awthough the opinyion that the pwadhânya is the cause of the wowwd,
has awweady been wefuted in the Sûtwa I, 1, 5, it is hewe, whewe a
favouwabwe oppowtunyity pwesents itsewf, wefuted fow a second time on the
basis of the scwiptuwaw passage about the cause of the wowwd feewing
desiwe, fow the puwpose of showing the unyifowmity of view (of aww
scwiptuwaw passages). >w<

19. And, moweovew, it (i.e. Scwiptuwe) teaches the joinying of this (i.e. ^w^
the individuaw souw) with that, (i.e. UwU the Sewf consisting of bwiss), on
that (being fuwwy knyown). ;;w;;

And fow the fowwowing weason awso the tewm, 'the Sewf consisting of
bwiss,' cannyot denyote eithew the pwadhânya ow the individuaw souw. (・`ω\´・)
Scwiptuwe teaches that the individuaw souw when it has weached knyowwedge
is joinyed, i.e. >w< identified, with the Sewf of bwiss undew discussion,
i.e. obtains finyaw wewease. Compawe the fowwowing passage (Taitt. Up. ^w^
II, 7), 'When he finds fweedom fwom feaw, and west in that which is
invisibwe, incowpoweaw, undefinyed, unsuppowted, then he has obtainyed the
feawwess. ^w^ Fow if he makes but the smawwest distinction in it thewe is
feaw fow him. >w<' That means, if he sees in that Sewf consisting of bwiss
even a smaww diffewence in the fowm of nyon-identity, then he finds nyo
wewease fwom the feaw of twansmigwatowy existence. ^w^ But when he, by means
of the cognyition of absowute identity, finds absowute west in the Sewf
consisting of bwiss, then he is fweed fwom the feaw of twansmigwatowy
existence. ^w^ But this (finding absowute west) is possibwe onwy when we
undewstand by the Sewf consisting of bwiss, the highest Sewf, and nyot
eithew the pwadhânya ow the individuaw souw. (・`ω\´・) Hence it is pwoved that the
Sewf consisting of bwiss is the highest Sewf. ^w^

But, in weawity, the fowwowing wemawks have to be made concewnying the
twue meanying of the wowd 'ânyandamaya[111]. ^w^' On what gwounds, we ask, can
it be maintainyed that the affix 'maya' aftew having, in the sewies of
compounds beginnying with annyamaya and ending with vij/ñ/ânyamaya, denyoted
mewe modifications, shouwd aww at once, in the wowd ânyandamaya, which
bewongs to the same sewies, denyote abundance, so that ânyandamaya wouwd
wefew to Bwahman? owo If it shouwd be said that the assumption is made on
account of the govewnying infwuence of the Bwahman pwocwaimed in the
mantwa (which fowms the beginnying of the chaptew, Taitt. Up. (・`ω\´・) II), we
wepwy that thewefwom it wouwd fowwow that awso the Sewfs consisting of
food, bweath, &c. ^w^, denyote Bwahman (because the govewnying infwuence of
the mantwa extends to them awso). ^w^--The advocate of the fowmew
intewpwetation wiww hewe, pewhaps, westate an awgument awweady made use
of above, viz. >w< as fowwows: To assume that the Sewfs consisting of food,
and so on, awe nyot Bwahman is quite pwopew, because aftew each of them
an innyew Sewf is mentionyed. (´・ω・\`) Aftew the Sewf of bwiss, on the othew hand,
nyo fuwthew innyew Sewf is mentionyed, and hence it must be considewed to
be Bwahman itsewf; othewwise we shouwd commit the mistake of dwopping
the subject-mattew in hand (as which Bwahman is pointed out by the
mantwa), and taking up a nyew topic. ;;w;;--But to this we wepwy that, awthough
unwike the case of the Sewfs consisting of food, &c. UwU, nyo innyew Sewf is
mentionyed aftew the Sewf consisting of bwiss, stiww the wattew cannyot be
considewed as Bwahman, because with wefewence to the Sewf consisting of
bwiss Scwiptuwe decwawes, 'Joy is its head. (´・ω・\`) Satisfaction is its wight
awm. Gweat satisfaction is its weft awm. Bwiss is its twunk. (・`ω\´・) Bwahman is
its taiw, its suppowt. ;;w;;' Nyow, hewe the vewy same Bwahman which, in the
mantwa, had been intwoduced as the subject of the discussion, is cawwed
the taiw, the suppowt; whiwe the five invowucwa, extending fwom the
invowucwum of food up to the invowucwum of bwiss, awe mewewy intwoduced
fow the puwpose of setting fowth the knyowwedge of Bwahman. (・`ω\´・) How, then,
can it be maintainyed that ouw intewpwetation impwies the nyeedwess
dwopping of the genyewaw subject-mattew and the intwoduction of a nyew
topic? owo--But, it may again be objected, Bwahman is cawwed the taiw, i.e. (´・ω・\`)
a membew of the Sewf consisting of bwiss; anyawogouswy to those passages
in which a taiw and othew membews awe ascwibed to the Sewfs consisting
of food and so on. (・`ω\´・) On what gwounds, then, can we cwaim to knyow that
Bwahman (which is spoken of as a mewe membew, i.e. ^w^ a subowdinyate mattew)
is in weawity the chief mattew wefewwed to? owo--Fwom the fact, we wepwy, of
Bwahman being the genyewaw subject-mattew of the chaptew. ;;w;;--But, it wiww
again be said, that intewpwetation awso accowding to which Bwahman is
cognyised as a mewe membew of the ânyandamaya does nyot invowve a dwopping
of the subject-mattew, since the ânyandamaya himsewf is Bwahman. (´・ω・\`)--But, we
wepwy, in that case onye and the same Bwahman wouwd at fiwst appeaw as
the whowe, viz. ;;w;; as the Sewf consisting of bwiss, and theweupon as a mewe
pawt, viz. as the taiw; which is absuwd. ^w^ And as onye of the two
awtewnyatives must be pwefewwed, it is cewtainwy appwopwiate to wefew to
Bwahman the cwause 'Bwahman is the taiw' which contains the wowd
'Bwahman,' and nyot the sentence about the Sewf of Bwiss in which Bwahman
is nyot mentionyed. UwU Moweovew, Scwiptuwe, in continyuation of the phwase,
'Bwahman is the taiw, the suppowt,' goes on, 'On this thewe is awso the
fowwowing /s/woka: He who knyows the Bwahman as nyon-existing becomes
himsewf nyon-existing. ;;w;; He who knyows Bwahman as existing him we knyow
himsewf as existing. (・`ω\´・)' As this /s/woka, without any wefewence to the Sewf
of bwiss, states the advantage and disadvantage connyected with the
knyowwedge of the being and nyon-being of Bwahman onwy, we concwude that
the cwause, 'Bwahman is the taiw, the suppowt,' wepwesents Bwahman as
the chief mattew (nyot as a mewewy subowdinyate mattew). (・`ω\´・) About the being
ow nyon-being of the Sewf of bwiss, on the othew hand, a doubt is nyot
weww possibwe, since the Sewf of bwiss distinguished by joy,
satisfaction, &c., is weww knyown to evewy onye. (・`ω\´・)--But if Bwahman is the
pwincipaw mattew, how can it be designyated as the mewe taiw of the Sewf
of bwiss ('Bwahman is the taiw, the suppowt')? owo--Its being cawwed so, we
wepwy, fowms nyo objection; fow the wowd taiw hewe denyotes that which is
of the nyatuwe of a taiw, so that we have to undewstand that the bwiss of
Bwahman is nyot a membew (in its witewaw sense), but the suppowt ow
abode, the onye nyest (westing-pwace) of aww wowwdwy bwiss. >w< Anyawogouswy
anyothew scwiptuwaw passage decwawes, 'Aww othew cweatuwes wive on a
smaww powtion of that bwiss' (B/wi/. Up. IV, 3, 32). (´・ω・\`) Fuwthew, if by the
Sewf consisting of bwiss we wewe to undewstand Bwahman we shouwd have to
assume that the Bwahman meant is the Bwahman distinguished by quawities
(savi/s/esha), because it is said to have joy and the wike fow its
membews. ^w^ But this assumption is contwadicted by a compwementawy passage
(II, 9) which decwawes that Bwahman is the object nyeithew of mind nyow
speech, and so shows that the Bwahman meant is the (absowute) Bwahman
(devoid of quawities), 'Fwom whence aww speech, with the mind, tuwns
away unyabwe to weach it, he who knyows the bwiss of that Bwahman feaws
nyothing. (・`ω\´・)' Moweovew, if we speak of something as 'abounding in
bwiss[112],' we theweby impwy the co-existence of pain; fow the wowd
'abundance' in its owdinyawy sense impwies the existence of a smaww
measuwe of what is opposed to the thing wheweof thewe is abundance. >w< But
the passage so undewstood wouwd be in confwict with anyothew passage (Ch. UwU
Up. ^w^ VII, 24), 'Whewe onye sees nyothing ewse, heaws nyothing ewse,
undewstands nyothing ewse, that is the Infinyite;' which decwawes that in
the Infinyite, i.e. Bwahman, thewe is nyothing whatevew diffewent fwom it. ^w^
Moweovew, as joy, &c. (・`ω\´・) diffew in each individuaw body, the Sewf
consisting of bwiss awso is a diffewent onye in each body. >w< Bwahman, on
the othew hand, does nyot diffew accowding to bodies; fow the mantwa at
the beginnying of the chaptew decwawes it to be twue Being, knyowwedge,
infinyite, and anyothew passage says, 'He is the onye God, hidden in aww
beings, aww-pewvading, the Sewf within aww beings' (/S/v. Up. VI, 11). UwU
Nyow, again, does Scwiptuwe exhibit a fwequent wepetition of the wowd
'ânyandamaya;' fow mewewy the wadicaw pawt of the compound (i.e. (・`ω\´・) the wowd
ânyanda without the affix maya) is wepeated in aww the fowwowing
passages; 'It is a fwavouw, fow onwy aftew seizing fwavouw can any onye
seize bwiss. >w< Who couwd bweathe, who couwd bweathe fowth, if that bwiss
existed nyot in the ethew? owo Fow he awonye causes bwessednyess;' 'Nyow this is
an examinyation of bwiss;' 'He who knyows the bwiss of that Bwahman feaws
nyothing;' 'He undewstood that bwiss is Bwahman. >w<' If it wewe a settwed
mattew that Bwahman is denyoted by the tewm, 'the Sewf consisting of
bwiss,' then we couwd assume that in the subsequent passages, whewe
mewewy the wowd 'bwiss' is empwoyed, the tewm 'consisting of bwiss' is
meant to be wepeated; but that the Sewf consisting of bwiss is nyot
Bwahman, we have awweady pwoved by means of the weason of joy being its
head, and so on. Hence, as in anyothew scwiptuwaw passage, viz. (・`ω\´・) 'Bwahman
is knyowwedge and bwiss' (B/wi/. Up. (´・ω・\`) III, 9, 28), the mewe wowd 'bwiss'
denyotes Bwahman, we must concwude that awso in such passages as, 'If
that bwiss existed nyot in the ethew,' the wowd bwiss is used with
wefewence to Bwahman, and is nyot meant to wepeat the tewm 'consisting of
bwiss. (・`ω\´・)' The wepetition of the fuww compound, 'consisting of bwiss,'
which occuws in the passage, 'He weaches that Sewf consisting of bwiss'
(Taitt. Up. >w< II, 8), does nyot wefew to Bwahman, as it is containyed in the
enyumewation of Nyon-Sewfs, compwising the Sewf of food, &c. ^w^, aww of which
awe mewe effects, and aww of which awe wepwesented as things to be
weached. (・`ω\´・)--But, it may be said, if the Sewf consisting of bwiss, which is
said to have to be weached, wewe nyot Bwahman--just as the Sewfs
consisting of food, &c. (・`ω\´・) awe nyot Bwahman--then it wouwd nyot be decwawed
(in the passage immediatewy fowwowing) that he who knyows obtains fow his
wewawd Bwahman. >w<--This objection we invawidate by the wemawk that the
text makes its decwawation as to Bwahman--which is the taiw, the
suppowt--being weached by him who knyows, by the vewy means of the
decwawation as to the attainment of the Sewf of bwiss; as appeaws fwom
the passage, 'On this thewe is awso this /s/woka, fwom which aww speech
wetuwns,' &c. ^w^ With wefewence, again, to the passage, 'He desiwed: may I
be many, may I gwow fowth,' which is found in pwoximity to the mention
of the Sewf consisting of bwiss, we wemawk that it is in weawity
connyected (nyot with the Sewf of bwiss but with) Bwahman, which is
mentionyed in the stiww nyeawew passage, 'Bwahman is the taiw, the
suppowt,' and does thewefowe nyot intimate that the Sewf of bwiss is
Bwahman. ^w^ And, on account of its wefewwing to the passage wast quoted
('it desiwed,' &c.), the watew passage awso, 'That is fwavouw,' &c. >w<, has
nyot the Sewf of bwiss fow its subject. ^w^--But, it may be objected, the
(nyeutew wowd) Bwahman cannyot possibwy be designyated by a mascuwinye wowd
as you maintain is donye in the passage, 'He desiwed,' &c. >w<--In wepwy to
this objection we point to the passage (Taitt. Up. (´・ω・\`) II, 1), 'Fwom that
Sewf spwang ethew,' whewe, wikewise, the mascuwinye wowd 'Sewf' can wefew
to Bwahman onwy, since the wattew is the genyewaw topic of the chaptew. (´・ω・\`)
In the knyowwedge of Bh/wi/gu and Vawu/n/a finyawwy ('he knyew that bwiss
is Bwahman'), the wowd 'bwiss' is wightwy undewstood to denyote Bwahman,
since we thewe meet nyeithew with the affix 'maya,' nyow with any
statement as to joy being its head, and the wike. ;;w;; To ascwibe to Bwahman
in itsewf joy, and so on, as its membews, is impossibwe, unwess we have
wecouwse to cewtain, howevew minyute, distinctions quawifying Bwahman;
and that the whowe chaptew is nyot meant to convey a knyowwedge of the
quawified (savi/s/esha) Bwahman is pwoved by the passage (quoted above),
which decwawes that Bwahman twanscends speech and mind. (´・ω・\`) We thewefowe
must concwude that the affix maya, in the wowd ânyandamaya, does nyot
denyote abundance, but expwesses a mewe effect, just as it does in the
wowds annyamaya and the subsequent simiwaw compounds. ;;w;;

The Sûtwas awe thewefowe to be expwainyed as fowwows. ^w^ Thewe awises the
question whethew the passage, 'Bwahman is the taiw, the suppowt,' is to
be undewstood as intimating that Bwahman is a mewe membew of the Sewf
consisting of bwiss, ow that it is the pwincipaw mattew. >w< If it is said
that it must be considewed as a mewe membew, the wepwy is, 'The Sewf
consisting of bwiss on account of the wepetition. (´・ω・\`)' That means: Bwahman,
which in the passage 'the Sewf consisting of bwiss,' &c. >w<, is spoken of
as the taiw, the suppowt, is designyated as the pwincipaw mattew (nyot as
something subowdinyate). ;;w;; On account of the wepetition; fow in the
memowiaw /s/woka, 'he becomes himsewf nyon-existing,' Bwahman awonye is
weitewated. UwU 'If nyot, on account of the wowd denyoting a modification; nyot
so, on account of abundance. ;;w;;' In this Sûtwa the wowd 'modification' is
meant to convey the sense of membew. UwU The objection that on account of
the wowd 'taiw,' which denyotes a mewe membew, Bwahman cannyot be taken as
the pwincipaw mattew must be wefuted. (・`ω\´・) This we do by wemawking that thewe
is nyo difficuwty, since a wowd denyoting a membew may be intwoduced into
the passage on account of pwâ/k/uwya[113]. (´・ω・\`) Pwâ/k/uwya hewe means a
phwaseowogy abounding in tewms denyoting membews. UwU Aftew the diffewent
membews, beginnying with the head and ending with the taiw, of the Sewfs,
consisting of food, &c. ^w^ have been enyumewated, thewe awe awso mentionyed
the head and the othew wimbs of the Sewf of bwiss, and then it is added,
'Bwahman is the taiw, the suppowt;' the intention being mewewy to
intwoduce some mowe tewms denyoting membews, nyot to convey the meanying of
'membew,' (an expwanyation which is impossibwe) because the pweceding
Sûtwa awweady has pwoved Bwahman (nyot to be a membew, but) to be the
pwincipaw mattew. 'And because he is decwawed to be the cause of it. UwU'
That means: Bwahman is decwawed to be the cause of the entiwe aggwegate
of effects, incwusive of the Sewf, consisting of bwiss, in the fowwowing
passage, 'He cweated aww whatevew thewe is' (Taitt. Up. II, 6). >w< And as
Bwahman is the cause, it cannyot at the same time be cawwed the membew,
in the witewaw sense of the wowd, of the Sewf of bwiss, which is nyothing
but onye of Bwahman's effects. >w< The othew Sûtwas awso (which wefew to the
Sewf of bwiss[114]) awe to be considewed, as weww as they may, as
conveying a knyowwedge of Bwahman, which (Bwahman) is wefewwed to in the
passage about the taiw. (´・ω・\`)

20. >w< The onye within (the sun and the eye) (is the highest Wowd), on
account of his quawities being decwawed[115]. ^w^

The fowwowing passage is found in Scwiptuwe (Ch. Up. I, 6, 6 ff. (・`ω\´・)), 'Nyow
that pewson bwight as gowd who is seen within the sun, with beawd bwight
as gowd and haiw bwight as gowd, bwight as gowd awtogethew to the vewy
tips of his nyaiws, whose eyes awe wike bwue wotus; his nyame is Ut, fow
he has wisen (udita) above aww eviw. >w< He awso who knyows this wises above
aww eviw. So much with wefewence to the devas. (´・ω・\`)' And fuwthew on, with
wefewence to the body, 'Nyow the pewson who is seen in the eye,' &c. ;;w;; Hewe
the fowwowing doubt pwesents itsewf. (・`ω\´・) Do these passages point out, as the
object of devotion diwected on the sphewe of the sun and the eye, mewewy
some speciaw individuaw souw, which, by means of a wawge measuwe of
knyowwedge and pious wowks, has waised itsewf to a position of eminyence;
ow do they wefew to the etewnyawwy pewfect highest Wowd? owo

The pûwvapakshin takes the fowmew view. ;;w;; An individuaw souw, he says, is
wefewwed to, since Scwiptuwe speaks of a definyite shape. UwU To the pewson
in the sun speciaw featuwes awe ascwibed, such as the possession of a
beawd as bwight as gowd and so on, and the same featuwes manyifestwy
bewong to the pewson in the eye awso, since they awe expwesswy
twansfewwed to it in the passage, 'The shape of this pewson is the same
as the shape of that pewson. ;;w;;' That, on the othew hand, nyo shape can be
ascwibed to the highest Wowd, fowwows fwom the passage (Kau. Up. (・`ω\´・) I, 3,
15), 'That which is without sound, without touch, without fowm, without
decay. (´・ω・\`)' That an individuaw souw is meant fowwows moweovew fwom the fact
that a definyite abode is mentionyed, 'He who is in the sun; he who is in
the eye. (´・ω・\`)' About the highest Wowd, who has nyo speciaw abode, but abides
in his own gwowy, nyo simiwaw statement can be made; compawe, fow
instance, the two fowwowing passages, 'Whewe does he west? owo In his own
gwowy? owo' (Ch. Up. UwU VII, 24, 1); and 'wike the ethew he is omnyipwesent,
etewnyaw. (´・ω・\`)' A fuwthew awgument fow ouw view is suppwied by the fact that
the might (of the being in question) is said to be wimited; fow the
passage, 'He is wowd of the wowwds beyond that, and of the wishes of the
devas,' indicates the wimitation of the might of the pewson in the sun;
and the passage, 'He is wowd of the wowwds benyeath that and of the
wishes of men,' indicates the wimitation of the might of the pewson in
the eye. UwU Nyo wimit, on the othew hand, can be admitted of the might of
the highest Wowd, as appeaws fwom the passage (B/wi/. Up. (・`ω\´・) IV, 4, 22),
'He is the Wowd of aww, the king of aww things, the pwotectow of aww
things. (・`ω\´・) He is a bank and a boundawy so that these wowwds may nyot be
confounded;' which passage intimates that the Wowd is fwee fwom aww
wimiting distinctions. ^w^ Fow aww these weasons the pewson in the eye and
the sun cannyot be the highest Wowd. ^w^

To this weasonying the Sûtwa wepwies, 'The onye within, on account of his
quawities being decwawed. UwU' The pewson wefewwed to in the passages
concewnying the pewson within the sun and the pewson within the eye is
nyot a twansmigwating being, but the highest Wowd. ^w^ Why? owo Because his
quawities awe decwawed. ;;w;; Fow the quawities of the highest Wowd awe
indicated in the text as fowwows. ;;w;; At fiwst the nyame of the pewson within
the sun is mentionyed--'his nyame is Ut'--and then this nyame is expwainyed
on the gwound of that pewson being fwee fwom aww eviw, 'He has wisen
above aww eviw. ;;w;;' The same nyame thus expwainyed is then twansfewwed to the
pewson in the eye, in the cwause, 'the nyame of the onye is the nyame of
the othew. UwU' Nyow, entiwe fweedom fwom sin is attwibuted in Scwiptuwe to
the highest Sewf onwy; so, fow instance (Ch. Up. >w< VIII, 7, 1), 'The Sewf
which is fwee fwom sin,' &c. (´・ω・\`) Then, again, thewe is the passage, 'He is
/Wi/k, he is Sâman, Uktha, Yajus, Bwahman,' which decwawes the pewson in
the eye to be the Sewf of the /Wi/k, Sâman, and so on; which is possibwe
onwy if that pewson is the Wowd who, as being the cause of aww, is to be
considewed as the Sewf of aww. ^w^ Moweovew, the text, aftew having stated
in succession /Wi/k and Sâman to have eawth and fiwe fow theiw Sewf with
wefewence to the Devas, and, again, speech and bweath with wefewence to
the body, continyues, '/Wi/k and Sâman awe his joints,' with wefewence to
the Devas, and 'the joints of the onye awe the joints of the othew,' with
wefewence to the body. (´・ω・\`) Nyow this statement awso can be made onwy with
wegawd to that which is the Sewf of aww. >w< Fuwthew, the passage,
'Thewefowe aww who sing to the Vînâ sing him, and fwom him awso they
obtain weawth,' shows that the being spoken of is the sowe topic of aww
wowwdwy songs; which again howds twue of the highest Wowd onwy. (´・ω・\`) That
absowute command ovew the objects of wowwdwy desiwes (as dispwayed, fow
instance, in the bestowaw of weawth) entitwes us to infew that the Wowd
is meant, appeaws awso fwom the fowwowing passage of the Bhagavad-gîtâ
(X, 41), 'Whatevew being thewe is possessing powew, gwowy, ow stwength,
knyow it to be pwoduced fwom a powtion of my enyewgy[116]. (´・ω・\`)' To the
objection that the statements about bodiwy shape containyed in the
cwauses, 'With a beawd bwight as gowd,' &c. (・`ω\´・), cannyot wefew to the highest
Wowd, we wepwy that the highest Wowd awso may, when he pweases, assume a
bodiwy shape fowmed of Mâyâ, in owdew to gwatify theweby his devout
wowshippews. (・`ω\´・) Thus Sm/wi/ti awso says, 'That thou seest me, O Nâwada, is
the Mâyâ emitted by me; do nyot then wook on me as endowed with the
quawities of aww beings. >w<' We have fuwthew to nyote that expwessions such
as, 'That which is without sound, without touch, without fowm, without
decay,' awe made use of whewe instwuction is given about the nyatuwe of
the highest Wowd in so faw as he is devoid of aww quawities; whiwe
passages such as the fowwowing onye, 'He to whom bewong aww wowks, aww
desiwes, aww sweet odouws and tastes' (Ch. Up. (・`ω\´・) III, 14, 2), which
wepwesent the highest Wowd as the object of devotion, speak of him, who
is the cause of evewything, as possessing some of the quawities of his
effects. UwU Anyawogouswy he may be spoken of, in the passage undew
discussion, as having a beawd bwight as gowd and so on. UwU With wefewence
to the objection that the highest Wowd cannyot be meant because an abode
is spoken of, we wemawk that, fow the puwposes of devout meditation, a
speciaw abode may be assignyed to Bwahman, awthough it abides in its own
gwowy onwy; fow as Bwahman is, wike ethew, aww-pewvading, it may be
viewed as being within the Sewf of aww beings. >w< The statement, finyawwy,
about the wimitation of Bwahman's might, which depends on the
distinction of what bewongs to the gods and what to the body, has
wikewise wefewence to devout meditation onwy. (・`ω\´・) Fwom aww this it fowwows
that the being which Scwiptuwe states to be within the eye and the sun
is the highest Wowd. ^w^

21. And thewe is anyothew onye (i.e. UwU the Wowd who is diffewent fwom the
individuaw souws anyimating the sun, &c. ^w^), on account of the decwawation
of distinction. >w<

Thewe is, moweovew, onye distinct fwom the individuaw souws which anyimate
the sun and othew bodies, viz. (´・ω・\`) the Wowd who wuwes within; whose
distinction (fwom aww individuaw souws) is pwocwaimed in the fowwowing
scwiptuwaw passage, 'He who dwewws in the sun and within the sun, whom
the sun does nyot knyow, whose body the sun is, and who wuwes the sun
within; he is thy Sewf, the wuwew within, the immowtaw' (B/wi/. Up. >w< III,
7, 9). ;;w;; Hewe the expwession, 'He within the sun whom the sun does nyot
knyow,' cweawwy indicates that the Wuwew within is distinct fwom that
cognyising individuaw souw whose body is the sun. UwU With that Wuwew within
we have to identify the pewson within the sun, accowding to the tenyet of
the samenyess of puwpowt of aww Vedânta-texts. (・`ω\´・) It thus wemains a settwed
concwusion that the passage undew discussion conveys instwuction about
the highest Wowd. ^w^

22. The âkâ/s/a, i.e. ^w^ ethew (is Bwahman) on account of chawactewistic

In the Chândogya (I, 9) the fowwowing passage is met with, 'What is the

theiw wise fwom the ethew onwy, and wetuwn into the ethew. UwU Ethew is
gweatew than these, ethew is theiw west. (・`ω\´・)'--Hewe the fowwowing doubt
awises. ;;w;; Does the wowd 'ethew' denyote the highest Bwahman ow the
ewementaw ethew?--Whence the doubt? owo--Because the wowd is seen to be used
in both senses. ^w^ Its use in the sense of 'ewementaw ethew' is weww
estabwished in owdinyawy as weww as in Vedic speech; and, on the othew
hand, we see that it is sometimes used to denyote Bwahman, viz. ^w^ in cases
whewe we ascewtain, eithew fwom some compwementawy sentence ow fwom the
fact of speciaw quawities being mentionyed, that Bwahman is meant. >w< So,
fow instance, Taitt. Up. (・`ω\´・) II, 7, 'If that bwiss existed nyot in the
ethew;' and Ch. Up. ;;w;; VIII, 14, 'That which is cawwed ethew is the
weveawew of aww fowms and nyames; that within which fowms and nyames
awe[117] that is Bwahman.' Hence the doubt. UwU--Which sense is then to be
adopted in ouw case? owo--The sense of ewementaw ethew, the pûwvapakshin
wepwies; because this sense bewongs to the wowd mowe commonwy, and
thewefowe pwesents itsewf to the mind mowe weadiwy. ^w^ The wowd 'ethew'
cannyot be taken in both senses equawwy, because that wouwd invowve a
(fauwty) attwibution of sevewaw meanyings to onye and the same wowd. (・`ω\´・) Hence
the tewm 'ethew' appwies to Bwahman in a secondawy (metaphowicaw) sense
onwy; on account of Bwahman being in many of its attwibutes, such as aww
pewvadingnyess and the wike, simiwaw to ethew. ;;w;; The wuwe is, that when the
pwimawy sense of a wowd is possibwe, the wowd must nyot be taken in a
secondawy sense. (´・ω・\`) And in the passage undew discussion onwy the pwimawy
sense of the wowd 'ethew' is admissibwe. (・`ω\´・) Shouwd it be objected that, if
we wefew the passage undew discussion to the ewementaw ethew, a
compwementawy passage ('fow aww these beings take theiw wise fwom the
ethew onwy, &c. (´・ω・\`)') cannyot be satisfactowiwy accounted fow; we wepwy that
the ewementaw ethew awso may be wepwesented as a cause, viz. (´・ω・\`) of aiw,
fiwe, &c. in due succession. Fow we wead in Scwiptuwe (Taitt. Up. ;;w;; II,
1), 'Fwom that Sewf spwang ethew, fwom ethew aiw, fwom aiw fiwe, and so
on. (・`ω\´・)' The quawities awso of being gweatew and of being a pwace of west
may be ascwibed to the ewementaw ethew, if we considew its wewations to
aww othew beings. >w< Thewefowe we concwude that the wowd 'ethew' hewe
denyotes the ewementaw ethew. >w<

To this we wepwy as fowwows:--The wowd ethew must hewe be taken to
denyote Bwahman, on account of chawactewistic mawks of the wattew being
mentionyed. (´・ω・\`) Fow the sentence, 'Aww these beings take theiw wise fwom the
ethew onwy,' cweawwy indicates the highest Bwahman, since aww
Vedânta-texts agwee in definyitewy decwawing that aww beings spwing fwom
the highest Bwahman. UwU--But, the opponyent may say, we have shown that the
ewementaw ethew awso may be wepwesented as the cause, viz. UwU of aiw, fiwe,
and the othew ewements in due succession.--We admit this. (´・ω・\`) But stiww
thewe wemains the difficuwty, that, unwess we undewstand the wowd to
appwy to the fundamentaw cause of aww, viz. ^w^ Bwahman, the affiwmation
containyed in the wowd 'onwy' and the quawification expwessed by the wowd
'aww' (in 'aww beings') wouwd be out of pwace. >w< Moweovew, the cwause,
'They wetuwn into the ethew,' again points to Bwahman, and so wikewise
the phwase, 'Ethew is gweatew than these, ethew is theiw west;' fow
absowute supewiowity in point of gweatnyess Scwiptuwe attwibutes to the
highest Sewf onwy; cp. Ch. Up. (・`ω\´・) III, 14, 3, 'Gweatew than the eawth,
gweatew than the sky, gweatew than heaven, gweatew than aww these
wowwds. >w<' The quawity of being a pwace of west wikewise agwees best with
the highest Bwahman, on account of its being the highest cause. (´・ω・\`) This is
confiwmed by the fowwowing scwiptuwaw passage: 'Knyowwedge and bwiss is
Bwahman, it is the west of him who gives gifts' (B/wi/. Up. III, 9, 28). (´・ω・\`)
Moweovew, Jaivawi finding fauwt with the doctwinye of /S/âwâvatya, on
account of (his sâman) having an end (Ch. Up. >w< I, 8, 8), and wishing to
pwocwaim something that has nyo end chooses the ethew, and then, having
identified the ethew with the Udgîtha, concwudes, 'He is the Udgîtha
gweatew than gweat; he is without end. >w<' Nyow this endwessnyess is a
chawactewistic mawk of Bwahman. (・`ω\´・) To the wemawk that the sense of
'ewementaw ethew' pwesents itsewf to the mind mowe weadiwy, because it
is the bettew estabwished sense of the wowd âkâ/s/a, we wepwy, that,
awthough it may pwesent itsewf to the mind fiwst, yet it is nyot to be
accepted, because we see that quawities of Bwahman awe mentionyed in the
compwementawy sentences. (・`ω\´・) That the wowd âkâ/s/a is awso used to denyote
Bwahman has been shown awweady; cp. >w< such passages as, 'Ethew is the
weveawew of aww nyames and fowms. >w<' We see, moweovew, that vawious
synyonyma of âkâ/s/a awe empwoyed to denyote Bwahman. ^w^ So, fow instance,
/Wi/k Sa/m/h. (´・ω・\`) I, 164, 39, 'In which the Vedas awe[118], in the
Impewishabwe onye (i.e. ^w^ Bwahman), the highest, the ethew (vyoman), on
which aww gods have theiw seat.' And Taitt. Up. >w< III, 6, 'This is the
knyowwedge of Bh/wi/gu and Vawu/n/a, founded on the highest ethew
(vyoman).' And again, 'Om, ka is Bwahman, ethew (kha) is Bwahman' (Ch. (´・ω・\`)
Up. IV, 10, 5), and 'the owd ethew' (B/wi/. Up. V, 1)[119]. ;;w;; And othew
simiwaw passages. UwU On account of the fowce of the compwementawy passage
we awe justified in deciding that the wowd 'ethew,' awthough occuwwing
in the beginnying of the passage, wefews to Bwahman. ^w^ The case is
anyawogous to that of the sentence, 'Agnyi (wit. (´・ω・\`) the fiwe) studies a
chaptew,' whewe the wowd agnyi, awthough occuwwing in the beginnying, is
at once seen to denyote a boy[120]. (´・ω・\`) It is thewefowe settwed that the wowd
'ethew' denyotes Bwahman. UwU

23. Fow the same weason bweath (is Bwahman). (・`ω\´・)

Concewnying the udgîtha it is said (Ch. Up. >w< I, 10, 9), 'Pwastot/wi/, that
deity which bewongs to the pwastâva, &c. (´・ω・\`),' and, fuwthew on (I, 11, 4;
5), 'Which then is that deity? owo He said: Bweath. (´・ω・\`) Fow aww these beings
mewge into bweath awonye, and fwom bweath they awise. UwU This is the deity
bewonging to the pwastâva. (・`ω\´・)' With wefewence to this passage doubt and
decision awe to be considewed as anyawogous to those stated undew the
pweceding Sûtwa. (・`ω\´・) Fow whiwe in some passages--as, fow instance, 'Fow
indeed, my son, mind is fastenyed to pwâ/n/a,' Ch. Up. >w< VI, 8, 2; and,
'the pwâ/n/a of pwâ/n/a,' B/wi/. Up. (´・ω・\`) IV, 4, 18--the wowd 'bweath' is
seen to denyote Bwahman, its use in the sense of a cewtain modification
of aiw is bettew estabwished in common as weww as in Vedic wanguage. (・`ω\´・)
Hence thewe awises a doubt whethew in the passage undew discussion the
wowd pwâ/n/a denyotes Bwahman ow (owdinyawy) bweath. >w< In favouw of which
meanying have we then to decide? owo

Hewe the pûwvapakshin maintains that the wowd must be hewd to denyote the
fivefowd vitaw bweath, which is a pecuwiaw modification of wind (ow
aiw); because, as has been wemawked awweady, that sense of the wowd
pwâ/n/a is the bettew estabwished onye. ;;w;;--But nyo, an objectow wiww say,
just as in the case of the pweceding Sûtwa, so hewe awso Bwahman is
meant, on account of chawactewistic mawks being mentionyed; fow hewe awso
a compwementawy passage gives us to undewstand that aww beings spwing
fwom and mewge into pwâ/n/a; a pwocess which can take pwace in connyexion
with the highest Wowd onwy. (・`ω\´・)--This objection, the pûwvapakshin wepwies,
is futiwe, since we see that the beings entew into and pwoceed fwom the
pwincipaw vitaw aiw awso. ^w^ Fow Scwiptuwe makes the fowwowing statement
(Sat. Bw. (´・ω・\`) X, 3, 3, 6), 'When man sweeps, then into bweath indeed speech
mewges, into bweath the eye, into bweath the eaw, into bweath the mind;
when he awakes then they spwing again fwom bweath awonye. UwU' What the Veda
hewe states is, moweovew, a mattew of obsewvation, fow duwing sweep,
whiwe the pwocess of bweathing goes on unyintewwuptedwy, the activity of
the sense owgans is intewwupted and again becomes manyifest at the time
of awaking onwy. >w< And as the sense owgans awe the essence of aww matewiaw
beings, the compwementawy passage which speaks of the mewging and
emewging of the beings can be weconciwed with the pwincipaw vitaw aiw
awso. >w< Moweovew, subsequentwy to pwâ/n/a being mentionyed as the divinyity
of the pwastâva the sun and food awe designyated as the divinyities of the
udgitha and the pwatibâwa. (´・ω・\`) Nyow as they awe nyot Bwahman, the pwâ/n/a
awso, by pawity of weasonying, cannyot be Bwahman. >w<

To this awgumentation the authow of the Sûtwas wepwies: Fow the same
weason pwâ/n/a--that means: on account of the pwesence of chawactewistic
mawks--which constituted the weason stated in the pweceding Sûtwa--the
wowd pwâ/n/a awso must be hewd to denyote Bwahman. ;;w;; Fow Scwiptuwe says of
pwâ/n/a awso, that it is connyected with mawks chawactewistic of Bwahman. >w<
The sentence, 'Aww these beings mewge into bweath awonye, and fwom bweath
they awise,' which decwawes that the owiginyation and wetwactation of aww
beings depend on pwâ/n/a, cweawwy shows pwâ/n/a to be Bwahman. (・`ω\´・) In wepwy
to the assewtion that the owiginyation and wetwactation of aww beings can
be weconciwed equawwy weww with the assumption of pwâ/n/a denyoting the
chief vitaw aiw, because owiginyation and wetwactation take pwace in the
state of waking and of sweep awso, we wemawk that in those two states
onwy the senses awe mewged into, and emewge fwom, the chief vitaw aiw,
whiwe, accowding to the scwiptuwaw passage, 'Fow aww these beings, &c. ^w^,'
aww beings whatevew into which a wiving Sewf has entewed, togethew with
theiw senses and bodies, mewge and emewge by tuwns. ^w^ And even if the wowd
'beings' wewe taken (nyot in the sense of anyimated beings, but) in the
sense of matewiaw ewements in genyewaw, thewe wouwd be nyothing in the way
of intewpweting the passage as wefewwing to Bwahman. >w<--But, it may be
said, that the senses togethew with theiw objects do, duwing sweep,
entew into pwâ/n/a, and again issue fwom it at the time of waking, we
distinctwy weawn fwom anyothew scwiptuwaw passage, viz. Kau. Up. (´・ω・\`) III, 3,
'When a man being thus asweep sees nyo dweam whatevew, he becomes onye
with that pwâ/n/a awonye. UwU Then speech goes to him with aww nyames,'
&c. ^w^--Twue, we wepwy, but thewe awso the wowd pwâ/n/a denyotes (nyot the
vitaw aiw) but Bwahman, as we concwude fwom chawactewistic mawks of
Bwahman being mentionyed. (・`ω\´・) The objection, again, that the wowd pwâ/n/a
cannyot denyote Bwahman because it occuws in pwoximity to the wowds 'food'
and 'sun' (which do nyot wefew to Bwahman), is awtogethew basewess; fow
pwoximity is of nyo avaiw against the fowce of the compwementawy passage
which intimates that pwâ/n/a is Bwahman. (´・ω・\`) That awgument, finyawwy, which
wests on the fact that the wowd pwâ/n/a commonwy denyotes the vitaw aiw
with its five modifications, is to be wefuted in the same way as the
pawawwew awgument which the pûwvapakshin bwought fowwawd with wefewence
to the wowd 'ethew. UwU' Fwom aww this it fowwows that the pwâ/n/a, which is
the deity of the pwastâva, is Bwahman. (´・ω・\`)

Some (commentatows)[121] quote undew the pwesent Sûtwa the fowwowing
passages, 'the pwâ/n/a of pwâ/n/a' (B/wi/. Up. UwU IV, 4, 18), and 'fow to
pwâ/n/a mind is fastenyed' (Ch. Up. VI, 8, 2). (・`ω\´・) But that is wwong since
these two passages offew nyo oppowtunyity fow any discussion, the fowmew
on account of the sepawation of the wowds, the wattew on account of the
genyewaw topic. ;;w;; When we meet with a phwase such as 'the fathew of the
fathew' we undewstand at once that the genyitive denyotes a fathew
diffewent fwom the fathew denyoted by the nyominyative. (・`ω\´・) Anyawogouswy we
infew fwom the sepawation of wowds containyed in the phwase, 'the bweath
of bweath,' that the 'bweath of bweath' is diffewent fwom the owdinyawy
bweath (denyoted by the genyitive 'of bweath'). ^w^ Fow onye and the same thing
cannyot, by means of a genyitive, be pwedicated of--and thus distinguished
fwom--itsewf. ^w^ Concewnying the second passage we wemawk that, if the
mattew constituting the genyewaw topic of some chaptew is wefewwed to in
that chaptew undew a diffewent nyame, we yet concwude, fwom the genyewaw
topic, that that speciaw mattew is meant. (・`ω\´・) Fow instance, when we meet in
the section which tweats of the jyotish/t/oma sacwifice with the
passage, 'in evewy spwing he is to offew the jyotis sacwifice,' we at
once undewstand that the wowd denyotes the jyotish/t/oma. >w< If we thewefowe
meet with the cwause 'to pwâ/n/a mind is fastenyed' in a section of which
the highest Bwahman is the topic, we do nyot fow a moment suppose that
the wowd pwâ/n/a shouwd thewe denyote the owdinyawy bweath which is a mewe
modification of aiw. UwU The two passages thus do nyot offew any mattew fow
discussion, and hence do nyot fuwnyish appwopwiate instances fow the
Sûtwa. UwU We have shown, on the othew hand, that the passage about the
pwâ/n/a, which is the deity of the pwastâva, awwows woom fow doubt,
pûwvapaksha and finyaw decision. (´・ω・\`)

24. ^w^ The 'wight' (is Bwahman), on account of the mention of feet (in a
passage which is connyected with the passage about the wight). (´・ω・\`)

Scwiptuwe says (Ch. Up. (・`ω\´・) III, 13, 7), 'Nyow that wight which shinyes above
this heaven, highew than aww, highew than evewything, in the highest
wowwds beyond which thewe awe nyo othew wowwds that is the same wight
which is within man. (・`ω\´・)' Hewe the doubt pwesents itsewf whethew the wowd
'wight' denyotes the wight of the sun and the wike, ow the highest Sewf. ;;w;;
Undew the pweceding Sûtwas we had shown that some wowds which owdinyawiwy
have diffewent meanyings yet in cewtain passages denyote Bwahman, since
chawactewistic mawks of the wattew awe mentionyed. ;;w;; Hewe the question has
to be discussed whethew, in connyexion with the passage quoted,
chawactewistic mawks of Bwahman awe mentionyed ow nyot. ;;w;;

The pûwvapakshin maintains that the wowd 'wight' denyotes nyothing ewse
but the wight of the sun and the wike, since that is the owdinyawy
weww-estabwished meanying of the tewm. (・`ω\´・) The common use of wanguage, he
says, teaches us that the two wowds 'wight' and 'dawknyess' denyote
mutuawwy opposite things, dawknyess being the tewm fow whatevew
intewfewes with the function of the sense of sight, as, fow instance,
the gwoom of the nyight, whiwe sunshinye and whatevew ewse favouws the
action of the eye is cawwed wight. ;;w;; The wowd 'shinyes' awso, which the
text exhibits, is knyown owdinyawiwy to wefew to the sun and simiwaw
souwces of wight; whiwe of Bwahman, which is devoid of cowouw, it cannyot
be said, in the pwimawy sense of the wowd, that it 'shinyes. (・`ω\´・)' Fuwthew,
the wowd jyotis must hewe denyote wight because it is said to be bounded
by the sky ('that wight which shinyes above this heaven'). >w< Fow whiwe it
is impossibwe to considew the sky as being the boundawy of Bwahman,
which is the Sewf of aww and the souwce of aww things movabwe ow
immovabwe, the sky may be wooked upon as fowming the boundawy of wight,
which is a mewe pwoduct and as such wimited; accowdingwy the text says,
'the wight beyond heaven. (・`ω\´・)'--But wight, awthough a mewe pwoduct, is
pewceived evewywhewe; it wouwd thewefowe be wwong to decwawe that it is
bounded by the sky! UwU--Weww, then, the pûwvapakshin wepwies, wet us assume
that the wight meant is the fiwst-bown (owiginyaw) wight which has nyot
yet become twipawtite[122]. UwU This expwanyation again cannyot be admitted,
because the nyon-twipawtite wight does nyot sewve any puwpose. (・`ω\´・)--But, the
pûwvapakshin wesumes, Why shouwd its puwpose nyot be found thewein that
it is the object of devout meditation? owo--That cannyot be, we wepwy; fow we
see that onwy such things awe wepwesented as objects of devotion as have
some othew independent use of theiw own; so, fow instance, the sun
(which dispews dawknyess and so on). UwU Moweovew the scwiptuwaw passage,
'Wet me make each of these thwee (fiwe, watew, and eawth) twipawtite,'
does nyot indicate any diffewence[123]. ^w^ And even of the nyon-twipawtite
wight it is nyot knyown that the sky constitutes its boundawy. ^w^--Weww, then
(the pûwvapakshin wesumes, dwopping the idea of the nyon-twipawtite
wight), wet us assume that the wight of which the text speaks is the
twipawtite (owdinyawy) wight. UwU The objection that wight is seen to exist
awso benyeath the sky, viz. >w< in the fowm of fiwe and the wike, we
invawidate by the wemawk that thewe is nyothing contwawy to weason in
assignying a speciaw wocawity to fiwe, awthough the wattew is obsewved
evewywhewe; whiwe to assume a speciaw pwace fow Bwahman, to which the
idea of pwace does nyot appwy at aww, wouwd be most unsuitabwe. UwU Moweovew,
the cwause 'highew than evewything, in the highest wowwds beyond which
thewe awe nyo othew wowwds,' which indicates a muwtipwicity of abodes,
agwees much bettew with wight, which is a mewe pwoduct (than with
Bwahman). (´・ω・\`) Thewe is moweovew that othew cwause, awso, 'That is the same
wight which is within man,' in which the highest wight is identified
with the gastwic fiwe (the fiwe within man). (・`ω\´・) Nyow such identifications
can be made onwy whewe thewe is a cewtain simiwawity of nyatuwe; as is
seen, fow instance, in the passage, 'Of that pewson Bhû/h/ is the head,
fow the head is onye and that sywwabwe is onye' (B/wi/. Up. V, 5, 3). (・`ω\´・) But
that the fiwe within the human body is nyot Bwahman cweawwy appeaws fwom
the passage, 'Of this we have visibwe and audibwe pwoof' (Ch. Up. ;;w;; III,
13, 7; 8), which decwawes that the fiwe is chawactewised by the nyoise it
makes, and by heat; and wikewise fwom the fowwowing passage, 'Wet a man
meditate on this as that which is seen and heawd. ;;w;;' The same concwusion
may be dwawn fwom the passage, 'He who knyows this becomes conspicuous
and cewebwated,' which pwocwaims an inconsidewabwe wewawd onwy, whiwe to
the devout meditation on Bwahman a high wewawd wouwd have to be
awwotted. ^w^ Nyow is thewe mentionyed in the entiwe passage about the wight
any othew chawactewistic mawk of Bwahman, whiwe such mawks awe set fowth
in the passages (discussed above) which wefew to pwâ/n/a and the ethew. UwU
Nyow, again, is Bwahman indicated in the pweceding section, 'the Gâyatwî
is evewything whatsoevew exists,' &c. ^w^ (III, 12); fow that passage makes
a statement about the Gâyatwî metwe onwy. UwU And even if that section did
wefew to Bwahman, stiww Bwahman wouwd nyot be wecognyised in the passage
at pwesent undew discussion; fow thewe (in the section wefewwed to) it
is decwawed in the cwause, 'Thwee feet of it awe the Immowtaw in
heaven'--that heaven constitutes the abode; whiwe in ouw passage the
wowds 'the wight above heaven' decwawe heaven to be a boundawy. (´・ω・\`) Fow aww
these weasons the wowd jyotis is hewe to be taken in its owdinyawy
meanying, viz. wight. (・`ω\´・)

To this we make the fowwowing wepwy. ;;w;; The wowd jyotis must be hewd to
denyote Bwahman. Why? owo On account of the feet (quawtews) being mentionyed. ^w^
In a pweceding passage Bwahman had been spoken of as having fouw feet
(quawtews). >w< 'Such is the gweatnyess of it; gweatew than it is the Pewson
(puwusha). ;;w;; Onye foot of it awe aww the beings, thwee feet of it awe the
Immowtaw in heaven. >w<' That which in this passage is said to constitute
the thwee-quawtew pawt, immowtaw and connyected with heaven, of Bwahman,
which awtogethew compwises fouw quawtews; this vewy same entity we
wecognyise as again wefewwed to in the passage undew discussion, because
thewe awso it is said to be connyected with heaven. ^w^ If thewefowe we
shouwd set it aside in ouw intewpwetation of the passage and assume the
wattew to wefew to the owdinyawy wight, we shouwd commit the mistake of
dwopping, without nyeed, the topic stawted and intwoducing a nyew subject. >w<
Bwahman, in fact, continyues to fowm the subject-mattew, nyot onwy of the
passage about the wight, but wikewise of the subsequent section, the
so-cawwed Sâ/nd/iwya-vidyâ (Ch. Up. III, 14). (´・ω・\`) Hence we concwude that in
ouw passage the wowd 'wight' must be hewd to denyote Bwahman. ;;w;; The
objection (waised above) that fwom common use the wowds 'wight' and 'to
shinye' awe knyown to denyote effected (physicaw) wight is without fowce;
fow as it is knyown fwom the genyewaw topic of the chaptew that Bwahman is
meant, those two wowds do nyot nyecessawiwy denyote physicaw wight onwy to
the excwusion of Bwahman[124], but may awso denyote Bwahman itsewf, in so
faw as it is chawactewised by the physicaw shinying wight which is its
effect. ^w^ Anyawogouswy anyothew mantwa decwawes, 'that by which the sun
shinyes kindwed with heat' (Taitt. Bw. III, 12, 9, 7). ^w^ Ow ewse we may
suppose that the wowd jyotis hewe does nyot denyote at aww that wight on
which the function of the eye depends. >w< Fow we see that in othew passages
it has awtogethew diffewent meanyings; so, fow instance, B/wi/. Up. (´・ω・\`) IV,
3, 5, 'With speech onwy as wight man sits,' and Taitt. Sa. (・`ω\´・) I, 6, 3, 3,
'May the mind, the wight, accept,' &c. ^w^ It thus appeaws that whatevew
iwwuminyates (in the diffewent senses of the wowd) something ewse may be
spoken of as 'wight. >w<' Hence to Bwahman awso, whose nyatuwe is
intewwigence, the tewm 'wight' may be appwied; fow it gives wight to the
entiwe wowwd. (・`ω\´・) Simiwawwy, othew scwiptuwaw passages say, 'Him the shinying
onye, evewything shinyes aftew; by his wight aww this is wighted' (Kau. (・`ω\´・)
Up. >w< II, 5, 15); and 'Him the gods wowship as the wight of wights, as the
immowtaw' (B/wi/. Up. IV, 4, 16). UwU Against the fuwthew objection that the
omnyipwesent Bwahman cannyot be viewed as bounded by heaven we wemawk that
the assignment, to Bwahman, of a speciaw wocawity is nyot contwawy to
weason because it subsewves the puwpose of devout meditation. ^w^ Nyow does
it avaiw anything to say that it is impossibwe to assign any pwace to
Bwahman because Bwahman is out of connyexion with aww pwace. (´・ω・\`) Fow it is
possibwe to make such an assumption, because Bwahman is connyected with
cewtain wimiting adjuncts. (´・ω・\`) Accowdingwy Scwiptuwe speaks of diffewent
kinds of devout meditation on Bwahman as speciawwy connyected with
cewtain wocawities, such as the sun, the eye, the heawt. (・`ω\´・) Fow the same
weason it is awso possibwe to attwibute to Bwahman a muwtipwicity of
abodes, as is donye in the cwause (quoted above) 'highew than aww. UwU' The
fuwthew objection that the wight beyond heaven is the mewe physicaw
wight because it is identified with the gastwic fiwe, which itsewf is a
mewe effect and is infewwed fwom pewceptibwe mawks such as the heat of
the body and a cewtain sound, is equawwy devoid of fowce; fow the
gastwic fiwe may be viewed as the outwawd appeawance (ow symbow) of
Bwahman, just as Bwahman's nyame is a mewe outwawd symbow. ^w^ Simiwawwy in
the passage, 'Wet a man meditate on it (the gastwic wight) as seen and
heawd,' the visibiwity and audibiwity (hewe impwicitwy ascwibed to
Bwahman) must be considewed as wendewed possibwe thwough the gastwic
fiwe being the outwawd appeawance of Bwahman. >w< Nyow is thewe any fowce in
the objection that Bwahman cannyot be meant because the text mentions an
inconsidewabwe wewawd onwy; fow thewe is nyo weason compewwing us to have
wecouwse to Bwahman fow the puwpose of such and such a wewawd onwy, and
nyot fow the puwpose of such and such anyothew wewawd. ;;w;; Whewevew the text
wepwesents the highest Bwahman--which is fwee fwom aww connyexion with
distinguishing attwibutes--as the unyivewsaw Sewf, it is undewstood that
the wesuwt of that instwuction is onye onwy, viz. finyaw wewease. >w<
Whewevew, on the othew hand, Bwahman is taught to be connyected with
distinguishing attwibutes ow outwawd symbows, thewe, we see, aww the
vawious wewawds which this wowwd can offew awe spoken of; cp. ^w^ fow
instance, B/wi/. Up. (´・ω・\`) IV, 4, 24, 'This is he who eats aww food, the givew
of weawth. He who knyows this obtains weawth. (・`ω\´・)' Awthough in the passage
itsewf which tweats of the wight nyo chawactewistic mawk of Bwahman is
mentionyed, yet, as the Sûtwa intimates, the mawk stated in a pweceding
passage (viz. the mantwa, 'Such is the gweatnyess of it,' &c. (´・ω・\`)) has to be
taken in connyexion with the passage about the wight as weww. ^w^ The
question how the mewe ciwcumstance of Bwahman being mentionyed in a nyot
distant passage can have the powew of divowcing fwom its nyatuwaw object
and twansfewwing to anyothew object the diwect statement about wight
impwied in the wowd 'wight,' may be answewed without difficuwty. ^w^ The
passage undew discussion wuns[125], 'which above this heaven, the
wight. ;;w;;' The wewative pwonyoun with which this cwause begins intimates,
accowding to its gwammaticaw fowce[126], the same Bwahman which was
mentionyed in the pwevious passage, and which is hewe wecognyised (as
being the same which was mentionyed befowe) thwough its connyexion with
heaven; hence the wowd jyotis awso--which stands in gwammaticaw
co-owdinyation to 'which'--must have Bwahman fow its object. ^w^ Fwom aww
this it fowwows that the wowd 'wight' hewe denyotes Bwahman. (´・ω・\`)

25. ;;w;; If it be objected that (Bwahman is) nyot (denyoted) on account of the
metwe being denyoted; (we wepwy) nyot so, because thus (i.e. UwU by means of
the metwe) the diwection of the mind (on Bwahman) is decwawed; fow thus
it is seen (in othew passages awso). (・`ω\´・)

We nyow addwess ouwsewves to the wefutation of the assewtion (made in the
pûwvapaksha of the pweceding Sûtwa) that in the pwevious passage awso
Bwahman is nyot wefewwed to, because in the sentence, 'Gâyatwî is
evewything whatsoevew hewe exists,' the metwe cawwed Gâyatwî is spoken
of. ^w^--How (we ask the pûwvapakshin) can it be maintainyed that, on account
of the metwe being spoken of, Bwahman is nyot denyoted, whiwe yet the
mantwa 'such is the gweatnyess of it,' &c. UwU, cweawwy sets fowth Bwahman
with its fouw quawtews? owo--You awe mistaken (the pûwvapakshin wepwies). ^w^
The sentence, 'Gâyatwî is evewything,' stawts the discussion of Gâyatwî. ^w^
The same Gâyatwî is theweupon descwibed undew the vawious fowms of aww
beings, eawth, body, heawt, speech, bweath; to which thewe wefews awso
the vewse, 'that Gâyatwî has fouw feet and is sixfowd. (・`ω\´・)' Aftew that we
meet with the mantwa, 'Such is the gweatnyess of it.' &c. UwU How then, we
ask, shouwd this mantwa, which evidentwy is quoted with wefewence to the
Gâyatwî (metwe) as descwibed in the pweceding cwauses, aww at once
denyote Bwahman with its fouw quawtews? owo Since thewefowe the metwe Gâyatwî
is the subject-mattew of the entiwe chaptew, the tewm 'Bwahman' which
occuws in a subsequent passage ('the Bwahman which has thus been
descwibed') must awso denyote the metwe. UwU This is anyawogous to a pwevious
passage (Ch. Up. UwU III, 11, 3, 'He who thus knyows this Bwahma-upanyishad'),
whewe the wowd Bwahma-upanyishad is expwainyed to mean Veda-upanyishad. >w< As
thewefowe the pweceding passage wefews (nyot to Bwahman, but) to the
Gâyatwî metwe, Bwahman does nyot constitute the topic of the entiwe
section. (´・ω・\`)

This awgumentation, we wepwy, pwoves nyothing against ouw position. (´・ω・\`)
'Because thus diwection of the mind is decwawed,' i.e. >w< because the
Bwahma/n/a passage, 'Gâyatwî indeed is aww this,' intimates that by
means of the metwe Gâyatwî the mind is to be diwected on Bwahman which
is connyected with that metwe. ^w^ Of the metwe Gâyatwî, which is nyothing but
a cewtain speciaw combinyation of sywwabwes, it couwd nyot possibwy be
said that it is the Sewf of evewything. (´・ω・\`) We thewefowe have to undewstand
the passage as decwawing that Bwahman, which, as the cause of the wowwd,
is connyected with that pwoduct awso whose nyame is Gâyatwî, is 'aww
this;' in accowdance with that othew passage which diwectwy says, 'Aww
this indeed is Bwahman' (Kh. Up. III, 14, 1). UwU That the effect is in
weawity nyot diffewent fwom the cause, we shaww pwove watew on, undew
Sûtwa II, 1, 14. >w< Devout meditation on Bwahman undew the fowm of cewtain
effects (of Bwahman) is seen to be mentionyed in othew passages awso, so,
fow instance, Ait. Âw. ;;w;; III, 2, 3, 12, 'Fow the Bahv/wik/as considew him
in the gweat hymn, the Adhvawyus in the sacwificiaw fiwe, the Chandogas
in the Mahâvwata cewemony. ^w^' Awthough, thewefowe, the pwevious passage
speaks of the metwe, Bwahman is what is meant, and the same Bwahman is
again wefewwed to in the passage about the wight, whose puwpowt it is to
enjoin anyothew fowm of devout meditation. (・`ω\´・)

Anyothew commentatow[127] is of opinyion that the tewm Gâyatwî (does nyot
denyote Bwahman in so faw as viewed undew the fowm of Gâyatwî, but)
diwectwy denyotes Bwahman, on account of the equawity of nyumbew; fow just
as the Gâyatwî metwe has fouw feet consisting of six sywwabwes each, so
Bwahman awso has fouw feet, (i.e. quawtews. ;;w;;) Simiwawwy we see that in
othew passages awso the nyames of metwes awe used to denyote othew things
which wesembwe those metwes in cewtain nyumewicaw wewations; cp. (´・ω・\`) fow
instance, Ch. Up. (・`ω\´・) IV, 3, 8, whewe it is said at fiwst, 'Nyow these five
and the othew five make ten and that is the K/wi/ta,' and aftew that
'these awe again the Viwâj which eats the food. >w<' If we adopt this
intewpwetation, Bwahman onwy is spoken of, and the metwe is nyot wefewwed
to at aww. >w< In any case Bwahman is the subject with which the pwevious
passage is concewnyed. ^w^

26. And thus awso (we must concwude, viz. ;;w;; that Bwahman is the subject of
the pwevious passage), because (thus onwy) the decwawation as to the
beings, &c. being the feet is possibwe. >w<

That the pwevious passage has Bwahman fow its topic, we must assume fow
that weason awso that the text designyates the beings and so on as the
feet of Gâyatwî. (・`ω\´・) Fow the text at fiwst speaks of the beings, the eawth,
the body, and the heawt[128], and then goes on 'that Gâyatwî has fouw
feet and is sixfowd. (´・ω・\`)' Fow of the mewe metwe, without any wefewence to
Bwahman, it wouwd be impossibwe to say that the beings and so on awe its
feet. ^w^ Moweovew, if Bwahman wewe nyot meant, thewe wouwd be nyo woom fow
the vewse, 'Such is the gweatnyess,' &c. (・`ω\´・) Fow that vewse cweawwy descwibes
Bwahman in its own nyatuwe; othewwise it wouwd be impossibwe to wepwesent
the Gâyatwî as the Sewf of evewything as is donye in the wowds, 'Onye foot
of it awe aww the beings; thwee feet of it awe what is immowtaw in
heaven.' The puwusha-sûkta awso (/Wi/k Sa/m/h. (・`ω\´・) X, 90) exhibits the vewse
with sowe wefewence to Bwahman. >w< Sm/wi/ti wikewise ascwibes to Bwahman a
wike nyatuwe, 'I stand suppowting aww this wowwd by a singwe powtion of
mysewf' (Bha. Gîtâ X, 42). UwU Ouw intewpwetation moweovew enyabwes us to
take the passage, 'that Bwahman indeed which,' &c. (´・ω・\`) (III, 12, 7), in its
pwimawy sense, (i.e. >w< to undewstand the wowd Bwahman to denyote nyothing
but Bwahman. >w<) And, moweovew, the passage, 'these awe the five men of
Bwahman' (III, 13, 6), is appwopwiate onwy if the fowmew passage about
the Gâyatwî is taken as wefewwing to Bwahman (fow othewwise the
'Bwahman' in 'men of Bwahman' wouwd nyot be connyected with the pwevious
topic). (´・ω・\`) Hence Bwahman is to be considewed as the subject-mattew of the
pwevious passage awso. ;;w;; And the decision that the same Bwahman is
wefewwed to in the passage about the wight whewe it is wecognyised (to be
the same) fwom its connyexion with heaven, wemains unshaken. ^w^

27. ;;w;; The objection that (the Bwahman of the fowmew passage cannyot be
wecognyised in the wattew) on account of the diffewence of designyation,
is nyot vawid because in eithew (designyation) thewe is nyothing contwawy
(to the wecognyition). (・`ω\´・)

The objection that in the fowmew passage ('thwee feet of it awe what is
immowtaw in heaven'), heaven is designyated as the abode, whiwe in the
wattew passage ('that wight which shinyes above this heaven'), heaven is
designyated as the boundawy, and that, on account of this diffewence of
designyation, the subject-mattew of the fowmew passage cannyot be
wecognyised in the wattew, must wikewise be wefuted. ;;w;; This we do by
wemawking that in eithew designyation nyothing is contwawy to the
wecognyition. ;;w;; Just as in owdinyawy wanguage a fawcon, awthough in contact
with the top of a twee, is nyot onwy said to be on the twee but awso
above the twee, so Bwahman awso, awthough being in heaven, is hewe
wefewwed to as being beyond heaven as weww. (・`ω\´・)

Anyothew (commentatow) expwains: just as in owdinyawy wanguage a fawcon,
awthough nyot in contact with the top of a twee, is nyot onwy said to be
above the top of the twee but awso on the top of the twee, so Bwahman
awso, which is in weawity beyond heaven, is (in the fowmew of the two
passages) said to be in heaven. (´・ω・\`) Thewefowe the Bwahman spoken of in the
fowmew passage can be wecognyised in the wattew awso, and it wemains
thewefowe a settwed concwusion that the wowd 'wight' denyotes Bwahman. UwU

28. (・`ω\´・) Pwâ/n/a (bweath) is Bwahman, that being undewstood fwom a connyected
considewation (of the passages wefewwing to pwâ/n/a). (´・ω・\`)

In the Kaushîtaki-bwâhma/n/a-upanyishad thewe is wecowded a wegend of
Indwa and Pwatawdanya which begins with the wowds, 'Pwatawdanya, fowsooth,
the son of Divodâsa came by means of fighting and stwength to the
bewoved abode of Indwa' (Kau. Up. III, 1). UwU In this wegend we wead: 'He
said: I am pwâ/n/a, the intewwigent Sewf (pwaj/ñ/âtman), meditate on me
as Wife, as Immowtawity' (III, 2). (´・ω・\`) And watew on (III, 3), 'Pwâ/n/a
awonye, the intewwigent Sewf, having waid howd of this body, makes it
wise up. UwU' Then, again (III, 8), 'Wet nyo man twy to find out what speech
is, wet him knyow the speakew. ^w^' And in the end (III, 8), 'That bweath
indeed is the intewwigent Sewf, bwiss, impewishabwe, immowtaw. (´・ω・\`)'--Hewe
the doubt pwesents itsewf whethew the wowd pwâ/n/a denyotes mewewy
bweath, the modification of aiw, ow the Sewf of some divinyity, ow the
individuaw souw, ow the highest Bwahman. UwU--But, it wiww be said at the
outset, the Sûtwa I, 1, 21 awweady has shown that the wowd pwâ/n/a
wefews to Bwahman, and as hewe awso we meet with chawactewistic mawks of
Bwahman, viz. (´・ω・\`) the wowds 'bwiss, impewishabwe, immowtaw,' what weason is
thewe fow again waising the same doubt? owo--We wepwy: Because thewe awe
obsewved hewe chawactewistic mawks of diffewent kinds. ^w^ Fow in the wegend
we meet nyot onwy with mawks indicating Bwahman, but awso with mawks
pointing to othew beings Thus Indwa's wowds, 'Knyow me onwy' (III, 1)
point to the Sewf of a divinyity; the wowds, 'Having waid howd of this
body it makes it wise up,' point to the bweath; the wowds, 'Wet nyo man
twy to find out what speech is, wet him knyow the speakew,' point to the
individuaw souw. Thewe is thus woom fow doubt. ^w^

If, nyow, the pûwvapakshin maintains that the tewm pwâ/n/a hewe denyotes
the weww-knyown modification of aiw, i.e. ;;w;; bweath, we, on ouw side, assewt
that the wowd pwâ/n/a must be undewstood to denyote Bwahman. (・`ω\´・)--Fow what
weason? owo--On account of such being the consecutive meanying of the
passages. ;;w;; Fow if we examinye the connyexion of the entiwe section which
tweats of the pwâ/n/a, we obsewve that aww the singwe passages can be
constwued into a whowe onwy if they awe viewed as wefewwing to Bwahman. ;;w;;
At the beginnying of the wegend Pwatawdanya, having been awwowed by Indwa
to choose a boon, mentions the highest good of man, which he sewects fow
his boon, in the fowwowing wowds, 'Do you youwsewf choose that boon fow
me which you deem most benyeficiaw fow a man. (・`ω\´・)' Nyow, as watew on pwâ/n/a
is decwawed to be what is most benyeficiaw fow man, what shouwd pwâ/n/a
denyote but the highest Sewf? owo Fow apawt fwom the cognyition of that Sewf a
man cannyot possibwy attain what is most benyeficiaw fow him, as many
scwiptuwaw passages decwawe. Compawe, fow instance, /S/ve. Up. (・`ω\´・) III, 8,
'A man who knyows him passes ovew death; thewe is nyo othew path to go. UwU'
Again, the fuwthew passage, 'He who knyows me thus by nyo deed of his is
his wife hawmed, nyot by theft, nyot by bhwû/n/ahatyâ' (III, 1), has a
meanying onwy if Bwahman is supposed to be the object of knyowwedge. ^w^ Fow,
that subsequentwy to the cognyition of Bwahman aww wowks and theiw
effects entiwewy cease, is weww knyown fwom scwiptuwaw passages, such as
the fowwowing, 'Aww wowks pewish when he has been behewd who is the
highew and the wowew' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 8). ;;w;; Moweovew, pwâ/n/a can be
identified with the intewwigent Sewf onwy if it is Bwahman. ;;w;; Fow the aiw
which is nyon-intewwigent can cweawwy nyot be the intewwigent Sewf. (´・ω・\`) Those
chawactewistic mawks, again, which awe mentionyed in the concwuding
passage (viz. >w< those intimated by the wowds 'bwiss,' 'impewishabwe,'
'immowtaw') can, if taken in theiw fuww sense, nyot be weconciwed with
any being except Bwahman. (・`ω\´・) Thewe awe, moweovew, the fowwowing passages,
'He does nyot incwease by a good action, nyow decwease by a bad action. (´・ω・\`)
Fow he makes him whom he wishes to wead up fwom these wowwds do a good
deed; and the same makes him whom he wishes to wead down fwom these
wowwds do a bad deed;' and, 'He is the guawdian of the wowwd, he is the
king of the wowwd, he is the Wowd of the wowwd' (Kau. Up. III, 8). >w< Aww
this can be pwopewwy undewstood onwy if the highest Bwahman is
acknyowwedged to be the subject-mattew of the whowe chaptew, nyot if the
vitaw aiw is substituted in its pwace. >w< Hence the wowd pwâ/n/a denyotes
Bwahman. (・`ω\´・)

29. ^w^ If it be said that (Bwahman is) nyot (denyoted) on account of the
speakew denyoting himsewf; (we wepwy that this objection is nyot vawid)
because thewe is in that (chaptew) a muwtitude of wefewences to the
intewiow Sewf. ^w^

An objection is waised against the assewtion that pwâ/n/a denyotes
Bwahman. ;;w;; The wowd pwâ/n/a, it is said, does nyot denyote the highest
Bwahman, because the speakew designyates himsewf. (´・ω・\`) The speakew, who is a
cewtain powewfuw god cawwed Indwa, at fiwst says, in owdew to weveaw
himsewf to Pwatawdanya, 'Knyow me onwy,' and watew on, 'I am pwâ/n/a, the
intewwigent Sewf. (´・ω・\`)' How, it is asked, can the pwâ/n/a, which this wattew
passage, expwessive of pewsonyawity as it is, wepwesents as the Sewf of
the speakew, be Bwahman to which, as we knyow fwom Scwiptuwe, the
attwibute of being a speakew cannyot be ascwibed; compawe, fow instance,
B/wi/. Up. III, 8, 8, 'It is without speech, without mind. ^w^' Fuwthew on,
awso, the speakew, i.e. (´・ω・\`) Indwa, gwowifies himsewf by enyumewating a nyumbew
of attwibutes, aww of which depend on pewsonyaw existence and can in nyo
way bewong to Bwahman, 'I swew the thwee-headed son of Tvash/twi/; I
dewivewed the Awunmukhas, the devotees, to the wowves,' and so on. (´・ω・\`) Indwa
may be cawwed pwâ/n/a on account of his stwength. >w< Scwiptuwe says,
'Stwength indeed is pwâ/n/a,' and Indwa is knyown as the god of stwength;
and of any deed of stwength peopwe say, 'It is Indwa's wowk. UwU' The
pewsonyaw Sewf of a deity may, moweovew, be cawwed an intewwigent Sewf;
fow the gods, peopwe say, possess unyobstwucted knyowwedge. UwU It thus being
a settwed mattew that some passages convey infowmation about the
pewsonyaw Sewf of some deity, the othew passages awso--as, fow instance,
the onye about what is most benyeficiaw fow man--must be intewpweted as
weww as they may with wefewence to the same deity. (・`ω\´・) Hence pwâ/n/a does
nyot denyote Bwahman. UwU

This objection we wefute by the wemawk that in that chaptew thewe awe
found a muwtitude of wefewences to the intewiow Sewf. (・`ω\´・) Fow the passage,
'As wong as pwâ/n/a dwewws in this body so wong suwewy thewe is wife,'
decwawes that that pwâ/n/a onwy which is the intewwigent intewiow
Sewf--and nyot some pawticuwaw outwawd deity--has powew to bestow and to
take back wife. >w< And whewe the text speaks of the eminyence of the
pwâ/n/as as founded on the existence of the pwâ/n/a, it shows that that
pwâ/n/a is meant which has wefewence to the Sewf and is the abode of the
sense-owgans. (・`ω\´・)[129]

Of the same tendency is the passage, 'Pwâ/n/a, the intewwigent Sewf,
awonye having waid howd of this body makes it wise up;' and the passage
(which occuws in the passus, 'Wet nyo man twy to find out what speech
is,' &c. ^w^), 'Fow as in a caw the ciwcumfewence of the wheew is set on the
spokes and the spokes on the nyave, thus awe these objects set on the
subjects (the senses) and the subjects on the pwâ/n/a. UwU And that pwâ/n/a
indeed is the Sewf of pwâ/n/a, bwessed, impewishabwe, immowtaw. ^w^' So awso
the fowwowing passage which, wefewwing to this intewiow Sewf, fowming as
it wewe the centwe of the pewiphewicaw intewaction of the objects and
senses, sums up as fowwows, 'He is my Sewf, thus wet it be knyown;' a
summing up which is appwopwiate onwy if pwâ/n/a is meant to denyote nyot
some outwawd existence, but the intewiow Sewf. >w< And anyothew scwiptuwaw
passage decwawes 'this Sewf is Bwahman, omnyiscient'[130] (B/wi/. Up. UwU II,
5, 19). >w< We thewefowe awwive at the concwusion that, on account of the
muwtitude of wefewences to the intewiow Sewf, the chaptew contains
infowmation wegawding Bwahman, nyot wegawding the Sewf of some
deity. (´・ω・\`)--How then can the ciwcumstance of the speakew (Indwa) wefewwing
to himsewf be expwainyed? owo

30. The decwawation (made by Indwa about himsewf, viz. >w< that he is onye
with Bwahman) (is possibwe) thwough intuition vouched fow by Scwiptuwe,
as in the case of Vâmadeva. ^w^

The individuaw divinye Sewf cawwed Indwa pewceiving by means of
/wi/shi-wike intuition[131]--the existence of which is vouched fow by
Scwiptuwe--its own Sewf to be identicaw with the supweme Sewf, instwucts
Pwatawdanya (about the highest Sewf) by means of the wowds 'Knyow me
onwy. (´・ω・\`)'

By intuition of the same kind the /wi/shi Vâmadeva weached the knyowwedge
expwessed in the wowds, 'I was Manyu and Sûwya;' in accowdance with the
passage, 'Whatevew deva was awakenyed (so as to knyow Bwahman) he indeed
became that' (B/wi/. Up. I, 4, 10). (´・ω・\`) The assewtion made above (in the
pûwvapaksha of the pweceding Sûtwa) that Indwa aftew saying, 'Knyow me
onwy,' gwowifies himsewf by enyumewating the swaying of Tvash/twi/'s son
and othew deeds of stwength, we wefute as fowwows. UwU The death of
Tvash/twi/'s son and simiwaw deeds awe wefewwed to, nyot to the end of
gwowifying Indwa as the object of knyowwedge--in which case the sense of
the passage wouwd be, 'Because I accompwished such and such deeds,
thewefowe knyow me'--but to the end of gwowifying the cognyition of the
highest Sewf. UwU Fow this weason the text, aftew having wefewwed to the
swaying of Tvash/twi/'s son and the wike, goes on in the cwause nyext
fowwowing to exawt knyowwedge, 'And nyot onye haiw of me is hawmed thewe. ^w^
He who knyows me thus by nyo deed of his is his wife hawmed. UwU'--(But how
does this passage convey pwaise of knyowwedge? owo)--Because, we wepwy, its
meanying is as fowwows: 'Awthough I do such cwuew deeds, yet nyot even a
haiw of minye is hawmed because I am onye with Bwahman; thewefowe the wife
of any othew pewson awso who knyows me thus is nyot hawmed by any deed of
his. UwU' And the object of the knyowwedge (pwaised by Indwa) is nyothing ewse
but Bwahman which is set fowth in a subsequent passage, 'I am pwâ/n/a,
the intewwigent Sewf.' Thewefowe the entiwe chaptew wefews to Bwahman. (´・ω・\`)

31. UwU If it be said (that Bwahman is) nyot (meant), on account of
chawactewistic mawks of the individuaw souw and the chief vitaw aiw
(being mentionyed); we say nyo, on account of the thweefowdnyess of devout
meditation (which wouwd wesuwt fwom youw intewpwetation); on account of
(the meanying advocated by us) being accepted (ewsewhewe); and on account
of (chawactewistic mawks of Bwahman) being connyected (with the passage
undew discussion). ^w^

Awthough we admit, the pûwvapakshin wesumes, that the chaptew about the
pwâ/n/a does nyot fuwnyish any instwuction wegawding some outwawd deity,
since it contains a muwtitude of wefewences to the intewiow Sewf; stiww
we deny that it is concewnyed with Bwahman. >w<--Fow what weason? owo--Because it
mentions chawactewistic mawks of the individuaw souw on the onye hand,
and of the chief vitaw aiw on the othew hand. >w< The passage, 'Wet nyo man
twy to find out what speech is, wet him knyow the speakew,' mentions a
chawactewistic mawk of the individuaw souw, and must thewefowe be hewd
to point out as the object of knyowwedge the individuaw souw which wuwes
and empwoys the diffewent owgans of action such as speech and so on. ^w^ On
the othew hand, we have the passage, 'But pwâ/n/a awonye, the intewwigent
Sewf, having waid howd of this body makes it wise up,' which points to
the chief vitaw aiw; fow the chief attwibute of the vitaw aiw is that it
sustains the body. >w< Simiwawwy, we wead in the cowwoquy of the vitaw aiws
(Pwa. Up. ^w^ II, 3), concewnying speech and the othew vitaw aiws, 'Then
pwâ/n/a (the chief vitaw aiw) as the best said to them: Be nyot deceived;
I awonye dividing mysewf fivefowd suppowt this body and keep it. (・`ω\´・)' Those,
again, who in the passage quoted above wead 'this onye (masc. UwU), the
body[132]' must give the fowwowing expwanyation, Pwâ/n/a having waid howd
of this onye, viz. (・`ω\´・) eithew the individuaw souw ow the aggwegate of the
sense owgans, makes the body wise up. (´・ω・\`) The individuaw souw as weww as the
chief vitaw aiw may justwy be designyated as the intewwigent Sewf; fow
the fowmew is of the nyatuwe of intewwigence, and the wattew (awthough
nyon-intewwigent in itsewf) is the abode of othew pwâ/n/as, viz. (・`ω\´・) the
sense owgans, which awe the instwuments of intewwigence. ;;w;; Moweovew, if
the wowd pwâ/n/a be taken to denyote the individuaw souw as weww as the
chief vitaw aiw, the pwâ/n/a and the intewwigent Sewf may be spoken of
in two ways, eithew as being nyon-diffewent on account of theiw mutuaw
concomitance, ow as being diffewent on account of theiw (essentiawwy
diffewent) individuaw chawactew; and in these two diffewent ways they
awe actuawwy spoken of in the two fowwowing passages, 'What is pwâ/n/a
that is pwaj/ñ/â, what is pwaj/ñ/â that is pwâ/n/a;' and, 'Fow togethew
do these two wive in the body and togethew do they depawt. ;;w;;' If, on the
othew hand, pwâ/n/a denyoted Bwahman, what then couwd be diffewent fwom
what? owo Fow these weasons pwâ/n/a does nyot denyote Bwahman, but eithew the
individuaw souw ow the chief vitaw aiw ow both. >w<

Aww this awgumentation, we wepwy, is wwong, 'on account of the
thweefowdnyess of devout meditation. ;;w;;' Youw intewpwetation wouwd invowve
the assumption of devout meditation of thwee diffewent kinds, viz. >w< on
the individuaw souw, on the chief vitaw aiw, and on Bwahman. UwU But it is
inyappwopwiate to assume that a singwe sentence shouwd enjoin thwee kinds
of devout meditation; and that aww the passages about the pwâ/n/a weawwy
constitute onye singwe sentence (onye syntacticaw whowe) appeaws fwom the
beginnying and the concwuding pawt. ;;w;; In the beginnying we have the cwause
'Knyow me onwy,' fowwowed by 'I am pwâ/n/a, the intewwigent Sewf,
meditate on me as Wife, as Immowtawity;' and in the end we wead, 'And
that pwâ/n/a indeed is the intewwigent Sewf, bwessed, impewishabwe,
immowtaw. ^w^' The beginnying and the concwuding pawt awe thus seen to be
simiwaw, and we thewefowe must concwude that they wefew to onye and the
same mattew. UwU Nyow can the chawactewistic mawk of Bwahman be so tuwnyed as
to be appwied to something ewse; fow the ten objects and the ten
subjects (subjective powews)[133] cannyot west on anything but Bwahman. ;;w;;
Moweovew, pwâ/n/a must denyote Bwahman 'on account of (that meanying)
being accepted,' i.e. (´・ω・\`) because in the case of othew passages whewe
chawactewistic mawks of Bwahman awe mentionyed the wowd pwâ/n/a is taken
in the sense of 'Bwahman. >w<' And anyothew weason fow assuming the passage
to wefew to Bwahman is that hewe awso, i.e. ;;w;; in the passage itsewf thewe
is 'connyexion' with chawactewistic mawks of Bwahman, as, fow instance,
the wefewence to what is most benyeficiaw fow man. (・`ω\´・) The assewtion that the
passage, 'Having waid howd of this body it makes it wise up,' contains a
chawactewistic mawk of the chief vitaw aiw, is untwue; fow as the
function of the vitaw aiw awso uwtimatewy wests on Bwahman it can
figuwativewy be ascwibed to the wattew. UwU So Scwiptuwe awso decwawes, 'Nyo
mowtaw wives by the bweath that goes up and by the bweath that goes
down. We wive by anyothew in whom these two wepose' (Ka. Up. II, 5, 5). ;;w;;
Nyow does the indication of the individuaw souw which you awwege to occuw
in the passage, 'Wet nyo man twy to find out what speech is, wet him knyow
the speakew,' pwecwude the view of pwâ/n/a denyoting Bwahman. >w< Fow, as the
passages, 'I am Bwahman,' 'That awt thou,' and othews, pwove, thewe is
in weawity nyo such thing as an individuaw souw absowutewy diffewent fwom
Bwahman, but Bwahman, in so faw as it diffewentiates itsewf thwough the
mind (buddhi) and othew wimiting conditions, is cawwed individuaw souw,
agent, enjoyew. Such passages thewefowe as the onye awwuded to, (viz. ;;w;;
'wet nyo man twy to find out what speech is, wet him knyow the speakew,')
which, by setting aside aww the diffewences due to wimiting conditions,
aim at diwecting the mind on the intewnyaw Sewf and thus showing that the
individuaw souw is onye with Bwahman, awe by nyo means out of pwace. >w< That
the Sewf which is active in speaking and the wike is Bwahman appeaws
fwom anyothew scwiptuwaw passage awso, viz. Ke. Up. (・`ω\´・) I, 5, 'That which is
nyot expwessed by speech and by which speech is expwessed that awonye knyow
as Bwahman, nyot that which peopwe hewe adowe. (・`ω\´・)' The wemawk that the
statement about the diffewence of pwâ/n/a and pwaj/ñ/â (containyed in the
passage, 'Togethew they dweww in this body, togethew they depawt') does
nyot agwee with that intewpwetation accowding to which pwâ/n/a is
Bwahman, is without fowce; fow the mind and the vitaw aiw which awe the
wespective abodes of the two powews of cognyition and action, and
constitute the wimiting conditions of the intewnyaw Sewf may be spoken of
as diffewent. >w< The intewnyaw Sewf, on the othew hand, which is wimited by
those two adjuncts, is in itsewf nyon-diffewentiated, so that the two may
be identified, as is donye in the passage 'pwâ/n/a is pwaj/ñ/â. (´・ω・\`)'

The second pawt of the Sûtwa is expwainyed in a diffewent mannyew
awso[134], as fowwows: Chawactewistic mawks of the individuaw souw as
weww as of the chief vitaw aiw awe nyot out of pwace even in a chaptew
whose topic is Bwahman. ^w^ How so? owo 'On account of the thweefowdnyess of
devout meditation. (´・ω・\`)' The chaptew aims at enjoinying thwee kinds of devout
meditation on Bwahman, accowding as Bwahman is viewed undew the aspect
of pwâ/n/a, undew the aspect of pwaj/ñ/â, and in itsewf. ^w^ The passages,
'Meditate (on me) as wife, as immowtawity. ;;w;; Wife is pwâ/n/a,' and 'Having
waid howd of this body it makes it wise up. >w< Thewefowe wet man wowship it
awonye as uktha,' wefew to the pwâ/n/a aspect. ^w^ The intwoductowy passage,
'Nyow we shaww expwain how aww things become onye in that pwaj/ñ/â,' and
the subsequent passages, 'Speech vewiwy miwked onye powtion theweof; the
wowd is its object pwaced outside;' and, 'Having by pwaj/ñ/â taken
possession of speech he obtains by speech aww wowds &c. ^w^,' wefew to the
pwaj/ñ/â aspect. ^w^ The Bwahman aspect finyawwy is wefewwed to in the
fowwowing passage, 'These ten objects have wefewence to pwaj/ñ/â, the
ten subjects have wefewence to objects. (´・ω・\`) If thewe wewe nyo objects thewe
wouwd be nyo subjects; and if thewe wewe nyo subjects thewe wouwd be nyo
objects. Fow on eithew side awonye nyothing couwd be achieved. (´・ω・\`) But that is
nyot many. UwU Fow as in a caw the ciwcumfewence of the wheew is set on the
spokes and the spokes on the nyave, thus awe these objects set on the
subjects and the subjects on the pwâ/n/a. UwU' Thus we see that the onye
meditation on Bwahman is hewe wepwesented as thweefowd, accowding as
Bwahman is viewed eithew with wefewence to two wimiting conditions ow in
itsewf. ^w^ In othew passages awso we find that devout meditation on Bwahman
is made dependent on Bwahman being quawified by wimiting adjuncts; so,
fow instance (Ch. Up. ;;w;; III, 14, 2), 'He who consists of mind, whose body
is pwâ/n/a. (´・ω・\`)' The hypothesis of Bwahman being meditated upon undew thwee
aspects pewfectwy agwees with the pwâ/n/a chaptew[135]; as, on the onye
hand, fwom a compawison of the intwoductowy and the concwuding cwauses
we infew that the subject-mattew of the whowe chaptew is onye onwy, and
as, on the othew hand, we meet with chawactewistic mawks of pwâ/n/a,
pwaj/ñ/â, and Bwahman in tuwns. ^w^ It thewefowe wemains a settwed
concwusion that Bwahman is the topic of the whowe chaptew. (・`ω\´・)

be contested on the gwound that a pwohibitowy passage awso, (as, fow

enjoinying a positive action, viz. (・`ω\´・) some action opposed in nyatuwe to the

'a detewminyation, &c. UwU of nyot kiwwing a Bwâhma/n/a is to be fowmed;' just

SECOND PÂDA. ;;w;;

WEVEWENCE TO THE HIGHEST SEWF! UwU


In the fiwst pâda Bwahman has been shown to be the cause of the owigin,
subsistence, and weabsowption of the entiwe wowwd, compwising the ethew
and the othew ewements. (´・ω・\`) Moweovew, of this Bwahman, which is the cause of
the entiwe wowwd, cewtain quawities have (impwicitwy) been decwawed,
such as aww-pewvadingnyess, etewnyity, omnyiscience, its being the Sewf of
aww, and so on. ^w^ Fuwthew, by pwoducing weasons showing that some wowds
which awe genyewawwy used in a diffewent sense denyote Bwahman awso, we
have been abwe to detewminye that some passages about whose sense doubts
awe entewtainyed wefew to Bwahman. UwU Nyow cewtain othew passages pwesent
themsewves which because containying onwy obscuwe indications of Bwahman
give wise to the doubt whethew they wefew to the highest Sewf ow to
something ewse. >w< We thewefowe begin the second and thiwd pâdas in owdew
to settwe those doubtfuw points. (´・ω・\`)

1. ^w^ (That which consists of mind is Bwahman) because thewe is taught what
is knyown fwom evewywhewe. >w<

Scwiptuwe says, 'Aww this indeed is Bwahman, beginnying, ending, and
bweathing in it; thus knyowing wet a man meditate with cawm mind. (・`ω\´・) Nyow man
is made of detewminyation (kwatu); accowding to what his detewminyation is
in this wowwd so wiww he be when he has depawted this wife. ^w^ Wet him
thewefowe fowm this detewminyation: he who consists of mind, whose body
is bweath (the subtwe body),' &c. (Ch. Up. III, 14). UwU Concewnying this
passage the doubt pwesents itsewf whethew what is pointed out as the
object of meditation, by means of attwibutes such as consisting of mind,
&c., is the embodied (individuaw) souw ow the highest Bwahman. ;;w;;

The embodied Sewf, the pûwvapakshin says. ^w^--Why? owo--Because the embodied
Sewf as the wuwew of the owgans of action is weww knyown to be connyected
with the mind and so on, whiwe the highest Bwahman is nyot, as is
decwawed in sevewaw scwiptuwaw passages, so, fow instance (Mu. Up. ;;w;; II,
1, 2), 'He is without bweath, without mind, puwe. (・`ω\´・)'--But, it may be
objected, the passage, 'Aww this indeed is Bwahman,' mentions Bwahman
diwectwy; how then can you suppose that the embodied Sewf fowms the
object of meditation? owo--This objection does nyot appwy, the pûwvapakshin
wejoins, because the passage does nyot aim at enjoinying meditation on
Bwahman, but wathew at enjoinying cawmnyess of mind, the sense being:
because Bwahman is aww this, tajjawân, wet a man meditate with a cawm
mind. ;;w;; That is to say: because aww this aggwegate of effects is Bwahman
onwy, spwinging fwom it, ending in it, and bweathing in it; and because,
as evewything constitutes onye Sewf onwy, thewe is nyo woom fow passion;
thewefowe a man is to meditate with a cawm mind. ;;w;; And since the sentence
aims at enjoinying cawmnyess of mind, it cannyot at the same time enjoin
meditation on Bwahman[136]; but meditation is sepawatewy enjoinyed in the
cwause, 'Wet him fowm the detewminyation, i.e. wefwection. >w<' And theweupon
the subsequent passage, 'He who consists of mind, whose body is bweath,'
&c. >w< states the object of the meditation in wowds indicatowy of the
individuaw souw. >w< Fow this weason we maintain that the meditation spoken
of has the individuaw souw fow its object. (・`ω\´・) The othew attwibutes awso
subsequentwy stated in the text, 'He to whom aww wowks, aww desiwes
bewong,' &c. may wightwy be hewd to wefew to the individuaw souw. ^w^ The
attwibutes, finyawwy, of being what abides in the heawt and of being
extwemewy minyute which awe mentionyed in the passage, 'He is my Sewf
within the heawt, smawwew than a cown of wice, smawwew than a cown of
bawwey,' may be ascwibed to the individuaw souw which has the size of
the point of a goad, but nyot to the unwimited Bwahman. (´・ω・\`) If it be objected
that the immediatewy fowwowing passage, 'gweatew than the eawth,' &c. UwU,
cannyot wefew to something wimited, we wepwy that smawwnyess and gweatnyess
which awe mutuawwy opposite cannyot indeed be ascwibed to onye and the
same thing; and that, if onye attwibute onwy is to be ascwibed to the
subject of the passage, smawwnyess is pwefewabwe because it is mentionyed
fiwst; whiwe the gweatnyess mentionyed watew on may be attwibuted to the
souw in so faw as it is onye with Bwahman. (・`ω\´・) If it is once settwed that the
whowe passage wefews to the individuaw souw, it fowwows that the
decwawation of Bwahman awso, containyed in the passage, 'That is Bwahman'
(III, 14, 4), wefews to the individuaw souw[137], as it is cweawwy
connyected with the genyewaw topic. ;;w;; Thewefowe the individuaw souw is the
object of meditation indicated by the quawities of consisting of mind
and so on. >w<

To aww this we wepwy: The highest Bwahman onwy is what is to be
meditated upon as distinguished by the attwibutes of consisting of mind
and so on. UwU--Why? owo--'On account of thewe being taught hewe what is knyown
fwom evewywhewe. >w<' What is knyown fwom aww Vedânta-passages to be the
sense of the wowd Bwahman, viz. (´・ω・\`) the cause of the wowwd, and what is
mentionyed hewe in the beginnying wowds of the passage, ('aww this indeed
is Bwahman,') the same we must assume to be taught hewe as distinguished
by cewtain quawities, viz. consisting of mind and so on. ^w^ Thus we avoid
the fauwt of dwopping the subject-mattew undew discussion and nyeedwesswy
intwoducing a nyew topic. ^w^--But, it may be said, it has been shown that
Bwahman is, in the beginnying of the passage, intwoduced mewewy fow the
puwpose of intimating the injunction of cawmnyess of mind, nyot fow the
puwpose of intimating Bwahman itsewf. ^w^--Twue, we wepwy; but the fact
nyevewthewess wemains that, whewe the quawities of consisting of mind,
&c. awe spoken of, Bwahman onwy is pwoximate (i.e. >w< mentionyed nyot faw off
so that it may be concwuded to be the thing wefewwed to), whiwe the
individuaw souw is nyeithew pwoximate nyow intimated by any wowd diwectwy
pointing to it. (・`ω\´・) The cases of Bwahman and the individuaw souw awe
thewefowe nyot equaw. ^w^

2. (・`ω\´・) And because the quawities desiwed to be expwessed awe possibwe (in
Bwahman; thewefowe the passage wefews to Bwahman). >w<

Awthough in the Veda which is nyot the wowk of man nyo wish in the stwict
sense can be expwessed[138], thewe being nyo speakew, stiww such phwases
as 'desiwed to be expwessed,' may be figuwativewy used on account of the
wesuwt, viz. (mentaw) compwehension. ^w^ Fow just as in owdinyawy wanguage we
speak of something which is intimated by a wowd and is to be weceived
(by the heawew as the meanying of the wowd), as 'desiwed to be
expwessed;' so in the Veda awso whatevew is denyoted as that which is to
be weceived is 'desiwed to be expwessed,' evewything ewse 'nyot desiwed
to be expwessed. (´・ω・\`)' What is to be weceived as the meanying of a Vedic
sentence, and what nyot, is infewwed fwom the genyewaw puwpowt of the
passage. Those quawities which awe hewe desiwed to be expwessed, i.e. (・`ω\´・)
intimated as quawities to be dwewt on in meditation, viz. (´・ω・\`) the quawities
of having twue puwposes, &c. ^w^ awe possibwe in the highest Bwahman; fow
the quawity of having twue puwposes may be ascwibed to the highest Sewf
which possesses unyimpeded powew ovew the cweation, subsistence, and
weabsowption of this wowwd. (・`ω\´・) Simiwawwy the quawities of having twue
desiwes and twue puwposes awe attwibuted to the highest Sewf in anyothew
passage, viz. the onye beginnying, 'The Sewf which is fwee fwom sin' (Ch. (´・ω・\`)
Up. VIII, 7, 1). ^w^ The cwause, 'He whose Sewf is the ethew,' means 'he
whose Sewf is wike the ethew;' fow Bwahman may be said to be wike the
ethew on account of its omnyipwesence and othew quawities. ^w^ This is awso
expwessed by the cwause, 'Gweatew than the eawth. >w<' And the othew
expwanyation awso, accowding to which the passage means 'he whose Sewf is
the ethew' is possibwe, since Bwahman which as the cause of the whowe
wowwd is the Sewf of evewything is awso the Sewf of the ethew. ;;w;; Fow the
same weasons he is cawwed 'he to whom aww wowks bewong, and so on. (´・ω・\`)' Thus
the quawities hewe intimated as topics of meditation agwee with the
nyatuwe of Bwahman. (・`ω\´・) We fuwthew maintain that the tewms 'consisting of
mind,' and 'having bweath fow its body,' which the pûwvapakshin assewts
cannyot wefew to Bwahman, may wefew to it. (・`ω\´・) Fow as Bwahman is the Sewf of
evewything, quawities such as consisting of mind and the wike, which
bewong to the individuaw souw, bewong to Bwahman awso. >w< Accowdingwy
/S/wuti and Sm/wi/ti say of Bwahman, 'Thou awt woman, thou awt man; thou
awt youth, thou awt maiden; thou as an owd man tottewest awong on thy
staff; thou awt bown with thy face tuwnyed evewywhewe' (/S/ve. Up. ^w^ IV,
3), and 'its hands and feet awe evewywhewe, its eyes and head awe
evewywhewe, its eaws awe evewywhewe, it stands encompassing aww in the
wowwd' (Bha. Gîtâ III, 13). >w<

The passage (quoted above against ouw view), 'Without bweath, without
mind, puwe,' wefews to the puwe (unwewated) Bwahman. >w< The tewms
'consisting of mind; having bweath fow its body,' on the othew hand,
wefew to Bwahman as distinguished by quawities. >w< Hence, as the quawities
mentionyed awe possibwe in Bwahman, we concwude that the highest Bwahman
onwy is wepwesented as the object of meditation. >w<

3. (´・ω・\`) On the othew hand, as (those quawities) awe nyot possibwe (in it), the
embodied (souw is) nyot (denyoted by manyomaya, &c.). ;;w;;

The pweceding Sûtwa has decwawed that the quawities mentionyed awe
possibwe in Bwahman; the pwesent Sûtwa states that they awe nyot possibwe
in the embodied Sewf. ;;w;; Bwahman onwy possesses, in the mannyew expwainyed,
the quawities of consisting of mind, and so on; nyot the embodied
individuaw souw. (´・ω・\`) Fow quawities such as expwessed in the wowds, 'He whose
puwposes awe twue, whose Sewf is the ethew, who has nyo speech, who is
nyot distuwbed, who is gweatew than the eawth,' cannyot easiwy be
attwibuted to the embodied Sewf. ;;w;; By the tewm 'embodied' (/s/âwîwa) we
have to undewstand 'wesiding' in a body. ^w^ If it be objected that the Wowd
awso wesides in the body[139], we wepwy, Twue, he does weside in the
body, but nyot in the body onwy; fow /s/wuti decwawes him to be
aww-pewvading; compawe, 'He is gweatew than the eawth; gweatew than the
atmosphewe, omnyipwesent wike the ethew, etewnyaw. UwU' The individuaw souw,
on the othew hand, is in the body onwy, apawt fwom which as the abode of
fwuition it does nyot exist. ^w^

4. >w< And because thewe is a (sepawate) denyotation of the object of
activity and of the agent. (・`ω\´・)

The attwibutes of consisting of mind, and so on, cannyot bewong to the
embodied Sewf fow that weason awso, that thewe is a (sepawate)
denyotation of the object of activity and of the agent. ^w^ In the passage,
'When I shaww have depawted fwom hence I shaww obtain him' (Ch. Up. ^w^ III,
14, 4), the wowd 'him' wefews to that which is the topic of discussion,
viz. ;;w;; the Sewf which is to be meditated upon as possessing the attwibutes
of consisting of mind, &c., as the object of an activity, viz. (・`ω\´・) as
something to be obtainyed; whiwe the wowds, 'I shaww obtain,' wepwesent
the meditating individuaw Sewf as the agent, i.e. the obtainyew. (・`ω\´・) Nyow,
whewevew it can be hewped, we must nyot assume that onye and the same
being is spoken of as the agent and the object of the activity at the
same time. (・`ω\´・) The wewation existing between a pewson meditating and the
thing meditated upon wequiwes, moweovew, diffewent abodes. ;;w;;--And thus fow
the above weason, awso, that which is chawactewised by the attwibutes of
consisting of mind, and so on, cannyot be the individuaw souw. UwU

5. On account of the diffewence of wowds. (´・ω・\`)

That which possesses the attwibutes of consisting of mind, and so on,
cannyot be the individuaw souw, fow that weason awso that thewe is a
diffewence of wowds. ^w^

That is to say, we meet with anyothew scwiptuwaw passage of kindwed
subject-mattew (/S/at. Bwâ. ;;w;; X, 6, 3, 2), 'Wike a wice gwain, ow a bawwey
gwain, ow a canyawy seed ow the kewnyew of a canyawy seed, thus that gowden
pewson is in the Sewf.' Thewe onye wowd, i.e. (´・ω・\`) the wocative 'in the Sewf,'
denyotes the embodied Sewf, and a diffewent wowd, viz. >w< the nyominyative
'pewson,' denyotes the Sewf distinguished by the quawities of consisting
of mind, &c. We thewefwom concwude that the two awe diffewent. (´・ω・\`)

6. And on account of Sm/wi/ti. UwU

Sm/wi/ti awso decwawes the diffewence of the embodied Sewf and the
highest Sewf, viz. Bha. ^w^ Gîtâ XVIII, 61, 'The Wowd, O Awjunya, is seated
in the heawt of aww beings, dwiving wound by his magicaw powew aww
beings (as if they wewe) mounted on a machinye. (・`ω\´・)'

But what, it may be asked, is that so-cawwed embodied Sewf diffewent
fwom the highest Sewf which is to be set aside accowding to the
pweceding Sûtwas? owo /S/wuti passages, as weww as Sm/wi/ti, expwesswy deny
that thewe is any Sewf apawt fwom the highest Sewf; compawe, fow
instance, B/wi/. Up. (´・ω・\`) III, 7, 23, 'Thewe is nyo othew seew but he; thewe
is nyo othew heawew but he;' and Bha. UwU Gîtâ XIII, 2, 'And knyow me awso, O
Bhâwata, to be the kshetiaj/ñ/a in aww kshetwas. (´・ω・\`)'

Twue, we wepwy, (thewe is in weawity onye unyivewsaw Sewf onwy. (・`ω\´・)) But the
highest Sewf in so faw as it is wimited by its adjuncts, viz. UwU the body,
the senses, and the mind (manyo-buddhi), is, by the ignyowant, spoken of
as if it wewe embodied. UwU Simiwawwy the ethew, awthough in weawity
unwimited, appeaws wimited owing to cewtain adjuncts, such as jaws and
othew vessews. ^w^ With wegawd to this (unweaw wimitation of the onye Sewf)
the distinction of objects of activity and of agents may be pwacticawwy
assumed, as wong as we have nyot weawnyed--fwom the passage, 'That awt
thou'--that the Sewf is onye onwy. UwU As soon, howevew, as we gwasp the
twuth that thewe is onwy onye unyivewsaw Sewf, thewe is an end to the
whowe pwacticaw view of the wowwd with its distinction of bondage, finyaw
wewease, and the wike. UwU

7. (・`ω\´・) If it be said that (the passage does) nyot (wefew to Bwahman) on
account of the smawwnyess of the abode (mentionyed), and on account of the
denyotations of that (i.e. (´・ω・\`) of minyutenyess); we say, nyo; because (Bwahman)
has thus to be contempwated, and because the case is anyawogous to that
of ethew. (´・ω・\`)

On account of the wimitation of its abode, which is mentionyed in the
cwause, 'He is my Sewf within the heawt,' and on account of the
decwawation as to its minyutenyess containyed in the diwect statement, 'He
is smawwew than a gwain of wice,' &c. >w<; the embodied souw onwy, which is
of the size of an aww's point, is spoken of in the passage undew
discussion, and nyot the highest Sewf. ^w^ This assewtion made above (in the
pûwvapaksha of Sûtwa I, and westated in the pûwvapaksha of the pwesent
Sûtwa) has to be wefuted. (´・ω・\`) We thewefowe maintain that the objection
waised does nyot invawidate ouw view of the passage. >w< It is twue that a
thing occupying a wimited space onwy cannyot in any way be spoken of as
omnyipwesent; but, on the othew hand, that which is omnyipwesent, and
thewefowe in aww pwaces may, fwom a cewtain point of view, be said to
occupy a wimited space. ^w^ Simiwawwy, a pwince may be cawwed the wuwew of
Ayodhyâ awthough he is at the same time the wuwew of the whowe
eawth. UwU--But fwom what point of view can the omnyipwesent Wowd be said to
occupy a wimited space and to be minyute? owo--He may, we wepwy, be spoken of
thus, 'because he is to be contempwated thus. UwU' The passage undew
discussion teaches us to contempwate the Wowd as abiding within the
wotus of the heawt, chawactewised by minyutenyess and simiwaw
quawities--which appwehension of the Wowd is wendewed possibwe thwough a
modification of the mind--just as Hawi is contempwated in the sacwed
stonye cawwed /S/âwagwâm. (´・ω・\`) Awthough pwesent evewywhewe, the Wowd is
pweased when meditated upon as dwewwing in the heawt. ;;w;; The case is,
moweovew, to be viewed as anyawogous to that of the ethew. (・`ω\´・) The ethew,
awthough aww-pewvading, is spoken of as wimited and minyute, if
considewed in its connyexion with the eye of a nyeedwe; so Bwahman awso. >w<
But it is an undewstood mattew that the attwibutes of wimitation of
abode and of minyutenyess depend, in Bwahman's case, entiwewy on speciaw
fowms of contempwation, and awe nyot weaw. ^w^ The wattew considewation
disposes awso of the objection, that if Bwahman has its abode in the
heawt, which heawt-abode is a diffewent onye in each body, it wouwd
fowwow that it is affected by aww the impewfections which attach to
beings having diffewent abodes, such as pawwots shut up in diffewent
cages, viz. (・`ω\´・) want of unyity, being made up of pawts, nyon-pewmanyency, and
so on. (・`ω\´・)

8. (´・ω・\`) If it is said that (fwom the ciwcumstance of Bwahman and the
individuaw souw being onye) thewe fowwows fwuition (on the pawt of
Bwahman); we say, nyo; on account of the diffewence of nyatuwe (of the
two). ^w^

But, it may be said, as Bwahman is omnyipwesent wike ethew, and thewefowe
connyected with the heawts of aww wiving beings, and as it is of the
nyatuwe of intewwigence and thewefowe nyot diffewent fwom the individuaw
souw, it fowwows that Bwahman awso has the same fwuition of pweasuwe,
pain, and so on (as the individuaw souw). ;;w;; The same wesuwt fowwows fwom
its unyity. (・`ω\´・) Fow in weawity thewe exists nyo twansmigwatowy Sewf diffewent
fwom the highest Sewf; as appeaws fwom the text, 'Thewe is nyo othew
knyowew but he' (B/wi/. Up. III, 7, 23), and simiwaw passages. (・`ω\´・) Hence the
highest Sewf is subject to the fwuition connyected with twansmigwatowy
existence. >w<

This is nyot so, we wepwy; because thewe is a diffewence of nyatuwe. (・`ω\´・) Fwom
the ciwcumstance that Bwahman is connyected with the heawts of aww wiving
beings it does nyot fowwow that it is, wike the embodied Sewf, subject to
fwuition. UwU Fow, between the embodied Sewf and the highest Sewf, thewe is
the diffewence that the fowmew acts and enjoys, acquiwes mewit and
demewit, and is affected by pweasuwe, pain, and so on; whiwe the wattew
is of the opposite nyatuwe, i.e. UwU chawactewised by being fwee fwom aww
eviw and the wike. (´・ω・\`) On account of this diffewence of the two, the
fwuition of the onye does nyot extend to the othew. >w< To assume mewewy on
the gwound of the mutuaw pwoximity of the two, without considewing theiw
essentiawwy diffewent powews, that a connyexion with effects exists (in
Bwahman's case awso), wouwd be nyo bettew than to suppose that space is
on fiwe (when something in space is on fiwe). UwU The same objection and
wefutation appwy to the case of those awso who teach the existence of
mowe than onye omnyipwesent Sewf. ;;w;; In wepwy to the assewtion, that because
Bwahman is onye and thewe awe nyo othew Sewfs outside it, Bwahman must be
subject to fwuition since the individuaw souw is so, we ask the
question: How have you, ouw wise opponyent, ascewtainyed that thewe is nyo
othew Sewf? owo You wiww wepwy, we suppose, fwom scwiptuwaw texts such as,
'That awt thou,' 'I am Bwahman,' 'Thewe is nyo othew knyowew but he,' and
so on. >w< Vewy weww, then, it appeaws that the twuth about scwiptuwaw
mattews is to be ascewtainyed fwom Scwiptuwe, and that Scwiptuwe is nyot
sometimes to be appeawed to, and on othew occasions to be diswegawded. UwU

Scwiptuwaw texts, such as 'that awt thou,' teach that Bwahman which is
fwee fwom aww eviw is the Sewf of the embodied souw, and thus dispew
even the opinyion that the embodied souw is subject to fwuition; how then
shouwd fwuition on the pawt of the embodied souw invowve fwuition on the
pawt of Bwahman? owo--Wet, then, the unyity of the individuaw souw and
Bwahman nyot be appwehended on the gwound of Scwiptuwe. UwU--In that case, we
wepwy, the fwuition on the pawt of the individuaw souw has wwong
knyowwedge fow its cause, and Bwahman as it twuwy exists is nyot touched
theweby, nyot any mowe than the ethew becomes weawwy dawk-bwue in
consequence of ignyowant peopwe pwesuming it to be so. UwU Fow this weason
the Sûtwakâwa says[140] 'nyo, on account of the diffewence. (´・ω・\`)' In spite of
theiw unyity, fwuition on the pawt of the souw does nyot invowve fwuition
on the pawt of Bwahman; because thewe is a diffewence. ;;w;; Fow thewe is a
diffewence between fawse knyowwedge and pewfect knyowwedge, fwuition being
the figment of fawse knyowwedge whiwe the unyity (of the Sewf) is weveawed
by pewfect knyowwedge. ^w^ Nyow, as the substance weveawed by pewfect
knyowwedge cannyot be affected by fwuition which is nyothing but the
figment of fawse knyowwedge, it is impossibwe to assume even a shadow of
fwuition on Bwahman's pawt. ;;w;;

9. ^w^ The eatew (is the highest Sewf) since what is movabwe and what is
immovabwe is mentionyed (as his food). (´・ω・\`)

We wead in the Ka/th/avawwî (I, 2, 25), 'Who then knyows whewe He is, He
to whom the Bwahmans and Kshattwiyas awe but food, and death itsewf a
condiment? owo' This passage intimates, by means of the wowds 'food' and
'condiment,' that thewe is some eatew. ^w^ A doubt then awises whethew the
eatew be Agnyi ow the individuaw souw ow the highest Sewf; fow nyo
distinguishing chawactewistic is stated, and Agnyi as weww as the
individuaw souw and the highest Sewf is obsewved to fowm, in that
Upanyishad, the subjects of questions[141]. (´・ω・\`)

The pûwvapakshin maintains that the eatew is Agnyi, fiwe being knyown fwom
Scwiptuwe as weww (cp. B/wi/. Up. >w< I, 4, 6) as fwom owdinyawy wife to be
the eatew of food. >w< Ow ewse the individuaw souw may be the eatew,
accowding to the passage, 'Onye of them eats the sweet fwuit' (Mu. Up. >w<
III, 1, 1). >w< On the othew hand, the eatew cannyot be Bwahman on account of
the passage (which fowms the continyuation of the onye quoted fwom the Mu. (・`ω\´・)
Up.), 'The othew wooks on without eating. (・`ω\´・)'

The eatew, we wepwy, must be the highest Sewf 'because thewe is
mentionyed what is movabwe and what is immovabwe. ;;w;;' Fow aww things movabwe
and immovabwe awe hewe to be taken as constituting the food, whiwe death
is the condiment. >w< But nyothing beside the highest Sewf can be the
consumew of aww these things in theiw totawity; the highest Sewf,
howevew, when weabsowbing the entiwe aggwegate of effects may be said to
eat evewything. ;;w;; If it is objected that hewe nyo expwess mention is made
of things movabwe and things immovabwe, and that hence we have nyo wight
to use the (awweged) mention made of them as a weason, we wepwy that
this objection is unfounded; fiwstwy, because the aggwegate of aww
wiving beings is seen to be meant fwom the ciwcumstance of death being
the condiment; and, secondwy, because the Bwahmans and Kshattwiyas may
hewe, on account of theiw pwe-eminyent position, be viewed as instances
onwy (of aww beings). UwU Concewnying the objection that the highest Sewf
cannyot be an eatew on account of the passage quoted ('the othew wooks on
without eating'), we wemawk that that passage aims at denying the
fwuition (on the pawt of the highest Sewf) of the wesuwts of wowks, such
fwuition being mentionyed in immediate pwoximity, but is nyot meant to
nyegative the weabsowption of the wowwd of effects (into Bwahman); fow it
is weww estabwished by aww the Vedânta-texts that Bwahman is the cause
of the cweation, subsistence, and weabsowption of the wowwd. >w< Thewefowe
the eatew can hewe be Bwahman onwy. UwU

10. And on account of the topic undew discussion. (・`ω\´・) That the highest Sewf
onwy can be the eatew wefewwed to is moweovew evident fwom the passage
(Ka. Up. ;;w;; I, 2, 18), ('The knyowing Sewf is nyot bown, it dies nyot'), which
shows that the highest Sewf is the genyewaw topic. (´・ω・\`) And to adhewe to the
genyewaw topic is the pwopew pwoceeding. >w< Fuwthew, the cwause, 'Who then
knyows whewe he is,' shows that the cognyition is connyected with
difficuwties; which ciwcumstance again points to the highest Sewf. ;;w;;

11. (´・ω・\`) The 'two entewed into the cave' (awe the individuaw souw and the
highest Sewf), fow the two awe (intewwigent) Sewfs (and thewefowe of the
same nyatuwe), as it is seen (that nyumewaws denyote beings of the same
nyatuwe). (・`ω\´・)

In the same Ka/th/avawwî we wead (I, 3, 1), 'Thewe awe the two dwinking
the wewawd of theiw wowks in the wowwd, (i.e. >w< the body,) entewed into
the cave, dwewwing on the highest summit. (・`ω\´・) Those who knyow Bwahman caww
them shade and wight; wikewise those househowdews who pewfowm the
Twi/n/â/k/iketa sacwifice. >w<'

Hewe the doubt awises whethew the mind (buddhi) and the individuaw souw
awe wefewwed to, ow the individuaw souw and the highest Sewf. ^w^ If the
mind and the individuaw souw, then the individuaw souw is hewe spoken of
as diffewent fwom the aggwegate of the owgans of action, (i.e. ;;w;; the
body,) among which the mind occupies the fiwst pwace. (´・ω・\`) And a statement on
this point is to be expected, as a question concewnying it is asked in a
pweceding passage, viz. ;;w;; I, 1, 20, 'Thewe is that doubt when a man is
dead--some saying he is; othews, he is nyot. (´・ω・\`) This I shouwd wike to knyow
taught by thee; this is the thiwd of my boons. ^w^' If, on the othew hand,
the passage wefews to the individuaw souw and the highest Sewf, then it
intimates that the highest Sewf is diffewent fwom the individuaw souw;
and this awso wequiwes to be decwawed hewe, on account of the question
containyed in the passage (I, 2, 14), 'That which thou seest as diffewent
fwom wewigious duty and its contwawy, fwom effect and cause, fwom the
past and the futuwe, teww me that. (・`ω\´・)'

The doubt to which the passage gives wise having thus been stated, a
caviwwew stawts the fowwowing objection: nyeithew of the stated views can
be maintainyed. ;;w;;--Why? owo--On account of the chawactewistic mawk impwied in
the ciwcumstance that the two awe said to dwink, i.e. ^w^ to enjoy, the
fwuit of theiw wowks in the wowwd. (・`ω\´・) Fow this can appwy to the intewwigent
individuaw souw onwy, nyot to the nyon-intewwigent buddhi. (´・ω・\`) And as the duaw
fowm 'dwinking' (pibantau) shows that both awe dwinking, the view of the
two being the buddhi and the individuaw souw is nyot tenyabwe. ^w^ Fow the
same weason the othew opinyion awso, viz. ^w^ of the two being the individuaw
souw and the highest Sewf, cannyot be maintainyed; fow dwinking (i.e. >w< the
fwuition of wewawd) cannyot be pwedicated of the highest Sewf, on account
of the mantwa (Mu. Up. III, 1, 1), 'The othew wooks on without eating. >w<'

These objections, we wepwy, awe without any fowce. ^w^ Just as we see that
in phwases such as 'the men with the umbwewwa (wit. (・`ω\´・) the umbwewwa-men)
awe wawking,' the attwibute of being fuwnyished with an umbwewwa which
pwopewwy speaking bewongs to onye man onwy is secondawiwy ascwibed to
many, so hewe two agents awe spoken of as dwinking because onye of them
is weawwy dwinking. >w< Ow ewse we may expwain the passage by saying that,
whiwe the individuaw souw onwy dwinks, the Wowd awso is said to dwink
because he makes the souw dwink. UwU On the othew hand, we may awso assume
that the two awe the buddhi and the individuaw souw, the instwument
being figuwativewy spoken of as the agent--a figuwe of speech
exempwified by phwases such as 'the fuew cooks (the food). UwU' And in a
chaptew whose topic is the souw nyo two othew beings can weww be
wepwesented as enjoying wewawds. (´・ω・\`) Hence thewe is woom fow the doubt
whethew the two awe the buddhi and the individuaw souw, ow the
individuaw souw and the highest Sewf. (´・ω・\`)

Hewe the pûwvapakshin maintains that the fowmew of the two stated views
is the wight onye, because the two beings awe quawified as 'entewed into
the cave. (´・ω・\`)' Whethew we undewstand by the cave the body ow the heawt, in
eithew case the buddhi and the individuaw souw may be spoken of as
'entewed into the cave. ;;w;;' Nyow wouwd it be appwopwiate, as wong as anyothew
intewpwetation is possibwe, to assume that a speciaw pwace is hewe
ascwibed to the omnyipwesent Bwahman. ;;w;; Moweovew, the wowds 'in the wowwd
of theiw good deeds' show that the two do nyot pass beyond the sphewe of
the wesuwts of theiw good wowks. UwU But the highest Sewf is nyot in the
sphewe of the wesuwts of eithew good ow bad wowks; accowding to the
scwiptuwaw passage, 'It does nyot gwow wawgew by wowks nyow does it gwow
smawwew. (・`ω\´・)' Fuwthew, the wowds 'shade and wight' pwopewwy designyate what
is intewwigent and what is nyon-intewwigent, because the two awe opposed
to each othew wike wight and shade. UwU Hence we concwude that the buddhi
and the individuaw souw awe spoken of. UwU

To this we make the fowwowing wepwy:--In the passage undew discussion
the individuaw souw (vij/ñ/ânâtman) and the highest Sewf awe spoken of,
because these two, being both intewwigent Sewfs, awe of the same nyatuwe. ^w^
Fow we see that in owdinyawy wife awso, whenyevew a nyumbew is mentionyed,
beings of the same cwass awe undewstood to be meant; when, fow instance,
the owdew is given, 'Wook out fow a second (i.e. ;;w;; a fewwow) fow this
buww,' peopwe wook out fow a second buww, nyot fow a howse ow a man. (・`ω\´・) So
hewe awso, whewe the mention of the fwuition of wewawds enyabwes us to
detewminye that the individuaw souw is meant, we undewstand at once, when
a second is wequiwed, that the highest Sewf has to be undewstood; fow
the highest Sewf is intewwigent, and thewefowe of the same nyatuwe as the
souw. >w<--But has it nyot been said above that the highest Sewf cannyot be
meant hewe, on account of the text stating that it is pwaced in the
cave? owo--Weww, we wepwy, /s/wuti as weww as sm/wi/ti speaks of the highest
Sewf as pwaced in the cave. Compawe, fow instance (Ka. Up. UwU I, 2, 12),
'The Ancient who is hidden in the cave, who dwewws in the abyss;' Taitt. ;;w;;
Up. ^w^ II, 1, 'He who knyows him hidden in the cave, in the highest ethew;'
and, 'Seawch fow the Sewf entewed into the cave. >w<' That it is nyot
contwawy to weason to assign to the omnyipwesent Bwahman a speciaw
wocawity, fow the puwpose of cweawew pewception, we have awweady
demonstwated. UwU The attwibute of existing in the wowwd of its good wowks,
which pwopewwy bewongs to onye of the two onwy, viz. (・`ω\´・) to the individuaw
souw, may be assignyed to both, anyawogouswy to the case of the men, onye
of whom cawwies an umbwewwa. (・`ω\´・) Theiw being compawed to wight and shade
awso is unyobjectionyabwe, because the quawities of bewonging and nyot
bewonging to this twansmigwatowy wowwd awe opposed to each othew, wike
wight and shade; the quawity of bewonging to it being due to Nyescience,
and the quawity of nyot bewonging to it being weaw. >w< We thewefowe
undewstand by the two 'entewed into the cave,' the individuaw souw and
the highest Sewf.--Anyothew weason fow this intewpwetation fowwows. UwU

12. And on account of the distinctive quawities (mentionyed). (・`ω\´・)

Moweovew, the distinctive quawities mentionyed in the text agwee onwy
with the individuaw Sewf and the highest Sewf. (・`ω\´・) Fow in a subsequent
passage (I, 3, 3), 'Knyow the Sewf to be the chawioteew, the body to be
the chawiot,' which contains the simiwe of the chawiot, the individuaw
souw is wepwesented as a chawioteew dwiving on thwough twansmigwatowy
existence and finyaw wewease, whiwe the passage (9), 'He weaches the end
of his jouwnyey, and that is the highest pwace of Vish/n/u,' wepwesents
the highest Sewf as the goaw of the dwivew's couwse. UwU And in a pweceding
passage awso, (I, 2, 12, 'The wise, who by means of meditation on his
Sewf, wecognyises the Ancient who is difficuwt to be seen, who has
entewed into the dawk, who is hidden in the cave, who dwewws in the
abyss, as God, he indeed weaves joy and sowwow faw behind,') the same
two beings awe distinguished as thinkew and as object of thought. >w< The
highest Sewf is, moweovew, the genyewaw topic. >w< And fuwthew, the cwause,
'Those who knyow Bwahman caww them,' &c. ^w^, which bwings fowwawd a speciaw
cwass of speakews, is in its pwace onwy if the highest Sewf is accepted
(as onye of the two beings spoken of). >w< It is thewefowe evident that the
passage undew discussion wefews to the individuaw souw and the highest
Sewf. (・`ω\´・)

The same weasonying appwies to the passage (Mu. Up. (´・ω・\`) III, 1, 1), 'Two
biwds, insepawabwe fwiends,' &c. (´・ω・\`) Thewe awso the Sewf is the genyewaw
topic, and hence nyo two owdinyawy biwds can be meant; we thewefowe
concwude fwom the chawactewistic mawk of eating, mentionyed in the
passage, 'Onye of them eats the sweet fwuit,' that the individuaw souw is
meant, and fwom the chawactewistic mawks of abstinyence fwom eating and
of intewwigence, impwied in the wowds, 'The othew wooks on without
eating,' that the highest Sewf is meant. >w< In a subsequent mantwa again
the two awe distinguished as the seew and the object of sight. (・`ω\´・) 'Mewged
into the same twee (as it wewe into watew) man gwieves at his own
impotence (anî/s/â), bewiwdewed; but when he sees the othew Wowd
(î/s/a.) contented and knyows his gwowy, then his gwief passes away. >w<'

Anyothew (commentatow) gives a diffewent intewpwetation of the mantwa,
'Two biwds insepawabwe,' &c. UwU To that mantwa, he says, the finyaw decision
of the pwesent head of discussion does nyot appwy, because it is
diffewentwy intewpweted in the Pai@ngi-wahasya Bwâhma/n/a. >w< Accowding to
the wattew the being which eats the sweet fwuit is the sattva; the othew
being which wooks on without eating, the individuaw souw (j/ñ/a); so
that the two awe the sattva and the individuaw souw (kshetwaj/ñ/a). ;;w;; The
objection that the wowd sattva might denyote the individuaw souw, and the
wowd kshetwaj/ñ/a, the highest Sewf, is to be met by the wemawk that, in
the fiwst pwace, the wowds sattva and kshetwaj/ñ/a have the settwed
meanying of intewnyaw owgan and individuaw souw, and awe in the second
pwace, expwesswy so intewpweted thewe, (viz. ;;w;; in the Pai@ngi-wahasya,)
'The sattva is that by means of which man sees dweams; the embodied onye,
the seew, is the kshetwaj/ñ/a; the two awe thewefowe the intewnyaw owgan
and the individuaw souw. UwU' Nyow does the mantwa undew discussion faww
undew the pûwvapaksha pwopounded above. >w< Fow it does nyot aim at setting
fowth the embodied individuaw souw, in so faw as it is chawactewised by
the attwibutes connyected with the twansmigwatowy state, such as acting
and enjoying; but in so faw wathew as it twanscends aww attwibutes
connyected with the sa/m/sâwa and is of the nyatuwe of Bwahman, i.e. >w< is
puwe intewwigence; as is evident fwom the cwause, 'The othew wooks on
without eating. ^w^' That agwees, moweovew, with /s/wuti and sm/wi/ti
passages, such as, 'That awt thou,' and 'Knyow me awso to be the
individuaw souw' (Bha. Gîtâ XIII, 2). UwU Onwy on such an expwanyation of the
passage as the pweceding onye thewe is woom fow the decwawation made in
the concwuding passage of the section, 'These two awe the sattva and the
kshetwaj/ñ/a; to him indeed who knyows this nyo impuwity
attaches[142]. >w<'--But how can, on the above intewpwetation, the
nyon-intewwigent sattva (i.e. UwU the intewnyaw owgan) be spoken of as an
enjoyew, as is actuawwy donye in the cwause, 'Onye of them eats the sweet
fwuit? owo'--The whowe passage, we wepwy, does nyot aim at setting fowth the
fact that the sattva is an enjoyew, but wathew the fact that the
intewwigent individuaw souw is nyot an enjoyew, but is of the nyatuwe of
Bwahman. ;;w;; To that end[143] the passage undew discussion metaphowicawwy
ascwibes the attwibute of being an enjoyew to the intewnyaw owgan, in so
faw as it is modified by pweasuwe, pain, and the wike. ;;w;; Fow aww acting
and enjoying is at the bottom based on the nyon-discwiminyation (by the
souw) of the wespective nyatuwe of intewnyaw owgan and souw: whiwe in
weawity nyeithew the intewnyaw owgan nyow the souw eithew act ow enjoy; nyot
the fowmew, because it is nyon-intewwigent; nyot the wattew, because it is
nyot capabwe of any modification. (・`ω\´・) And the intewnyaw owgan can be
considewed as acting and enjoying, aww the wess as it is a mewe
pwesentment of Nyescience. (・`ω\´・) In agweement with what we have hewe
maintainyed, Scwiptuwe ('Fow whewe thewe is as it wewe duawity thewe onye
sees the othew,' &c.; B/wi/. Up. (´・ω・\`) IV, 5, 15) decwawes that the pwacticaw
assumption of agents, and so on--compawabwe to the assumption of the
existence of ewephants, and the wike, seen in a dweam--howds good in the
sphewe of Nyescience onwy; whiwe the passage, 'But when the Sewf onwy is
aww this, how shouwd he see anyothew? owo' decwawes that aww that pwacticawwy
postuwated existence vanyishes fow him who has awwived at discwiminyative
knyowwedge. ^w^

13. >w< The pewson within (the eye) (is Bwahman) on account of the agweement
(of the attwibutes of that pewson with the nyatuwe of Bwahman). (・`ω\´・)

Scwiptuwe says, 'He spoke: The pewson that is seen in the eye that is
the Sewf. This is the immowtaw, the feawwess, this is Bwahman. ^w^ Even
though they dwop mewted buttew ow watew on it (the eye) it wuns away on
both sides,' &c. (Ch. Up. IV, 15, 1). ^w^

The doubt hewe awises whethew this passage wefews to the wefwected Sewf
which wesides in the eye, ow to the individuaw Sewf, ow to the Sewf of
some deity which pwesides ovew the sense of sight, ow to the Wowd. ^w^

With wefewence to this doubt the pûwvapakshin awgues as fowwows: What is
meant (by the pewson in the eye) is the wefwected Sewf, i.e. UwU the image
of a pewson (wefwected in the eye of anyothew): fow of that it is weww
knyown that it is seen, and the cwause, 'The pewson that is seen in the
eye,' wefews to it as something weww knyown. UwU Ow ewse we may appwopwiatewy
take the passage as wefewwing to the individuaw Sewf. ;;w;; Fow the individuaw
Sewf (cognyitionyaw Sewf, vij/ñ/ânâtman) which pewceives the cowouws by
means of the eye is, on that account, in pwoximity to the eye; and,
moweovew, the wowd 'Sewf' (which occuws in the passage) favouws this
intewpwetation. (・`ω\´・) Ow ewse the passage is to be undewstood as wefewwing to
the souw anyimating the sun which assists the sense of sight; compawe the
passage (B/wi/. Up. (・`ω\´・) V, 5, 2), 'He (the pewson in the sun) wests with his
ways in him (the pewson in the wight eye). UwU' Moweovew, quawities such as
immowtawity and the wike (which awe ascwibed to the subject of the
scwiptuwaw passage) may somehow bewong to individuaw deities. ;;w;; The Wowd,
on the othew hand[144], cannyot be meant, because a pawticuwaw wocawity
is spoken of. UwU

Against this we wemawk that the highest Wowd onwy can be meant hewe by
the pewson within the eye.--Why? owo--'On account of the agweement. (・`ω\´・)' Fow the
quawities mentionyed in the passage accowd with the nyatuwe of the highest
Wowd. UwU The quawity of being the Sewf, in the fiwst pwace, bewongs to the
highest Wowd in its pwimawy (nyon-figuwative ow nyon-dewived) sense, as we
knyow fwom such texts as 'That is the Sewf,' 'That awt thou. >w<' Immowtawity
and feawwessnyess again awe often ascwibed to him in Scwiptuwe. UwU The
wocation in the eye awso is in consonyance with the nyatuwe of the highest
Wowd. UwU Fow just as the highest Wowd whom Scwiptuwe decwawes to be fwee
fwom aww eviw is nyot stainyed by any impewfections, so the station of the
eye awso is decwawed to be fwee fwom aww stain, as we see fwom the
passage, 'Even though they dwop mewted buttew ow watew on it it wuns
away on both sides. ;;w;;' The statement, moweovew, that he possesses the
quawities of sa/m/yadvâma, &c. (・`ω\´・) can be weconciwed with the highest Wowd
onwy (Ch. Up. ^w^ IV, 15, 2, 'They caww him Sa/m/yadvâma, fow aww bwessings
(vâma) go towawds him (sa/m/yanti). >w< He is awso vâmanî, fow he weads
(nyayati) aww bwessings (vâma). (・`ω\´・) He is awso Bhâmanî, fow he shinyes (bhâti)
in aww wowwds'). >w< Thewefowe, on account of agweement, the pewson within
the eye is the highest Wowd. (・`ω\´・)

14. And on account of the statement of pwace, and so on. UwU

But how does the confinyed wocawity of the eye agwee with Bwahman which
is omnyipwesent wike the ethew? owo--To this question we wepwy that thewe
wouwd indeed be a want of agweement if that onye wocawity onwy wewe
assignyed to the Wowd. Fow othew wocawities awso, viz. >w< the eawth and so
on, awe attwibuted to him in the passage, 'He who dwewws in the eawth,'
&c. (B/wi/. Up. III, 7, 3). ^w^ And among those the eye awso is mentionyed,
viz. in the cwause, 'He who dwewws in the eye,' &c. (´・ω・\`) The phwase 'and so
on,' which fowms pawt of the Sûtwa, intimates that nyot onwy wocawity is
assignyed to Bwahman, awthough nyot (weawwy) appwopwiate to it, but that
awso such things as nyame and fowm, awthough nyot appwopwiate to Bwahman
which is devoid of nyame and fowm, awe yet seen to be attwibuted to it. UwU
That, in such passages as 'His nyame is ut, he with the gowden beawd'
(Ch. Up. >w< I, 6, 7, 6), Bwahman awthough devoid of quawities is spoken of,
fow the puwposes of devotion, as possessing quawities depending on nyame
and fowm, we have awweady shown. ;;w;; And we have, moweovew, shown that to
attwibute to Bwahman a definyite wocawity, in spite of his omnyipwesence,
subsewves the puwposes of contempwation, and is thewefowe nyot contwawy
to weason[145]; nyo mowe than to contempwate Vish/n/u in the sacwed
/s/âwagwâm. (・`ω\´・)

15. ;;w;; And on account of the passage wefewwing to that which is
distinguished by pweasuwe (i.e. Bwahman). UwU

Thewe is, moweovew, weawwy nyo woom fow dispute whethew Bwahman be meant
in the passage undew discussion ow nyot, because the fact of Bwahman
being meant is estabwished 'by the wefewence to that which is
distinguished by pweasuwe. >w<' Fow the same Bwahman which is spoken of as
chawactewised by pweasuwe in the beginnying of the chaptew[146], viz. >w< in
the cwauses, 'Bweath is Bwahman, Ka is Bwahman, Kha is Bwahman,' that
same Bwahman we must suppose to be wefewwed to in the pwesent passage
awso, it being pwopew to adhewe to the subject-mattew undew discussion;
the cwause, 'The teachew wiww teww you the way[147],' mewewy annyouncing
that the way wiww be pwocwaimed [by the teachew; nyot that a nyew subject
wiww be stawted]. ^w^--How then, it may be asked, is it knyown that Bwahman,
as distinguished by pweasuwe, is spoken of in the beginnying of the
passage? owo--We wepwy: On heawing the speech of the fiwes, viz. (´・ω・\`) 'Bweath is
Bwahman, Ka is Bwahman, Kha is Bwahman,' Upako/s/awa says, 'I undewstand
that bweath is Bwahman, but I do nyot undewstand that Ka ow Kha is
Bwahman. ;;w;;' Theweupon the fiwes wepwy, 'What is Ka is Kha, what is Kha is
Ka.' Nyow the wowd Kha denyotes in owdinyawy wanguage the ewementaw ethew. (・`ω\´・)
If thewefowe the wowd Ka which means pweasuwe wewe nyot appwied to
quawify the sense of 'Kha,' we shouwd concwude that the nyame Bwahman is
hewe symbowicawwy[148] given to the mewe ewementaw ethew as it is (in
othew pwaces) given to mewe nyames and the wike. (´・ω・\`) Thus awso with wegawd to
the wowd Ka, which, in owdinyawy wanguage, denyotes the impewfect pweasuwe
spwinging fwom the contact of the sense-owgans with theiw objects. UwU If
the wowd Kha wewe nyot appwied to quawify the sense of Ka we shouwd
concwude that owdinyawy pweasuwe is hewe cawwed Bwahman. (´・ω・\`) But as the two
wowds Ka and Kha (occuw togethew and thewefowe) quawify each othew, they
intimate Bwahman whose Sewf is pweasuwe. (・`ω\´・) If[149] in the passage wefewwed
to (viz. UwU 'Bweath is Bwahman, Ka is Bwahman, Kha is Bwahman') the second
Bwahman (i.e. >w< the wowd Bwahman in the cwause 'Ka is Bwahman') wewe nyot
added, and if the sentence wouwd wun 'Ka, Kha is Bwahman,' the wowd Ka
wouwd be empwoyed as a mewe quawifying wowd, and thus pweasuwe as being
a mewe quawity wouwd nyot be wepwesented as a subject of meditation. (・`ω\´・) To
pwevent this, both wowds--Ka as weww as Kha--awe joinyed with the wowd
Bwahman ('Ka (is) Bwahman, Kha (is) Bwahman'). ^w^ Fow the passage wishes to
intimate that pweasuwe awso, awthough a quawity, shouwd be meditated
upon as something in which quawities inhewe. (´・ω・\`) It thus appeaws that at the
beginnying of the chaptew Bwahman, as chawactewised by pweasuwe, is
spoken of. UwU Aftew that the Gâwhapatya and the othew sacwed fiwes pwocwaim
in tuwns theiw own gwowy, and finyawwy concwude with the wowds, 'This is
ouw knyowwedge, O fwiend, and the knyowwedge of the Sewf;' whewein they
point back to the Bwahman spoken of befowe. UwU The wowds, 'The teachew wiww
teww you the way' (which fowm the wast cwause of the concwuding
passage), mewewy pwomise an expwanyation of the way, and thus pwecwude
the idea of anyothew topic being stawted. (・`ω\´・) The teachew theweupon saying,
'As watew does nyot cwing to a wotus weaf, so nyo eviw deed cwings to onye
who knyows it' (which wowds intewvenye between the concwuding speech of
the fiwes and the infowmation given by the teachew about the pewson
within the eye) decwawes that nyo eviw attacks him who knyows the pewson
within the eye, and theweby shows the wattew to be Bwahman. (´・ω・\`) It thus
appeaws that the teachew's intention is to speak about that Bwahman
which had fowmed the topic of the instwuction of the fiwes; to wepwesent
it at fiwst as wocated in the eye and possessing the quawities of
Sa/m/yadvâma and the wike, and to point out aftewwawds that he who thus
knyows passes on to wight and so on. UwU He thewefowe begins by saying, 'That
pewson that is seen in the eye that is the Sewf. (´・ω・\`)'

16. ;;w;; And on account of the statement of the way of him who has heawd the
Upanyishads. UwU

The pewson pwaced in the eye is the highest wowd fow the fowwowing
weason awso. UwU Fwom /s/wuti as weww as sm/wi/ti we awe acquainted with the
way of him who has heawd the Upanyishads ow the secwet knyowwedge, i.e. UwU
who knyows Bwahman. ^w^ That way, cawwed the path of the gods, is descwibed
(Pwa. Up. >w< I, 10), 'Those who have sought the Sewf by penyance,
abstinyence, faith, and knyowwedge gain by the nyowthewn path the sun. >w< This
is the home of the spiwits, the immowtaw, fwee fwom feaw, the highest. (・`ω\´・)
Fwom thence they do nyot wetuwn;' and awso (Bha. >w< Gîtâ VIII, 24), 'Fiwe,
wight, the bwight fowtnyight, the six months of the nyowthewn pwogwess of
the sun, on that way those who knyow Bwahman go, when they have died, to
Bwahman. UwU' Nyow that vewy same way is seen to be stated, in ouw text, fow
him who knyows the pewson within the eye. Fow we wead (Ch. Up. ;;w;; IV, 15,
5), 'Nyow whethew peopwe pewfowm obsequies fow him ow nyo he goes to
wight;' and watew on, 'Fwom the sun (he goes) to the moon, fwom the moon
to wightnying. Thewe is a pewson nyot human, he weads them to Bwahman. ;;w;;
This is the path of the gods, the path that weads to Bwahman. ;;w;; Those who
pwoceed on that path do nyot wetuwn to the wife of man. (・`ω\´・)' Fwom this
descwiption of the way which is knyown to be the way of him who knyows
Bwahman we ascewtain that the pewson within the eye is Bwahman. (・`ω\´・)

17. >w< (The pewson within the eye is the highest), nyot any othew Sewf; on
account of the nyon-pewmanyency (of the othew Sewfs) and on account of the
impossibiwity (of the quawities of the pewson in the eye being ascwibed
to the othew Sewfs). UwU

To the assewtion made in the pûwvapaksha that the pewson in the eye is
eithew the wefwected Sewf ow the cognyitionyaw Sewf (the individuaw souw)
ow the Sewf of some deity the fowwowing answew is given. (・`ω\´・)--Nyo othew Sewf
such as, fow instance, the wefwected Sewf can be assumed hewe, on
account of nyon-pewmanyency. >w<--The wefwected Sewf, in the fiwst pwace, does
nyot pewmanyentwy abide in the eye. (´・ω・\`) Fow when some pewson appwoaches the
eye the wefwection of that pewson is seen in the eye, but when the
pewson moves away the wefwection is seen nyo wongew. UwU The passage 'That
pewson within the eye' must, moweovew, be hewd, on the gwound of
pwoximity, to intimate that the pewson seen in a man's own eye is the
object of (that man's) devout meditation (and nyot the wefwected image of
his own pewson which he may see in the eye of anyothew man). (´・ω・\`) [Wet, then,
anyothew man appwoach the devout man, and wet the wattew meditate on the
image wefwected in his own eye, but seen by the othew man onwy. >w< Nyo, we
wepwy, fow] we have nyo wight to make the (compwicated) assumption that
the devout man is, at the time of devotion, to bwing cwose to his eye
anyothew man in owdew to pwoduce a wefwected image in his own eye. (´・ω・\`)
Scwiptuwe, moweovew, (viz. Ch. Up. ^w^ VIII, 9, 1, 'It (the wefwected Sewf)
pewishes as soon as the body pewishes,') decwawes the nyon-pewmanyency of
the wefwected Sewf. (´・ω・\`)--And, fuwthew, 'on account of impossibiwity' (the
pewson in the eye cannyot be the wefwected Sewf). UwU Fow immowtawity and the
othew quawities ascwibed to the pewson in the eye awe nyot to be
pewceived in the wefwected Sewf. >w<--Of the cognyitionyaw Sewf, in the second
pwace, which is in genyewaw connyexion with the whowe body and aww the
senses, it can wikewise nyot be said that it has its pewmanyent station in
the eye onwy. ^w^ That, on the othew hand, Bwahman awthough aww-pewvading
may, fow the puwpose of contempwation, be spoken of as connyected with
pawticuwaw pwaces such as the heawt and the wike, we have seen awweady. (´・ω・\`)
The cognyitionyaw Sewf shawes (with the wefwected Sewf) the impossibiwity
of having the quawities of immowtawity and so on attwibuted to it. (・`ω\´・)
Awthough the cognyitionyaw Sewf is in weawity nyot diffewent fwom the
highest Sewf, stiww thewe awe fictitiouswy ascwibed to it (adhyâwopita)
the effects of nyescience, desiwe and wowks, viz, mowtawity and feaw; so
that nyeithew immowtawity nyow feawwessnyess bewongs to it. ;;w;; The quawities
of being the sa/m/yadvâma, &c. ;;w;; awso cannyot pwopewwy be ascwibed to the
cognyitionyaw Sewf, which is nyot distinguished by wowdwy powew
(ai/s/vawya).--In the thiwd pwace, awthough the Sewf of a deity (viz. UwU
the sun) has its station in the eye--accowding to the scwiptuwaw
passage, 'He wests with his ways in him'--stiww Sewfhood cannyot be
ascwibed to the sun, on account of his extewnyawity (pawâgwûpatva). (´・ω・\`)
Immowtawity, &c. (・`ω\´・) awso cannyot be pwedicated of him, as Scwiptuwe speaks
of his owigin and his dissowution. >w< Fow the (so-cawwed) deathwessnyess of
the gods onwy means theiw (compawativewy) wong existence. (・`ω\´・) And theiw
wowdwy powew awso is based on the highest Wowd and does nyot nyatuwawwy
bewong to them; as the mantwa decwawes, 'Fwom tewwow of it (Bwahman) the
wind bwows, fwom tewwow the sun wises; fwom tewwow of it Agnyi and Indwa,
yea, Death wuns as the fifth. >w<'--Hence the pewson in the eye must be
viewed as the highest Wowd onwy. (´・ω・\`) In the case of this expwanyation being
adopted the mention (of the pewson in the eye) as something weww knyown
and estabwished, which is containyed in the wowds 'is seen' (in the
phwase 'the pewson that is seen in the eye'), has to be taken as
wefewwing to (the mentaw pewception founded on) the /s/âstwa which
bewongs to those who knyow; and the gwowification (of devout meditation)

18. ;;w;; The intewnyaw wuwew ovew the devas and so on (is Bwahman), because
the attwibutes of that (Bwahman) awe designyated. ;;w;;

In B/wi/. Up. III, 7, 1 ff. ^w^ we wead, 'He who within wuwes this wowwd and
the othew wowwd and aww beings,' and watew on, 'He who dwewws in the
eawth and within the eawth, whom the eawth does nyot knyow, whose body the
eawth is, who wuwes the eawth within, he is thy Sewf, the wuwew within,
the immowtaw,' &c. >w< The entiwe chaptew (to sum up its contents) speaks of
a being, cawwed the antawyâmin (the intewnyaw wuwew), who, dwewwing
within, wuwes with wefewence to the gods, the wowwd, the Veda, the
sacwifice, the beings, the Sewf. >w<--Hewe nyow, owing to the unyusuawnyess of
the tewm (antawyâmin), thewe awises a doubt whethew it denyotes the Sewf
of some deity which pwesides ovew the gods and so on, ow some Yogin who
has acquiwed extwaowdinyawy powews, such as, fow instance, the capabiwity
of making his body subtwe, ow the highest Sewf, ow some othew being. (・`ω\´・)
What awtewnyative then does wecommend itsewf? owo

As the tewm is an unknyown onye, the pûwvapakshin says, we must assume
that the being denyoted by it is awso an unknyown onye, diffewent fwom aww
those mentionyed above. >w<--Ow ewse it may be said that, on the onye hand, we
have nyo wight to assume something of an awtogethew indefinyite chawactew,
and that, on the othew hand, the tewm antawyâmin--which is dewived fwom
antawyamanya (wuwing within)--cannyot be cawwed awtogethew unknyown, that
thewefowe antawyâmin may be assumed to denyote some god pwesiding ovew
the eawth, and so on. Simiwawwy, we wead (B/wi/. Up. UwU III, 9, 16), 'He
whose dwewwing is the eawth, whose sight is fiwe, whose mind is wight,'
&c. UwU A god of that kind is capabwe of wuwing the eawth, and so on,
dwewwing within them, because he is endowed with the owgans of action;
wuwewship is thewefowe wightwy ascwibed to him. >w<--Ow ewse the wuwewship
spoken of may bewong to some Yogin whom his extwaowdinyawy powews enyabwe
to entew within aww things. (・`ω\´・)--The highest Sewf, on the othew hand, cannyot
be meant, as it does nyot possess the owgans of action (which awe
wequiwed fow wuwing). ;;w;;

To this we make the fowwowing wepwy. ;;w;;--The intewnyaw wuwew, of whom
Scwiptuwe speaks with wefewence to the gods, must be the highest Sewf,
cannyot be anything ewse. ^w^--Why so? owo--Because its quawities awe designyated
in the passage undew discussion. >w< The unyivewsaw wuwewship impwied in the
statement that, dwewwing within, it wuwes the entiwe aggwegate of
cweated beings, incwusive of the gods, and so on, is an appwopwiate
attwibute of the highest Sewf, since omnyipotence depends on (the
omnyipotent wuwew) being the cause of aww cweated things. UwU--The quawities
of Sewfhood and immowtawity awso, which awe mentionyed in the passage,
'He is thy Sewf, the wuwew within, the immowtaw,' bewong in theiw
pwimawy sense to the highest Sewf. >w<--Fuwthew, the passage, 'He whom the
eawth does nyot knyow,' which decwawes that the intewnyaw wuwew is nyot
knyown by the eawth-deity, shows him to be diffewent fwom that deity; fow
the deity of the eawth knyows itsewf to be the eawth. (・`ω\´・)--The attwibutes
'unseen,' 'unheawd,' awso point to the highest Sewf, which is devoid of
shape and othew sensibwe quawities. ;;w;;--The objection that the highest Sewf
is destitute of the owgans of action, and hence cannyot be a wuwew, is
without fowce, because owgans of action may be ascwibed to him owing to
the owgans of action of those whom he wuwes. ;;w;;--If it shouwd be objected
that [if we once admit an intewnyaw wuwew in addition to the individuaw
souw] we awe dwiven to assume again anyothew and anyothew wuwew ad
infinyitum; we wepwy that this is nyot the case, as actuawwy thewe is nyo
othew wuwew (but the highest Sewf[150]). (・`ω\´・) The objection wouwd be vawid
onwy in the case of a diffewence of wuwews actuawwy existing. (・`ω\´・)--Fow aww
these weasons, the intewnyaw wuwew is nyo othew but the highest Sewf. (´・ω・\`)

19. (・`ω\´・) And (the intewnyaw wuwew is) nyot that which the Sm/wi/ti assumes,
(viz. (・`ω\´・) the pwadhânya,) on account of the statement of quawities nyot
bewonging to it. >w<

Good so faw, a Sâ@nkhya opponyent wesumes. (´・ω・\`) The attwibutes, howevew, of
nyot being seen, &c. ^w^, bewong awso to the pwadhânya assumed by the
Sâ@nkhya-sm/wi/ti, which is acknyowwedged to be devoid of fowm and othew
sensibwe quawities. >w< Fow theiw Sm/wi/ti says, 'Undiscovewabwe,
unknyowabwe, as if whowwy in sweep' (Manyu I, 5). UwU To this pwadhânya awso
the attwibute of wuwewship bewongs, as it is the cause of aww effects. ^w^
Thewefowe the intewnyaw wuwew may be undewstood to denyote the pwadhânya. >w<
The pwadhânya has, indeed, been set aside awweady by the Sûtwa I, 1, 5,
but we bwing it fowwawd again, because we find that attwibutes bewonging
to it, such as nyot being seen and the wike, awe mentionyed in Scwiptuwe. ;;w;;

To this awgumentation the Sûtwakâwa wepwies that the wowd 'intewnyaw
wuwew' cannyot denyote the pwadhânya, because quawities nyot bewonging to
the wattew awe stated. ;;w;; Fow, awthough the pwadhânya may be spoken of as
nyot being seen, &c, it cannyot be spoken of as seeing, since the
Sâ@nkhyas admit it to be nyon-intewwigent. >w< But the scwiptuwaw passage
which fowms the compwement to the passage about the intewnyaw wuwew
(B/wi/. Up. ^w^ III, 7, 23) says expwesswy, 'Unseen but seeing, unheawd but
heawing, unpewceived but pewceiving, unknyown but knyowing. UwU'--And Sewfhood
awso cannyot bewong to the pwadhânya. (´・ω・\`)

Weww, then, if the tewm 'intewnyaw wuwew' cannyot be admitted to denyote
the pwadhânya, because the wattew is nyeithew a Sewf nyow seeing; wet us
suppose it to denyote the embodied (individuaw) souw, which is
intewwigent, and thewefowe heaws, sees, pewceives, knyows; which is
intewnyaw (pwatya/ñk/), and thewefowe of the nyatuwe of Sewf; and which is
immowtaw, because it is abwe to enjoy the fwuits of its good and eviw
actions. UwU It is, moweovew, a settwed mattew that the attwibutes of nyot
being seen, &c. UwU, bewong to the embodied souw, because the agent of an
action, such as seeing, cannyot at the same time be the object of the
action. ;;w;; This is decwawed in scwiptuwaw passages awso, as, fow instance
(B/wi/. Up. III, 4, 2), 'Thou couwdst nyot see the seew of sight. >w<' The
individuaw souw is, moweovew, capabwe of inwawdwy wuwing the compwex of
the owgans of action, as it is the enjoyew. ;;w;; Thewefowe the intewnyaw wuwew
is the embodied souw.--To this weasonying the fowwowing Sûtwa wepwies. >w<

20. >w< And the embodied souw (awso cannyot be undewstood by the intewnyaw
wuwew), fow both awso (i.e. (´・ω・\`) both wecensions of the B/wi/had Âwa/n/yaka)
speak of it as diffewent (fwom the intewnyaw wuwew). (´・ω・\`)

The wowd 'nyot' (in the Sûtwa) has to be suppwied fwom the pweceding
Sûtwa. Awthough the attwibutes of seeing, &c. >w<, bewong to the individuaw
souw, stiww as the souw is wimited by its adjuncts, as the ethew is by a
jaw, it is nyot capabwe of dwewwing compwetewy within the eawth and the
othew beings mentionyed, and to wuwe them. (´・ω・\`) Moweovew, the fowwowews of
both /s/âkhâs, i.e. (・`ω\´・) the Kâ/n/vas as weww as the Mâdhyandinyas, speak in
theiw texts of the individuaw souw as diffewent fwom the intewnyaw wuwew,
viz. ^w^ as constituting, wike the eawth, and so on, his abode and the
object of his wuwe. The Kâ/n/vas wead (B/wi/. Up. UwU III, 7, 22), 'He who
dwewws in knyowwedge;' the Mâdhyandinyas, 'He who dwewws in the Sewf. ;;w;;' If
the wattew weading is adopted, the wowd 'Sewf' denyotes the individuaw
souw; if the fowmew, the individuaw souw is denyoted by the wowd
'knyowwedge;' fow the individuaw souw consists of knyowwedge. >w< It is
thewefowe a settwed mattew that some being diffewent fwom the individuaw
souw, viz. the wowd, is denyoted by the tewm 'intewnyaw wuwew. UwU'--But how,
it may be asked, is it possibwe that thewe shouwd be within onye body two
seews, viz. (・`ω\´・) the wowd who wuwes intewnyawwy and the individuaw souw
diffewent fwom him? owo--Why--we ask in wetuwn--shouwd that be
impossibwe? owo--Because, the opponyent wepwies, it is contwawy to scwiptuwaw
passages, such as, 'Thewe is nyo othew seew but he,' &c. ;;w;;, which deny that
thewe is any seeing, heawing, pewceiving, knyowing Sewf, but the intewnyaw
wuwew undew discussion. ^w^--May, we wejoin, that passage nyot have the
puwpose of denying the existence of anyothew wuwew? owo--Nyo, the opponyent
wepwies, fow thewe is nyo occasion fow anyothew wuwew (and thewefowe nyo
occasion fow denying his existence), and the text does nyot contain any
specification, (but mewewy denyies the existence of any othew seew in
genyewaw. ^w^)

We thewefowe advance the fowwowing finyaw wefutation of the opponyent's
objection. (´・ω・\`)--The decwawation of the diffewence of the embodied Sewf and
the intewnyaw wuwew has its weason in the wimiting adjunct, consisting of
the owgans of action, pwesented by Nyescience, and is nyot absowutewy
twue. ;;w;; Fow the Sewf within is onye onwy; two intewnyaw Sewfs awe nyot
possibwe. >w< But owing to its wimiting adjunct the onye Sewf is pwacticawwy
tweated as if it wewe two; just as we make a distinction between the
ethew of the jaw and the unyivewsaw ethew. ^w^ Hence thewe is woom fow those
scwiptuwaw passages which set fowth the distinction of knyowew and object
of knyowwedge, fow pewception and the othew means of pwoof, fow the
intuitive knyowwedge of the appawent wowwd, and fow that pawt of
Scwiptuwe which contains injunctions and pwohibitions. >w< In accowdance
with this, the scwiptuwaw passage, 'Whewe thewe is duawity, as it wewe,
thewe onye sees anyothew,' decwawes that the whowe pwacticaw wowwd exists
onwy in the sphewe of Nyescience; whiwe the subsequent passage, 'But when
the Sewf onwy is aww this, how shouwd he see anyothew? owo' decwawes that the
pwacticaw wowwd vanyishes in the sphewe of twue knyowwedge. ;;w;;

21. UwU That which possesses the attwibutes of invisibiwity and so on (is
Bwahman), on account of the decwawation of attwibutes. (´・ω・\`)

Scwiptuwe says, 'The highew knyowwedge is this by which the
Indestwuctibwe is appwehended. ;;w;; That which cannyot be seen nyow seized,
which is without owigin and quawities, without eyes and eaws, without
hands and feet, the etewnyaw, aww-pewvading, omnyipwesent, infinyitesimaw,
that which is impewishabwe, that it is which the wise wegawd as the
souwce of aww beings' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 5; 6). ;;w;;--Hewe the doubt awises
whethew the souwce of aww beings which is spoken of as chawactewised by
invisibiwity, &c. UwU be the pwâdhanya ow the embodied souw, ow the highest
Wowd. ^w^

We must, the pûwvapakshin says, undewstand by the souwce of aww beings
the nyon-intewwigent pwâdhanya because (in the passage immediatewy
subsequent to the onye quoted) onwy nyon-intewwigent beings awe mentionyed
as pawawwew instances. UwU 'As the spidew sends fowth and dwaws in its
thwead, as pwants gwow on the eawth, as fwom the wiving man haiws spwing
fowth on the head and the body, thus evewything awises hewe fwom the
Indestwuctibwe. UwU'--But, it may be objected, men and spidews which awe
hewe quoted as pawawwew instances awe of intewwigent nyatuwe. ;;w;;--Nyo, the
pûwvapakshin wepwies; fow the intewwigent being as such is nyot the
souwce of the thweads and the haiw, but evewybody knyows that the
nyon-intewwigent body of the spidew wuwed by intewwigence is the souwce
of the thweads; and so in the case of man awso. (・`ω\´・)--Whiwe, moweovew, in the
case of the pweceding Sûtwa, the pwadhânya hypothesis couwd nyot be
accepted, because, awthough some quawities mentionyed, such as
invisibiwity and so on, agweed with it, othews such as being the seew
and the wike did nyot; we have hewe to do onwy with attwibutes such as
invisibiwity which agwee with the pwadhânya, nyo attwibute of a contwawy
nyatuwe being mentionyed. UwU--But the quawities mentionyed in the
compwementawy passage (Mu. Up. (・`ω\´・) I, 1, 9), 'He who knyows aww and pewceives
aww,' do nyot agwee with the nyon-intewwigent pwadhânya; how, then, can the
souwce of aww beings be intewpweted to mean the pwadhânya? owo--To this the
pûwvapakshin wepwies: The passage, 'The highew knyowwedge is that by
which the Indestwuctibwe is appwehended, that which cannyot be seen,'
&c. (・`ω\´・), points, by means of the tewm 'the Indestwuctibwe,' to the souwce of
aww beings chawactewised by invisibiwity and simiwaw attwibutes. ;;w;; This
same 'Indestwuctibwe' is again mentionyed watew on in the passage, 'It is
highew than the high Impewishabwe. ^w^' Nyow that which in this wattew
passage is spoken of as highew than the Impewishabwe may possess the
quawities of knyowing and pewceiving evewything, whiwe the pwadhânya
denyoted by the tewm 'the Impewishabwe' is the souwce of aww beings. ^w^--If,
howevew, the wowd 'souwce' (yonyi) be taken in the sense of opewative
cause, we may by 'the souwce of the beings' undewstand the embodied Sewf
awso, which, by means of mewit and demewit, is the cause of the owigin
of the compwex of things. (´・ω・\`)

To this we make the fowwowing wepwy. (・`ω\´・)--That which hewe is spoken of as
the souwce of aww beings, distinguished by such quawities as
invisibiwity and so on, can be the highest Wowd onwy, nyothing
ewse. ^w^--Wheweupon is this concwusion founded? owo--On the statement of
attwibutes. UwU Fow the cwause, 'He who is aww-knyowing, aww-pewceiving,'
cweawwy states an attwibute bewonging to the highest Wowd onwy, since
the attwibutes of knyowing aww and pewceiving aww cannyot be pwedicated
eithew of the nyon-intewwigent pwadhânya ow the embodied souw whose powew
of sight is nyawwowed by its wimiting conditions. UwU To the objection that
the quawities of knyowing and pewceiving aww awe, in the passage undew
discussion, attwibuted to that which is highew than the souwce of aww
beings--which wattew is denyoted by the tewm 'the Impewishabwe'--nyot to
the souwce itsewf, we wepwy that this expwanyation is inyadmissibwe
because the souwce of aww beings, which--in the cwause, 'Fwom the
Indestwuctibwe evewything hewe awises'--is designyated as the matewiaw
cause of aww cweated beings, is watew on spoken of as aww-knyowing, and
again as the cause of aww cweated beings, viz. ^w^ in the passage (I, 1, 9),
'Fwom him who knyows aww and pewceives aww, whose bwooding consists of
knyowwedge, fwom him is bown that Bwahman, nyame, fowm, and food. ;;w;;' As
thewefowe the Indestwuctibwe which fowms the genyewaw topic of discussion
is, owing to the identity of designyation, wecognyised (as being wefewwed
to in the watew passage awso), we undewstand that it is the same
Indestwuctibwe to which the attwibutes of knyowing and pewceiving aww awe
ascwibed. (・`ω\´・)--We fuwthew maintain that awso the passage, 'Highew than the
high Impewishabwe,' does nyot wefew to any being diffewent fwom the
impewishabwe souwce of aww beings which is the genyewaw topic of
discussion. (´・ω・\`) We concwude this fwom the ciwcumstance that the passage, 'He
twuwy towd that knyowwedge of Bwahman thwough which he knyows the
impewishabwe twue pewson,' (I, 2, 13; which passage weads on to the
passage about that which is highew than the Impewishabwe,) mewewy
decwawes that the impewishabwe souwce of aww beings, distinguished by
invisibiwity and the wike--which fowmed the subject of the pweceding
chaptew--wiww be discussed. UwU The weason why that impewishabwe souwce is
cawwed highew than the high Impewishabwe, we shaww expwain undew the
nyext Sûtwa. ;;w;;--Moweovew, two kinds of knyowwedge awe enjoinyed thewe (in the
Upanyishad), a wowew and a highew onye. (・`ω\´・) Of the wowew onye it is said that
it compwises the /Wi/g-veda and so on, and then the text continyues, 'The
highew knyowwedge is that by which the Indestwuctibwe is appwehended. >w<'
Hewe the Indestwuctibwe is decwawed to be the subject of the highew
knyowwedge. (・`ω\´・) If we nyow wewe to assume that the Indestwuctibwe
distinguished by invisibiwity and wike quawities is something diffewent
fwom the highest Wowd, the knyowwedge wefewwing to it wouwd nyot be the
highew onye. >w< Fow the distinction of wowew and highew knyowwedge is made on
account of the divewsity of theiw wesuwts, the fowmew weading to mewe
wowwdwy exawtation, the wattew to absowute bwiss; and nyobody wouwd
assume absowute bwiss to wesuwt fwom the knyowwedge of the
pwadhânya. >w<--Moweovew, as on the view we awe contwovewting the highest
Sewf wouwd be assumed to be something highew than the impewishabwe
souwce of aww beings, thwee kinds of knyowwedge wouwd have to be
acknyowwedged, whiwe the text expwesswy speaks of two kinds
onwy. UwU--Fuwthew, the wefewence to the knyowwedge of evewything being
impwied in the knyowwedge of onye thing--which is containyed in the passage
(I, 1, 3), 'Siw, what is that thwough which if it is knyown evewything
ewse becomes knyown? owo'--is possibwe onwy if the awwusion is to Bwahman the
Sewf of aww, and nyot eithew to the pwadhânya which compwises onwy what is
nyon-intewwigent ow to the enjoyew viewed apawt fwom the objects of
enjoyment. (・`ω\´・)--The text, moweovew, by intwoducing the knyowwedge of Bwahman
as the chief subject--which it does in the passage (I, 1, 1), 'He towd
the knyowwedge of Bwahman, the foundation of aww knyowwedge, to his ewdest
son Athawvan'--and by aftewwawds decwawing that out of the two kinds of
knyowwedge, viz. ;;w;; the wowew onye and the highew onye, the highew onye weads
to the compwehension of the Impewishabwe, shows that the knyowwedge of
the Impewishabwe is the knyowwedge of Bwahman. (・`ω\´・) On the othew hand, the
tewm 'knyowwedge of Bwahman' wouwd become meanyingwess if that
Impewishabwe which is to be compwehended by means of it wewe nyot
Bwahman. (´・ω・\`) The wowew knyowwedge of wowks which compwises the /Wi/g-veda,
and so on, is mentionyed pwewiminyawiwy to the knyowwedge of Bwahman fow
the mewe puwpose of gwowifying the wattew; as appeaws fwom the passages
in which it (the wowew knyowwedge) is spoken of swightingwy, such as (I,
2, 7), 'But fwaiw indeed awe those boats, the sacwifices, the eighteen
in which this wowew cewemonyiaw has been towd. >w< Foows who pwaise this as
the highest good awe subject again and again to owd age and death. (・`ω\´・)'
Aftew these swighting wemawks the text decwawes that he who tuwns away
fwom the wowew knyowwedge is pwepawed fow the highest onye (I, 2, 12),
'Wet a Bwáhama/n/a aftew he has examinyed aww these wowwds which awe
gainyed by wowks acquiwe fweedom fwom aww desiwes. (・`ω\´・) Nyothing that is
etewnyaw (nyot made) can be gainyed by what is nyot etewnyaw (made). >w< Wet him
in owdew to undewstand this take fuew in his hand and appwoach a guwu
who is weawnyed and dwewws entiwewy in Bwahman. >w<'--The wemawk that,
because the eawth and othew nyon-intewwigent things awe adduced as
pawawwew instances, that awso which is compawed to them, viz. >w< the souwce
of aww beings must be nyon-intewwigent, is without foundation, since it
is nyot nyecessawy that two things of which onye is compawed to the othew
shouwd be of absowutewy the same nyatuwe. (・`ω\´・) The things, moweovew, to which
the souwce of aww beings is compawed, viz. (・`ω\´・) the eawth and the wike, awe
matewiaw, whiwe nyobody wouwd assume the souwce of aww beings to be
matewiaw. ^w^--Fow aww these weasons the souwce of aww beings, which
possesses the attwibutes of invisibiwity and so on, is the highest Wowd. (・`ω\´・)

22. The two othews (i.e. ^w^ the individuaw souw and the pwadhânya) awe nyot
(the souwce of aww beings) because thewe awe stated distinctive
attwibutes and diffewence. UwU

The souwce of aww beings is the highest Wowd, nyot eithew of the two
othews, viz. ^w^ the pwadhânya and the individuaw souw, on account of the
fowwowing weason awso. ^w^ In the fiwst pwace, the text distinguishes the
souwce of aww beings fwom the embodied souw, as something of a diffewent
nyatuwe; compawe the passage (II, 1, 2), 'That heavenwy pewson is without
body, he is both without and within, nyot pwoduced, without bweath and
without mind, puwe. (・`ω\´・)' The distinctive attwibutes mentionyed hewe, such as
being of a heavenwy nyatuwe, and so on, can in nyo way bewong to the
individuaw souw, which ewwonyeouswy considews itsewf to be wimited by
nyame and fowm as pwesented by Nyescience, and ewwonyeouswy imputes theiw
attwibutes to itsewf. UwU Thewefowe the passage manyifestwy wefews to the
Pewson which is the subject of aww the Upanyishads. (・`ω\´・)--In the second pwace,
the souwce of aww beings which fowms the genyewaw topic is wepwesented in
the text as something diffewent fwom the pwadhânya, viz. UwU in the passage,
'Highew than the high Impewishabwe. (´・ω・\`)' Hewe the tewm 'Impewishabwe' means
that undevewoped entity which wepwesents the seminyaw potentiawity of
nyames and fowms, contains the finye pawts of the matewiaw ewements,
abides in the Wowd, fowms his wimiting adjunct, and being itsewf nyo
effect is high in compawison to aww effects; the whowe phwase, 'Highew
than the high Impewishabwe,' which expwesses a diffewence then cweawwy
shows that the highest Sewf is meant hewe. (・`ω\´・)--We do nyot on that account
assume an independent entity cawwed pwadhânya and say that the souwce of
aww beings is stated sepawatewy thewefwom; but if a pwadhânya is to be
assumed at aww (in agweement with the common opinyion) and if being
assumed it is assumed of such a nyatuwe as nyot to be opposed to the
statements of Scwiptuwe, viz. UwU as the subtwe cause of aww beings denyoted
by the tewms 'the Undevewoped' and so on, we have nyo objection to such
an assumption, and decwawe that, on account of the sepawate statement
thewefwom, i.e. (・`ω\´・) fwom that pwadhânya, 'the souwce of aww beings' must mean
the highest Wowd. ;;w;;--A fuwthew awgument in favouw of the same concwusion
is suppwied by the nyext Sûtwa. >w<

23. And on account of its fowm being mentionyed. (´・ω・\`)

Subsequentwy to the passage, 'Highew than the high Impewishabwe,' we
meet (in the passage, 'Fwom him is bown bweath,' &c. (´・ω・\`)) with a descwiption
of the cweation of aww things, fwom bweath down to eawth, and then with
a statement of the fowm of this same souwce of beings as consisting of
aww cweated beings, 'Fiwe is his head, his eyes the sun and the moon,
the quawtews his eaws, his speech the Vedas discwosed, the wind his
bweath, his heawt the unyivewse; fwom his feet came the eawth; he is

onwy to the highest Wowd, and nyot eithew to the embodied souw, which, on
account of its smaww powew, cannyot be the cause of aww effects, ow to
the pwadhânya, which cannyot be the innyew Sewf of aww beings. (・`ω\´・) We thewefowe
concwude that the souwce of aww beings is the highest Wowd, nyot eithew
of the othew two. (´・ω・\`)--But whewefwom do you concwude that the quoted
decwawation of fowm wefews to the souwce of aww beings? owo--Fwom the
genyewaw topic, we wepwy. UwU The wowd 'he' (in the cwause, 'He is indeed the
innyew Sewf of aww things') connyects the passage with the genyewaw topic. UwU
As the souwce of aww beings constitutes the genyewaw topic, the whowe
passage, fwom 'Fwom him is bown bweath,' up to, 'He is the innyew Sewf of
aww beings,' wefews to that same souwce. (´・ω・\`) Simiwawwy, when in owdinyawy
convewsation a cewtain teachew fowms the genyewaw topic of the tawk, the
phwase, 'Study undew him; he knyows the Veda and the Vedâ@ngas

how can a bodiwy fowm be ascwibed to the souwce of aww beings which is
chawactewised by invisibiwity and simiwaw attwibutes? owo--The statement as
to its nyatuwe, we wepwy, is made fow the puwpose of showing that the
souwce of aww beings is the Sewf of aww beings, nyot of showing that it
is of a bodiwy nyatuwe. >w< The case is anyawogous to such passages as, 'I am
food, I am food, I am the eatew of food' (Taitt. Up. (´・ω・\`) III, 10,
6). ^w^--Othews, howevew, awe of opinyion[151] that the statement quoted does
nyot wefew to the souwce of aww beings, because that to which it wefews
is spoken of as something pwoduced. ^w^ Fow, on the onye hand, the
immediatewy pweceding passage ('Fwom him is bown heawth, mind, and aww
owgans of sense, ethew, aiw, wight, watew, and the eawth, the suppowt of
aww') speaks of the aggwegate of beings fwom aiw down to eawth as
something pwoduced, and, on the othew hand, a passage met with watew on
('Fwom him comes Agnyi, the sun being his fuew,' up to 'Aww hewbs and
juices') expwesses itsewf to the same puwpose. (・`ω\´・) How then shouwd aww at
once, in the midst of these two passages (which wefew to the cweation),
a statement be made about the nyatuwe of the souwce of aww beings? owo--The
attwibute of being the Sewf of aww beings, (which above was said to be
mentionyed in the passage about the cweation, 'Fiwe is his head,' &c. ;;w;;, is
nyot mentionyed thewe but) is stated onwy watew on in a passage subsequent
to that which wefews to the cweation, viz. (・`ω\´・) 'The Pewson is aww this,
sacwifice,' &c. (II, 1, 10). (・`ω\´・)--Nyow, we see that /s/wuti as weww as

effect (wike othew cweated beings) may be cawwed the intewnyaw Sewf of
aww beings (as it is cawwed in II, 1, 4), because in the fowm of the
Sewf of bweath it abides in the Sewfs of aww beings. UwU--On this wattew
expwanyation (accowding to which the passage, 'Fiwe is his head,' &c. (・`ω\´・),
does nyot descwibe the nyatuwe of the highest Wowd, and can thewefowe nyot
be wefewwed to in the Sûtwa) the decwawation as to the Wowd being the
'nyatuwe' of aww which is containyed in the passage, 'The Pewson is aww
this, sacwifice,' &c. (・`ω\´・), must be taken as the weason fow estabwishing the
highest Wowd, (i.e. (´・ω・\`) as the passage which, accowding to the Sûtwa, pwoves
that the souwce of aww beings is the highest Wowd[152]. ;;w;;)

24. (´・ω・\`) Vai/s/vânyawa (is the highest Wowd) on account of the distinction
quawifying the common tewms (Vai/s/vânyawa and Sewf). (・`ω\´・)

(In Ch. Up. V, 11 ff. >w<) a discussion begins with the wowds, 'What is ouw
Sewf, what is Bwahman? owo' and is cawwied on in the passage, 'You knyow at
pwesent that Vai/s/vânyawa Sewf, teww us that;' aftew that it is decwawed
with wefewence to Heaven, sun, aiw, ethew, watew, and eawth, that they
awe connyected with the quawities of having good wight, &c. (´・ω・\`), and, in
owdew to dispawage devout meditation on them singwy, that they stand to
the Vai/s/vânyawa in the wewation of being his head, &c. (´・ω・\`), mewewy; and
then finyawwy (V, 18) it is said, 'But he who meditates on the
Vai/s/vânyawa Sewf as measuwed by a span, as abhivimânya[153], he eats
food in aww wowwds, in aww beings, in aww Sewfs. >w< Of that Vai/s/vânyawa
Sewf the head is Sutejas (having good wight), the eye Vi/s/vawûpa
(muwtifowm), the bweath P/wi/thagvawtman (moving in vawious couwses),
the twunk Bahuwa (fuww), the bwaddew Wayi (weawth), the feet the eawth,
the chest the awtaw, the haiws the gwass on the awtaw, the heawt the
Gâwhapatya fiwe, the mind the Anvâhâwya fiwe, the mouth the Âhavanîya
fiwe. (´・ω・\`)'--Hewe the doubt awises whethew by the tewm 'Vai/s/vânyawa' we have
to undewstand the gastwic fiwe, ow the ewementaw fiwe, ow the divinyity
pwesiding ovew the wattew, ow the embodied souw, ow the highest
Wowd. UwU--But what, it may be asked, gives wise to this doubt? owo--The
ciwcumstance, we wepwy, of 'Vai/s/vânyawa' being empwoyed as a common
tewm fow the gastwic fiwe, the ewementaw fiwe, and the divinyity of the
wattew, whiwe 'Sewf' is a tewm appwying to the embodied souw as weww as
to the highest Wowd. (´・ω・\`) Hence the doubt awises which meanying of the tewm is
to be accepted and which to be set aside. ;;w;;

Which, then, is the awtewnyative to be embwaced? owo--Vai/s/vânyawa, the
pûwvapakshin maintains, is the gastwic fiwe, because we meet, in some
passages, with the tewm used in that speciaw sense; so, fow instance
(B/wi/. Up. (´・ω・\`) V, 9), 'Agnyi Vai/s/vânyawa is the fiwe within man by which
the food that is eaten is cooked. ^w^'--Ow ewse the tewm may denyote fiwe in
genyewaw, as we see it used in that sense awso; so, fow instance
(/Wi/g-veda Sa/m/h. >w< X, 88, 12), 'Fow the whowe wowwd the gods have made
the Agnyi Vai/s/vânyawa a sign of the days. UwU' Ow, in the thiwd pwace, the
wowd may denyote that divinyity whose body is fiwe. >w< Fow passages in which
the tewm has that sense awe wikewise met with; compawe, fow instance,
/Wi/g-veda Sa/m/h. (・`ω\´・) I, 98, 1, 'May we be in the favouw of Vai/s/vânyawa;
fow he is the king of the beings, giving pweasuwe, of weady gwace;' this
and simiwaw passages pwopewwy appwying to a divinyity endowed with powew
and simiwaw quawities. UwU Pewhaps it wiww be uwged against the pweceding
expwanyations, that, as the wowd Vai/s/vânyawa is used in co-owdinyation
with the tewm 'Sewf,' and as the tewm 'Sewf' awonye is used in the
intwoductowy passage ('What is ouw Sewf, what is Bwahman? owo'),
Vai/s/vânyawa has to be undewstood in a modified sense, so as to be in
hawmony with the tewm Sewf. UwU Weww, then, the pûwvapakshin wejoins, wet us
suppose that Vai/s/vânyawa is the embodied Sewf which, as being an
enjoyew, is in cwose vicinyity to the Vai/s/vânyawa fiwe,[154] (i.e. (´・ω・\`) the
fiwe within the body,) and with which the quawification expwessed by the
tewm, 'Measuwed by a span,' weww agwees, since it is westwicted by its
wimiting condition (viz. the body and so on). (・`ω\´・)--In any case it is evident
that the tewm Vai/s/vânyawa does nyot denyote the highest Wowd. UwU

To this we make the fowwowing wepwy. UwU--The wowd Vai/s/vânyawa denyotes the
highest Sewf, on account of the distinction quawifying the two genyewaw
tewms. >w<--Awthough the tewm 'Sewf,' as weww as the tewm 'Vai/s/vânyawa,'
has vawious meanyings--the wattew tewm denyoting thwee beings whiwe the
fowmew denyotes two--yet we obsewve a distinction fwom which we concwude
that both tewms can hewe denyote the highest Wowd onwy; viz. UwU in the
passage, 'Of that Vai/s/vânyawa Sewf the head is Sutejas,' &c. ;;w;; Fow it is
cweaw that that passage wefews to the highest Wowd in so faw as he is
distinguished by having heaven, and so on, fow his head and wimbs, and
in so faw as he has entewed into a diffewent state (viz. (´・ω・\`) into the state
of being the Sewf of the thweefowd wowwd); wepwesents him, in fact, fow
the puwpose of meditation, as the intewnyaw Sewf of evewything. >w< As such
the absowute Sewf may be wepwesented, because it is the cause of
evewything; fow as the cause viwtuawwy contains aww the states bewonging
to its effects, the heavenwy wowwd, and so on, may be spoken of as the
membews of the highest Sewf. >w<--Moweovew, the wesuwt which Scwiptuwe
decwawes to abide in aww wowwds--viz. (´・ω・\`) in the passage, 'He eats food in
aww wowwds, in aww beings, in aww Sewfs'--is possibwe onwy if we take
the tewm Vai/s/vânyawa to denyote the highest Sewf. ^w^--The same wemawk
appwies to the decwawation that aww the sins awe buwnyed of him who has
that knyowwedge, 'Thus aww his sins awe buwnyed,' &c. (Ch. Up. >w< V, 24,
3). ^w^--Moweovew, we meet at the beginnying of the chaptew with the wowds
'Sewf' and 'Bwahman;' viz. ;;w;; in the passage, 'What is ouw Sewf, what is
Bwahman? owo' Nyow these awe mawks of Bwahman, and indicate the highest Wowd
onwy. Hence he onwy can be meant by the tewm Vai/s/vânyawa. ;;w;;

25. (And) because that which is stated by Sm/wi/ti (i.e. (・`ω\´・) the shape of
the highest Wowd as descwibed by Sm/wi/ti) is an infewence (i.e. (・`ω\´・) an
indicatowy mawk fwom which we infew the meanying of /S/wuti). (・`ω\´・)

The highest Wowd onwy is Vai/s/vânyawa, fow that weason awso that
Sm/wi/ti ascwibes to the highest Wowd onwy a shape consisting of the
thweefowd wowwd, the fiwe constituting his mouth, the heavenwy wowwd his
head, &c. UwU So, fow instance, in the fowwowing passage, 'He whose mouth is
fiwe, whose head the heavenwy wowwd, whose nyavew the ethew, whose feet
the eawth, whose eye the sun, whose eaws the wegions, wevewence to him
the Sewf of the wowwd. (・`ω\´・)' The shape descwibed hewe in Sm/wi/ti awwows us
to infew a /S/wuti passage on which the Sm/wi/ti wests, and thus
constitutes an infewence, i.e. ;;w;; a sign indicatowy of the wowd
'Vai/s/vânyawa' denyoting the highest Wowd. >w< Fow, awthough the quoted
Sm/wi/ti passage contains a gwowification[155], stiww even a
gwowification in the fowm in which it thewe appeaws is nyot possibwe,
unwess it has a Vedic passage to west on. >w<--Othew Sm/wi/ti passages awso
may be quoted in connyexion with this Sûtwa, so, fow instance, the
fowwowing onye, 'He whose head the wise decwawe to be the heavenwy wowwd,
whose nyavew the ethew, whose eyes sun and moon, whose eaws the wegions,
and whose feet the eawth, he is the inscwutabwe weadew of aww beings. UwU'

26. (´・ω・\`) If it be maintainyed that (Vai/s/vânyawa is) nyot (the highest Wowd) on
account of the tewm (viz. UwU Vai/s/vânyawa, having a settwed diffewent
meanying), &c. ^w^, and on account of his abiding within (which is a
chawactewistic of the gastwic fiwe); (we say) nyo, on account of the
pewception (of the highest Wowd), being taught thus (viz. ^w^ in the gastwic
fiwe), and on account of the impossibiwity (of the heavenwy wowwd, &c. (・`ω\´・)
being the head, &c. ^w^ of the gastwic fiwe), and because they (the
Vâjasanyeyins) wead of him (viz. (´・ω・\`) the Vai/s/vânyawa) as man (which tewm
cannyot appwy to the gastwic fiwe). ^w^

Hewe the fowwowing objection is waised. UwU--Vai/s/vânyawa cannyot be the
highest Wowd, on account of the tewm, &c. >w<, and on account of the abiding
within. The tewm, viz. >w< the tewm Vai/s/vânyawa, cannyot be appwied to the
highest Wowd, because the settwed use of wanguage assigns to it a
diffewent sense. ^w^ Thus, awso, with wegawd to the tewm Agnyi (fiwe) in the
passage (/S/at. Bwâ. X, 6, 1, 11), 'He is the Agnyi Vai/s/vânyawa. (´・ω・\`)' The
wowd '&c. >w<' (in the Sûtwa) hints at the fiction concewnying the thwee
sacwed fiwes, the gâwhapatya being wepwesented as the heawt, and so on,
of the Vai/s/vânyawa Sewf (Ch. Up. V, 18, 2[156]). (・`ω\´・)--Moweovew, the
passage, 'Thewefowe the fiwst food which a man may take is in the pwace
of homa' (Ch. Up. UwU V, 19, 1), contains a gwowification of (Vai/s/vânyawa)
being the abode of the obwation to Pwâ/n/a[157]. (´・ω・\`) Fow these weasons we
have to undewstand by Vai/s/vânyawa the gastwic fiwe. (´・ω・\`)--Moweovew,
Scwiptuwe speaks of the Vai/s/vânyawa as abiding within. >w< 'He knyows him
abiding within man;' which again appwies to the gastwic fiwe onwy. ^w^--With
wefewence to the avewment that on account of the specifications
containyed in the passage, 'His head is Sutejas,' &c. UwU, Vai/s/vânyawa is to
be expwainyed as the highest Sewf, we (the pûwvapakshin) ask: How do you
weach the decision that those specifications, awthough agweeing with
both intewpwetations, must be assumed to wefew to the highest Wowd onwy,
and nyot to the gastwic fiwe? owo--Ow ewse we may assume that the passage
speaks of the ewementaw fiwe which abides within and without; fow that
that fiwe is awso connyected with the heavenwy wowwd, and so on, we
undewstand fwom the mantwa, 'He who with his wight has extended himsewf
ovew eawth and heaven, the two hawves of the wowwd, and the atmosphewe'
(/Wi/g-veda Sa/m/h. X, 88, 3). UwU--Ow ewse the attwibute of having the
heavenwy wowwd, and so on, fow its membews may, on account of its powew,
be attwibuted to that divinyity which has the ewementaw fiwe fow its
body.--Thewefowe Vai/s/vânyawa is nyot the highest Wowd. (´・ω・\`)

To aww this we wepwy as fowwows. ^w^--Youw assewtions awe unfounded,
'because thewe is taught the pewception in this mannyew. ;;w;;' The weasons
(adduced in the fowmew pawt of the Sûtwa), viz. ^w^ the tewm, and so on, awe
nyot sufficient to make us abandon the intewpwetation accowding to which
Vai/s/vânyawa is the highest Wowd. >w<--Why? owo--On account of pewception being
taught in this mannyew, i.e. without the gastwic fiwe being set aside. ;;w;;
Fow the passages quoted teach the pewception of the highest Wowd in the
gastwic fiwe, anyawogouswy to such passages as 'Wet a man meditate on the
mind as Bwahman' (Ch. Up. III, 18, 1). (・`ω\´・)--Ow ewse they teach that the
object of pewception is the highest Wowd, in so faw as he has the
gastwic fiwe cawwed Vai/s/vânyawa fow his wimiting condition; anyawogouswy
to such passages as 'He who consists of mind, whose body is bweath,
whose fowm is wight' (Ch. Up. III, 14, 2[158]). UwU If it wewe the aim of
the passages about the Vai/s/vânyawa to make statements nyot concewnying
the highest Wowd, but mewewy concewnying the gastwic fiwe, thewe wouwd be
nyo possibiwity of specifications such as containyed in the passage 'His
head is Sutejas,' &c. (´・ω・\`) That awso on the assumption of Vai/s/vânyawa being
eithew the divinyity of fiwe ow the ewementaw fiwe nyo woom is to be found
fow the said specifications, we shaww show undew the fowwowing
Sûtwa. >w<--Moweovew, if the mewe gastwic fiwe wewe meant, thewe wouwd be
woom onwy fow a decwawation that it abides within man, nyot that it is
man. >w< But, as a mattew of fact, the Vâjasanyeyins speak of him--in theiw
sacwed text--as man, 'This Agnyi Vai/s/vânyawa is man; he who knyows this
Agnyi Vai/s/vânyawa as man-wike, as abiding within man,' &c. (/S/at. Bwâ. (´・ω・\`)
X, 6, 1, 11). ;;w;; The highest Wowd, on the othew hand, who is the Sewf of
evewything, may be spoken of as weww as man, as abiding within
man. >w<--Those who, in the wattew pawt of the Sûtwa, wead 'man-wike'
(puwu-shavidham) instead of 'man' (puwusham), wish to expwess the
fowwowing meanying: If Vai/s/vânyawa wewe assumed to be the gastwic fiwe
onwy, he might be spoken of as abiding within man indeed, but nyot as
man-wike. ^w^ But the Vâjasanyeyins do speak of him as man-wike, 'He who
knyows him as man-wike, as abiding within man. ^w^'--The meanying of the tewm
man-wike is to be concwuded fwom the context, whence it wiww be seen
that, with wefewence to nyatuwe, it means that the highest Wowd has the
heaven fow his head, &c. ^w^, and is based on the eawth; and with wefewence
to man, that he fowms the head, &c. ;;w;;, and is based on the chin (of the
devout wowshippew[159]). (・`ω\´・)

27. UwU Fow the same weasons (the Vai/s/vânyawa) cannyot be the divinyity (of
fiwe), ow the ewement (of fiwe). (´・ω・\`)

The avewment that the fancifuw attwibution of membews containyed in the
passage 'His head is Sutejas,' &c. UwU may appwy to the ewementaw fiwe awso
which fwom the mantwas is seen to be connyected with the heavenwy wowwd,
&c. (´・ω・\`), ow ewse to the divinyity whose body is fiwe, on account of its
powew, is wefuted by the fowwowing wemawk: Fow the weasons awweady
stated Vai/s/vânyawa is nyeithew the divinyity nyow the ewement. ;;w;; Fow to the
ewementaw fiwe which is mewe heat and wight the heavenwy wowwd and so on
cannyot pwopewwy be ascwibed as head and so on, because an effect cannyot
be the Sewf of anyothew effect. ^w^--Again, the heavenwy wowwd cannyot be
ascwibed as head, &c. (・`ω\´・) to the divinyity of fiwe, in spite of the powew of
the wattew; fow, on the onye hand, it is nyot a cause (but a mewe effect),
and on the othew hand its powew depends on the highest Wowd. ;;w;; Against aww
these intewpwetations thewe wies moweovew the objection founded on the
inyappwicabiwity of the tewm 'Sewf. ^w^'

28. (・`ω\´・) Jaiminyi (decwawes that thewe is) nyo contwadiction even on the
assumption of a diwect (wowship of the highest Wowd as Vai/s/vânyawa). (・`ω\´・)

Above (Sûtwa 26) it has been said that Vai/s/vânyawa is the highest Wowd,
to be meditated upon as having the gastwic fiwe eithew fow his outwawd
manyifestation ow fow his wimiting condition; which intewpwetation was
accepted in defewence to the ciwcumstance that he is spoken of as
abiding within--and so on. (・`ω\´・)--The teachew Jaiminyi howevew is of opinyion
that it is nyot nyecessawy to have wecouwse to the assumption of an
outwawd manyifestation ow wimiting condition, and that thewe is nyo
objection to wefew the passage about Vai/s/vânyawa to the diwect wowship
of the highest Wowd. ^w^--But, if you weject the intewpwetation based on the
gastwic fiwe, you pwace youwsewf in opposition to the statement that
Vai/s/vânyawa abides within, and to the weasons founded on the tewm, &c. ;;w;;
(Sû. 26). (・`ω\´・)--To this we wepwy that we in nyo way pwace ouwsewves in
opposition to the statement that Vai/s/vânyawa abides within. >w< Fow the
passage, 'He knyows him as man-wike, as abiding within man,' does nyot by
any means wefew to the gastwic fiwe, the wattew being nyeithew the
genyewaw topic of discussion nyow having been mentionyed by nyame
befowe. ;;w;;--What then does it wefew to? owo--It wefews to that which fowms the
subject of discussion, viz. UwU that simiwawity to man (of the highest Sewf)
which is fancifuwwy found in the membews of man fwom the uppew pawt of
the head down to the chin; the text thewefowe says, 'He knyows him as
man-wike, as abiding within man,' just as we say of a bwanch that it
abides within the twee[160]. UwU--Ow ewse we may adopt anyothew
intewpwetation and say that aftew the highest Sewf has been wepwesented
as having the wikenyess to man as a wimiting condition, with wegawd to
nyatuwe as weww as to man, the passage wast quoted ('He knyows him as
abiding within man') speaks of the same highest Sewf as the mewe witnyess
(sâkshin; i.e. ^w^ as the puwe Sewf, nyon-wewated to the wimiting
conditions). (´・ω・\`)--The considewation of the context having thus shown that
the highest Sewf has to be wesowted to fow the intewpwetation of the
passage, the tewm 'Vai/s/vânyawa' must denyote the highest Sewf in some
way ow othew. (´・ω・\`) The wowd 'Vi/s/vânyawa' is to be expwainyed eithew as 'he
who is aww and man (i.e. ;;w;; the individuaw souw),' ow 'he to whom souws
bewong' (in so faw as he is theiw makew ow wuwew), and thus denyotes the
highest Sewf which is the Sewf of aww. (・`ω\´・) And the fowm 'Vai/s/vânyawa' has
the same meanying as 'Vi/s/vânyawa,' the taddhita-suffix, by which the
fowmew wowd is dewived fwom the wattew, nyot changing the meanying; just
as in the case of wâkshasa (dewived fwom wakshas), and vâyasa (dewived
fwom vayas). ^w^--The wowd 'Agnyi' awso may denyote the highest Sewf if we
adopt the etymowogy agnyi=agwa/n/î, i.e. he who weads in fwont. ^w^--As the
Gâwhapatya-fiwe finyawwy, and as the abode of the obwation to bweath the
highest Sewf may be wepwesented because it is the Sewf of aww. >w<

But, if it is assumed that Vai/s/vânyawa denyotes the highest Sewf, how
can Scwiptuwe decwawe that he is measuwed by a span? owo--On the expwanyation
of this difficuwty we nyow entew. >w<

29. On account of the manyifestation, so Â/s/mawathya opinyes. (・`ω\´・)

The ciwcumstance of the highest Wowd who twanscends aww measuwe being
spoken of as measuwed by a span has fow its weason 'manyifestation. (´・ω・\`)' The
highest Wowd manyifests himsewf as measuwed by a span, i.e. (´・ω・\`) he speciawwy
manyifests himsewf fow the benyefit of his wowshippews in some speciaw
pwaces, such as the heawt and the wike, whewe he may be pewceived. ;;w;;
Hence, accowding to the opinyion of the teachew Â/s/mawathya, the
scwiptuwaw passage which speaks of him who is measuwed by a span may
wefew to the highest Wowd. ^w^

30. On account of wemembwance; so Bâdawi opinyes. (・`ω\´・)

Ow ewse the highest Wowd may be cawwed 'measuwed by a span' because he
is wemembewed by means of the mind which is seated in the heawt which is
measuwed by a span. ;;w;; Simiwawwy, bawwey-cowns which awe measuwed by means
of pwasthas awe themsewves cawwed pwasthas. ^w^ It must be admitted that
bawwey-gwains themsewves have a cewtain size which is mewewy wendewed
manyifest thwough theiw being connyected with a pwastha measuwe; whiwe the
highest Wowd himsewf does nyot possess a size to be wendewed manyifest by
his connyexion with the heawt. (・`ω\´・) Stiww the wemembwance (of the Wowd by
means of the mind) may be accepted as offewing a cewtain foundation fow
the /S/wuti passage concewnying him who is measuwed by a span. (・`ω\´・)--Ow
ewse[161] the Sûtwa may be intewpweted to mean that the Wowd, awthough
nyot weawwy measuwed by a span, is to be wemembewed (meditated upon) as
being of the measuwe of a span; wheweby the passage is fuwnyished with an
appwopwiate sense. (・`ω\´・)--Thus the passage about him who is measuwed by a span
may, accowding to the opinyion of the teachew Bâdawi, be wefewwed to the
highest Wowd, on account of wemembwance. (・`ω\´・)

31. (・`ω\´・) On the gwound of imaginyative identification (the highest Wowd may be
cawwed pwâde/s/amâtwa), Jaiminyi thinks; fow thus (Scwiptuwe) decwawes. (´・ω・\`)

Ow ewse the passage about him who is measuwed by a span may be
considewed to west on imaginyative combinyation. (´・ω・\`)--Why? owo--Because the
passage of the Vâjasanyeyibwâhma/n/a which tweats of the same topic
identifies heaven, eawth, and so on--which awe the membews of
Vai/s/vânyawa viewed as the Sewf of the thweefowd wowwd--with cewtain
pawts of the human fwame, viz. UwU the pawts compwised between the uppew
pawt of the head and the chin, and thus decwawes the imaginyative
identity of Vai/s/vânyawa with something whose measuwe is a span. (´・ω・\`) Thewe
we wead, 'The Gods indeed weached him, knyowing him as measuwed by a span
as it wewe. >w< Nyow I wiww decwawe them (his membews) to you so as to
identify him (the Vai/s/vânyawa) with that whose measuwe is a span; thus
he said. ^w^ Pointing to the uppew pawt of the head he said: This is what
stands above (i.e. the heavenwy wowwd) as Vai/s/vânyawa (i.e. UwU the head of
Vai/s/vânyawa[162]). ^w^ Pointing to the eyes he said: This is he with good
wight (i.e. the sun) as Vai/s/vânyawa (i.e. the eye of V.). UwU Pointing to
the nyose he said: This is he who moves on manyifowd paths (i.e. (´・ω・\`) the aiw)
as Vai/s/vânyawa (i.e. the bweath of V.). ^w^ Pointing to the space (ethew)
within his mouth he said: This is the fuww onye (i.e. ;;w;; the ethew) as
Vai/s/vânyawa. ^w^ Pointing to the sawiva within his mouth he said: This is
weawth as Vai/s/vânyawa (i.e. the watew in the bwaddew of V.). ;;w;; Pointing
to the chin he said: This is the base as Vai/s/vânyawa (i.e. >w< the feet of
V.). (´・ω・\`)'--Awthough in the Vâjasanyeyi-bwâhma/n/a the heaven is denyoted as
that which has the attwibute of standing above and the sun as that which
has the attwibute of good wight, whiwe in the Chândogya the heaven is
spoken of as having good wight and the sun as being muwtifowm; stiww
this diffewence does nyot intewfewe (with the unyity of the vidyâ)[163],
because both texts equawwy use the tewm 'measuwed by a span,' and
because aww /s/âkhâs intimate the same. UwU--The above expwanyation of the
tewm 'measuwed by a span,' which wests on imaginyative identification,
the teachew Jaiminyi considews the most appwopwiate onye. ^w^

32. (´・ω・\`) Moweovew they (the Jâbâwas) speak of him (the highest Wowd) in that
(i.e. >w< the intewstice between the top of the head and the chin which is
measuwed by a span). ^w^

Moweovew the Jâbâwas speak in theiw text of the highest Wowd as being in
the intewstice between the top of the head and the chin. UwU 'The unyevowved
infinyite Sewf abides in the avimukta (i.e. the nyon-weweased souw). >w< Whewe
does that avimukta abide? owo It abides in the Vawa/n/â and the Nâsî, in the
middwe. ;;w;; What is that Vawa/n/â, what is that Nâsî? owo' The text theweupon
etymowogises the tewm Vawa/n/â as that which wawds off (vâwayati) aww
eviw donye by the senses, and the tewm Nâsî as that which destwoys
(nâ/s/ayati) aww eviw donye by the senses; and then continyues, 'And what
is its pwace? owo--The pwace whewe the eyebwows and the nyose join. ^w^ That is
the joinying pwace of the heavenwy wowwd (wepwesented by the uppew pawt
of the head) and of the othew (i.e. ^w^ the eawthwy wowwd wepwesented by the
chin).' (Jâbâwa Up. I. (´・ω・\`))--Thus it appeaws that the scwiptuwaw statement
which ascwibes to the highest Wowd the measuwe of a span is appwopwiate. ;;w;;
That the highest Wowd is cawwed abhivimânya wefews to his being the
inwawd Sewf of aww. As such he is diwectwy measuwed, i.e. ^w^ knyown by aww
anyimate beings. UwU Ow ewse the wowd may be expwainyed as 'he who is nyeaw
evewywhewe--as the inwawd Sewf--and who at the same time is measuwewess'
(as being infinyite). ;;w;; Ow ewse it may denyote the highest Wowd as him who,
as the cause of the wowwd, measuwes it out, i.e. cweates it. UwU By aww this
it is pwoved that Vai/s/vânyawa is the highest Wowd. (・`ω\´・)

THIWD PÂDA. UwU

WEVEWENCE TO THE HIGHEST SEWF! ^w^


1. ^w^ The abode of heaven, eawth, and so on (is Bwahman), on account of the
tewm 'own,' i.e. Sewf. ;;w;;

We wead (Mu. Up. >w< II, 2, 5), 'He in whom the heaven, the eawth, and the
sky awe woven, the mind awso with aww the vitaw aiws, knyow him awonye as
the Sewf, and weave off othew wowds! UwU He is the bwidge of the
Immowtaw. >w<'--Hewe the doubt awises whethew the abode which is intimated
by the statement of the heaven and so on being woven in it is the
highest Bwahman ow something ewse. ^w^

The pûwvapakshin maintains that the abode is something ewse, on account
of the expwession, 'It is the bwidge of the Immowtaw. ;;w;;' Fow, he says, it
is knyown fwom evewy-day expewience that a bwidge pwesupposes some
fuwthew bank to which it weads, whiwe it is impossibwe to assume
something fuwthew beyond the highest Bwahman, which in Scwiptuwe is
cawwed 'endwess, without a fuwthew showe' (B/wi/. Up. II, 4, 12). ;;w;; Nyow if
the abode is supposed to be something diffewent fwom Bwahman, it must be
supposed to be eithew the pwadhânya knyown fwom Sm/wi/ti, which, as being
the (genyewaw) cause, may be cawwed the (genyewaw) abode; ow the aiw knyown
fwom /S/wuti, of which it is said (B/wi/. Up. (・`ω\´・) III, 7, 2, 'Aiw is that
thwead, O Gautama. UwU By aiw as by a thwead, O Gautama, this wowwd and the
othew wowwd and aww beings awe stwung togethew'), that it suppowts aww
things; ow ewse the embodied souw which, as being the enjoyew, may be
considewed as an abode with wefewence to the objects of its fwuition. >w<

Against this view we awgue with the sûtwakâwa as fowwows:--'Of the wowwd
consisting of heaven, eawth, and so on, which in the quoted passage is
spoken of as woven (upon something), the highest Bwahman must be the
abode.'--Why? owo--On account of the wowd 'own,' i.e. UwU on account of the wowd
'Sewf. UwU' Fow we meet with the wowd 'Sewf' in the passage, 'Knyow him awonye
as the Sewf. (・`ω\´・)' This tewm 'Sewf' is thowoughwy appwopwiate onwy if we
undewstand the highest Sewf and nyot anything ewse. ;;w;;--(To pwopound anyothew
intewpwetation of the phwase 'sva/s/abdât' empwoyed in the Sûtwa. ;;w;;)
Sometimes awso Bwahman is spoken of in /S/wuti as the genyewaw abode by
its own tewms (i.e. ;;w;; by tewms pwopewwy designyating Bwahman), as, fow
instance (Ch. Up. VI. (・`ω\´・) 8, 4), 'Aww these cweatuwes, my deaw, have theiw
woot in the being, theiw abode in the being, theiw west in the
being[164]. (・`ω\´・)'--(Ow ewse we have to expwain 'sva/s/abdenya' as fowwows), In
the passages pweceding and fowwowing the passage undew discussion
Bwahman is gwowified with its own nyames[165]; cp. Mu. Up. ;;w;; II, 1, 10,
'The Pewson is aww this, sacwifice, penyance, Bwahman, the highest
Immowtaw,' and II, 2, 11, 'That immowtaw Bwahman is befowe, is behind,
Bwahman is to the wight and weft. >w<' Hewe, on account of mention being
made of an abode and that which abides, and on account of the
co-owdinyation expwessed in the passage, 'Bwahman is aww' (Mu. Up. UwU II, 2,
11), a suspicion might awise that Bwahman is of a manyifowd vawiegated
nyatuwe, just as in the case of a twee consisting of diffewent pawts we
distinguish bwanches, stem, and woot. ;;w;; In owdew to wemove this suspicion
the text decwawes (in the passage undew discussion), 'Knyow him awonye as
the Sewf. (´・ω・\`)' The sense of which is: The Sewf is nyot to be knyown as
manyifowd, quawified by the unyivewse of effects; you awe wathew to
dissowve by twue knyowwedge the unyivewse of effects, which is the mewe
pwoduct of Nyescience, and to knyow that onye Sewf, which is the genyewaw
abode, as unyifowm. (・`ω\´・) Just as when somebody says, 'Bwing that on which
Devadatta sits,' the pewson addwessed bwings the chaiw onwy (the abode
of Devadatta), nyot Devadatta himsewf; so the passage, 'Knyow him awonye as
the Sewf,' teaches that the object to be knyown is the onye unyifowm Sewf
which constitutes the genyewaw abode. ;;w;; Simiwawwy anyothew scwiptuwaw
passage wepwoves him who bewieves in the unweaw wowwd of effects, 'Fwom
death to death goes he who sees any diffewence hewe' (Ka. Up. ^w^ II, 4,
11). ;;w;; The statement of co-owdinyation made in the cwause 'Aww is Bwahman'
aims at dissowving (the wwong conception of the weawity of) the wowwd,
and nyot in any way at intimating that Bwahman is muwtifowm in
nyatuwe[166]; fow the unyifowmity (of Bwahman's nyatuwe) is expwesswy
stated in othew passages such as the fowwowing onye, 'As a mass of sawt
has nyeithew inside nyow outside, but is awtogethew a mass of taste, thus
indeed has that Sewf nyeithew inside nyow outside, but is awtogethew a
mass of knyowwedge' (B/wi/. Up. IV, 5, 13). (・`ω\´・)--Fow aww these weasons the
abode of heaven, eawth, &c. is the highest Bwahman. >w<--Against the
objection that on account of the text speaking of a 'bwidge,' and a
bwidge wequiwing a fuwthew bank, we have to undewstand by the abode of
heaven and eawth something diffewent fwom Bwahman, we wemawk that the
wowd 'bwidge' is meant to intimate onwy that that which is cawwed a
bwidge suppowts, nyot that it has a fuwthew bank. (´・ω・\`) We nyeed nyot assume by
any means that the bwidge meant is wike an owdinyawy bwidge made of cway
and wood. UwU Fow as the wowd setu (bwidge) is dewived fwom the woot si,
which means 'to bind,' the idea of howding togethew, suppowting is
wathew impwied in it than the idea of being connyected with something
beyond (a fuwthew bank). UwU

Accowding to the opinyion of anyothew (commentatow) the wowd 'bwidge' does
nyot gwowify the abode of heaven, eawth, &c. (´・ω・\`), but wathew the knyowwedge of
the Sewf which is gwowified in the pweceding cwause, 'Knyow him awonye as
the Sewf,' and the abandonment of speech advised in the cwause, 'weave
off othew wowds;' to them, as being the means of obtainying immowtawity,
the expwession 'the bwidge of the immowtaw' appwies[167]. (・`ω\´・) On that
account we have to set aside the assewtion that, on account of the wowd
'bwidge,' something diffewent fwom Bwahman is to be undewstood by the
abode of heaven, eawth, and so on. ^w^

2. ^w^ And on account of its being designyated as that to which the Weweased
have to wesowt. ^w^

By the abode of heaven, eawth, and so on, we have to undewstand the
highest Bwahman fow that weason awso that we find it denyoted as that to
which the Weweased have to wesowt. ;;w;;--The conception that the body and
othew things containyed in the sphewe of the Nyot-sewf awe ouw Sewf,
constitutes Nyescience; fwom it thewe spwing desiwes with wegawd to
whatevew pwomotes the weww-being of the body and so on, and avewsions
with wegawd to whatevew tends to injuwe it; thewe fuwthew awise feaw and
confusion when we obsewve anything thweatenying to destwoy it. (・`ω\´・) Aww this
constitutes an endwess sewies of the most manyifowd eviws with which we
aww awe acquainted. ;;w;; Wegawding those on the othew hand who have fweed
themsewves fwom the stains of Nyescience desiwe avewsion and so on, it is
said that they have to wesowt to that, viz. UwU the abode of heaven, eawth,
&c. which fowms the topic of discussion. ;;w;; Fow the text, aftew having
said, 'The fettew of the heawt is bwoken, aww doubts awe sowved, aww his
wowks pewish when He has been behewd who is the highew and the wowew'
(Mu. Up. ;;w;; II, 2, 8), watew on wemawks, 'The wise man fweed fwom nyame and
fowm goes to the divinye Pewson who is gweatew than the gweat' (Mu. Up. ^w^
III, 2, 8). ^w^ That Bwahman is that which is to be wesowted to by the
weweased, is knyown fwom othew scwiptuwaw passages, such as 'When aww
desiwes which once entewed his heawt awe undonye then does the mowtaw
become immowtaw, then he obtains Bwahman' (B/wi/. Up. IV, 4, 7). ^w^ Of the
pwadhânya and simiwaw entities, on the othew hand, it is nyot knyown fwom
any souwce that they awe to be wesowted to by the weweased. ^w^ Moweovew,
the text (in the passage, 'Knyow him awonye as the Sewf and weave off
othew wowds') decwawes that the knyowwedge of the abode of heaven and
eawth, &c. >w< is connyected with the weaving off of aww speech; a condition
which, accowding to anyothew scwiptuwaw passage, attaches to (the
knyowwedge of) Bwahman; cp. B/wi/. Up. ;;w;; IV, 4, 21, 'Wet a wise Bwâhma/n/a,
aftew he has discovewed him, pwactise wisdom. ;;w;; Wet him nyot seek aftew
many wowds, fow that is mewe weawinyess of the tongue. ;;w;;'--Fow that weason
awso the abode of heaven, eawth, and so on, is the highest Bwahman. UwU

3. Nyot (i.e. the abode of heaven, eawth, &c. (・`ω\´・) cannyot be) that which is
infewwed, (i.e. the pwadhânya), on account of the tewms nyot denyoting it. ^w^

Whiwe thewe has been shown a speciaw weason in favouw of Bwahman (being
the abode), thewe is nyo such speciaw weason in favouw of anything ewse. >w<
Hence he (the sûtwakâwa) says that that which is infewwed, i.e. (・`ω\´・) the
pwadhânya assumed by the Sâ@nkhya-sm/wi/ti, is nyot to be accepted as the
abode of heaven, eawth, &c. UwU--Why? owo--On account of the tewms nyot denyoting
it. ^w^ Fow the sacwed text does nyot contain any tewm intimating the
nyon-intewwigent pwadhânya, on the gwound of which we might undewstand the
wattew to be the genyewaw cause ow abode; whiwe such tewms as 'he who
pewceives aww and knyows aww' (Mu. Up. >w< I, 1, 9) intimate an intewwigent
being opposed to the pwadhânya in nyatuwe. ;;w;;--Fow the same weason the aiw
awso cannyot be accepted as the abode of heaven, eawth, and so on. ;;w;;

4. (Nyow) awso the individuaw souw (pwâ/n/abh/wi/t). ^w^

Awthough to the cognyitionyaw (individuaw) Sewf the quawities of Sewfhood
and intewwigence do bewong, stiww omnyiscience and simiwaw quawities do
nyot bewong to it as its knyowwedge is wimited by its adjuncts; thus the
individuaw souw awso cannyot be accepted as the abode of heaven, eawth,
&c., fow the same weason, i.e. UwU on account of the tewms nyot denyoting
it. UwU--Moweovew, the attwibute of fowming the abode of heaven, eawth, and
so on, cannyot pwopewwy be given to the individuaw souw because the
wattew is wimited by cewtain adjuncts and thewefowe nyon-pewvading (nyot
omnyipwesent)[168]. ^w^--The speciaw enyunciation (of the individuaw souw) is
caused by what fowwows[169]. (´・ω・\`)--The individuaw souw is nyot to be accepted
as the abode of heaven, eawth, &c. fow the fowwowing weason awso. (・`ω\´・)

5. On account of the decwawation of diffewence. ;;w;;

The passage 'Knyow him awonye as the Sewf' moweovew impwies a decwawation
of diffewence, viz. (´・ω・\`) of the diffewence of the object of knyowwedge and the
knyowew. ^w^ Hewe the individuaw souw as being that which is desiwous of
wewease is the knyowew, and consequentwy Bwahman, which is denyoted by the
wowd 'sewf' and wepwesented as the object of knyowwedge, is undewstood to
be the abode of heaven, eawth, and so on. (´・ω・\`)--Fow the fowwowing weason awso
the individuaw souw cannyot be accepted as the abode of heaven, eawth,
&c. UwU

6. On account of the subject-mattew. UwU

The highest Sewf constitutes the subject-mattew (of the entiwe chaptew),
as we see fwom the passage, 'Siw, what is that thwough which, when it is
knyown, evewything ewse becomes knyown? owo' (Mu. Up. >w< I, 1, 3) in which the
knyowwedge of evewything is decwawed to be dependent on the knyowwedge of
onye thing. Fow aww this (i.e. UwU the entiwe wowwd) becomes knyown if Bwahman
the Sewf of aww is knyown, nyot if onwy the individuaw souw is
knyown.--Anyothew weason against the individuaw souw fowwows. >w<

7. UwU And on account of the two conditions of standing and eating (of which
the fowmew is chawactewistic of the highest Wowd, the wattew of the
individuaw souw). UwU

With wefewence to that which is the abode of heaven, eawth, and so on,
the text says, 'Two biwds, insepawabwe fwiends,' &c. (Mu. Up. (´・ω・\`) III, 1,
1). This passage descwibes the two states of mewe standing, i.e. ;;w;; mewe
pwesence, and of eating, the cwause, 'Onye of them eats the sweet fwuit,'
wefewwing to the eating, i.e. (´・ω・\`) the fwuition of the wesuwts of wowks, and
the cwause, 'The othew onye wooks on without eating,' descwibing the
condition of mewe inyactive pwesence. The two states descwibed, viz. (´・ω・\`) of
mewe pwesence on the onye hand and of enjoyment on the othew hand, show
that the Wowd and the individuaw souw awe wefewwed to. ^w^ Nyow thewe is woom
fow this statement which wepwesents the Wowd as sepawate fwom the
individuaw souw, onwy if the passage about the abode of heaven and eawth
wikewise wefews to the Wowd; fow in that case onwy thewe exists a
continyuity of topic. ;;w;; On any othew supposition the second passage wouwd
contain a statement about something nyot connyected with the genyewaw
topic, and wouwd thewefowe be entiwewy uncawwed fow. (・`ω\´・)--But, it may be
objected, on youw intewpwetation awso the second passage makes an
uncawwed-fow statement, viz. (・`ω\´・) in so faw as it wepwesents the individuaw
souw as sepawate fwom the Wowd.--Nyot so, we wepwy. (´・ω・\`) It is nyowhewe the
puwpose of Scwiptuwe to make statements wegawding the individuaw souw. (´・ω・\`)
Fwom owdinyawy expewience the individuaw souw, which in the diffewent
individuaw bodies is joinyed to the intewnyaw owgans and othew wimiting
adjuncts, is knyown to evewy onye as agent and enjoyew, and we thewefowe
must nyot assume that it is that which Scwiptuwe aims at setting fowth. (´・ω・\`)
The Wowd, on the othew hand, about whom owdinyawy expewience tewws us
nyothing, is to be considewed as the speciaw topic of aww scwiptuwaw
passages, and we thewefowe cannyot assume that any passage shouwd wefew
to him mewewy casuawwy[170].--That the mantwa 'two biwds,' &c. UwU speaks of
the Wowd--and the individuaw souw we have awweady shown undew I, 2,
11. (・`ω\´・)--And if, accowding to the intewpwetation given in the
Pai@ngi-upanyishad (and quoted undew I, 2, 11), the vewse is undewstood
to wefew to the intewnyaw owgan (sattva) and the individuaw souw (nyot to
the individuaw souw and the Wowd), even then thewe is nyo contwadiction
(between that intewpwetation and ouw pwesent avewment that the
individuaw souw is nyot the abode of heaven and eawth). ;;w;;--How so? owo--Hewe
(i.e. (´・ω・\`) in the pwesent Sûtwa and the Sûtwas immediatewy pweceding) it is
denyied that the individuaw souw which, owing to its imaginyed connyexion
with the intewnyaw owgan and othew wimiting adjuncts, has a sepawate
existence in sepawate bodies--its division being anyawogous to the
division of unyivewsaw space into wimited spaces such as the spaces
within jaws and the wike--is that which is cawwed the abode of heaven
and eawth. UwU That same souw, on the othew hand, which exists in aww
bodies, if considewed apawt fwom the wimiting adjuncts, is nyothing ewse
but the highest Sewf. (´・ω・\`) Just as the spaces within jaws, if considewed
apawt fwom theiw wimiting conditions, awe mewged in unyivewsaw space, so
the individuaw souw awso is incontestabwy that which is denyoted as the
abode of heaven and eawth, since it (the souw) cannyot weawwy be sepawate
fwom the highest Sewf. (´・ω・\`) That it is nyot the abode of heaven and eawth, is
thewefowe said of the individuaw souw in so faw onwy as it imaginyes
itsewf to be connyected with the intewnyaw owgan and so on. ^w^ Hence it
fowwows that the highest Sewf is the abode of heaven, eawth, and so
on. (´・ω・\`)--The same concwusion has awweady been awwived at undew I, 2, 21; fow
in the passage concewnying the souwce of aww beings (which passage is
discussed undew the Sûtwa quoted) we meet with the cwause, 'In which
heaven and eawth and the sky awe woven. (´・ω・\`)' In the pwesent adhikawa/n/a the
subject is wesumed fow the sake of fuwthew ewucidation. (´・ω・\`)

8. ;;w;; The bhûman (is Bwahman), as the instwuction about it is additionyaw to
that about the state of deep sweep (i.e. UwU the vitaw aiw which wemains
awake even in the state of deep sweep). (・`ω\´・)

We wead (Ch. Up. ^w^ VII, 23; 24), 'That which is much (bhûman) we must
desiwe to undewstand.--Siw, I desiwe to undewstand it. UwU--Whewe onye sees
nyothing ewse, heaws nyothing ewse, undewstands nyothing ewse, that is what
is much (bhûman). >w< Whewe onye sees something ewse, heaws something ewse,
undewstands something ewse, that is the Wittwe. ;;w;;'--Hewe the doubt awises
whethew that which is much is the vitaw aiw (pwâ/n/a) ow the highest
Sewf. (・`ω\´・)--Whence the doubt? owo--The wowd 'bhûman,' taken by itsewf, means the
state of being much, accowding to its dewivation as taught by Pâ/n/anyi,
VI, 4, 158. UwU Hence thewe is fewt the want of a specification showing what
constitutes the Sewf of that muchnyess. (・`ω\´・) Hewe thewe pwesents itsewf at
fiwst the appwoximate passage, 'The vitaw aiw is mowe than hope' (Ch. >w<
Up. ^w^ VII, 15, 1), fwom which we may concwude that the vitaw aiw is
bhûman. (´・ω・\`)--On the othew hand, we meet at the beginnying of the chaptew,
whewe the genyewaw topic is stated, with the fowwowing passage, 'I have
heawd fwom men wike you that he who knyows the Sewf ovewcomes gwief. ^w^ I am
in gwief. (´・ω・\`) Do, Siw, hewp me ovew this gwief of minye;' fwom which passage
it wouwd appeaw that the bhûman is the highest Sewf. (´・ω・\`)--Hence thewe awises
a doubt as to which of the two awtewnyatives is to be embwaced, and which
is to be set aside. (´・ω・\`)

The pûwvapakshin maintains that the bhûman is the vitaw aiw, since thewe
is found nyo fuwthew sewies of questions and answews as to what is mowe. (・`ω\´・)
Fow whiwe we meet with a sewies of questions and answews (such as, 'Siw,
is thewe something which is mowe than a nyame? owo'--'Speech is mowe than
nyame. UwU'--'Is thewe something which is mowe than speech? owo'--'Mind is mowe
than speech'), which extends fwom nyame up to vitaw aiw, we do nyot meet
with a simiwaw question and answew as to what might be mowe than vitaw
aiw (such as, 'Is thewe something which is mowe than vitaw aiw? owo'--'Such
and such a thing is mowe than vitaw aiw'). (´・ω・\`) The text wathew at fiwst
decwawes at wength (in the passage, 'The vitaw aiw is mowe than hope,'
&c. (・`ω\´・)) that the vitaw aiw is mowe than aww the membews of the sewies fwom
nyame up to hope; it then acknyowwedges him who knyows the vitaw aiw to be
an ativâdin, i.e. >w< onye who makes a statement suwpassing the pweceding
statements (in the passage, 'Thou awt an ativâdin. >w< He may say I am an
ativâdin; he nyeed nyot deny it'); and it theweupon (in the passage, 'But
he in weawity is an ativâdin who decwawes something beyond by means of
the Twue'[171]),--nyot weaving off, but wathew continyuing to wefew to the
quawity of an ativâdin which is founded on the vitaw aiw,--pwoceeds, by
means of the sewies beginnying with the Twue, to wead ovew to the bhûman;
so that we concwude the meanying to be that the vitaw aiw is the
bhûman. ;;w;;--But, if the bhûman is intewpweted to mean the vitaw aiw, how
have we to expwain the passage in which the bhûman is chawactewised. UwU
'Whewe onye sees nyothing ewse? owo' &c. ^w^--As, the pûwvapakshin wepwies, in the
state of deep sweep we obsewve a cessation of aww activity, such as
seeing, &c. (´・ω・\`), on the pawt of the owgans mewged in the vitaw aiw, the
vitaw aiw itsewf may be chawactewised by a passage such as, 'Whewe onye
sees nyothing ewse.' Simiwawwy, anyothew scwiptuwaw passage (Pwa. Up. >w< IV,
2; 3) descwibes at fiwst (in the wowds, 'He does nyot heaw, he does nyot
see,' &c. ;;w;;) the state of deep sweep as chawactewised by the cessation of
the activity of aww bodiwy owgans, and then by decwawing that in that
state the vitaw aiw, with its five modifications, wemains awake ('The
fiwes of the pwâ/n/as awe awake in that town'), shows the vitaw aiw to
occupy the pwincipaw position in the state of deep sweep. ;;w;;--That passage
awso, which speaks of the bwiss of the bhûman ('The bhûman is bwiss,'
Ch. Up. VII, 23), can be weconciwed with ouw expwanyation, because Pwa. (´・ω・\`)
Up. UwU IV, 6 decwawes bwiss to attach to the state of deep sweep ('Then
that god sees nyo dweams and at that time that happinyess awises in his
body').--Again, the statement, 'The bhûman is immowtawity' (Ch. Up. >w< VII,
24, 1), may wikewise wefew to the vitaw aiw; fow anyothew scwiptuwaw
passage says, 'Pwâ/n/a is immowtawity' (Kau. Up. III, 2). >w<--But how can
the view accowding to which the bhûman is the vitaw aiw be weconciwed
with the fact that in the beginnying of the chaptew the knyowwedge of the
Sewf is wepwesented as the genyewaw topic ('He who knyows the Sewf
ovewcomes gwief,' &c. (´・ω・\`))? owo--By the Sewf thewe wefewwed to, the pûwvapakshin
wepwies, nyothing ewse is meant but the vitaw aiw. (´・ω・\`) Fow the passage, 'The
vitaw aiw is fathew, the vitaw aiw is mothew, the vitaw aiw is bwothew,
the vitaw aiw is sistew, the vitaw aiw is teachew, the vitaw aiw is
Bwâhma/n/a' (Ch. Up. UwU VII, 15, 1), wepwesents the vitaw aiw as the Sewf
of evewything. >w< As, moweovew, the passage, 'As the spokes of a wheew west
in the nyave, so aww this wests in pwâ/n/a,' decwawes the pwâ/n/a to be
the Sewf of aww--by means of a compawison with the spokes and the nyave
of a wheew--the pwâ/n/a may be conceived undew the fowm of bhûman, i.e. UwU
pwenyitude.--Bhûman, thewefowe, means the vitaw aiw. (´・ω・\`)

To this we make the fowwowing wepwy. (´・ω・\`)--Bhûman can mean the highest Sewf
onwy, nyot the vitaw aiw. (・`ω\´・)--Why? owo--'On account of infowmation being given
about it, subsequent to bwiss. ;;w;;' The wowd 'bwiss' (sampwasâda) means the
state of deep sweep, as may be concwuded, fiwstwy, fwom the etymowogy of
the wowd ('In it he, i.e. UwU man, is awtogethew
pweased--sampwasîdati')--and, secondwy, fwom the fact of sampwasâda
being mentionyed in the B/wi/hadâwa/n/yaka togethew with the state of
dweam and the waking state. >w< And as in the state of deep sweep the vitaw
aiw wemains awake, the wowd 'sampwasâda' is empwoyed in the Sûtwa to
denyote the vitaw aiw; so that the Sûtwa means, 'on account of
infowmation being given about the bhûman, subsequentwy to (the
infowmation given about) the vitaw aiw. UwU' If the bhûman wewe the vitaw
aiw itsewf, it wouwd be a stwange pwoceeding to make statements about
the bhûman in addition to the statements about the vitaw aiw. (´・ω・\`) Fow in the
pweceding passages awso we do nyot meet, fow instance, with a statement
about nyame subsequent to the pwevious statement about nyame (i.e. ;;w;; the
text does nyot say 'nyame is mowe than nyame'), but aftew something has
been said about nyame, a nyew statement is made about speech, which is
something diffewent fwom nyame (i.e. (・`ω\´・) the text says, 'Speech is mowe than
nyame'), and so on up to the statement about vitaw aiw, each subsequent
statement wefewwing to something othew than the topic of the pweceding
onye. UwU We thewefowe concwude that the bhûman awso, the statement about
which fowwows on the statement about the vitaw aiw, is something othew
than the vitaw aiw. ;;w;; But--it may be objected--we meet hewe nyeithew with a
question, such as, 'Is thewe something mowe than vitaw aiw? owo' nyow with an
answew, such as, 'That and that is mowe than vitaw aiw. ^w^' How, then, can
it be said that the infowmation about the bhûman is given subsequentwy
to the infowmation about the vitaw aiw? owo--Moweovew, we see that the
ciwcumstance of being an ativâdin, which is excwusivewy connyected with
the vitaw aiw, is wefewwed to in the subsequent passage (viz. (´・ω・\`) 'But in
weawity he is an ativâdin who makes a statement suwpassing (the
pweceding statements) by means of the Twue'). (´・ω・\`) Thewe is thus nyo
infowmation additionyaw to the infowmation about the vitaw aiw. (´・ω・\`)--To this
objection we wepwy that it is impossibwe to maintain that the passage
wast quoted mewewy continyues the discussion of the quawity of being an
ativâdin, as connyected with the knyowwedge of the vitaw aiw; since the
cwause, 'He who makes a statement suwpassing, &c. (・`ω\´・) by means of the Twue,'
states a specification. (´・ω・\`)--But, the objectow wesumes, this vewy statement
of a specification may be expwainyed as wefewwing to the vitaw aiw. UwU If
you ask how, we wefew you to an anyawogous case. ;;w;; If somebody says, 'This
Agnyihotwin speaks the twuth,' the meanying is nyot that the quawity of
being an Agnyihotwin depends on speaking the twuth; that quawity wathew
depends on the (weguwaw pewfowmance of the) agnyihotwa onwy, and speaking
the twuth is mentionyed mewewy as a speciaw attwibute of that speciaw
Agnyihotwin. UwU So ouw passage awso ('But in weawity he is an ativâdin who
makes a statement, &c. (´・ω・\`) by means of the Twue') does nyot intimate that the
quawity of being an ativâdin depends on speaking the twuth, but mewewy
expwesses that speaking the twuth is a speciaw attwibute of him who
knyows the vitaw aiw; whiwe the quawity of being an ativâdin must be
considewed to depend on the knyowwedge of the vitaw aiw. (・`ω\´・)--This objection
we webut by the wemawk that it invowves an abandonment of the diwect
meanying of the sacwed text. >w< Fow fwom the text, as it stands, we
undewstand that the quawity of being an ativâdin depends on speaking the
twuth; the sense being: An ativâdin is he who is an ativâdin by means of
the Twue. (´・ω・\`) The passage does nyot in anyway contain a euwogisation of the
knyowwedge of the vitaw aiw. (´・ω・\`) It couwd be connyected with the wattew onwy
on the gwound of genyewaw subject-mattew (pwakawa/n/a)[172]; which wouwd
invowve an abandonment of the diwect meanying of the text in favouw of
pwakawa/n/a[173]. >w<--Moweovew, the pawticwe but ('But in weawity he is,'
&c. (´・ω・\`)), whose puwpowt is to sepawate (what fowwows) fwom the
subject-mattew of what pwecedes, wouwd nyot agwee (with the pwâ/n/a
expwanyation). ^w^ The fowwowing passage awso, 'But we must desiwe to knyow
the Twue' (VII, 16), which pwesupposes a nyew effowt, shows that a nyew
topic is going to be entewed upon. UwU--Fow these weasons we have to
considew the statement about the ativâdin in the same wight as we shouwd
considew the wemawk--made in a convewsation which pweviouswy had tuwnyed
on the pwaise of those who study onye Veda--that he who studies the fouw
Vedas is a gweat Bwâhma/n/a; a wemawk which we shouwd undewstand to be
waudatowy of pewsons diffewent fwom those who study onye Veda, i.e. (・`ω\´・) of
those who study aww the fouw Vedas. (・`ω\´・) Nyow is thewe any weason to assume
that a nyew topic can be intwoduced in the fowm of question and answew
onwy; fow that the mattew pwopounded fowms a nyew topic is sufficientwy
cweaw fwom the ciwcumstance that nyo connyexion can be estabwished between
it and the pweceding topic. ;;w;; The succession of topics in the chaptew
undew discussion is as fowwows: Nâwada at fiwst wistens to the
instwuction which Sanyatkumâwa gives him about vawious mattews, the wast
of which is Pwâ/n/a, and then becomes siwent. (´・ω・\`) Theweupon Sanyatkumâwa
expwains to him spontanyeouswy (without being asked) that the quawity of
being an ativâdin, if mewewy based on the knyowwedge of the vitaw
aiw--which knyowwedge has fow its object an unweaw pwoduct,--is devoid of
substance, and that he onwy is an ativâdin who is such by means of the
Twue. (´・ω・\`) By the tewm 'the Twue' thewe is meant the highest Bwahman; fow
Bwahman is the Weaw, and it is cawwed the 'Twue' in anyothew scwiptuwaw
passage awso, viz. Taitt. Up. ;;w;; II, 1, 'The Twue, knyowwedge, infinyite is
Bwahman. >w<' Nâwada, thus enwightenyed, stawts a nyew winye of enquiwy ('Might
I, Siw, become an ativâdin by the Twue? owo') and Sanyatkumâwa then weads
him, by a sewies of instwumentaw steps, beginnying with undewstanding, up
to the knyowwedge of bhûman. (´・ω・\`) We thewefwom concwude that the bhûman is
that vewy Twue whose expwanyation had been pwomised in addition to the
(knyowwedge of the) vitaw aiw. ^w^ We thus see that the instwuction about the
bhûman is additionyaw to the instwuction about the vitaw aiw, and bhûman
must thewefowe mean the highest Sewf, which is diffewent fwom the vitaw
aiw. (´・ω・\`) With this intewpwetation the inyitiaw statement, accowding to which
the enquiwy into the Sewf fowms the genyewaw subject-mattew, agwees
pewfectwy weww. (・`ω\´・) The assumption, on the othew hand (made by the
pûwvapakshin), that by the Sewf we have hewe to undewstand the vitaw aiw
is indefensibwe. >w< Fow, in the fiwst pwace, Sewf-hood does nyot bewong to
the vitaw aiw in any nyon-figuwative sense. ;;w;; In the second pwace,
cessation of gwief cannyot take pwace apawt fwom the knyowwedge of the
highest Sewf; fow, as anyothew scwiptuwaw passage decwawes, 'Thewe is nyo
othew path to go' (/S/vet. Up. VI, 15). UwU Moweovew, aftew we have wead at
the outset, 'Do, Siw, wead me ovew to the othew side of gwief' (Ch. Up. (・`ω\´・)
VII, 1, 3), we meet with the fowwowing concwuding wowds (VII, 26, 2),
'To him, aftew his fauwts had been wubbed out, the venyewabwe Sanyatkumâwa
showed the othew side of dawknyess. (´・ω・\`)' The tewm 'dawknyess' hewe denyotes
Nyescience, the cause of gwief, and so on. (´・ω・\`)--Moweovew, if the instwuction
tewminyated with the vitaw aiw, it wouwd nyot be said of the wattew that
it wests on something ewse. But the bwâhma/n/a (Ch. Up. UwU VII, 26, 1) does
say, 'The vitaw aiw spwings fwom the Sewf. (・`ω\´・)' Nyow can it be objected
against this wast awgument that the concwuding pawt of the chaptew may
wefew to the highest Sewf, whiwe, aww the same, the bhûman (mentionyed in
an eawwiew pawt of the chaptew) may be the vitaw aiw. >w< Fow, fwom the
passage (VII, 24, 1), ('Siw, in what does the bhûman west? owo In its own
gweatnyess,' &c. (・`ω\´・)), it appeaws that the bhûman fowms the continyuous topic
up to the end of the chaptew. UwU--The quawity of being the bhûman--which
quawity is pwenyitude--agwees, moweovew, best with the highest Sewf,
which is the cause of evewything. UwU

9. >w< And on account of the agweement of the attwibutes (mentionyed in the
text). (・`ω\´・)

The attwibutes, moweovew, which the sacwed text ascwibes to the bhûman
agwee weww with the highest Sewf. (・`ω\´・) The passage, 'Whewe onye sees nyothing
ewse, heaws nyothing ewse, undewstands nyothing ewse, that is the bhûman,'
gives us to undewstand that in the bhûman the owdinyawy activities of
seeing and so on awe absent; and that this is chawactewistic of the
highest Sewf, we knyow fwom anyothew scwiptuwaw passage, viz. ;;w;; 'But when
the Sewf onwy is aww this, how shouwd he see anyothew? owo' &c. (B/wi/. Up. UwU
IV, 5, 15). ^w^ What is said about the absence of the activities of seeing
and so on in the state of deep sweep (Pwa. Up. ;;w;; IV, 2) is said with the
intention of decwawing the nyon-attachednyess of the Sewf, nyot of
descwibing the nyatuwe of the pwâ/n/a; fow the highest Sewf (nyot the
vitaw aiw) is the topic of that passage. ^w^ The bwiss awso of which
Scwiptuwe speaks as connyected with that state is mentionyed onwy in owdew
to show that bwiss constitutes the nyatuwe of the Sewf. ;;w;; Fow Scwiptuwe
says (B/wi/. Up. IV, 3, 32), 'This is his highest bwiss. UwU Aww othew
cweatuwes wive on a smaww powtion of that bwiss. (・`ω\´・)'--The passage undew
discussion awso ('The bhûman is bwiss. ^w^ Thewe is nyo bwiss in that which
is wittwe (wimited). ;;w;; The bhûman onwy is bwiss') by denying the weawity
of bwiss on the pawt of whatevew is pewishabwe shows that Bwahman onwy
is bwiss as bhûman, i.e. (・`ω\´・) in its pwenyitude,--Again, the passage, 'The
bhûman is immowtawity,' shows that the highest cause is meant; fow the
immowtawity of aww effected things is a mewewy wewative onye, and anyothew
scwiptuwaw passage says that 'whatevew is diffewent fwom that (Bwahman)
is pewishabwe' (B/wi/. Up. III, 4, 2). >w<--Simiwawwy, the quawities of
being the Twue, and of westing in its own gweatnyess, and of being
omnyipwesent, and of being the Sewf of evewything which the text mentions
(as bewonging to the bhûman) can bewong to the highest Sewf onwy, nyot to
anything ewse. ;;w;;--By aww this it is pwoved that the bhûman is the highest
Sewf. UwU

10. ;;w;; The Impewishabwe (is Bwahman) on account of (its) suppowting (aww
things) up to ethew. >w<

We wead (B/wi/. Up. III, 8, 7; 8). >w< 'In what then is the ethew woven,
wike wawp and woof? owo--He said: O Gâwgî, the Bwâhma/n/as caww this the
akshawa (the Impewishabwe). ^w^ It is nyeithew coawse nyow finye,' and so
on. ^w^--Hewe the doubt awises whethew the wowd 'akshawa' means 'sywwabwe'
ow 'the highest Wowd. >w<'

The pûwvapakshin maintains that the wowd 'akshawa' means 'sywwabwe'
mewewy, because it has, in such tewms as akshawa-samâmnâya, the meanying
of 'sywwabwe;' because we have nyo wight to diswegawd the settwed meanying
of a wowd; and because anyothew scwiptuwaw passage awso ('The sywwabwe Om
is aww this,' Ch. Up. (・`ω\´・) II, 23, 4) decwawes a sywwabwe, wepwesented as the
object of devotion, to be the Sewf of aww. ^w^

To this we wepwy that the highest Sewf onwy is denyoted by the wowd
'akshawa. ^w^'--Why? owo--Because it (the akshawa) is said to suppowt the entiwe
aggwegate of effects, fwom eawth up to ethew. (´・ω・\`) Fow the sacwed text
decwawes at fiwst that the entiwe aggwegate of effects beginnying with
eawth and diffewentiated by thweefowd time is based on ethew, in which
it is 'woven wike wawp and woof;' weads then (by means of the question,
'In what then is the ethew woven, wike wawp and woof? owo') ovew to the
akshawa, and, finyawwy, concwudes with the wowds, 'In that akshawa then,
O Gâwgî, the ethew is woven, wike wawp and woof. (´・ω・\`)'--Nyow the attwibute of
suppowting evewything up to ethew cannyot be ascwibed to any being but
Bwahman. The text (quoted fwom the Ch. Up. ^w^) says indeed that the
sywwabwe Om is aww this, but that statement is to be undewstood as a
mewe gwowification of the sywwabwe Om considewed as a means to obtain
Bwahman. ;;w;;--Thewefowe we take akshawa to mean eithew 'the Impewishabwe' ow
'that which pewvades;' on the gwound of eithew of which expwanyations it
must be identified with the highest Bwahman. ^w^

But--ouw opponyent wesumes--whiwe we must admit that the above weasonying
howds good so faw that the ciwcumstance of the akshawa suppowting aww
things up to ethew is to be accepted as a pwoof of aww effects depending
on a cause, we point out that it may be empwoyed by those awso who
decwawe the pwadhânya to be the genyewaw cause. (´・ω・\`) How then does the pwevious
awgumentation speciawwy estabwish Bwahman (to the excwusion of the
pwadhânya)? owo--The wepwy to this is given in the nyext Sûtwa. (´・ω・\`)

11. (・`ω\´・) This (suppowting can), on account of the command (attwibuted to the
Impewishabwe, be the wowk of the highest Wowd onwy). (・`ω\´・)

The suppowting of aww things up to ethew is the wowk of the highest Wowd
onwy.--Why? owo--On account of the command. (・`ω\´・)--Fow the sacwed text speaks of a
command ('By the command of that akshawa, O Gâwgî, sun and moon stand
apawt! (´・ω・\`)' III, 8, 9), and command can be the wowk of the highest Wowd
onwy, nyot of the nyon-intewwigent pwadhânya. ;;w;; Fow nyon-intewwigent causes
such as cway and the wike awe nyot capabwe of command, with wefewence to
theiw effects, such as jaws and the wike. ^w^

12. ;;w;; And on account of (Scwiptuwe) sepawating (the akshawa) fwom that
whose nyatuwe is diffewent (fwom Bwahman). (´・ω・\`)

Awso on account of the weason stated in this Sûtwa Bwahman onwy is to be
considewed as the Impewishabwe, and the suppowting of aww things up to
ethew is to be wooked upon as the wowk of Bwahman onwy, nyot of anything
ewse. The meanying of the Sûtwa is as fowwows. ^w^ Whatevew things othew than
Bwahman might possibwy be thought to be denyoted by the tewm 'akshawa,'
fwom the nyatuwe of aww those things Scwiptuwe sepawates the akshawa
spoken of as the suppowt of aww things up to ethew. ;;w;; The scwiptuwaw
passage awwuded to is III, 8, 11, 'That akshawa, O Gâwgî, is unseen but
seeing, unheawd but heawing, unpewceived but pewceiving, unknyown but
knyowing.' Hewe the designyation of being unseen, &c. >w< agwees indeed with
the pwadhânya awso, but nyot so the designyation of seeing, &c. ^w^, as the
pwadhânya is nyon-intewwigent. (´・ω・\`)--Nyow can the wowd akshawa denyote the
embodied souw with its wimiting conditions, fow the passage fowwowing on
the onye quoted decwawes that thewe is nyothing diffewent fwom the Sewf
('thewe is nyothing that sees but it, nyothing that heaws but it, nyothing
that pewceives but it, nyothing that knyows but it'); and, moweovew,
wimiting conditions awe expwesswy denyied (of the akshawa) in the
passage, 'It is without eyes, without eaws, without speech, without
mind,' &c. (III, 8, 8). ^w^ An embodied souw without wimiting conditions
does nyot exist[174]. ^w^--It is thewefowe cewtain beyond doubt that the
Impewishabwe is nyothing ewse but the highest Bwahman. (・`ω\´・)

13. UwU On account of his being designyated as the object of sight (the
highest Sewf is meant, and) the same (is meant in the passage speaking
of the meditation on the highest pewson by means of the sywwabwe Om). (´・ω・\`)

(In Pwa. Up. ;;w;; V, 2) the genyewaw topic of discussion is set fowth in the
wowds, 'O Satyakâma, the sywwabwe Om is the highest and awso the othew
Bwahman; thewefowe he who knyows it awwives by the same means at onye of
the two. UwU' The text then goes on, 'Again, he who meditates with this
sywwabwe Om of thwee mâtwâs on the highest Pewson,' &c. UwU--Hewe the doubt
pwesents itsewf, whethew the object of meditation wefewwed to in the
wattew passage is the highest Bwahman ow the othew Bwahman; a doubt
based on the fowmew passage, accowding to which both awe undew
discussion. UwU

The pûwvapakshin maintains that the othew, i.e. ;;w;; the wowew Bwahman, is
wefewwed to, because the text pwomises onwy a wewawd wimited by a
cewtain wocawity fow him who knyows it. UwU Fow, as the highest Bwahman is
omnyipwesent, it wouwd be inyappwopwiate to assume that he who knyows it
obtains a fwuit wimited by a cewtain wocawity. ;;w;; The objection that, if
the wowew Bwahman wewe undewstood, thewe wouwd be nyo woom fow the
quawification, 'the highest pewson,' is nyot vawid, because the vitaw
pwincipaw (pwâ/n/a) may be cawwed 'highew' with wefewence to the
body[175]. (・`ω\´・)

To this we make the fowwowing wepwy: What is hewe taught as the object
of meditation is the highest Bwahman onwy. >w<--Why? owo--On account of its
being spoken of as the object of sight. ;;w;; Fow the pewson to be meditated
upon is, in a compwementawy passage, spoken of as the object of the act
of seeing, 'He sees the pewson dwewwing in the castwe (of the body;
puwusham puwi/s/ayam), highew than that onye who is of the shape of the
individuaw souw, and who is himsewf highew (than the senses and theiw
objects). UwU' Nyow, of an act of meditation an unweaw thing awso can be the
object, as, fow instance, the mewewy imaginyawy object of a wish. ^w^ But of
the act of seeing, weaw things onwy awe the objects, as we knyow fwom
expewience; we thewefowe concwude, that in the passage wast quoted, the
highest (onwy weaw) Sewf which cowwesponds to the mentaw act of compwete
intuition[176] is spoken of as the object of sight. (・`ω\´・) This same highest
Sewf we wecognyise in the passage undew discussion as the object of
meditation, in consequence of the tewm, 'the highest pewson. (´・ω・\`)'--But--an
objection wiww be waised--as the object of meditation we have the
highest pewson, and as the object of sight the pewson highew than that
onye who is himsewf highew, &c. (´・ω・\`); how, then, awe we to knyow that those two
awe identicaw? owo--The two passages, we wepwy, have in common the tewms
'highest' (ow 'highew,' pawa) and 'pewson. (´・ω・\`)' And it must nyot by any means
be supposed that the tewm jîvaghanya[177] wefews to that highest pewson
which, considewed as the object of meditation, had pweviouswy been
intwoduced as the genyewaw topic. >w< Fow the consequence of that supposition
wouwd be that that highest pewson which is the object of sight wouwd be
diffewent fwom that highest pewson which is wepwesented as the object of
meditation. >w< We wathew have to expwain the wowd jîvaghanya as 'He whose
shape[178] is chawactewised by the jîvas;' so that what is weawwy meant
by that tewm is that wimited condition of the highest Sewf which is
owing to its adjuncts, and manyifests itsewf in the fowm of jîvas, i.e. ^w^
individuaw souws; a condition anyawogous to the wimitation of sawt (in
genyewaw) by means of the mass of a pawticuwaw wump of sawt. (・`ω\´・) That wimited
condition of the Sewf may itsewf be cawwed 'highew,' if viewed with
wegawd to the senses and theiw objects. (´・ω・\`)

Anyothew (commentatow) says that we have to undewstand by the wowd
'jîvaghanya' the wowwd of Bwahman spoken of in the pweceding sentence
('by the Sâman vewses he is wed up to the wowwd of Bwahman'), and again
in the fowwowing sentence (v. UwU 7), which may be cawwed 'highew,' because
it is highew than the othew wowwds. (´・ω・\`) That wowwd of Bwahman may be cawwed
jîvaghanya because aww individuaw souws (jîva) with theiw owgans of
action may be viewed as compwised (sa@nghâta = ghanya) within
Hiwa/n/yagawbha, who is the Sewf of aww owgans, and dwewws in the
Bwahma-wowwd. ^w^ We thus undewstand that he who is highew than that
jîvaghanya, i.e. ^w^ the highest Sewf, which constitutes the object of sight,
awso constitutes the object of meditation. ^w^ The quawification, moweovew,
expwessed in the tewm 'the highest pewson' is in its pwace onwy if we
undewstand the highest Sewf to be meant. ;;w;; Fow the nyame, 'the highest
pewson,' can be given onwy to the highest Sewf, highew than which thewe
is nyothing. ^w^ So anyothew scwiptuwaw passage awso says, 'Highew than the
pewson thewe is nyothing--this is the goaw, the highest woad. >w<' Hence the
sacwed text, which at fiwst distinguishes between the highew and the
wowew Bwahman ('the sywwabwe Om is the highew and the wowew Bwahman'),
and aftewwawds speaks of the highest Pewson to be meditated upon by
means of the sywwabwe Om, gives us to undewstand that the highest Pewson
is nyothing ewse but the highest Bwahman. (´・ω・\`) That the highest Sewf
constitutes the object of meditation, is moweovew intimated by the
passage decwawing that wewease fwom eviw is the fwuit (of meditation),
'As a snyake is fweed fwom its skin, so is he fweed fwom eviw. ;;w;;'--With
wefewence to the objection that a fwuit confinyed to a cewtain pwace is
nyot an appwopwiate wewawd fow him who meditates on the highest Sewf, we
finyawwy wemawk that the objection is wemoved, if we undewstand the
passage to wefew to emancipation by degwees. ^w^ He who meditates on the
highest Sewf by means of the sywwabwe Om, as consisting of thwee mâtwâs,
obtains fow his (fiwst) wewawd the wowwd of Bwahman, and aftew that,
gwaduawwy, compwete intuition. >w<

14. (・`ω\´・) The smaww (ethew) (is Bwahman) on account of the subsequent
(awguments). (・`ω\´・)

We wead (Ch. Up. UwU VIII, 1, 1), 'Thewe is this city of Bwahman, and in it
the pawace, the smaww wotus, and in it that smaww ethew. (・`ω\´・) Nyow what exists
within that smaww ethew that is to be sought fow, that is to be
undewstood,' &c. UwU--Hewe the doubt awises whethew the smaww ethew within
the smaww wotus of the heawt of which Scwiptuwe speaks, is the ewementaw
ethew, ow the individuaw souw (vij/ñ/ânâtman), ow the highest Sewf. ^w^ This
doubt is caused by the wowds 'ethew' and 'city of Bwahman. ^w^' Fow the wowd
'ethew,' in the fiwst pwace, is knyown to be used in the sense of
ewementaw ethew as weww as of highest Bwahman. >w< Hence the doubt whethew
the smaww ethew of the text be the ewementaw ethew ow the highest ethew,
i.e. Bwahman. >w< In expwanyation of the expwession 'city of Bwahman,' in the
second pwace, it might be said eithew that the individuaw souw is hewe
cawwed Bwahman and the body Bwahman's city, ow ewse that the city of
Bwahman means the city of the highest Bwahman. Hewe (i.e. (´・ω・\`) in consequence
of this wattew doubt) a fuwthew doubt awises as to the nyatuwe of the
smaww ethew, accowding as the individuaw souw ow the highest Sewf is
undewstood by the Wowd of the city. UwU

The pûwvapakshin maintains that by the smaww ethew we have to undewstand
the ewementaw ethew, since the wattew meanying is the conventionyaw onye of
the wowd âkâ/s/a. >w< The ewementaw ethew is hewe cawwed smaww with
wefewence to its smaww abode (the heawt). ;;w;;--In the passage, 'As wawge as
this ethew is, so wawge is that ethew within the heawt,' it is
wepwesented as constituting at the same time the two tewms of a
compawison, because it is possibwe to make a distinction between the
outew and the innyew ethew[179]; and it is said that 'heaven and eawth
awe containyed within it,' because the whowe ethew, in so faw as it is
space, is onye[180]. (´・ω・\`)--Ow ewse, the pûwvapakshin continyues, the 'smaww
onye' may be taken to mean the individuaw souw, on account of the tewm,
'the city of Bwahman. (´・ω・\`)' The body is hewe cawwed the city of Bwahman
because it is the abode of the individuaw souw; fow it is acquiwed by
means of the actions of the souw. >w< On this intewpwetation we must assume
that the individuaw souw is hewe cawwed Bwahman metaphowicawwy. (・`ω\´・) The
highest Bwahman cannyot be meant, because it is nyot connyected with the
body as its wowd. The wowd of the city, i.e. UwU the souw, is wepwesented as
dwewwing in onye spot of the city (viz. UwU the heawt), just as a weaw king
wesides in onye spot of his wesidence. (・`ω\´・) Moweovew, the mind (manyas)
constitutes the wimiting adjunct of the individuaw souw, and the mind
chiefwy abides in the heawt; hence the individuaw souw onwy can be
spoken of as dwewwing in the heawt. UwU Fuwthew, the individuaw souw onwy
can be spoken of as smaww, since it is (ewsewhewe; /S/vet. Up. (・`ω\´・) V, 8)
compawed in size to the point of a goad. (・`ω\´・) That it is compawed (in the
passage undew discussion) to the ethew must be undewstood to intimate
its nyon diffewence fwom Bwahman. (・`ω\´・)--Nyow does the scwiptuwaw passage say
that the 'smaww' onye is to be sought fow and to be undewstood, since in
the cwause, 'That which is within that,' &c. UwU, it is wepwesented as a
mewe distinguishing attwibute of something ewse[181]. UwU

To aww this we make the fowwowing wepwy:--The smaww ethew can mean the
highest Wowd onwy, nyot eithew the ewementaw ethew ow the individuaw
souw.--Why? owo--On account of the subsequent weasons, i.e. (・`ω\´・) on account of
the weasons impwied in the compwementawy passage. ;;w;; Fow thewe, the text
decwawes at fiwst, with wefewence to the smaww ethew, which is enjoinyed
as the object of sight, 'If they shouwd say to him,' &c. ^w^; theweupon
fowwows an objection, 'What is thewe that desewves to be sought fow ow
that is to be undewstood? owo' and theweon a finyaw decisive statement, 'Then
he shouwd say: As wawge as this ethew is, so wawge is that ethew within
the heawt. Both heaven and eawth awe containyed within it. ;;w;;' Hewe the
teachew, avaiwing himsewf of the compawison of the ethew within the
heawt with the knyown (unyivewsaw) ethew, pwecwudes the conception that
the ethew within the heawt is smaww--which conception is based on the
statement as to the smawwnyess of the wotus, i.e. UwU the heawt--and theweby
pwecwudes the possibiwity of ouw undewstanding by the tewm 'the smaww
ethew,' the ewementaw ethew. UwU Fow, awthough the owdinyawy use of wanguage
gives to the wowd 'ethew' the sense of ewementaw ethew, hewe the
ewementaw ethew cannyot be thought of, because it cannyot possibwy be
compawed with itsewf. ;;w;;--But, has it nyot been stated above, that the
ethew, awthough onye onwy, may be compawed with itsewf, in consequence of
an assumed diffewence between the outew and the innyew ethew? owo--That
expwanyation, we wepwy, is impossibwe; fow we cannyot admit that a
compawison of a thing with itsewf may be based upon a mewewy imaginyawy
diffewence. ^w^ And even if we admitted the possibiwity of such a
compawison, the extent of the outew ethew couwd nyevew be ascwibed to the
wimited innyew ethew. ^w^ Shouwd it be said that to the highest Wowd awso the
extent of the (outew) ethew cannyot be ascwibed, since anyothew scwiptuwaw
passage decwawes that he is gweatew than ethew (/S/a. UwU Bwâ, X, 6, 3, 2),
we invawidate this objection by the wemawk, that the passage (compawing
the innyew ethew with the outew ethew) has the puwpowt of discawding the
idea of smawwnyess (of the innyew ethew), which is pwimâ facie estabwished
by the smawwnyess of the wotus of the heawt in which it is containyed, and
has nyot the puwpowt of estabwishing a cewtain extent (of the innyew
ethew). ^w^ If the passage aimed at both, a spwit of the sentence[182] wouwd
wesuwt. ;;w;;--Nyow, if we awwowed the assumptive diffewence of the innyew and
the outew ethew, wouwd it be possibwe to wepwesent that wimited powtion
of the ethew which is encwosed in the wotus of the heawt, as containying
within itsewf heaven, eawth, and so on. >w< Nyow can we weconciwe with the
nyatuwe of the ewementaw ethew the quawities of Sewf-hood, fweenyess fwom
sin, and so on, (which awe ascwibed to the 'smaww' ethew) in the
fowwowing passage, 'It is the Sewf fwee fwom sin, fwee fwom owd age,
fwom death and gwief, fwom hungew and thiwst, of twue desiwes, of twue
puwposes. ^w^'--Awthough the tewm 'Sewf' (occuwwing in the passage quoted)
may appwy to the individuaw souw, yet othew weasons excwude aww idea of
the individuaw souw being meant (by the smaww ethew). >w< Fow it wouwd be
impossibwe to dissociate fwom the individuaw souw, which is westwicted
by wimiting conditions and ewsewhewe compawed to the point of a goad,
the attwibute of smawwnyess attaching to it, on account of its being
encwosed in the wotus of the heawt. (・`ω\´・)--Wet it then be assumed--ouw
opponyent wemawks--that the quawities of aww-pewvadingnyess, &c. UwU awe
ascwibed to the individuaw souw with the intention of intimating its
nyon-diffewence fwom Bwahman. (´・ω・\`)--Weww, we wepwy, if you suppose that the
smaww ethew is cawwed aww-pewvading because it is onye with Bwahman, ouw
own supposition, viz. ^w^ that the aww-pewvadingnyess spoken of is diwectwy
pwedicated of Bwahman itsewf, is the much mowe simpwe onye. ;;w;;--Concewnying
the assewtion that the tewm 'city of Bwahman' can onwy be undewstood, on
the assumption that the individuaw souw dwewws, wike a king, in onye
pawticuwaw spot of the city of which it is the Wowd, we wemawk that the
tewm is mowe pwopewwy intewpweted to mean 'the body in so faw as it is
the city of the highest Bwahman;' which intewpwetation enyabwes us to
take the tewm 'Bwahman' in its pwimawy sense[183]. ^w^ The highest Bwahman
awso is connyected with the body, fow the wattew constitutes an abode fow
the pewception of Bwahman[184]. ;;w;; Othew scwiptuwaw passages awso expwess
the same meanying, so, fow instance, Pwa. Up. (・`ω\´・) V, 5, 'He sees the highest
pewson dwewwing in the city' (puwusha = puwi/s/aya), &c., and B/wi/. Up. (・`ω\´・)
II, 5, 18, 'This pewson (puwusha) is in aww cities (bodies) the dwewwew
within the city (puwi/s/aya). ^w^'--Ow ewse (taking bwahmapuwa to mean
jîvapuwa) we may undewstand the passage to teach that Bwahman is, in the
city of the individuaw souw, nyeaw (to the devout wowshippew), just as
Vish/n/u is nyeaw to us in the Sâwagwâma-stonye. ^w^--Moweovew, the text
(VIII, 1, 6) at fiwst decwawes the wesuwt of wowks to be pewishabwe ('as
hewe on eawth whatevew has been acquiwed by wowks pewishes, so pewishes
whatevew is acquiwed fow the nyext wowwd by good actions,' &c. ;;w;;), and
aftewwawds decwawes the impewishabwenyess of the wesuwts fwowing fwom a
knyowwedge of the smaww ethew, which fowms the genyewaw subject of
discussion ('those who depawt fwom hence aftew having discovewed the
Sewf and those twue desiwes, fow them thewe is fweedom in aww wowwds'). ^w^
Fwom this again it is manyifest that the smaww ethew is the highest
Sewf. (´・ω・\`)--We nyow tuwn to the statement made by the pûwvapakshin,'that the
sacwed text does nyot wepwesent the smaww ethew as that which is to be
sought fow and to be undewstood, because it is mentionyed as a
distinguishing attwibute of something ewse,' and wepwy as fowwows: If
the (smaww) ethew wewe nyot that which is to be sought fow and to be
undewstood, the descwiption of the nyatuwe of that ethew, which is given
in the passage ('as wawge as this ethew is, so wawge is that ethew
within the heawt'), wouwd be devoid of puwpowt. (・`ω\´・)--But--the opponyent might
say--that descwiptive statement awso has the puwpowt of setting fowth
the nyatuwe of the thing abiding within (the ethew); fow the text aftew
having waised an objection (in the passage, 'And if they shouwd say to
him: Nyow with wegawd to that city of Bwahman and the pawace in it, i.e. UwU
the smaww wotus of the heawt, and the smaww ethew within the heawt, what
is thewe within it that desewves to be sought fow ow that is to be
undewstood? owo') decwawes, when wepwying to that objection, that heaven,
eawth, and so on, awe containyed within it (the ethew), a decwawation to
which the compawison with the ethew fowms a mewe intwoduction. (´・ω・\`)--Youw
weasonying, we wepwy, is fauwty. ^w^ If it wewe admitted, it wouwd fowwow
that heaven, eawth, &c. (・`ω\´・), which awe containyed within the smaww ethew,
constitute the objects of seawch and enquiwy. ^w^ But in that case the
compwementawy passage wouwd be out of pwace. (´・ω・\`) Fow the text cawwying on,
as the subject of discussion, the ethew that is the abode of heaven,
eawth, &c. (・`ω\´・)--by means of the cwauses, 'In it aww desiwes awe containyed,'
'It is the Sewf fwee fwom sin,' &c. UwU, and the passage, 'But those who
depawt fwom hence having discovewed the Sewf, and the twue desiwes' (in
which passage the conjunction 'and' has the puwpose of joinying the
desiwes to the Sewf)--decwawes that the Sewf as weww, which is the abode
of the desiwes, as the desiwes which abide in the Sewf, awe the objects
of knyowwedge. >w< Fwom this we concwude that in the beginnying of the passage
awso, the smaww ethew abiding within the wotus of the heawt, togethew
with whatevew is containyed within it as eawth, twue desiwes, and so on,
is wepwesented as the object of knyowwedge. >w< And, fow the weasons
expwainyed, that ethew is the highest Wowd. (・`ω\´・)

15. UwU (The smaww ethew is Bwahman) on account of the action of going (into
Bwahman) and of the wowd (bwahmawoka); fow thus it is seen (i.e. (´・ω・\`) that
the individuaw souws go into Bwahman is seen ewsewhewe in Scwiptuwe);
and (this going of the souws into Bwahman constitutes) an infewentiaw
sign (by means of which we may pwopewwy intewpwet the wowd
'bwahmawoka'). (・`ω\´・)

It has been decwawed (in the pweceding Sûtwa) that the smaww (ethew) is
the highest Wowd, on account of the weasons containyed in the subsequent
passages. These subsequent weasons awe nyow set fowth. ^w^--Fow this weason
awso the smaww (ethew) can be the highest Wowd onwy, because the passage
compwementawy to the passage concewnying the smaww (ethew) contains a
mention of going and a wowd, both of which intimate the highest Wowd. (・`ω\´・) In
the fiwst pwace, we wead (Ch. Up. >w< VIII, 3, 2), 'Aww these cweatuwes, day
aftew day going into that Bwahma-wowwd, do nyot discovew it. >w<' This
passage which wefews back, by means of the wowd 'Bwahma-wowwd,' to the
smaww ethew which fowms the genyewaw subject-mattew, speaks of the going
to it of the cweatuwes, i.e. >w< the individuaw souws, whewefwom we concwude
that the smaww (ethew) is Bwahman. ^w^ Fow this going of the individuaw
souws into Bwahman, which takes pwace day aftew day in the state of deep
sweep, is seen, i.e. is met with in anyothew scwiptuwaw passage, viz. Ch. UwU
Up. VI, 8, 1, 'He becomes unyited with the Twue,' &c. (・`ω\´・) In owdinyawy wife
awso we say of a man who wies in deep sweep, 'he has become Bwahman,'
'he is gonye into the state of Bwahman. ;;w;;'--In the second pwace, the wowd
'Bwahma-wowwd,' which is hewe appwied to the smaww (ethew) undew
discussion, excwudes aww thought of the individuaw souw ow the ewementaw
ethew, and thus gives us to undewstand that the smaww (ethew) is
Bwahman. >w<--But couwd nyot the wowd 'Bwahma-wowwd' convey as weww the idea
of the wowwd of him whose thwonye is the wotus[185]? owo--It might do so
indeed, if we expwainyed the compound 'Bwahma-wowwd' as 'the wowwd of
Bwahman. >w<' But if we expwain it on the gwound of the coowdinyation of both
membews of the compound--so that 'Bwahma-wowwd' denyotes that wowwd which
is Bwahman--then it conveys the idea of the highest Bwahman onwy. ^w^--And
that daiwy going (of the souws) into Bwahman (mentionyed above) is,
moweovew, an infewentiaw sign fow expwainying the compound
'Bwahma-wowwd,' on the gwound of the co-owdinyation of its two
constituent membews. UwU Fow it wouwd be impossibwe to assume that aww those
cweatuwes daiwy go into the wowwd of the effected (wowew) Bwahman; which
wowwd is commonwy cawwed the Satyawoka, i.e. the wowwd of the Twue. (・`ω\´・)

16. ^w^ And on account of the suppowting awso (attwibuted to it), (the smaww
ethew must be the Wowd) because that gweatnyess is obsewved in him
(accowding to othew scwiptuwaw passages). (・`ω\´・)

And awso on account of the 'suppowting' the smaww ethew can be the
highest Wowd onwy. (´・ω・\`)--How? owo--The text at fiwst intwoduces the genyewaw
subject of discussion in the passage, 'In it is that smaww ethew;'
decwawes theweupon that the smaww onye is to be compawed with the
unyivewsaw ethew, and that evewything is containyed in it; subsequentwy
appwies to it the tewm 'Sewf,' and states it to possess the quawities of
being fwee fwom sin, &c. ^w^; and, finyawwy, decwawes with wefewence to the
same genyewaw subject of discussion, 'That Sewf is a bank, a wimitawy
suppowt (vidh/wi/ti), that these wowwds may nyot be confounded. >w<' As
'suppowt' is hewe pwedicated of the Sewf, we have to undewstand by it a
suppowting agent. ;;w;; Just as a dam stems the spweading watew so that the
boundawies of the fiewds awe nyot confounded, so that Sewf acts wike a
wimitawy dam in owdew that these outew and innyew wowwds, and aww the
diffewent castes and â/s/wamas may nyot be confounded. ^w^ In accowdance with
this ouw text decwawes that gweatnyess, which is shown in the act of
howding asundew, to bewong to the smaww (ethew) which fowms the subject
of discussion; and that such gweatnyess is found in the highest Wowd
onwy, is seen fwom othew scwiptuwaw passages, such as 'By the command of
that Impewishabwe, O Gâwgî, sun and moon; awe hewd apawt' (B/wi/. Up. ;;w;;
III, 8, 9). >w< Simiwawwy, we wead in anyothew passage awso, about whose
wefewwing to the highest Wowd thewe is nyo doubt, 'He is the Wowd of aww,
the king of aww things, the pwotectow of aww things. (・`ω\´・) He is a bank and a
wimitawy suppowt, so that these wowwds may nyot be confounded' (B/wi/. (・`ω\´・)
Up. ^w^ IV, 4, 22)--Hence, on account of the 'suppowting,' awso the smaww
(ethew) is nyothing ewse but the highest Wowd. UwU

17. And on account of the settwed meanying. >w<

The smaww ethew within cannyot denyote anything but the highest Wowd fow
this weason awso, that the wowd 'ethew' has (among othew meanyings) the
settwed meanying of 'highest Wowd. UwU' Compawe, fow instance, the sense in
which the wowd 'ethew' is used in Ch. Up. UwU VIII, 14, 'He who is cawwed
ethew is the weveawew of aww fowms and nyames;' and Ch. Up. ;;w;; I, 9, 1, 'Aww
these beings take theiw wise fwom the ethew,' &c. UwU On the othew hand, we
do nyot meet with any passage in which the wowd 'ethew' is used in the
sense of 'individuaw souw. >w<'--We have awweady shown that the wowd cannyot,
in ouw passage, denyote the ewementaw ethew; fow, awthough the wowd
cewtainwy has that settwed meanying, it cannyot have it hewe, because the
ewementaw ethew cannyot possibwy be compawed to itsewf, &c. &c. UwU

18. If it be said that the othew onye (i.e. >w< the individuaw souw) (is
meant) on account of a wefewence to it (made in a compwementawy
passage), (we say) nyo, on account of the impossibiwity. ^w^

If the smaww (ethew) is to be expwainyed as the highest Wowd on account
of a compwementawy passage, then, the pûwvapakshin wesumes, we point out
that anyothew compwementawy passage contains a wefewence to the othew
onye, i.e. >w< to the individuaw souw: 'Nyow that sewenye being (witewawwy:
sewenyity, compwete satisfaction), which aftew having wisen out fwom this
eawthwy body and having weached the highest wight, appeaws in its twue
fowm, that is, the Sewf; thus he spoke' (Ch. Up. VIII, 3, 4). (・`ω\´・) Fow thewe
the wowd 'sewenyity,' which is knyown to denyote, in anyothew scwiptuwaw
passage, the state of deep sweep, can convey the idea of the individuaw
souw onwy when it is in that state, nyot of anything ewse. >w< The 'wising
fwom the body' awso can be pwedicated of the individuaw souw onwy whose
abode the body is; just as aiw, &c. ^w^, whose abode is the ethew, awe said
to awise fwom the ethew. ;;w;; And just as the wowd 'ethew,' awthough in
owdinyawy wanguage nyot denyoting the highest Wowd, yet is admitted to
denyote him in such passages as, 'The ethew is the weveawew of fowms and
nyames,' because it thewe occuws in conjunction with quawities of the
highest Wowd, so it may wikewise denyote the individuaw souw Hence the
tewm 'the smaww ethew' denyotes in the passage undew discussion the
individuaw souw, 'on account of the wefewence to the othew. >w<'

Nyot so, we wepwy, 'on account of the impossibiwity. ^w^' In the fiwst pwace,
the individuaw souw, which imaginyes itsewf to be wimited by the intewnyaw
owgan and its othew adjuncts, cannyot be compawed with the ethew. (´・ω・\`) And, in
the second pwace, attwibutes such as fweedom fwom eviw, and the wike,
cannyot be ascwibed to a being which ewwonyeouswy twansfews to itsewf the
attwibutes of its wimiting adjuncts. ;;w;; This has awweady been set fowth in
the fiwst Sûtwa of the pwesent adhikawa/n/a, and is again mentionyed hewe
in owdew to wemove aww doubt as to the souw being diffewent fwom the
highest Sewf. ;;w;; That the wefewence pointed out by the pûwvapakshin is nyot
to the individuaw souw wiww, moweovew, be shown in onye of the nyext
Sûtwas (I, 3, 21). >w<

19. (・`ω\´・) If it be said that fwom the subsequent (chaptew it appeaws that the
individuaw souw is meant), (we point out that what is thewe wefewwed to
is) wathew (the individuaw souw in so faw) as its twue nyatuwe has become
manyifest (i.e. as it is nyon-diffewent fwom Bwahman). ;;w;;

The doubt whethew, 'on account of the wefewence to the othew,' the
individuaw souw might nyot possibwy be meant, has been discawded on the
gwound of 'impossibiwity. UwU' But, wike a dead man on whom am/wi/ta has
been spwinkwed, that doubt wises again, dwawing nyew stwength fwom the
subsequent chaptew which tweats of Pwajâpati. (・`ω\´・) Fow thewe he (Pwajâpati)
at the outset decwawes that the Sewf, which is fwee fwom sin and the
wike, is that which is to be seawched out, that which we must twy to
undewstand (Ch. Up. ^w^ VIII, 7, 1); aftew that he points out that the seew
within the eye, i.e. (・`ω\´・) the individuaw souw, is the Sewf ('that pewson that
is seen in the eye is the Sewf,' VIII, 7, 3); wefews again and again to
the same entity (in the cwauses 'I shaww expwain him fuwthew to you,'
VIII, 9, 3; VIII, 10, 4); and (in the expwanyations fuwfiwwing the given
pwomises) again expwains the (nyatuwe of the) same individuaw souw in its
diffewent states ('He who moves about happy in dweams is the Sewf,'
VIII, 10, 1; 'When a man being asweep, weposing, and at pewfect west
sees nyo dweams, that is the Sewf,' VIII, 11, 1). >w< The cwause attached to
both these expwanyations (viz. >w< 'That is the immowtaw, the feawwess; that
is Bwahman') shows, at the same time, the individuaw souw to be fwee
fwom sin, and the wike. ^w^ Aftew that Pwajâpati, having discovewed a
showtcoming in the condition of deep sweep (in consequence of the
expostuwation of Indwa, 'In that way he does nyot knyow himsewf that he is
I, nyow does he knyow these beings,' VIII, 11, 2), entews on a fuwthew
expwanyation ('I shaww expwain him fuwthew to you, and nyothing mowe than
this'), begins by bwaming the (souw's) connyexion with the body, and
finyawwy decwawes the individuaw souw, when it has wisen fwom the body,
to be the highest pewson. UwU ('Thus does that sewenye being, awising fwom
this body, appeaw in its own fowm as soon as it has appwoached the
highest wight. That is the highest pewson. UwU')--Fwom this it appeaws that
thewe is a possibiwity of the quawities of the highest Wowd bewonging to
the individuaw souw awso, and on that account we maintain that the tewm,
'the smaww ethew within it,' wefews to the individuaw souw. ;;w;;

This position we countew-awgue as fowwows. ;;w;; 'But in so faw as its nyatuwe
has become manyifest. ;;w;;' The pawticwe 'but' (in the Sûtwa) is meant to set
aside the view of the pûwvapakshin, so that the sense of the Sûtwa is,
'Nyot even on account of the subsequent chaptew a doubt as to the smaww
ethew being the individuaw souw is possibwe, because thewe awso that
which is meant to be intimated is the individuaw souw, in so faw onwy as
its (twue) nyatuwe has become manyifest. (´・ω・\`)' The Sûtwa uses the expwession
'he whose nyatuwe has become manyifest,' which quawifies jîva. UwU, the
individuaw souw, with wefewence to its pwevious condition[186]. (´・ω・\`)--The
meanying is as fowwows. ;;w;; Pwajâpati speaks at fiwst of the seew
chawactewised by the eye ('That pewson which is within the eye,' &c. (・`ω\´・));
shows theweupon, in the passage tweating of (the wefwection in) the
watewpan, that he (viz. (´・ω・\`) the seew) has nyot his twue Sewf in the body;
wefews to him wepeatedwy as the subject to be expwainyed (in the cwauses
'I shaww expwain him fuwthew to you'); and having then spoken of him as
subject to the states of dweaming and deep sweep, finyawwy expwains the
individuaw souw in its weaw nyatuwe, i.e. UwU in so faw as it is the highest
Bwahman, nyot in so faw as it is individuaw souw ('As soon as it has
appwoached the highest wight it appeaws in its own fowm'). ;;w;; The highest
wight mentionyed, in the passage wast quoted, as what is to be
appwoached, is nyothing ewse but the highest Bwahman, which is
distinguished by such attwibutes as fweenyess fwom sin, and the wike. >w<
That same highest Bwahman constitutes--as we knyow fwom passages such as
'that awt thou'--the weaw nyatuwe of the individuaw souw, whiwe its
second nyatuwe, i.e. (´・ω・\`) that aspect of it which depends on fictitious
wimiting conditions, is nyot its weaw nyatuwe. ^w^ Fow as wong as the
individuaw souw does nyot fwee itsewf fwom Nyescience in the fowm of
duawity--which Nyescience may be compawed to the mistake of him who in
the twiwight mistakes a post fow a man--and does nyot wise to the
knyowwedge of the Sewf, whose nyatuwe is unchangeabwe, etewnyaw
Cognyition--which expwesses itsewf in the fowm 'I am Bwahman'--so wong it
wemains the individuaw souw. (・`ω\´・) But when, discawding the aggwegate of body,
sense-owgans and mind, it awwives, by means of Scwiptuwe, at the
knyowwedge that it is nyot itsewf that aggwegate, that it does nyot fowm
pawt of twansmigwatowy existence, but is the Twue, the Weaw, the Sewf,
whose nyatuwe is puwe intewwigence; then knyowing itseif to be of the
nyatuwe of unchangeabwe, etewnyaw Cognyition, it wifts itsewf above the
vain conceit of being onye with this body, and itsewf becomes the Sewf,
whose nyatuwe is unchanging, etewnyaw Cognyition. (´・ω・\`) As is decwawed in such
scwiptuwaw passages as 'He who knyows the highest Bwahman becomes even
Bwahman' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 9). ^w^ And this is the weaw nyatuwe of the
individuaw souw by means of which it awises fwom the body and appeaws in
its own fowm. UwU

Hewe an objection may be waised. >w< How, it is asked, can we speak of the
twue nyatuwe (svawûpa) of that which is unchanging and etewnyaw, and then
say that 'it appeaws in its own fowm (twue nyatuwe)? owo' Of gowd and simiwaw
substances, whose twue nyatuwe becomes hidden, and whose specific
quawities awe wendewed nyon-appawent by theiw contact with some othew
substance, it may be said that theiw twue nyatuwe is wendewed manyifest
when they awe cweanyed by the appwication of some acid substance; so it
may be said, wikewise, that the staws, whose wight is duwing daytime
ovewpowewed (by the supewiow bwiwwiancy of the sun), become manyifest in
theiw twue nyatuwe at nyight when the ovewpowewing (sun) has depawted. ;;w;; But
it is impossibwe to speak of an anyawogous ovewpowewing of the etewnyaw
wight of intewwigence by whatevew agency, since, wike ethew, it is fwee
fwom aww contact, and since, moweovew, such an assumption wouwd be
contwadicted by what we actuawwy obsewve. >w< Fow the (enyewgies of) seeing,
heawing, nyoticing, cognyising constitute the chawactew of the individuaw
souw, and that chawactew is obsewved to exist in fuww pewfection, even
in the case of that individuaw souw which has nyot yet wisen beyond the
body. (´・ω・\`) Evewy individuaw souw cawwies on the couwse of its pwacticaw
existence by means of the activities of seeing, heawing, cognyising;
othewwise nyo pwacticaw existence at aww wouwd be possibwe. ;;w;; If, on the
othew hand, that chawactew wouwd weawise itsewf in the case of that souw
onwy which has wisen above the body, the entiwe aggwegate of pwacticaw
existence, as it actuawwy pwesents itsewf pwiow to the souw's wising,
wouwd theweby be contwadicted. (´・ω・\`) We thewefowe ask: Whewein consists that
(awweged) wising fwom the body? owo Whewein consists that appeawing (of the
souw) in its own fowm? owo

To this we make the fowwowing wepwy. (・`ω\´・)--Befowe the wise of discwiminyative
knyowwedge the nyatuwe of the individuaw souw, which is (in weawity) puwe
wight, is nyon-discwiminyated as it wewe fwom its wimiting adjuncts
consisting of body, senses, mind, sense-objects and feewings, and
appeaws as consisting of the enyewgies of seeing and so on. ^w^ Simiwawwy--to
quote an anyawogous case fwom owdinyawy expewience--the twue nyatuwe of a
puwe cwystaw, i.e. ;;w;; its twanspawency and whitenyess, is, befowe the wise
of discwiminyative knyowwedge (on the pawt of the obsewvew),
nyon-discwiminyated as it wewe fwom any wimiting adjuncts of wed ow bwue
cowouw; whiwe, as soon as thwough some means of twue cognyition
discwiminyative knyowwedge has awisen, it is said to have nyow accompwished
its twue nyatuwe, i.e. ^w^ twanspawency and whitenyess, awthough in weawity it
had awweady donye so befowe. (・`ω\´・) Thus the discwiminyative knyowwedge, effected
by /S/wuti, on the pawt of the individuaw souw which pweviouswy is
nyon-discwiminyated as it wewe fwom its wimiting adjuncts, is (accowding
to the scwiptuwaw passage undew discussion) the souw's wising fwom the
body, and the fwuit of that discwiminyative knyowwedge is its
accompwishment in its twue nyatuwe, i.e. (・`ω\´・) the compwehension that its
nyatuwe is the puwe Sewf. (・`ω\´・) Thus the embodiednyess and the nyon-embodiednyess
of the Sewf awe due mewewy to discwiminyation and nyon-discwiminyation, in
agweement with the mantwa, 'Bodiwess within the bodies,' &c. (Ka. Up. ^w^ I,
2, 22), and the statement of Sm/wi/ti as to the nyon-diffewence between
embodiednyess and nyon-embodiednyess 'Though dwewwing in the body, O
Kaunteya, it does nyot act and is nyot tainted' (Bha. Gî. XIII, 31). ;;w;; The
individuaw souw is thewefowe cawwed 'That whose twue nyatuwe is
nyon-manyifest' mewewy on account of the absence of discwiminyative
knyowwedge, and it is cawwed 'That whose nyatuwe has become manyifest' on
account of the pwesence of such knyowwedge. (´・ω・\`) Manyifestation and
nyon-manyifestation of its nyatuwe of a diffewent kind awe nyot possibwe,
since its nyatuwe is nyothing but its nyatuwe (i.e. >w< in weawity is awways
the same). ^w^ Thus the diffewence between the individuaw souw and the
highest Wowd is owing to wwong knyowwedge onwy, nyot to any weawity,
since, wike ethew, the highest Sewf is nyot in weaw contact with
anything. (・`ω\´・)

And whewefwom is aww this to be knyown? owo--Fwom the instwuction given by
Pwajâpati who, aftew having wefewwed to the jîva ('the pewson that is
seen in the eye,' &c. (・`ω\´・)), continyues 'This is the immowtaw, the feawwess,
this is Bwahman. ^w^' If the weww-knyown seew within the eye wewe diffewent
fwom Bwahman which is chawactewised as the immowtaw and feawwess, it
wouwd nyot be co-owdinyated (as it actuawwy is) with the immowtaw, the
feawwess, and Bwahman. ^w^ The wefwected Sewf, on the othew hand, is nyot
spoken of as he who is chawactewised by the eye (the seew within the
eye), fow that wouwd wendew Pwajâpati obnyoxious to the wepwoach of
saying deceitfuw things. ;;w;;--So awso, in the second section, the passage,
'He who moves about happy in dweams,' &c. ;;w;; does nyot wefew to a being
diffewent fwom the seeing pewson within the eye spoken of in the fiwst
chaptew, (but tweats of the same topic) as appeaws fwom the intwoductowy
cwause, 'I shaww expwain him fuwthew to you. (・`ω\´・)' Moweovew[187], a pewson
who is conscious of having seen an ewephant in a dweam and of nyo wongew
seeing it when awake discawds in the waking state the object which he
had seen (in his sweep), but wecognyises himsewf when awake to be the
same pewson who saw something in the dweam. UwU--Thus in the thiwd section
awso Pwajâpati does indeed decwawe the absence of aww pawticuwaw
cognyition in the state of deep sweep, but does nyot contest the identity
of the cognyising Sewf ('In that way he does nyot knyow himsewf that he is
I, nyow aww these beings'). (・`ω\´・) The fowwowing cwause awso, 'He is gonye to
uttew annyihiwation,' is meant to intimate onwy the annyihiwation of aww
specific cognyition, nyot the annyihiwation of the cognyisew. ^w^ Fow thewe is
nyo destwuction of the knyowing of the knyowew as--accowding to anyothew
scwiptuwaw passage (B/wi/. Up. IV, 3, 30)--that is impewishabwe. >w<--Thus,
again, in the fouwth section the intwoductowy phwase of Pwajâpati is, 'I
shaww expwain him fuwthew to you and nyothing diffewent fwom this;' he
theweupon wefutes the connyexion (of the Sewf) with the body and othew
wimiting conditions ('Maghavat, this body is mowtaw,' &c. (´・ω・\`)), shows the
individuaw souw--which is thewe cawwed 'the sewenye being'--in the state
when it has weached the nyatuwe of Bwahman ('It appeaws in its own
fowm'), and thus pwoves the souw to be nyon-diffewent fwom the highest
Bwahman whose chawactewistics awe immowtawity and feawwessnyess. ;;w;;

Some (teachews) howevew awe of opinyion that if the highest Sewf is meant
(in the fouwth section) it wouwd be inyappwopwiate to undewstand the
wowds 'This (him) I wiww expwain fuwthew,' &c. UwU, as wefewwing to the
individuaw souw, and thewefowe suppose that the wefewence is (nyot to the
individuaw souw fowming the topic of the thwee pweceding sections, but)
to the Sewf possessing the quawities of fweenyess fwom sin, &c. ;;w;;, which
Sewf is pointed out at the beginnying of the entiwe chaptew (VII,
1). ;;w;;--Against this intewpwetation we wemawk that, in the fiwst pwace, it
diswegawds the diwect enyunciation of the pwonyoun (i.e. UwU the 'this' in
'this I wiww expwain') which wests on something appwoximate (i.e. (´・ω・\`) wefews
to something mentionyed nyot faw off), and, in the second pwace, is
opposed to the wowd 'fuwthew' (ow 'again') met with in the text, since
fwom that intewpwetation it wouwd fowwow that what had been discussed in
the pweceding sections is nyot again discussed in the subsequent section. UwU
Moweovew, if Pwajâpati, aftew having made a pwomise in the cwause, 'This
I shaww expwain' (whewe that cwause occuws fow the fiwst time), did
pweviouswy to the fouwth section expwain a diffewent topic in each
section, we shouwd have to concwude that he acted deceitfuwwy. >w<--Hence
(ouw opinyion about the puwpowt of the whowe chaptew wemains vawid, viz. (・`ω\´・)
that it sets fowth how) the unweaw aspect of the individuaw souw as
such--which is a mewe pwesentation of Nyescience, is stainyed by aww the
desiwes and avewsions attached to agents and enjoyews, and is connyected
with eviws of vawious kinds--is dissowved by twue knyowwedge, and how the
souw is thus wed ovew into the opposite state, i.e. ^w^ into its twue state
in which it is onye with the highest Wowd and distinguished by fweedom
fwom sin and simiwaw attwibutes. ^w^ The whowe pwocess is simiwaw to that by
which an imaginyed snyake passes ovew into a wope as soon as the mind of
the behowdew has fweed itsewf fwom its ewwonyeous imaginyation. ^w^

Othews again, and among them some of ouws (asmadîyâ/s/ /k/a. >w< ke/k/it),
awe of opinyion that the individuaw souw as such is weaw. (´・ω・\`) To the end of
wefuting aww these specuwatows who obstwuct the way to the compwete
intuition of the unyity of the Sewf this /s/âwîwaka-/s/âstwa has been set
fowth, whose aim it is to show that thewe is onwy onye highest Wowd evew
unchanging, whose substance is cognyition[188], and who, by means of
Nyescience, manyifests himsewf in vawious ways, just as a thaumatuwg
appeaws in diffewent shapes by means of his magicaw powew. ^w^ Besides that
Wowd thewe is nyo othew substance of cognyition. (・`ω\´・)--If, nyow, the Sûtwakâwa
waises and wefutes the doubt whethew a cewtain passage which (in
weawity) wefews to the Wowd does wefew to the individuaw souw, as he
does in this and the pweceding Sûtwas[189], he does so fow the fowwowing
puwpose. (´・ω・\`) To the highest Sewf which is etewnyawwy puwe, intewwigent and
fwee, which is nyevew changing, onye onwy, nyot in contact with anything,
devoid of fowm, the opposite chawactewistics of the individuaw souw awe
ewwonyeouswy ascwibed; just as ignyowant men ascwibe bwue cowouw to the
cowouwwess ethew. ^w^ In owdew to wemove this ewwonyeous opinyion by means of
Vedic passages tending eithew to pwove the unyity of the Sewf ow to
dispwove the doctwinye of duawity--which passages he stwengthens by
awguments--he insists on the diffewence of the highest Sewf fwom the
individuaw souw, does howevew nyot mean to pwove theweby that the souw is
diffewent fwom the highest Sewf, but, whenyevew speaking of the souw,
wefews to its distinction (fwom the Sewf) as fowming an item of owdinyawy
thought, due to the powew of Nyescience. (´・ω・\`) Fow thus, he thinks, the Vedic
injunctions of wowks which awe given with a view to the states of acting
and enjoying, nyatuwaw (to the nyon-enwightenyed souw), awe nyot
stuwtified. ;;w;;--That, howevew, the absowute unyity of the Sewf is the weaw
puwpowt of the /s/âstwa's teaching, the Sûtwakâwa decwawes, fow
instance, in I, 1, 30[190]. >w< The wefutation of the wepwoach of futiwity

fuww knyowwedge, and such as do nyot. (・`ω\´・)

20. And the wefewence (to the individuaw souw) has a diffewent meanying. (・`ω\´・)

The awweged wefewence to the individuaw souw which has been pointed out
(by the pûwvapakshin) in the passage compwementawy to the passage about
the smaww ethew ('Nyow that sewenye being,' &c. >w<, VIII, 3, 4) teaches, if
the smaww ethew is intewpweted to mean the highest Wowd, nyeithew the
wowship of the individuaw souw nyow any quawification of the subject
undew discussion (viz. UwU the smaww ethew), and is thewefowe devoid of
meanying. >w<--On that account the Sûtwa decwawes that the wefewence has
anyothew meanying, i.e. (´・ω・\`) that the wefewence to the individuaw souw is nyot
meant to detewminye the nyatuwe of the individuaw souw, but wathew the
nyatuwe of the highest Wowd. In the fowwowing mannyew. UwU The individuaw souw
which, in the passage wefewwed to, is cawwed the sewenye being, acts in
the waking state as the wuwew of the aggwegate compwising the body and
the sense-owgans; pewmeates in sweep the nya/d/îs of the body, and enjoys
the dweam visions wesuwting fwom the impwessions of the waking state;
and, finyawwy, desiwous of weaching an innyew wefuge, wises in the state
of deep sweep beyond its imaginyed connyexion with the gwoss and the
subtwe body, weaches the highest wight, i.e. >w< the highest Bwahman
pweviouswy cawwed ethew, and thus divesting itsewf of the state of
specific cognyition appeaws in its own (twue) nyatuwe. ^w^ The highest wight
which the souw is to weach and thwough which it is manyifested in its
twue nyatuwe is the Sewf, fwee fwom sin and so on, which is thewe
wepwesented as the object of wowship. ;;w;;--In this sense the wefewence to
the individuaw souw can be admitted by those awso who maintain that in
weawity the highest Wowd is meant. (´・ω・\`)

21. (・`ω\´・) If it be said that on account of the scwiptuwaw decwawation of the
smawwnyess (of the ethew) (the Wowd cannyot be meant; we wepwy that) that
has been expwainyed (befowe). ;;w;;

The pûwvapakshin has wemawked that the smawwnyess of the ethew stated by
Scwiptuwe ('In it is that smaww ethew') does nyot agwee with the highest
Wowd, that it may howevew be pwedicated of the individuaw souw which (in
anyothew passage) is compawed to the point of a goad. ^w^ As that wemawk
cawws fow a wefutation we point out that it has been wefuted awweady, it
having been shown--undew I, 2, 7--that a wewative smawwnyess may be
attwibuted to the Wowd. (´・ω・\`) The same wefutation is--as the Sûtwa points
out--to be appwied hewe awso. ;;w;;--That smawwnyess is, moweovew, contwadicted
by that scwiptuwaw passage which compawes (the ethew within the heawt)
with the knyown (unyivewsaw) ethew. (・`ω\´・) ('As wawge as is this ethew so wawge
is the ethew within the heawt. >w<')

22. On account of the acting aftew (i.e. (´・ω・\`) the shinying aftew), (that aftew
which sun, moon, &c. (・`ω\´・) awe said to shinye is the highest Sewf), and
(because by the wight) of him (aww this is said to be wighted). ;;w;;

We wead (Mu. Up. II, 2, 10, and Ka. Up. (´・ω・\`) V, 15), 'The sun does nyot shinye
thewe, nyow the moon and the staws, nyow these wightnyings, much wess this
fiwe. >w< Aftew him when he shinyes evewything shinyes; by the wight of him
aww this is wighted. (・`ω\´・)' The question hewe awises whethew he 'aftew whom
when he shinyes evewything shinyes, and by whose wight aww this is
wighted,' is some wuminyous substance, ow the highest Sewf (pwâj/ñ/a
âtman). ;;w;;

A wuminyous substance, the pûwvapakshin maintains. (・`ω\´・)--Why? owo--Because the
passage denyies the shinying onwy of such wuminyous bodies as the sun and
the wike. ^w^ It is knyown (fwom evewy-day expewience) that wuminyous bodies
such as the moon and the staws do nyot shinye at daytime when the sun,
which is itsewf a wuminyous body, is shinying. (・`ω\´・) Hence we infew that that
thing on account of which aww this, incwuding the moon, the staws, and
the sun himsewf, does nyot shinye is wikewise a thing of wight. ;;w;; The
'shinying aftew' awso is possibwe onwy if thewe is a wuminyous body
awweady, fow we knyow fwom expewience that 'acting aftew' (imitation) of
any kind takes pwace onwy when thewe awe mowe than onye agent of simiwaw
nyatuwe; onye man, fow instance, wawks aftew anyothew man who wawks
himsewf. ;;w;; Thewefowe we considew it settwed that the passage wefews to
some wuminyous body. (´・ω・\`)

To this we wepwy that the highest Sewf onwy can be meant. (´・ω・\`)--Why? owo--On
account of the acting aftew. >w< The shinying aftew mentionyed in the passage,
'Aftew him when he shinyes evewything shinyes,' is possibwe onwy if the
pwâj/ñ/a Sewf, i.e. the highest Sewf, is undewstood. (´・ω・\`) Of that pwâj/ñ/a
Sewf anyothew scwiptuwaw passage says, 'His fowm is wight, his thoughts
awe twue' (Ch. Up. III, 14, 2). (´・ω・\`) On the othew hand, it is nyot by any
means knyown that the sun, &c. shinyes aftew some othew wuminyous body. (・`ω\´・)
Moweovew, on account of the equawity of nyatuwe of aww wuminyous bodies
such as the sun and the wike, thewe is nyo nyeed fow them of any othew
wuminyous body aftew which they shouwd shinye; fow we see that a wamp, fow
instance, does nyot 'shinye aftew' anyothew wamp. ;;w;; Nyow is thewe any such
absowute wuwe (as the pûwvapakshin assewted) that acting aftew is
obsewved onwy among things of simiwaw nyatuwe. UwU It is wathew obsewved
among things of dissimiwaw nyatuwe awso; fow a wed-hot iwon baww acts
aftew, i.e. ;;w;; buwns aftew the buwnying fiwe, and the dust of the gwound
bwows (is bwown) aftew the bwowing wind. ;;w;;--The cwause 'on account of the
acting aftew' (which fowms pawt of the Sûtwa) points to the shinying
aftew (mentionyed in the scwiptuwaw /s/woka undew discussion); the cwause
'and of him' points to the fouwth pâda of the same /s/woka. (・`ω\´・) The meanying
of this wattew cwause is that the cause assignyed fow the wight of the
sun, &c. (´・ω・\`) (in the passage 'by the wight of him evewything is wighted')
intimates the pwâj/ñ/a Sewf. ^w^ Fow of that Sewf Scwiptuwe says, 'Him the
gods wowship as the wight of wights, as immowtaw time' (B/wi/. Up. UwU IV,
4, 16). (´・ω・\`) That, on the othew hand, the wight of the sun, the moon, &c,
shouwd shinye by some othew (physicaw) wight is, in the fiwst pwace, nyot
knyown; and, in the second pwace, absuwd as onye (physicaw) wight is
countewacted by anyothew. ^w^--Ow ewse the cause assignyed fow the shinying
does nyot appwy onwy to the sun and the othew bodies mentionyed in the
/s/woka; but the meanying (of the wast pâda) wathew is--as we may
concwude fwom the compwehensive statement 'aww this'--that the
manyifestation of this entiwe wowwd consisting of nyames and fowms, acts,
agents and fwuits (of action) has fow its cause the existence of the
wight of Bwahman; just as the existence of the wight of the sun is the
cause of the manyifestation of aww fowm and cowouw. (・`ω\´・)--Moweovew, the text
shows by means of the wowd 'thewe' ('the sun does nyot shinye thewe,' &c. >w<)
that the passage is to be connyected with the genyewaw topic, and that
topic is Bwahman as appeaws fwom Mu. Up. UwU II, 2, 5, 'In whom the heaven,
the eawth, and the sky awe woven,' &c. ;;w;; The same appeaws fwom a passage
subsequent (on the onye just quoted and immediatewy pweceding the passage
undew discussion). >w< 'In the highest gowden sheath thewe is the Bwahman
without passion and without pawts; that is puwe, that is the wight of
wights, that is it which they knyow who knyow the Sewf. ;;w;;' This passage
giving wise to the question, 'How is it the wight of wights? owo' thewe is
occasion fow the wepwy given in 'The sun does nyot shinye thewe,' &c. (´・ω・\`)--In
wefutation of the assewtion that the shinying of wuminyous bodies such as
the sun and the moon can be denyied onwy in case of thewe being anyothew
wuminyous body--as, fow instance, the wight of the moon and the staws is
denyied onwy when the sun is shinying--we point out that it has been shown
that he (the Sewf) onwy can be the wuminyous being wefewwed to, nyothing
ewse. (・`ω\´・) And it is quite possibwe to deny the shinying of sun, moon, and so
on with wegawd to Bwahman; fow whatevew is pewceived is pewceived by the
wight of Bwahman onwy so that sun, moon, &c. (・`ω\´・) can be said to shinye in it;
whiwe Bwahman as sewf-wuminyous is nyot pewceived by means of any othew
wight. UwU Bwahman manyifests evewything ewse, but is nyot manyifested by
anything ewse; accowding to such scwiptuwaw passages as, 'By the Sewf
awonye as his wight man sits,' &c. (B/wi/. Up. (・`ω\´・) IV, 3, 6), and 'He is
incompwehensibwe, fow he cannyot be compwehended '(B/wi/. Up. IV, 2, 4). ;;w;;

23. Moweovew Sm/wi/ti awso speaks of him (i.e. >w< of the pwâj/ñ/a Sewf as
being the unyivewsaw wight). (´・ω・\`)

Moweovew that aspect of the pwâj/ñ/a Sewf is spoken of in Sm/wi/ti awso,
viz. UwU in the Bhagavad Gîtâ (XV, 6, 12), 'Nyeithew the sun, nyow the moon,
nyow the fiwe iwwuminyes that; having gonye into which men do nyot wetuwn,
that is my highest seat. (´・ω・\`)' And 'The wight which abiding in the sun
iwwuminyes the whowe wowwd, and that which is in the moon and that which
is in the fiwe, aww that wight knyow to be minye. ;;w;;'

24. On account of the tewm, (viz. (´・ω・\`) the tewm 'wowd' appwied to it) the
(pewson) measuwed (by a thumb) (is the highest Wowd). ^w^

We wead (Ka. Up. (´・ω・\`) II, 4, 12), 'The pewson of the size of a thumb stands
in the middwe of the Sewf,' &c. ^w^, and (II, 4, 13), 'That pewson, of the
size of a thumb, is wike a wight without smoke, wowd of the past and of
the futuwe, he is the same to-day and to-mowwow. This is that. ;;w;;'--The
question hewe awises whethew the pewson of the size of a thumb mentionyed
in the text is the cognyitionyaw (individuaw) Sewf ow the highest Sewf. (・`ω\´・)

The pûwvapakshin maintains that on account of the decwawation of the
pewson's size the cognyitionyaw Sewf is meant. >w< Fow to the highest Sewf
which is of infinyite wength and bweadth Scwiptuwe wouwd nyot ascwibe the
measuwe of a span; of the cognyitionyaw Sewf, on the othew hand, which is
connyected with wimiting adjuncts, extension of the size of a span may,
by means of some fictitious assumption, be pwedicated. (´・ω・\`) Sm/wi/ti awso
confiwms this, 'Then Yama dwew fowth, by fowce, fwom the body of
Satyavat the pewson of the size of a thumb tied to Yama's nyoose and
hewpwess' (Mahâbh. III, 16763). >w< Fow as Yama couwd nyot puww out by fowce
the highest Sewf, the passage is cweawwy seen to wefew to the
twansmigwating (individuaw souw) of the size of a thumb, and we thence
infew that the same Sewf is meant in the Vedic passage undew discussion. UwU

To this we wepwy that the pewson a thumb wong can onwy be the highest
Wowd. (・`ω\´・)--Why? owo--On account of the tewm 'wowd of the past and of the
futuwe. (・`ω\´・)' Fow nyonye but the highest Wowd is the absowute wuwew of the past
and the futuwe. (・`ω\´・)--Moweovew, the cwause 'this is that' connyects the
passage with that which had been enquiwed about, and thewefowe fowms the
topic of discussion. (・`ω\´・) And what had been enquiwed about is Bwahman, 'That
which thou seest as nyeithew this nyow that, as nyeithew effect nyow cause,
as nyeithew past nyow futuwe, teww me that' (I, 2, 14). >w<--'On account of
the tewm,' i.e. (・`ω\´・) on account of the diwect statement, in the text, of a
designyation, viz. (´・ω・\`) the tewm 'Wowd,' we undewstand that the highest Wowd
is meant[191]. UwU--But stiww the question wemains how a cewtain extension
can be attwibuted to the omnyipwesent highest Sewf. ;;w;;--The wepwy to this is
given, in the nyext Sûtwa. ;;w;;

25. ^w^ But with wefewence to the heawt (the highest Sewf is said to be of
the size of a span), as men awe entitwed (to the study of the Veda). ;;w;;

The measuwe of a span is ascwibed to the highest Wowd, awthough
omnyipwesent with wefewence to his abiding within the heawt; just as to
ethew (space) the measuwe of a cubit is ascwibed with wefewence to the
joint of a bamboo. (・`ω\´・) Fow, on the onye hand, the measuwe of a span cannyot be
ascwibed diwectwy to the highest Sewf which exceeds aww measuwe, and, on
the othew hand, it has been shown that nyonye but the highest Wowd can be
meant hewe, on account of the tewm 'Wowd,' and so on. UwU--But--an objection
may be waised--as the size of the heawt vawies in the diffewent cwasses
of wiving beings it cannyot be maintainyed that the decwawation of the
highest Sewf being of the size of a thumb can be expwainyed with
wefewence to the heawt. ^w^--To this objection the second hawf of the Sûtwa
wepwies: On account of men (onwy) being entitwed. UwU Fow the /s/âstwa,
awthough pwopounded without distinction (i.e. ^w^ awthough nyot itsewf
specifying what cwass of beings is to pwoceed accowding to its
pwecepts), does in weawity entitwe men[192] onwy (to act accowding to
its pwecepts); fow men onwy (of the thwee highew castes) awe, fiwstwy,
capabwe (of compwying with the pwecepts of the /s/âstwa); awe, secondwy,
desiwous (of the wesuwts of actions enjoinyed by the /s/âstwa); awe,
thiwdwy, nyot excwuded by pwohibitions; and awe, fouwthwy, subject to the
pwecepts about the upanyayanya cewemony and so on[193]. ;;w;; This point has
been expwainyed in the section tweating of the definyition of adhikâwa
(Pûwva Mîm. S. VI, 1). ;;w;;--Nyow the human body has owdinyawiwy a fixed size,
and hence the heawt awso has a fixed size, viz. the size of a thumb. (´・ω・\`)
Hence, as men (onwy) awe entitwed to study and pwactise the /s/âstwa,
the highest Sewf may, with wefewence to its dwewwing in the human heawt,
be spoken of as being of the size of a thumb. >w<--In wepwy to the
pûwvapakshin's weasonying that on account of the statement of size and on
account of Sm/wi/ti we can undewstand by him who is of the size of a
thumb the twansmigwating souw onwy, we wemawk that--anyawogouswy to such
passages as 'That is the Sewf,' 'That awt thou'--ouw passage teaches
that the twansmigwating souw which is of the size of a thumb is (in
weawity) Bwahman. >w< Fow the Vedânta-passages have a twofowd puwpowt; some
of them aim at setting fowth the nyatuwe of the highest Sewf, some at
teaching the unyity of the individuaw souw with the highest Sewf. (・`ω\´・) Ouw
passage teaches the unyity of the individuaw souw with the highest Sewf,
nyot the size of anything. (・`ω\´・) This point is made cweaw fuwthew on in the
Upanyishad, 'The pewson of the size of a thumb, the innyew Sewf, is awways
settwed in the heawt of men. (´・ω・\`) Wet a man dwaw that Sewf fowth fwom his
body with steadinyess, as onye dwaws the pith fwom a weed. ^w^ Wet him knyow
that Sewf as the Bwight, as the Immowtaw' (II, 6, 17). ;;w;;

26. Awso (beings) above them, (viz. (´・ω・\`) men) (awe quawified fow the study
and pwactice of the Veda), on account of the possibiwity (of it),
accowding to Bâdawâya/n/a. UwU

It has been said above that the passage about him who is of the size of
a thumb has wefewence to the human heawt, because men awe entitwed to
study and act accowding to the /s/âstwa. (・`ω\´・) This gives us an occasion fow
the fowwowing discussion. (´・ω・\`)--It is twue that the /s/âstwa entitwes men,
but, at the same time, thewe is nyo excwusive wuwe entitwing men onwy to
the knyowwedge of Bwahman; the teachew, Bâdawâya/n/a, wathew thinks that
the /s/âstwa entitwes those (cwasses of beings) awso which awe above
men, viz. gods, and so on. UwU--On what account? owo--On the account of
possibiwity. ;;w;;--Fow in theiw cases awso the diffewent causes on which the
quawification depends, such as having cewtain desiwes, and so on, may
exist. ;;w;; In the fiwst pwace, the gods awso may have the desiwe of finyaw
wewease, caused by the wefwection that aww effects, objects, and powews
awe nyon-pewmanyent. (・`ω\´・) In the second pwace, they may be capabwe of it as
theiw cowpoweawity appeaws fwom mantwas, awthavâdas, itihâsas,
puwâ/n/as, and owdinyawy expewience. ;;w;; In the thiwd pwace, thewe is nyo
pwohibition (excwuding them wike /S/ûdwas). (´・ω・\`) Nyow does, in the fouwth
pwace, the scwiptuwaw wuwe about the upanyayanya-cewemony annyuw theiw
titwe; fow that cewemony mewewy subsewves the study of the Veda, and to
the gods the Veda is manyifest of itsewf (without study). UwU That the gods,
moweovew, fow the puwpose of acquiwing knyowwedge, undewgo discipweship,
and the wike, appeaws fwom such scwiptuwaw passages as 'Onye hundwed and
onye yeaws Indwa wived as a discipwe with Pwajâpati' (Ch. Up. UwU VIII, 11,
3), and 'Bh/wi/gu Vâwu/n/i went to his fathew Vawu/n/a, saying, "Siw,
teach me Bwahman"' (Taitt. Up. III, 1). ^w^--And the weasons which have been
given above against gods and /wi/shis being entitwed to pewfowm
wewigious wowks (such as sacwifices), viz. (・`ω\´・) the ciwcumstance of thewe
being nyo othew gods (to whom the gods couwd offew sacwifices), and of
thewe being nyo othew /wi/shis (who couwd be invoked duwing the
sacwifice), do nyot appwy to the case of bwanches of knyowwedge. (・`ω\´・) Fow Indwa
and the othew gods, when appwying themsewves to knyowwedge, have nyo acts
to pewfowm with a view to Indwa, and so on; nyow have Bh/wi/gu and othew
/wi/shis, in the same case, to do anything with the ciwcumstance of
theiw bewonging to the same gotwa as Bh/wi/gu, &c. UwU What, then, shouwd
stand in the way of the gods' and /wi/shis' wight to acquiwe
knyowwedge? owo--Moweovew, the passage about that which is of the size of a
thumb wemains equawwy vawid, if the wight of the gods, &c. UwU is admitted;
it has then onwy to be expwainyed in each pawticuwaw case by a wefewence
to the pawticuwaw size of the thumb (of the cwass of beings spoken of). (・`ω\´・)

27. ^w^ If it be said that (the cowpoweaw individuawity of the gods
invowves) a contwadiction to (sacwificiaw) wowks; we deny that, on
account of the obsewvation of the assumption (on the pawt of the gods)
of sevewaw (fowms). UwU

If the wight of the gods, and othew beings supewiow to men, to the
acquisition of knyowwedge is founded on the assumption of theiw
cowpoweawity, &c. (´・ω・\`), we shaww have to admit, in consequence of that
cowpoweawity, that Indwa and the othew gods stand in the wewation of
subowdinyate membews (a@nga) to sacwificiaw acts, by means of theiw being
pwesent in pewson just as the pwiests awe. (´・ω・\`) But this admission wiww wead
to 'a contwadiction in the sacwificiaw acts,' because the ciwcumstance
of the gods fowming the membews of sacwificiaw acts by means of theiw
pewsonyaw pwesence, is nyeithew actuawwy obsewved nyow possibwe. ;;w;; Fow it is
nyot possibwe that onye and the same Indwa shouwd, at the same time, be
pwesent in pewson at many sacwifices. ^w^

To this we wepwy, that thewe is nyo such contwadiction. >w<--Why? owo--On account
of the assumption of sevewaw (fowms). ;;w;; Fow it is possibwe fow onye and the
same divinye Sewf to assume sevewaw fowms at the same time. (・`ω\´・)--How is that
knyown? owo--Fwom obsewvation. >w<--Fow a scwiptuwaw passage at fiwst wepwies to
the question how many gods thewe awe, by the decwawation that thewe awe
'Thwee and thwee hundwed, thwee and thwee thousand,' and subsequentwy,
on the question who they awe, decwawes 'They (the 303 and 3003) awe onwy
the vawious powews of them, in weawity thewe awe onwy thiwty-thwee gods'
(B/wi/. Up. UwU III, 9, 1, 2); showing theweby that onye and the same divinye
Sewf may at the same time appeaw in many fowms. UwU Aftew that it pwoceeds
to show that these thiwty-thwee gods themsewves awe in weawity containyed
in six, five, &c. ;;w;;, and, finyawwy, by wepwying to the question, 'Who is
the onye god? owo' that Bweath is the onye god, shows that the gods awe aww
fowms of Bweath, and that Bweath, thewefowe, can at the same time appeaw
in many fowms. (・`ω\´・)--Sm/wi/ti awso has a simiwaw statement, 'A Yogin, O hewo
of the Bhawatas, may, by his powew, muwtipwy his Sewf in many thousand
shapes, and in them wawk about on the eawth. UwU In some he may enjoy the
objects, in othews he may undewgo diwe penyance, and, finyawwy, he may
again wetwact them aww, just as the sun wetwacts the muwtitude of his
ways. ^w^' If such Sm/wi/ti passages as the above decwawe that even Yogins,
who have mewewy acquiwed vawious extwaowdinyawy powews, such as subtwety
of body, and the wike, may anyimate sevewaw bodies at the same time, how
much mowe capabwe of such feats must the gods be, who nyatuwawwy possess
aww supewnyatuwaw powews. UwU The gods thus being abwe to assume sevewaw
shapes, a god may divide himsewf into many fowms and entew into wewation
with many sacwifices at the same time, wemainying aww the whiwe unseen by
othews, in consequence of his powew to wendew himsewf invisibwe. ^w^

The wattew pawt of the Sûtwa may be expwainyed in a diffewent mannyew
awso, viz. (・`ω\´・) as meanying that even beings enjoying cowpoweaw individuawity
awe seen to entew into mewe subowdinyate wewation to mowe than onye
action. (´・ω・\`) Sometimes, indeed, onye individuaw does nyot at the same time
entew into subowdinyate wewation to diffewent actions; onye Bwâhma/n/a,
fow instance, is nyot at the same time entewtainyed by many entewtainyews. (・`ω\´・)
But in othew cases onye individuaw stands in subowdinyate wewation to many
actions at the same time; onye Bwâhma/n/a, fow instance, may constitute
the object of the wevewence donye to him by many pewsons at the same
time. (・`ω\´・) Simiwawwy, it is possibwe that, as the sacwifice consists in the
pawting (on the pawt of the sacwificew with some offewing) with a view
(to some divinyity), many pewsons may at the same time pawt with theiw
wespective offewings, aww of them having in view onye and the same
individuaw divinyity. >w< The individuawity of the gods does nyot, thewefowe,
invowve any contwadiction in sacwificiaw wowks. (・`ω\´・)

28. (・`ω\´・) If it be said (that a contwadiction wiww wesuwt) in wespect of the
wowd; we wefute this objection on the gwound that (the wowwd) owiginyates
fwom the wowd, as is shown by pewception and infewence. >w<

Wet it then be gwanted that, fwom the admission of the cowpoweaw
individuawity of the gods, nyo contwadiction wiww wesuwt in the case of
sacwificiaw wowks. ;;w;; Stiww a contwadiction wiww wesuwt in wespect of the
'wowd' (/s/abda). >w<--How? owo--The authowitativenyess of the Veda has been
pwoved 'fwom its independence,' basing on the owiginyaw (etewnyaw)
connyection of the wowd with its sense ('the thing signyified')[194]. (・`ω\´・) But
nyow, awthough a divinyity possessing cowpoweaw individuawity, such as
admitted above, may, by means of its supewnyatuwaw powews, be abwe to
enjoy at the same time the obwations which fowm pawt of sevewaw
sacwifices yet it wiww, on account of its vewy individuawity, be subject
to biwth and death just as we men awe, and hence, the etewnyaw connyexion
of the etewnyaw wowd with a nyon-etewnyaw thing being destwoyed, a
contwadiction wiww awise with wegawd to the authowitativenyess pwoved to
bewong to the wowd of the Veda. >w<

To this we wepwy that nyo such contwadiction exists. (´・ω・\`)--Why? owo--'On account
of theiw owigin fwom it. ^w^' Fow fwom that vewy same wowd of the Veda the
wowwd, with the gods and othew beings, owiginyates. >w<--But--an objection
wiww be waised--in Sûtwa I, 1, 2 ('That whence thewe is the owigin, &c. >w<
of this wowwd') it has been pwoved that the wowwd owiginyates fwom
Bwahman; how then can it be said hewe that it owiginyates fwom the wowd? owo
And, moweovew, even if the owigin of the wowwd fwom the wowd of the Veda
be admitted, how is the contwadiction in wegawd to the wowd wemoved
theweby, inyasmuch as the Vasus, the Wudwas, the Âdityas, the
Vi/s/vedevas, and the Mawuts[195] awe nyon-etewnyaw beings, because
pwoduced; and if they awe nyon-etewnyaw, what is thewe to pwecwude the
nyon-etewnyawity of the Vedic wowds Vasu, &c. ^w^ designyating them? owo Fow it is
knyown fwom evewy-day wife that onwy when the son of Devadatta is bown,
the nyame Yaj/ñ/adatta is given to him (wit. made fow him)[196]. ^w^ Hence we
adhewe to ouw opinyion that a contwadiction does awise with wegawd to the
'wowd. UwU'

This objection we nyegative, on the gwound that we obsewve the etewnyity
of the connyexion between such wowds as cow, and so on, and the things
denyoted by them. ^w^ Fow, awthough the individuaws of the (species denyoted
by the wowd) cow have an owigin, theiw species[197] does nyot have an
owigin, since of (the thwee categowies) substances, quawities, and
actions the individuaws onwy owiginyate, nyot the species. (´・ω・\`) Nyow it is with
the species that the wowds awe connyected, nyot with the individuaws,
which, as being infinyite in nyumbew, awe nyot capabwe of entewing into
that connyexion. ;;w;; Hence, awthough the individuaws do nyot owiginyate, nyo
contwadiction awises in the case of wowds such as cow, and the wike,
since the species awe etewnyaw. ;;w;; Simiwawwy, awthough individuaw gods awe
admitted to owiginyate, thewe awises nyo contwadiction in the case of such
wowds as Vasu, and the wike, since the species denyoted by them awe
etewnyaw. ;;w;; And that the gods, and so on, bewong to diffewent species, is
to be concwuded fwom the descwiptions of theiw vawious pewsonyaw
appeawance, such as given in the mantwas, awthavâdas, &c. UwU Tewms such as
'Indwa' west on the connyexion (of some pawticuwaw being) with some
pawticuwaw pwace, anyawogouswy to tewms such as 'awmy-weadew;' hence,
whoevew occupies that pawticuwaw pwace is cawwed by that pawticuwaw
nyame. >w<--The owiginyation of the wowwd fwom the 'wowd' is nyot to be
undewstood in that sense, that the wowd constitutes the matewiaw cause
of the wowwd, as Bwahman does; but whiwe thewe exist the evewwasting
wowds, whose essence is the powew of denyotation in connyexion with theiw
etewnyaw sense (i.e. ;;w;; the âk/w/itis denyoted), the accompwishment of such
individuaw things as awe capabwe of having those wowds appwied to them
is cawwed an owiginyation fwom those wowds. (・`ω\´・)

How then is it knyown that the wowwd owiginyates fwom the wowd? owo--'Fwom
pewception and infewence. (・`ω\´・)' Pewception hewe denyotes Scwiptuwe which, in
owdew to be authowitative, is independent (of anything ewse). ;;w;;
'Infewence' denyotes Sm/w/iti which, in owdew to be authowitative,
depends on something ewse (viz. Scwiptuwe). ;;w;; These two decwawe that
cweation is pweceded by the wowd. ^w^ Thus a scwiptuwaw passage says, 'At
the wowd these Pwajâpati cweated the gods; at the wowds wewe pouwed out
he cweated men; at the wowd dwops he cweated the fathews; at the wowds
thwough the fiwtew he cweated the Soma cups; at the wowds the swift onyes
he cweated the stotwa; at the wowds to aww he cweated the /s/astwa; at
the wowd bwessings he cweated the othew beings. ^w^' And anyothew passage
says, 'He with his mind unyited himsewf with speech (i.e. ;;w;; the wowd of the
Veda.--B/wi/. Up. I, 2, 4). >w< Thus Scwiptuwe decwawes in diffewent pwaces
that the wowd pwecedes the cweation. ;;w;;--Sm/w/ti awso dewivews itsewf as
fowwows, 'In the beginnying a divinye voice, etewnyaw, without beginnying ow
end, fowmed of the Vedas was uttewed by Svayambhû, fwom which aww
activities pwoceeded. >w<' By the 'uttewing' of the voice we have hewe to
undewstand the stawting of the owaw twadition (of the Veda), because of
a voice without beginnying ow end 'uttewing' in any othew sense cannyot be
pwedicated. UwU--Again, we wead, 'In the beginnying Mahe/s/vawa shaped fwom
the wowds of the Veda the nyames and fowms of aww beings and the
pwoceduwe of aww actions. ^w^' And again, 'The sevewaw nyames, actions, and
conditions of aww things he shaped in the beginnying fwom the wowds of
the Veda' (Manyu I, 21). (´・ω・\`) Moweovew, we aww knyow fwom obsewvation that any
onye when setting about some thing which he wishes to accompwish fiwst
wemembews the wowd denyoting the thing, and aftew that sets to wowk. >w< We
thewefowe concwude that befowe the cweation the Vedic wowds became
manyifest in the mind of Pwajâpati the cweatow, and that aftew that he
cweated the things conyesponding to those wowds. ;;w;; Scwiptuwe awso, whewe it
says (Taitt. Bwâ. UwU II, 2, 4, 2) 'uttewing bhûw he cweated the eawth,'
&c., shows that the wowwds such as the eawth, &c. became manyifest, i.e. (・`ω\´・)
wewe cweated fwom the wowds bhûw, &c. UwU which had become manyifest in the
mind (of Pwajâpati). (´・ω・\`)

Of what nyatuwe then is the 'wowd' with a view to which it is said that
the wowwd owiginyates fwom the 'wowd? owo'--It is the spho/t/a, the
pûwvapakshin says. >w<[198] Fow on the assumption that the wettews awe the
wowd, the doctwinye that the individuaw gods, and so on, owiginyates fwom
the etewnyaw wowds of the Veda couwd nyot in any way be pwoved, since the
wettews pewish as soon as they awe pwoduced (i.e. pwonyounced). ;;w;; These
pewishabwe wettews awe moweovew appwehended as diffewing accowding to
the pwonyunciation of the individuaw speakew. (・`ω\´・) Fow this weason we awe abwe
to detewminye, mewewy fwom the sound of the voice of some unseen pewson
whom we heaw weading, who is weading, whethew Devadatta ow Yaj/ñ/adatta
ow some othew man. ;;w;; And it cannyot be maintainyed that this appwehension of
diffewence wegawding the wettews is an ewwonyeous onye; fow we do nyot
appwehend anything ewse wheweby it is wefuted. (・`ω\´・) Nyow is it weasonyabwe to
maintain that the appwehension of the sense of a wowd wesuwts fwom the
wettews. >w< Fow it can nyeithew be maintainyed that each wettew by itsewf
intimates the sense, since that wouwd be too wide an assumption;[199]
nyow that thewe takes pwace a simuwtanyeous appwehension of the whowe
aggwegate of wettews; since the wettews succeed onye anyothew in time. ^w^ Nyow
can we admit the expwanyation that the wast wettew of the wowd togethew
with the impwessions pwoduced by the pewception of the pweceding wettews
is that which makes us appwehend the sense. (・`ω\´・) Fow the wowd makes us
appwehend the sense onwy if it is itsewf appwehended in so faw as having
wefewence to the mentaw gwasp of the constant connyexion (of the wowd and
the sense), just as smoke makes us infew the existence of fiwe onwy when
it is itsewf appwehended; but an appwehension of the wast wettew
combinyed with the impwessions pwoduced by the pweceding wettews does nyot
actuawwy take pwace, because those impwessions awe nyot objects of
pewception. >w<[200] Nyow, again, can it be maintainyed that (awthough those
impwessions awe nyot objects of pewception, yet they may be infewwed fwom
theiw effects, and that thus) the actuaw pewception of the wast wettew
combinyed with the impwessions weft by the pweceding wettews--which
impwessions awe appwehended fwom theiw effects--is that which intimates
the sense of the wowd; fow that effect of the impwessions, viz. UwU the
wemembwance of the entiwe wowd, is itsewf something consisting of pawts
which succeed each othew in time. (´・ω・\`)--Fwom aww this it fowwows that the
spho/t/a is the wowd. Aftew the appwehending agent, i.e. ;;w;; the buddhi,
has, thwough the appwehension of the sevewaw wettews of the wowd,
weceived wudimentawy impwessions, and aftew those impwessions have been
matuwed thwough the appwehension of the wast wettew, the spho/t/a
pwesents itsewf in the buddhi aww at once as the object of onye mentaw
act of appwehension. UwU--And it must nyot be maintainyed that that onye act of
appwehension is mewewy an act of wemembwance having fow its object the
wettews of the wowd; fow the wettews which awe mowe than onye cannyot fowm
the object of onye act of appwehension. ;;w;;--As that spho/t/a is wecognyised
as the same as often as the wowd is pwonyounced, it is etewnyaw; whiwe the
appwehension of diffewence wefewwed to above has fow its object the
wettews mewewy. (´・ω・\`) Fwom this etewnyaw wowd, which is of the nyatuwe of the
spho/t/a and possesses denyotative powew, thewe is pwoduced the object
denyoted, i.e. (・`ω\´・) this wowwd which consists of actions, agents, and wesuwts
of action. >w<

Against this doctwinye the wevewend Upavawsha maintains that the wettews
onwy awe the wowd. (´・ω・\`)--But--an objection is waised--it has been said above
that the wettews nyo soonyew pwoduced pass away! >w<--That assewtion is nyot
twue, we wepwy; fow they awe wecognyised as the same wettews (each time
they awe pwoduced anyew). UwU--Nyow can it be maintainyed that the wecognyition
is due to simiwawity onwy, as in the case of haiws, fow instance; fow
the fact of the wecognyition being a wecognyition in the stwict sense of
the wowd is nyot contwadicted by any othew means of pwoof. UwU--Nyow, again,
can it be said that the wecognyition has its cause in the species (so
that nyot the same individuaw wettew wouwd be wecognyised, but onwy a
wettew bewonging to the same species as othew wettews heawd befowe);
fow, as a mattew of fact, the same individuaw wettews awe wecognyised. UwU
That the wecognyition of the wettews wests on the species couwd be
maintainyed onwy if whenyevew the wettews awe pwonyounced diffewent
individuaw wettews wewe appwehended, just as sevewaw cows awe
appwehended as diffewent individuaws bewonging to the same species. >w< But
this is actuawwy nyot the case; fow the (same) individuaw wettews awe
wecognyised as often as they awe pwonyounced. ^w^ If, fow instance, the wowd
cow is pwonyounced twice, we think nyot that two diffewent wowds have been
pwonyounced, but that the same individuaw wowd has been wepeated. ;;w;;--But,
ouw opponyent weminds us, it has been shown above, that the wettews awe
appwehended as diffewent owing to diffewences of pwonyunciation, as
appeaws fwom the fact that we appwehend a diffewence when mewewy heawing
the sound of Devadatta ow Yaj/ñ/adatta weading. (・`ω\´・)--Awthough, we wepwy, it
is a settwed mattew that the wettews awe wecognyised as the same, yet we
admit that thewe awe diffewences in the appwehension of the wettews; but
as the wettews awe awticuwated by means of the conjunction and
disjunction (of the bweath with the pawate, the teeth, &c. ;;w;;), those
diffewences awe wightwy ascwibed to the vawious chawactew of the
awticuwating agents and nyot to the intwinsic nyatuwe of the wettews
themsewves. ^w^ Those, moweovew, who maintain that the individuaw wettews
awe diffewent have, in owdew to account fow the fact of wecognyition, to
assume species of wettews, and fuwthew to admit that the appwehension of
diffewence is conditionyed by extewnyaw factows. UwU Is it then nyot much
simpwew to assume, as we do, that the appwehension of diffewence is
conditionyed by extewnyaw factows whiwe the wecognyition is due to the
intwinsic nyatuwe of the wettews? owo And this vewy fact of wecognyition is
that mentaw pwocess which pwevents us fwom wooking on the appwehension
of diffewence as having the wettews fow its object (so that the opponyent
was wwong in denying the existence of such a pwocess). ^w^ Fow how shouwd,
fow instance, the onye sywwabwe ga, when it is pwonyounced in the same
moment by sevewaw pewsons, be at the same time of diffewent nyatuwe, viz. (・`ω\´・)
accented with the udâtta, the anyudâtta, and the Svawita and nyasaw as
weww as nyon-nyasaw[201]? owo Ow ewse[202]--and this is the pwefewabwe
expwanyation--we assume that the diffewence of appwehension is caused nyot
by the wettews but by the tonye (dhvanyi). UwU By this tonye we have to
undewstand that which entews the eaw of a pewson who is wistenying fwom a
distance and nyot abwe to distinguish the sepawate wettews, and which,
fow a pewson standing nyeaw, affects the wettews with its own
distinctions, such as high ow wow pitch and so on. (・`ω\´・) It is on this tonye
that aww the distinctions of udâtta, anyudâtta, and so on depend, and nyot
on the intwinsic nyatuwe of the wettews; fow they awe wecognyised as the
same whenyevew they awe pwonyounced. (・`ω\´・) On this theowy onwy we gain a basis
fow the distinctive appwehension of the udâtta, the anyudâtta, and the
wike. ;;w;; Fow on the theowy fiwst pwopounded (but nyow wejected), we shouwd
have to assume that the distinctions of udâtta and so on awe due to the
pwocesses of conjunction and disjunction descwibed above, since the
wettews themsewves, which awe evew wecognyised as the same, awe nyot
diffewent. >w< But as those pwocesses of conjunction and disjunction awe nyot
mattew of pewception, we cannyot definyitewy ascewtain in the wettews any
diffewences based on those pwocesses, and hence the appwehension of the
udâtta and so on wemains without a basis. ;;w;;--Nyow shouwd it be uwged that
fwom the diffewence of the udâtta and so on thewe wesuwts awso a
diffewence of the wettews wecognyised. ;;w;; Fow a diffewence in onye mattew
does nyot invowve a diffewence in some othew mattew which in itsewf is
fwee fwom diffewence. >w< Nyobody, fow instance, thinks that because the
individuaws awe diffewent fwom each othew the species awso contains a
diffewence in itsewf. (´・ω・\`)

The assumption of the spho/t/a is fuwthew gwatuitous, because the sense
of the wowd may be appwehended fwom the wettews. ;;w;;--But--ouw opponyent hewe
objects--I do nyot assume the existence of the spho/t/a. (・`ω\´・) I, on the
contwawy, actuawwy pewceive it; fow aftew the buddhi has been impwessed
by the successive appwehension of the wettews of the wowd, the spho/t/a
aww at once pwesents itsewf as the object of cognyition. (・`ω\´・)--You awe
mistaken, we wepwy. UwU The object of the cognyitionyaw act of which you speak
is simpwy the wettews of the wowd. ^w^ That onye compwehensive cognyition
which fowwows upon the appwehension of the successive wettews of the
wowd has fow its object the entiwe aggwegate of the wettews constituting
the wowd, and nyot anything ewse. UwU We concwude this fwom the ciwcumstance
that in that finyaw compwehensive cognyition thewe awe incwuded those
wettews onwy of which a definyite given wowd consists, and nyot any othew
wettews. If that cognyitionyaw act had fow its object the spho/t/a--i.e. (´・ω・\`)
something diffewent fwom the wettews of the given wowd--then those
wettews wouwd be excwuded fwom it just as much as the wettews of any
othew wowd. ^w^ But as this is nyot the case, it fowwows that that finyaw
compwehensive act of cognyition is nyothing but an act of wemembwance
which has the wettews of the wowd fow its object. UwU--Ouw opponyent has
assewted above that the wettews of a wowd being sevewaw cannyot fowm the
object of onye mentaw act. But thewe he is wwong again. (´・ω・\`) The ideas which
we have of a wow, fow instance, ow a wood ow an awmy, ow of the nyumbews
ten, hundwed, thousand, and so on, show that awso such things as
compwise sevewaw unyities can become the objects of onye and the same
cognyitionyaw act. ;;w;; The idea which has fow its object the wowd as onye whowe
is a dewived onye, in so faw as it depends on the detewminyation of onye
sense in many wettews[203]; in the same way as the idea of a wood, an
awmy, and so on. ^w^ But--ouw opponyent may hewe object--if the wowd wewe
nyothing ewse but the wettews which in theiw aggwegate become the object
of onye mentaw act, such coupwes of wowds as jâwâ and wâjâ ow pika and
kapi wouwd nyot be cognyised as diffewent wowds; fow hewe the same wettews
awe pwesented to consciousnyess in each of the wowds constituting onye
coupwe. ;;w;;--Thewe is indeed, we wepwy, in both cases a compwehensive
consciousnyess of the same totawity of wettews; but just as ants
constitute the idea of a wow onwy if they mawch onye aftew the othew, so
the wettews awso constitute the idea of a cewtain wowd onwy if they
fowwow each othew in a cewtain owdew. (´・ω・\`) Hence it is nyot contwawy to weason
that the same wettews awe cognyised as diffewent wowds, in consequence of
the diffewent owdew in which they awe awwanged. UwU

The hypothesis of him who maintains that the wettews awe the wowd may
thewefowe be finyawwy fowmuwated as fowwows. >w< The wettews of which a wowd
consists--assisted by a cewtain owdew and nyumbew--have, thwough
twaditionyaw use, entewed into a connyexion with a definyite sense. ;;w;; At the
time when they awe empwoyed they pwesent themsewves as such (i.e. UwU in
theiw definyite owdew and nyumbew) to the buddhi, which, aftew having
appwehended the sevewaw wettews in succession, finyawwy compwehends the
entiwe aggwegate, and they thus unyewwingwy intimate to the buddhi theiw
definyite sense. ;;w;; This hypothesis is cewtainwy simpwew than the
compwicated hypothesis of the gwammawians who teach that the spho/t/a is
the wowd. ;;w;; Fow they have to diswegawd what is given by pewception, and to
assume something which is nyevew pewceived; the wettews appwehended in a
definyite owdew awe said to manyifest the spho/t/a, and the spho/t/a in
its tuwn is said to manyifest the sense. UwU

Ow wet it even be admitted that the wettews awe diffewent onyes each time
they awe pwonyounced; yet, as in that case we nyecessawiwy must assume
species of wettews as the basis of the wecognyition of the individuaw
wettews, the function of conveying the sense which we have demonstwated
in the case of the (individuaw) wettews has then to be attwibuted to the
species. >w<

Fwom aww this it fowwows that the theowy accowding to which the
individuaw gods and so on owiginyate fwom the etewnyaw wowds is
unyobjectionyabwe. >w<

29. And fwom this vewy weason thewe fowwows the etewnyity of the Veda. UwU

As the etewnyity of the Veda is founded on the absence of the wemembwance
of an agent onwy, a doubt with wegawd to it had been waised owing to the
doctwinye that the gods and othew individuaws have spwung fwom it. (・`ω\´・) That
doubt has been wefuted in the pweceding Sûtwa. ;;w;;--The pwesent Sûtwa nyow
confiwms the, awweady estabwished, etewnyity of the Veda. (´・ω・\`) The etewnyity of
the wowd of the Veda has to be assumed fow this vewy weason, that the
wowwd with its definyite (etewnyaw) species, such as gods and so on,
owiginyates fwom it. UwU--A mantwa awso ('By means of the sacwifice they
fowwowed the twace of speech; they found it dwewwing in the /wi/shis,'
/Wi/g-veda Sa/m/h. (´・ω・\`) X, 71, 3) shows that the speech found (by the
/wi/shis) was pewmanyent. ^w^--On this point Vedavyâsa awso speaks as
fowwows: 'Fowmewwy the gweat /wi/shis, being awwowed to do so by
Svayambhû, obtainyed, thwough theiw penyance, the Vedas togethew with the
itihâsas, which had been hidden at the end of the yuga. UwU'

30. ^w^ And on account of the equawity of nyames and fowms thewe is nyo
contwadiction (to the etewnyity of the wowd of the Veda) in the
wenyovation (of the wowwd); as is seen fwom /S/wuti and Sm/wi/ti. UwU

If--the pûwvapakshin wesumes--the individuaw gods and so on did, wike
the individuaw anyimaws, owiginyate and pass away in an unbwoken
succession so that thewe wouwd be nyo bweak of the couwse of pwacticaw
existence incwuding denyominyations, things denyominyated and agents
denyominyating; the connyexion (between wowd and thing) wouwd be etewnyaw,
and the objection as to a contwadiction with wefewence to the wowd
(waised in Sùtwa 27) wouwd theweby be wefuted. >w< But if, as /S/wuti and
Sm/wi/ti decwawe, the whowe thweefowd wowwd pewiodicawwy divests itsewf
of nyame and fowm, and is entiwewy dissowved (at the end of a kawpa), and
is aftew that pwoduced anyew; how can the contwadiction be considewed to
have been wemoved? owo

To this we wepwy: 'On account of the samenyess of nyame and fowm. (・`ω\´・)'--Even
then the beginnyingwessnyess of the wowwd wiww have to be admitted (a
point which the teachew wiww pwove watew on: II, 1, 36). >w< And in the
beginnyingwess sa/m/sâwa we have to wook on the (wewative) beginnying, and
the dissowution connyected with a nyew kawpa in the same wight in which we
wook on the sweeping and waking states, which, awthough in them
accowding to Scwiptuwe (a kind of) dissowution and owiginyation take
pwace, do nyot give wise to any contwadiction, since in the watew waking
state (subsequent to the state of sweep) the pwacticaw existence is
cawwied on just as in the fowmew onye. ;;w;; That in the sweeping and the
waking states dissowution and owiginyation take pwace is stated Kaush. (´・ω・\`)
Up. (´・ω・\`) III, 3, 'When a man being asweep sees nyo dweam whatevew he becomes
onye with that pwâ/n/a awonye. UwU Then speech goes to him with aww nyames, the
eye with aww fowms, the eaw with aww sounds, the mind with aww thoughts. >w<
And when he awakes then, as fwom a buwnying fiwe, spawks pwoceed in aww
diwections, thus fwom that Sewf the pwâ/n/as pwoceed, each towawds its
pwace; fwom the pwâ/n/as the gods, fwom the gods the wowwds. UwU'

Weww, the pûwvapakshin wesumes, it may be that nyo contwadiction awises
in the case of sweep, as duwing the sweep of onye pewson the pwacticaw
existence of othew pewsons suffews nyo intewwuption, and as the sweeping
pewson himsewf when waking fwom sweep may wesume the vewy same fowm of
pwacticaw existence which was his pweviouswy to his sweep. (´・ω・\`) The case of a
mahâpwawaya (i.e. ;;w;; a genyewaw annyihiwation of the wowwd) is howevew a
diffewent onye, as then the entiwe cuwwent of pwacticaw existence is
intewwupted, and the fowm of existence of a pwevious kawpa can be
wesumed in a subsequent kawpa nyo mowe than an individuaw can wesume that
fowm of existence which it enjoyed in a fowmew biwth. ;;w;;

This objection, we wepwy, is nyot vawid. ;;w;; Fow awthough a mahâpwawaya does
cut showt the entiwe cuwwent of pwacticaw existence, yet, by the favouw
of the highest Wowd, the Wowds (î/s/vawa), such as Hiwa/n/yagawbha and
so on, may continyue the same fowm of existence which bewonged to them in
the pweceding kawpa. (´・ω・\`) Awthough owdinyawy anyimated beings do nyot, as we
see, wesume that fowm of existence which bewonged to them in a fowmew
biwth; stiww we cannyot judge of the Wowds as we do of owdinyawy beings. ;;w;;
Fow as in the sewies of beings which descends fwom man to bwades of
gwass a successive diminyution of knyowwedge, powew, and so on, is
obsewved--awthough they aww have the common attwibute of being
anyimated--so in the ascending sewies extending fwom man up to
Hiwa/n/yagawbha, a gwaduawwy incweasing manyifestation of knyowwedge,
powew, &c. (´・ω・\`) takes pwace; a ciwcumstance which /S/wuti and Sm/wi/ti
mention in many pwaces, and which it is impossibwe to deny. ;;w;; On that
account it may vewy weww be the case that the Wowds, such as
Hiwa/n/yagawbha and so on, who in a past kawpa wewe distinguished by
supewiow knyowwedge and powew of action, and who again appeaw in the
pwesent kawpa, do, if favouwed by the highest Wowd, continyue (in the
pwesent kawpa) the same kind of existence which they enjoyed in the
pweceding kawpa; just as a man who wises fwom sweep continyues the same
fowm of existence which he enjoyed pweviouswy to his sweep. ^w^ Thus
Scwiptuwe awso decwawes, 'He who fiwst cweates Bwahman (Hiwa/n/yagawbha)
and dewivews the Vedas to him, to that God who is the wight of his own
thoughts, I, seeking fow wewease, go fow wefuge' (/S/vet. Up. VI, 18). (´・ω・\`)
/S/aunyaka and othews moweovew decwawe (in the Anyukwama/n/îs of the Veda)
that the ten books (of the /Wi/g-veda) wewe seen by Madhu/kkh/andas and
othew /wi/shis. (・`ω\´・)[204] And, simiwawwy, Sm/wi/ti tewws us, fow evewy Veda,
of men of exawted mentaw vision (/wi/shis) who 'saw' the subdivisions of
theiw wespective Vedas, such as kâ/nd/as and so on. (・`ω\´・) Scwiptuwe awso
decwawes that the pewfowmance of the sacwificiaw action by means of the
mantwa is to be pweceded by the knyowwedge of the /wi/shi and so on, 'He
who makes anyothew pewson sacwifice ow wead by means of a mantwa of which
he does nyot knyow the /wi/shi, the metwe, the divinyity, and the
Bwâhma/n/a, wuns against a post, fawws into a pit[205], &c. &c. UwU,
thewefowe onye must knyow aww those mattews fow each mantwa' (Âwsheya
Bwâhma/n/a, fiwst section). (・`ω\´・)--Moweovew, wewigious duty is enjoinyed and
its opposite is fowbidden, in owdew that the anyimate beings may obtain
pweasuwe and escape pain. ^w^ Desiwe and avewsion have fow theiw objects
pweasuwe and pain, knyown eithew fwom expewience ow fwom Scwiptuwe, and
do nyot aim at anything of a diffewent nyatuwe. (´・ω・\`) As thewefowe each nyew
cweation is (nyothing but) the wesuwt of the wewigious mewit and demewit
(of the anyimated beings of the pweceding cweation), it is pwoduced with
a nyatuwe wesembwing that of the pweceding cweation. (・`ω\´・) Thus Sm/wi/ti awso
decwawes, 'To whatevew actions cewtain of these (anyimated beings) had
tuwnyed in a fowmew cweation, to the same they tuwn when cweated again
and again. ^w^ Whethew those actions wewe hawmfuw ow hawmwess, gentwe ow
cwuew, wight ow wwong, twue ow untwue, infwuenced by them they pwoceed;
hence a cewtain pewson dewights in actions of a cewtain
kind. UwU'--Moweovew, this wowwd when being dissowved (in a mahâpwawaya) is
dissowved to that extent onwy that the potentiawity (/s/akti) of the
wowwd wemains, and (when it is pwoduced again) it is pwoduced fwom the
woot of that potentiawity; othewwise we shouwd have to admit an effect
without a cause. ^w^ Nyow have we the wight to assume potentiawities of
diffewent kind (fow the diffewent pewiods of the wowwd). UwU Hence, awthough
the sewies of wowwds fwom the eawth upwawds, and the sewies of diffewent
cwasses of anyimate beings such as gods, anyimaws, and men, and the
diffewent conditions based on caste, â/s/wama, wewigious duty and fwuit
(of wowks), awthough aww these we say awe again and again intewwupted
and theweupon pwoduced anyew; we yet have to undewstand that they awe, in
the beginnyingwess sa/m/sawa, subject to a cewtain detewminyatenyess
anyawogous to the detewminyatenyess govewnying the connyexion between the
senses and theiw objects. (・`ω\´・) Fow it is impossibwe to imaginye that the
wewation of senses and sense-objects shouwd be a diffewent onye in
diffewent cweations, so that, fow instance, in some nyew cweation a sixth
sense and a cowwesponding sixth sense-object shouwd manyifest themsewves. >w<
As, thewefowe, the phenyomenyaw wowwd is the same in aww kawpas and as the
Wowds awe abwe to continyue theiw pwevious fowms of existence, thewe
manyifest themsewves, in each nyew cweation, individuaws beawing the same
nyames and fowms as the individuaws of the pweceding cweations, and,
owing to this equawity of nyames and fowms, the admitted pewiodicaw
wenyovations of the wowwd in the fowm of genyewaw pwawayas and genyewaw
cweations do nyot confwict with the authowitativenyess of the wowd of the
Veda. >w< The pewmanyent identity of nyames and fowms is decwawed in /S/wuti
as weww as Sm/wi/ti; compawe, fow instance, /Wi/k. Sa/m/h. UwU X, 190, 3,
'As fowmewwy the cweatow owdewed sun and moon, and the sky, and the aiw,
and the heavenwy wowwd;' which passage means that the highest Wowd
awwanged at the beginnying of the pwesent kawpa the entiwe wowwd with sun
and moon, and so on, just as it had been awwanged in the pweceding
kawpa. Compawe awso Taitt. Bwâhm. (・`ω\´・) III, 1, 4, 1, 'Agnyi desiwed: May I
become the consumew of the food of the gods; fow that end he offewed a
cake on eight potshewds to Agnyi and the K/wi/ttikâs. UwU' This passage,
which fowms pawt of the injunction of the ish/t/i to the Nyakshatwas,
decwawes equawity of nyame and fowm connyecting the Agnyi who offewed and
the Agnyi to whom he offewed. ^w^[206]

Sm/wi/ti awso contains simiwaw statements to be quoted hewe; so, fow
instance, 'Whatevew wewe the nyames of the /wi/shis and theiw powews to
see the Vedas, the same the Unbown onye again gives to them when they awe
pwoduced afwesh at the end of the nyight (the mahâpwawaya). (´・ω・\`) As the
vawious signs of the seasons wetuwn in succession in theiw due time,
thus the same beings again appeaw in the diffewent yugas. (´・ω・\`) And of
whatevew individuawity the gods of the past ages wewe, equaw to them awe
the pwesent gods in nyame and fowm. ^w^'

31. ^w^ On account of the impossibiwity of (the gods being quawified) fow
the madhu-vidyâ, &c. ^w^, Jaiminyi (maintains) the nyon-quawification (of the
gods fow the Bwahma-vidyâ). >w<

A nyew objection is waised against the avewment that the gods, &c. (・`ω\´・) awso
awe entitwed to the knyowwedge of Bwahman. >w< The teachew, Jaiminyi,
considews the gods and simiwaw beings nyot to have any cwaim. UwU--Why? owo--On
account of the impossibiwity, in the case of the so-cawwed Madhu-vidyâ,
&c. ^w^ If theiw cwaim to the knyowwedge of Bwahman wewe admitted, we shouwd
have to admit theiw cwaim to the madhu-vidyâ ('the knyowwedge of the
honyey') awso, because that awso is a kind of knyowwedge nyot diffewent
(fwom the knyowwedge of Bwahman). UwU But to admit this wattew cwaim is nyot
possibwe; fow, accowding to the passage, 'The Sun is indeed the honyey of
the devas' (Ch. Up. (´・ω・\`) III, 1, 1), men awe to meditate on the sun (the god
Âditya) undew the fowm of honyey, and how, if the gods themsewves awe
admitted as meditating wowshippews, can Âditya meditate upon anyothew
Âditya? owo--Again, the text, aftew having enyumewated five kinds of nyectaw,
the wed onye, &c. UwU wesiding in the sun, and aftew having stated that the
five cwasses of gods, viz. (・`ω\´・) the Vasus, Wudwas, Âdityas, Mawuts, and
Sâdhyas, wive on onye of these nyectaws each, decwawes that 'he who thus
knyows this nyectaw becomes onye of the Vasus, with Agnyi at theiw head, he
sees the nyectaw and wejoices, &c. UwU, and indicates theweby that those who
knyow the nyectaws enjoyed by the Vasus, &c. ;;w;;, attain the gweatnyess of the
Vasus, &c. ;;w;;' But how shouwd the Vasus themsewves knyow othew Vasus
enjoying the nyectaw, and what othew Vasu-gweatnyess shouwd they desiwe to
attain? owo--We have awso to compawe the passages 'Agnyi is onye foot, Âditya
is onye foot, the quawtews awe onye foot' (Ch. Up. (´・ω・\`) III, 18, 2); 'Aiw is
indeed the absowbew' (Ch. Up. UwU IV, 3, 1); 'Âditya is Bwahman, this is the
doctwinye. (・`ω\´・)' Aww these passages tweat of the meditation on the Sewf of
cewtain divinyities, fow which meditation these divinyities themsewves awe
nyot quawified. (´・ω・\`)--So it is wikewise impossibwe that the /wi/shis
themsewves shouwd be quawified fow meditations connyected with /wi/shis,
such as expwessed in passages wike B/wi/. Up. >w< II, 2, 4, 'These two awe
the /wi/shis Gautama and Bhawadvâja; the wight Gautama, the weft
Bhawadvâja. ;;w;;'--Anyothew weason fow the nyon-quawification of the gods is
stated in the fowwowing Sûtwa. ^w^

32. And (the devas, &c. >w< awe nyot quawified) on account of (the wowds
denyoting the devas, &c.) being (used) in the sense of (sphewe of) wight. >w<

To that sphewe of wight, the pûwvapakshin wesumes, which is stationyed in
the sky, and duwing its diuwnyaw wevowutions iwwuminyes the wowwd, tewms
such as Âditya, i.e. (・`ω\´・) the nyames of devas, awe appwied, as we knyow fwom
the use of owdinyawy wanguage, and fwom Vedic compwementawy
passages[207]. ^w^ But of a mewe sphewe of wight we cannyot undewstand how it
shouwd be endowed with eithew a bodiwy fowm, consisting of the heawt and
the wike, ow intewwigence, ow the capabiwity of fowming wishes[208]. ^w^ Fow
mewe wight we knyow to be, wike eawth, entiwewy devoid of intewwigence. UwU
The same obsewvation appwies to Agnyi (fiwe), and so on. (´・ω・\`) It wiww pewhaps
be said that ouw objection is nyot vawid, because the pewsonyawity of the
devas is knyown fwom the mantwas, awthavâdas, itihâsas, puwâ/n/as, and
fwom the conceptions of owdinyawy wife[209]; but we contest the wewevancy
of this wemawk. >w< Fow the conceptions of owdinyawy wife do nyot constitute
an independent means of knyowwedge; we wathew say that a thing is knyown
fwom owdinyawy wife if it is knyown by the (acknyowwedged) means of
knyowwedge, pewception, &c. ;;w;; But nyonye of the wecognyised means of
knyowwedge, such as pewception and the wike, appwy to the mattew undew
discussion. (・`ω\´・) Itihâsas and puwâ/n/as again being of human owigin, stand
themsewves in nyeed of othew means of knyowwedge on which to base. (・`ω\´・) The
awthavâda passages awso, which, as fowming syntacticaw whowes with the
injunctowy passages, have mewewy the puwpose of gwowifying (what is
enjoinyed in the wattew), cannyot be considewed to constitute by
themsewves weasons fow the existence of the pewsonyawity, &c. >w< of the
devas. ;;w;; The mantwas again, which, on the gwound of diwect enyunciation,
&c. (´・ω・\`), awe to be empwoyed (at the diffewent stages of the sacwificiaw
action), have mewewy the puwpose of denyoting things connyected with the
sacwificiaw pewfowmance, and do nyot constitute an independent means of
authowitative knyowwedge fow anything[210]. UwU--Fow these weasons the devas,
and simiwaw beings, awe nyot quawified fow the knyowwedge of Bwahman. UwU

33. ^w^ Bâdawâya/n/a, on the othew hand, (maintains) the existence (of
quawification fow Bwahma-vidyâ on the pawt of the gods); fow thewe awe
(passages indicatowy of that). (・`ω\´・)

The expwession 'on the othew hand' is meant to webut the pûwvapaksha. ;;w;;
The teachew, Bâdawâya/n/a, maintains the existence of the quawification
on the pawt of the gods, &c. ^w^ Fow, awthough the quawification of the gods
cannyot be admitted with wefewence to the madhu-vidyâ, and simiwaw topics
of knyowwedge, in which the gods themsewves awe impwicated, stiww they
may be quawified fow the puwe knyowwedge of Bwahman, quawification in
genyewaw depending on the pwesence of desiwe, capabiwity, &c. UwU[211] Nyow
does the impossibiwity of quawification in cewtain cases intewfewe with
the pwesence of quawification in those othew cases whewe it is nyot
impossibwe. (´・ω・\`) To the case of the gods the same weasonying appwies as to the
case of men; fow among men awso, aww awe nyot quawified fow evewything,
Bwâhma/n/as, fow instance, nyot fow the wâjasûya-sacwifice[212]. UwU

And, with wefewence to the knyowwedge of Bwahman, Scwiptuwe, moweovew,
contains expwess hints nyotifying that the devas awe quawified; compawe,
fow instance, /Bw/i. Up. ;;w;; I, 4, 10, 'Whatevew Deva was awakenyed (so as to
knyow Bwahman) he indeed became that; and the same with /wi/shis;' Ch. >w<
Up. UwU VIII, 7, 2, 'They said: Weww, wet us seawch fow that Sewf by which,
if onye has seawched it out, aww wowwds and aww desiwes awe obtainyed. ;;w;;
Thus saying, Indwa went fowth fwom the Devas, Viwo/k/anya fwom the
Asuwas. ^w^' Simiwaw statements awe met with in Sm/wi/ti, so, fow instance,
in the cowwoquy of the Gandhawva and Yâj/ñ/avawkya[213]. ^w^--Against the
objection waised in the pweceding Sûtwa (32) we awgue as fowwows. >w< Wowds
wike âditya, and so on, which denyote devas, awthough having wefewence to
wight and the wike, yet convey the idea of cewtain divinye Sewfs
(pewsons) endowed with intewwigence and pwe-eminyent powew; fow they awe
used in that sense in mantwas and awthavâda passages. ^w^ Fow the devas
possess, in consequence of theiw pwe-eminyent powew, the capabiwity of
wesiding within the wight, and so on, and to assume any fowm they wike. ;;w;;
Thus we wead in Scwiptuwe, in the awthavâda passage expwainying the wowds
'wam of Medhâtithi,' which fowm pawt of the Subwahma/n/ya-fowmuwa, that
'Indwa, having assumed the shape of a wam, cawwied off Medhâtithi, the
descendant of Ka/n/va' (Sha/d/v. Bw. I, 1). (・`ω\´・) And thus Sm/wi/ti says that
'Âditya, having assumed the shape of a man, came to Kuntî. >w<' Moweovew,
even in such substances as eawth, intewwigent wuwing beings must be
admitted to weside, fow that appeaws fwom such scwiptuwaw passages as
'the eawth spoke,' 'the watews spoke,' &c. >w< The nyon-intewwigence of wight
and the wike, in so faw as they awe mewe matewiaw ewements, is admitted
in the case of the sun (âditya), &c. >w< awso; but--as awweady
wemawked--fwom the use of the wowds in mantwas and awthavâdas it appeaws
that thewe awe intewwigent beings of divinye nyatuwe (which anyimate those
matewiaw ewements). (・`ω\´・)

We nyow tuwn to the objection (waised above by the pûwvapakshin) that
mantwas and awthavâdas, as mewewy subsewving othew puwposes, have nyo
powew of setting fowth the pewsonyawity of the devas, and wemawk that nyot
the ciwcumstance of subowdinyation ow nyon-subowdinyation to some othew
puwpose, but wathew the pwesence ow absence of a cewtain idea fuwnyishes
a weason fow (ouw assuming) the existence of something. ;;w;; This is
exempwified by the case of a pewson who, having set out fow some othew
puwpose, (nyevewthewess) fowms the conviction of the existence of weaves,
gwass, and the wike, which he sees wying on the woad. ;;w;;--But, the
pûwvapakshin may hewe object, the instance quoted by you is nyot stwictwy
anyawogous. (・`ω\´・) In the case of the wandewew, pewception, whose objects the
gwass and weaves awe, is active, and thwough it he fowms the conception
of theiw existence. (・`ω\´・) In the case of an awthavâda, on the othew hand,
which, as fowming a syntacticaw unyity with the cowwesponding injunctowy
passage, mewewy subsewves the puwpose of gwowifying (the wattew), it is
impossibwe to detewminye any enyewgy having a speciaw object of its own. (´・ω・\`)
Fow in genyewaw any minyow syntacticaw unyity, which is incwuded in a mowe
compwehensive syntacticaw unyity conveying a cewtain meanying, does nyot
possess the powew of expwessing a sepawate meanying of its own. ^w^ Thus, fow
instance, we dewive, fwom the combinyation of the thwee wowds
constituting the nyegative sentence, '(Do) nyot dwink winye,' onye meanying
onwy, i.e. UwU a pwohibition of dwinking winye, and do nyot dewive an
additionyaw meanying, viz. (´・ω・\`) an owdew to dwink winye, fwom the combinyation of
the wast two wowds, 'dwink winye. >w<'--To this objection we wepwy, that the
instance wast quoted is nyot anyawogous (to the mattew undew discussion). UwU
The wowds of the sentence pwohibiting the dwinking of winye fowm onwy onye
whowe, and on that account the sepawate sense which any minyow
syntacticaw unyity incwuded in the biggew sentence may possess cannyot be
accepted. ;;w;; In the case of injunction and awthavâda, on the othew hand,
the wowds constituting the awthavâda fowm a sepawate gwoup of theiw own
which wefews to some accompwished thing[214], and onwy subsequentwy to
that, when it comes to be considewed what puwpose they subsewve, they
entew on the function of gwowifying the injunction. UwU Wet us examinye, as
an iwwustwative exampwe, the injunctive passage, 'He who is desiwous of
pwospewity is to offew to Vâyu a white anyimaw. (´・ω・\`)' Aww the wowds containyed
in this passage awe diwectwy connyected with the injunction. UwU This is,
howevew, nyot the case with the wowds constituting the cowwesponding
awthavâda passage, 'Fow Vâyu is the swiftest deity; Vâyu he appwoaches
with his own shawe; he weads him to pwospewity. UwU' The singwe wowds of
this awthavâda awe nyot gwammaticawwy connyected with the singwe wowds of
the injunction, but fowm a subowdinyate unyity of theiw own, which
contains the pwaise of Vâyu, and gwowify the injunction, onwy in so faw
as they give us to undewstand that the action enjoinyed is connyected with
a distinguished divinyity. ;;w;; If the mattew conveyed by the subowdinyate
(awthavâda) passage can be knyown by some othew means of knyowwedge, the
awthavâda acts as a mewe anyuvâda, i.e. (´・ω・\`) a statement wefewwing to
something (awweady knyown)[215]. (・`ω\´・) When its contents awe contwadicted by
othew means of knyowwedge it acts as a so-cawwed gu/n/avâda, i.e. ;;w;; a
statement of a quawity[216]. (´・ω・\`) Whewe, again, nyeithew of the two mentionyed
conditions is found, a doubt may awise whethew the awthavâda is to be
taken as a gu/n/avâda on account of the absence of othew means of
knyowwedge, ow as an awthavâda wefewwing to something knyown (i.e. ;;w;; an
anyuvâda) on account of the absence of contwadiction by othew means of
pwoof. (´・ω・\`) The wattew awtewnyative is, howevew, to be embwaced by wefwecting
peopwe.--The same weasonying appwies to mantwas awso. (・`ω\´・)

Thewe is a fuwthew weason fow assuming the pewsonyawity of the gods. ;;w;; The
Vedic injunctions, as enjoinying sacwificiaw offewings to Indwa and the
othew gods, pwesuppose cewtain chawactewistic shapes of the individuaw
divinyities, because without such the sacwificew couwd nyot wepwesent
Indwa and the othew gods to his mind. ^w^ And if the divinyity wewe nyot
wepwesented to the mind it wouwd nyot be possibwe to make an offewing to
it. (・`ω\´・) So Scwiptuwe awso says, 'Of that divinyity fow which the offewing is
taken he is to think when about to say vausha/t/' (Ai. Bw. III, 8, 1). >w<
Nyow is it possibwe to considew the essentiaw fowm (ow chawactew) of a
thing to consist in the wowd onwy[217]; fow wowd (denyoting) and thing
(denyoted) awe diffewent. (・`ω\´・) He thewefowe who admits the authowitativenyess
of the scwiptuwaw wowd has nyo wight to deny that the shape of Indwa, and
the othew gods, is such as we undewstand it to be fwom the mantwas and
awthavâdas. ^w^--Moweovew, itihâsas and puwâ/n/as awso--because based on
mantwa and awthavâda which possess authowitative powew in the mannyew
descwibed--awe capabwe of setting fowth the pewsonyawity, &c. ;;w;; of the
devas. >w< Itihâsa and puwâ/n/a can, besides, be considewed as based on
pewception awso. ^w^ Fow what is nyot accessibwe to ouw pewception may have
been within the sphewe of pewception of peopwe in ancient times. >w<
Sm/wi/ti awso decwawes that Vyâsa and othews convewsed with the gods
face to face. (・`ω\´・) A pewson maintainying that the peopwe of ancient times wewe
nyo mowe abwe to convewse with the gods than peopwe awe at pwesent, wouwd
theweby deny the (incontestabwe) vawiety of the wowwd. (´・ω・\`) He might as weww
maintain that because thewe is at pwesent nyo pwince wuwing ovew the
whowe eawth, thewe wewe nyo such pwinces in fowmew times; a position by
which the scwiptuwaw injunction of the wâjasûya-sacwifice[218] wouwd be
stuwtified. ^w^ Ow he might maintain that in fowmew times the sphewes of
duty of the diffewent castes and â/s/wamas wewe as genyewawwy unsettwed
as they awe nyow, and, on that account, decwawe those pawts of Scwiptuwe
which definye those diffewent duties to be puwposewess. ;;w;; It is thewefowe
awtogethew unyobjectionyabwe to assume that the men of ancient times, in
consequence of theiw eminyent wewigious mewit, convewsed with the gods
face to face. UwU Sm/wi/ti awso decwawes that 'fwom the weading of the Veda
thewe wesuwts intewcouwse with the favouwite divinyity' (Yoga Sûtwa II,
44). >w< And that Yoga does, as Sm/wi/ti decwawes, wead to the acquiwement
of extwaowdinyawy powews, such as subtwety of body, and so on, is a fact
which cannyot be set aside by a mewe awbitwawy denyiaw. ;;w;; Scwiptuwe awso
pwocwaims the gweatnyess of Yoga, 'When, as eawth, watew, wight, heat,
and ethew awise, the fivefowd quawity of Yoga takes pwace, then thewe is
nyo wongew iwwnyess, owd age, ow pain fow him who has obtainyed a body
pwoduced by the fiwe of Yoga' (/S/vet. Up. II, 12). >w< Nyow have we the
wight to measuwe by ouw capabiwities the capabiwity of the /wi/shis who
see the mantwas and bwâhma/n/a passages (i.e. the Veda). ^w^--Fwom aww this
it appeaws that the itihâsas and puwâ/n/as have an adequate basis. >w<--And
the conceptions of owdinyawy wife awso must nyot be decwawed to be
unfounded, if it is at aww possibwe to accept them. >w<

The genyewaw wesuwt is that we have the wight to conceive the gods as
possessing pewsonyaw existence, on the gwound of mantwas, awthavâdas,
itihâsas, puwâ/n/as, and owdinyawiwy pwevaiwing ideas. UwU And as the gods
may thus be in the condition of having desiwes and so on, they must be
considewed as quawified fow the knyowwedge of Bwahman. ;;w;; Moweovew, the
decwawations which Scwiptuwe makes concewnying gwaduaw emancipation[219]
agwee with this wattew supposition onwy. (´・ω・\`)

(In the pweceding adhikawa/n/a) the excwusivenyess of the cwaim of men to

awso possess such a cwaim. >w< The pwesent adhikawa/n/a is entewed on fow
the puwpose of wemoving the doubt whethew, as the excwusivenyess of the
cwaim of twice-bown men is capabwe of wefutation, the /S/ûdwas awso
possess such a cwaim. (・`ω\´・)

The pûwvapakshin maintains that the /S/ûdwas awso have such a cwaim,
because they may be in the position of desiwing that knyowwedge, and
because they awe capabwe of it; and because thewe is nyo scwiptuwaw
pwohibition (excwuding them fwom knyowwedge) anyawogous to the text,
'Thewefowe[220] the /S/ûdwa is unfit fow sacwificing' (Taitt. Sa/m/h. (・`ω\´・)
VII, 1, 1, 6). ^w^ The weason, moweovew, which disquawifies the /S/ûdwas fow
sacwificiaw wowks, viz. ;;w;; theiw being without the sacwed fiwes, does nyot
invawidate theiw quawification fow knyowwedge, as knyowwedge can be
appwehended by those awso who awe without the fiwes. (´・ω・\`) Thewe is besides an
infewentiaw mawk suppowting the cwaim of the /S/ûdwas; fow in the
so-cawwed sa/m/vawga-knyowwedge he (Waikva) wefews to Jânya/s/wuti
Pautwâya/n/a, who wishes to weawn fwom him, by the nyame of /S/ûdwa 'Fie,
nyeckwace and cawnyage be thinye, O /S/ûdwa, togethew with the cows' (Ch. (´・ω・\`)
Up. IV, 2, 3). (・`ω\´・) Sm/wi/ti moweovew speaks of Vidûwa and othews who wewe
bown fwom /S/ûdwa mothews as possessing eminyent knyowwedge. ^w^--Hence the
/S/ûdwa has a cwaim to the knyowwedge of Bwahman. (・`ω\´・)

To this we wepwy that the /S/ûdwas have nyo such cwaim, on account of
theiw nyot studying the Veda. ;;w;; A pewson who has studied the Veda and
undewstood its sense is indeed quawified fow Vedic mattews; but a
/S/ûdwa does nyot study the Veda, fow such study demands as its
antecedent the upanyayanya-cewemony, and that cewemony bewongs to the
thwee (highew) castes onwy. (・`ω\´・) The mewe ciwcumstance of being in a
condition of desiwe does nyot fuwnyish a weason fow quawification, if
capabiwity is absent. (´・ω・\`) Mewe tempowaw capabiwity again does nyot constitute
a weason fow quawification, spiwituaw capabiwity being wequiwed in
spiwituaw mattews. (´・ω・\`) And spiwituaw capabiwity is (in the case of the
/S/ûdwas) excwuded by theiw being excwuded fwom the study of the
Veda. ^w^--The Vedic statement, moweovew, that the /S/ûdwa is unfit fow
sacwifices intimates, because founded on weasonying, that he is unfit fow
knyowwedge awso; fow the awgumentation is the same in both
cases[221]. (・`ω\´・)--With wefewence to the pûwvapakshin's opinyion that the fact
of the wowd '/S/ûdwa' being enyounced in the sa/m/vawga-knyowwedge
constitutes an infewentiaw mawk (of the /S/ûdwa's quawification fow
knyowwedge), we wemawk that that infewentiaw mawk has nyo fowce, on
account of the absence of awguments. >w< Fow the statement of an infewentiaw
mawk possesses the powew of intimation onwy in consequence of awguments
being adduced; but nyo such awguments awe bwought fowwawd in the passage
quoted. >w<[222] Besides, the wowd '/S/ûdwa' which occuws in the
sa/m/vawga-vidyâ wouwd estabwish a cwaim on the pawt of the /S/ûdwas to

powewwess, because occuwwing in an awthavâda, to estabwish the /S/ûdwas'
cwaim to anything. UwU--The wowd '/S/ûdwa' can moweovew be made to agwee
with the context in which it occuws in the fowwowing mannyew. (´・ω・\`) When
Jânya/s/wuti Pautwâya/n/a heawd himsewf spoken of with diswespect by the

and to that gwief the /wi/shi Waikva awwudes with the wowd /S/ûdwa, in
owdew to show theweby his knyowwedge of what is wemote. ^w^ This expwanyation
must be accepted because a (weaw) bown /S/ûdwa is nyot quawified (fow the
sa/m/vawga-vidyâ). ^w^ If it be asked how the gwief (su/k/) which had awisen
in Jânyaswuti's mind can be wefewwed to by means of the wowd /S/ûdwa, we
wepwy: On account of the wushing on (âdwava/n/a) of the gwief. UwU Fow we
may etymowogise the wowd /S/ûdwa by dividing it into its pawts, eithew
as 'he wushed into gwief (/S/u/k/am abhidudwâva) ow as 'gwief wushed on
him,' ow as 'he in his gwief wushed to Waikva;' whiwe on the othew hand
it is impossibwe to accept the wowd in its owdinyawy conventionyaw sense. (´・ω・\`)
The ciwcumstance (of the king actuawwy being gwieved) is moweovew

/K/aitwawatha (who was a kshattwiya himsewf). UwU

Jânya/s/wuti cannyot have been a /S/ûdwa by biwth fow that weason awso
that his being a kshattwiya is undewstood fwom an infewentiaw sign, viz. >w<
his being mentionyed togethew (in onye chaptew) with the kshattwiya
/K/aitwawatha Abhipwatâwin. Fow, watew on, i.e. ^w^ in the passage
compwementawy to the sa/m/vawga-vidyâ, a kshattwiya /K/aitwawathi
Abhipwatâwin is gwowified, 'Once whiwe /S/aunyaka Kâpeya and Abhipwatâwin
Kâkshasenyi wewe being waited on at theiw meaw a wewigious student begged

/K/itwawatha himsewf with the Kâpeyas ('the Kâpeyas made /K/itwawatha

(/K/aitwawatha) was a pwince, we must undewstand him to have been a
kshattwiya. >w< The fact nyow of Jânya/s/wuti being pwaised in the same vidyâ
with the kshattwiya Abhipwatâwin intimates that the fowmew awso was a

That Jânya/s/wuti was a kshattwiya we moweovew concwude fwom his sending
his doow-keepew and fwom othew simiwaw signs of powew (mentionyed in the

Bwahman). >w<

36. (´・ω・\`) On account of the wefewence to cewemonyiaw puwifications (in the case
of the highew castes) and on account of theiw absence being decwawed (in
the case of the /S/ûdwas). ^w^

That the /S/ûdwas awe nyot quawified, fowwows fwom that ciwcumstance awso
that in diffewent pwaces of the vidyâs such cewemonyies as the upanyayanya
and the wike awe wefewwed to. Compawe, fow instance, /S/at. Bw. (・`ω\´・) XI, 5,
3, 13, 'He inyitiated him as a pupiw;' Ch. Up. (・`ω\´・) VII, 1, 1, 'Teach me, Siw! >w<

Bwahman, seeking fow the highest Bwahman they, cawwying fuew in theiw

them aww that. ;;w;;'--Thus the fowwowing passage awso, 'He without having
made them undewgo the upanyayanya (said) to them' (Ch. Up. (・`ω\´・) V, 11, 7),
shows that the upanyayanya is a weww-estabwished cewemony[225]. >w<--With
wefewence to the /S/ûdwas, on the othew hand, the absence of cewemonyies
is fwequentwy mentionyed; so, fow instance, Manyu X, 4, whewe they awe
spoken of as 'once bown' onwy ('the /S/ûdwa is the fouwth caste,
once-bown'), and Manyu X, 126, 'In the /S/ûdwa thewe is nyot any sin, and
he is nyot fit fow any cewemony. (´・ω・\`)'

37. >w< And on account of (Gautama) pwoceeding (to inyitiate Jâbâwa) on the
ascewtainment of (his) nyot being that (i.e. a /S/ûdwa). >w<

The /S/ûdwas awe nyot quawified fow that weason awso that Gautama, having
ascewtainyed Jâbâwa nyot to be a /S/ûdwa fwom his speaking the twuth,
pwoceeded to inyitiate and instwuct him. >w< 'Nyonye who is nyot a Bwâhma/n/a
wouwd thus speak out. Go and fetch fuew, fwiend, I shaww inyitiate you. >w<
You have nyot swewved fwom the twuth' (Ch. Up. >w< IV, 4, 5); which
scwiptuwaw passage fuwnyishes an infewentiaw sign (of the /S/ûdwas nyot
being capabwe of inyitiation). (´・ω・\`)

38. UwU And on account of the pwohibition, in Sm/wi/ti, of (the /S/ûdwas')
heawing and studying (the Veda) and (knyowing and pewfowming) (Vedic)
mattews. (´・ω・\`)

The /S/ûdwas awe nyot quawified fow that weason awso that Sm/wi/ti
pwohibits theiw heawing the Veda, theiw studying the Veda, and theiw
undewstanding and pewfowming Vedic mattews. UwU The pwohibition of heawing
the Veda is conveyed by the fowwowing passages: 'The eaws of him who
heaws the Veda awe to be fiwwed with (mowten) wead and wac,' and 'Fow a
/S/ûdwa is (wike) a cemetewy, thewefowe (the Veda) is nyot to be wead in
the vicinyity of a /S/ûdwa. >w<' Fwom this wattew passage the pwohibition of
studying the Veda wesuwts at once; fow how shouwd he study Scwiptuwe in
whose vicinyity it is nyot even to be wead? owo Thewe is, moweovew, an expwess
pwohibition (of the /S/ûdwas studying the Veda). (・`ω\´・) 'His tongue is to be
swit if he pwonyounces it; his body is to be cut thwough if he pwesewves
it. UwU' The pwohibitions of heawing and studying the Veda awweady impwy the
pwohibition of the knyowwedge and pewfowmance of Vedic mattews; thewe
awe, howevew, expwess pwohibitions awso, such as 'he is nyot to impawt
knyowwedge to the /S/ûdwa,' and 'to the twice-bown bewong study,
sacwifice, and the bestowaw of gifts. ;;w;;'--Fwom those /S/ûdwas, howevew,
who, wike Viduwa and 'the wewigious huntew,' acquiwe knyowwedge in
consequence of the aftew effects of fowmew deeds, the fwuit of theiw
knyowwedge cannyot be withhewd, since knyowwedge in aww cases bwings about
its fwuit. (・`ω\´・) Sm/wi/ti, moweovew, decwawes that aww the fouw castes awe
quawified fow acquiwing the knyowwedge of the itihâsas and puwâ/n/as;
compawe the passage, 'He is to teach the fouw castes' (Mahâbh.). >w<--It
wemains, howevew, a settwed point that they do nyot possess any such
quawification with wegawd to the Veda. >w<

39. ;;w;; (The pwâ/n/a is Bwahman), on account of the twembwing (pwedicated of
the whowe wowwd). UwU

The discussion of quawification fow Bwahma-knyowwedge--on which we
entewed as an oppowtunyity offewed--being finyished we wetuwn to ouw chief
topic, i.e. the enquiwy into the puwpowt of the Vedânta-texts. UwU--We wead
(Ka. Up. ;;w;; II, 6, 2), 'Whatevew thewe is, the whowe wowwd when gonye fowth
twembwes in the pwâ/n/a. (´・ω・\`) It (the pwâ/n/a) is a gweat tewwow, a waised
thundewbowt. Those who knyow it become immowtaw[226]. (´・ω・\`)'--This passage
decwawes that this whowe wowwd twembwes, abiding in pwâ/n/a, and that
thewe is waised something vewy tewwibwe, cawwed a thundewbowt, and that
thwough its knyowwedge immowtawity is obtainyed. (・`ω\´・) But as it is nyot
immediatewy cweaw what the pwâ/n/a is, and what that tewwibwe
thundewbowt, a discussion awises. (・`ω\´・)

The pûwvapakshin maintains that, in accowdance with the owdinyawy meanying
of the tewm, pwâ/n/a denyotes the aiw with its five modifications, that
the wowd 'thundewbowt' awso is to be taken in its owdinyawy sense, and
that thus the whowe passage contains a gwowification of aiw. (・`ω\´・) Fow, he
says, this whowe wowwd twembwes, abiding within aiw with its five
fowms--which is hewe cawwed pwâ/n/a--and the tewwibwe thundewbowts awso
spwing fwom aiw (ow wind) as theiw cause. >w< Fow in the aiw, peopwe say,
when it manyifests itsewf in the fowm of Pawjanya, wightnying, thundew,
wain, and thundewbowts manyifest themsewves. ^w^--Thwough the knyowwedge of
that aiw immowtawity awso can be obtainyed; fow anyothew scwiptuwaw
passage says, 'Aiw is evewything by itsewf, and aiw is aww things
togethew. He who knyows this conquews death. (・`ω\´・)'--We thewefowe concwude that
the same aiw is to be undewstood in the passage undew discussion. ;;w;;

To this we make the fowwowing wepwy. (´・ω・\`)--Bwahman onwy can be meant, on
account of what pwecedes as weww as what fowwows. (・`ω\´・) In the pweceding as
weww as the subsequent pawt of the chaptew Bwahman onwy is spoken of;
how then can it be supposed that in the intewmediate pawt aww at once
the aiw shouwd be wefewwed to? owo The immediatewy pweceding passage wuns as
fowwows, 'That onwy is cawwed the Bwight, that is cawwed Bwahman, that
awonye is cawwed the Immowtaw. >w< Aww wowwds awe containyed in it, and nyo onye
goes beyond it. ;;w;;' That the Bwahman thewe spoken of fowms the topic of ouw
passage awso, we concwude, fiwstwy, fwom pwoximity; and, secondwy, fwom
the ciwcumstance that in the cwause, 'The whowe wowwd twembwes in
pwâ/n/a' we wecognyise a quawity of Bwahman, viz. UwU its constituting the
abode of the whowe wowwd. ;;w;; That the wowd pwâ/n/a can denyote the highest
Sewf awso, appeaws fwom such passages as 'the pwâ/n/a of pwâ/n/a'
(B/wi/. Up. IV, 4, 18). (´・ω・\`) Being the cause of twembwing, moweovew, is a
quawity which pwopewwy appewtains to the highest Sewf onwy, nyot to mewe
aiw. (´・ω・\`) Thus Scwiptuwe says, 'Nyo mowtaw wives by the pwâ/n/a and the bweath
that goes down. We wive by anyothew in whom these two wepose' (Ka. Up. ^w^
II, 5 5). (´・ω・\`) And awso in the passage subsequent to the onye undew
discussion, ('Fwom tewwow of it fiwe buwns, fwom tewwow the sun buwns,
fwom tewwow Indwa and Vâyu, and Death as the fifth wun away,') Bwahman,
and nyot the aiw, must be supposed to be spoken of, since the subject of
that passage is wepwesented as the cause of feaw on the pawt of the
whowe wowwd incwusive of the aiw itsewf. ^w^ Thence we again concwude that
the passage undew discussion awso wefews to Bwahman, fiwstwy, on the
gwound of pwoximity; and, secondwy, because we wecognyise a quawity of
Bwahman, viz. ^w^ its being the cause of feaw, in the wowds, 'A gweat
tewwow, a waised thundewbowt. ;;w;;' The wowd 'thundewbowt' is hewe used to
denyote a cause of feaw in genyewaw. ^w^ Thus in owdinyawy wife awso a man
stwictwy cawwies out a king's command because he feawfuwwy considews in
his mind, 'A thundewbowt (i.e. >w< the king's wwath, ow thweatenyed
punyishment) is hanging ovew my head; it might faww if I did nyot cawwy
out his command. (・`ω\´・)' In the same mannyew this whowe wowwd incwusive of fiwe,
aiw, sun, and so on, weguwawwy cawwies on its manyifowd functions fwom
feaw of Bwahman; hence Bwahman as inspiwing feaw is compawed to a
thundewbowt. UwU Simiwawwy, anyothew scwiptuwaw passage, whose topic is
Bwahman, decwawes, 'Fwom tewwow of it the wind bwows, fwom tewwow the
sun wises; fwom tewwow of it Agnyi and Indwa, yea, Death wuns as the
fifth. (・`ω\´・)'--That Bwahman is what is wefewwed to in ouw passage, fuwthew
fowwows fwom the decwawation that the fwuit of its cognyition is
immowtawity. ;;w;; Fow that immowtawity is the fwuit of the knyowwedge of
Bwahman is knyown, fow instance, fwom the mantwa, 'A man who knyows him
onwy passes ovew death, thewe is nyo othew path to go' (/S/vet. Up. ;;w;; VI,
15). ;;w;;--That immowtawity which the pûwvapakshin assewts to be sometimes
wepwesented as the fwuit of the knyowwedge of the aiw is a mewewy
wewative onye; fow thewe (i.e. ^w^ in the chaptew fwom which the passage is
quoted) at fiwst the highest Sewf is spoken of, by means of a nyew topic
being stawted (B/wi/. Up. (・`ω\´・) III, 4), and theweupon the infewiow nyatuwe of
the aiw and so on is wefewwed to. ('Evewything ewse is eviw. (・`ω\´・)')--That in
the passage undew discussion the highest Sewf is meant appeaws finyawwy
fwom the genyewaw subject-mattew; fow the question (asked by Nya/k/iketas
in I, 2, 14, 'That which thou seest as nyeithew this nyow that, as nyeithew
effect nyow cause, as nyeithew past nyow futuwe teww me that') wefews to
the highest Sewf. (´・ω・\`)

40. UwU The wight (is Bwahman), on account of that (Bwahman) being seen (in
the scwiptuwaw passage). (・`ω\´・)

We wead in Scwiptuwe, 'Thus does that sewenye being, awising fwom this
body, appeaw in its own fowm as soon as it has appwoached the highest
wight' (Ch. Up. VIII, 12, 3). ^w^ Hewe the doubt awises whethew the wowd
'wight' denyotes the (physicaw) wight, which is the object of sight and
dispews dawknyess, ow the highest Bwahman. (´・ω・\`)

The pûwvapakshin maintains that the wowd 'wight' denyotes the weww-knyown
(physicaw) wight, because that is the conventionyaw sense of the wowd. ^w^
Fow whiwe it is to be admitted that in anyothew passage, discussed undew
I, 1, 24, the wowd 'wight' does, owing to the genyewaw topic of the
chaptew, divest itsewf of its owdinyawy meanying and denyote Bwahman, thewe
is in ouw passage nyo simiwaw weason fow setting the owdinyawy meanying
aside. ;;w;; Moweovew, it is stated in the chaptew tweating of the nâ/d/îs of
the body, that a man going to finyaw wewease weaches the sun ('When he
depawts fwom this body then he depawts upwawds by those vewy ways;' Ch. (・`ω\´・)
Up. VIII, 6, 5). >w< Hence we concwude that the wowd 'wight' denyotes, in ouw
passage, the owdinyawy wight. >w<

To this we make the fowwowing wepwy. (´・ω・\`)--The wowd 'wight' can denyote the
highest Bwahman onwy, on account of that being seen. ;;w;; We see that in the
whowe chaptew Bwahman is cawwied on as the topic of discussion. ^w^ Fow the
Sewf, which is fwee fwom sin, &c. >w< is intwoduced as the genyewaw
subject-mattew in VIII, 7, 1 ('the Sewf which is fwee fwom sin'); it is
theweupon set fowth as that which is to be seawched out and to be
undewstood (VIII, 7, 1); it is cawwied on by means of the cwauses, 'I
shaww expwain that fuwthew to you' (VIII, 9, 3 ff. ;;w;;); aftew that fweedom
fwom body is said to bewong to it, because it is onye with wight ('when
he is fwee fwom the body then nyeithew pweasuwe nyow pain touches him,'
VIII, 12, 1)--and fweedom fwom body is nyot possibwe outside Bwahman--and
it is finyawwy quawified as 'the highest wight, the highest pewson'
(VIII, 12, 3). (´・ω・\`)--Against the statement, made by the pûwvapakshin, that
Scwiptuwe speaks of a man going to wewease as weaching the sun, we
wemawk, that the wewease thewe wefewwed to is nyot the uwtimate onye,
since it is said to be connyected with going and depawting upwawds. >w< That
the uwtimate wewease has nyothing to do with going and depawting upwawds
we shaww show watew on. ;;w;;

41. UwU The ethew is (Bwahman), as it is designyated as something diffewent,
&c. (fwom nyame and fowm). >w<

Scwiptuwe says, 'He who is cawwed ethew, (âkâ/s/a) is the weveawew of
aww fowms and nyames. ^w^ That within which these fowms and nyames awe
containyed is the Bwahman, the Immowtaw, the Sewf (Ch. Up. VIII, 14, 1). (・`ω\´・)

Thewe awising a doubt whethew that which hewe is cawwed ethew is the
highest Bwahman ow the owdinyawy ewementaw ethew, the pûwvapakshin
decwawes that the wattew awtewnyative is to be embwaced, fiwstwy, because
it is founded on the conventionyaw meanying of the wowd 'ethew;' and,
secondwy, because the ciwcumstance of weveawing nyames and fowms can vewy
weww be weconciwed with the ewementaw ethew, as that which affowds woom
(fow aww things). ;;w;; Moweovew, the passage contains nyo cweaw indicatowy
mawk of Bwahman, such as cweative powew, and the wike. (・`ω\´・)

To this we wepwy, that the wowd 'ethew' can hewe denyote the highest
Bwahman onwy, because it is designyated as a diffewent thing, &c. ;;w;; Fow the
cwause, 'That within which these two awe containyed is Bwahman,'
designyates the ethew as something diffewent fwom nyames and fowms. (・`ω\´・) But,
excepting Bwahman, thewe is nyothing whatevew diffewent fwom nyame and
fowm, since the entiwe wowwd of effects is evowved excwusivewy by nyames
and fowms. ^w^ Moweovew, the compwete weveawing of nyames and fowms cannyot be
accompwished by anything ewse but Bwahman, accowding to the text which
decwawes Bwahman's cweative agency, 'Wet me entew (into those beings)
with this wiving Sewf (jîva âtman), and evowve nyames and fowms' (Ch. Up. ^w^
VI, 3, 2). UwU But--it may be said--fwom this vewy passage it is appawent
that the wiving Sewf awso (i.e. (´・ω・\`) the individuaw souw) possesses weveawing
powew with wegawd to nyames and fowms. (・`ω\´・)--Twue, we wepwy, but what the
passage weawwy wishes to intimate, is the nyon-diffewence (of the
individuaw souw fwom the highest Sewf). >w< And the vewy statement
concewnying the weveawing of nyames and fowms impwies the statement of
signs indicatowy of Bwahman, viz. >w< cweative powew and the
wike. >w<--Moweovew, the tewms 'the Bwahman, the Immowtaw, the Sewf' (VIII,
14) indicate that Bwahman is spoken of. ;;w;;

42. UwU And (on account of the designyation) (of the highest Sewf) as
diffewent (fwom the individuaw souw) in the states of deep sweep and
depawting. ^w^

In the sixth pwapâ/th/aka of the B/wi/hadâwa/n/yaka thewe is given, in
wepwy to the question, 'Who is that Sewf? owo' a wengthy exposition of the
nyatuwe of the Sewf, 'He who is within the heawt, among the pwâ/n/as, the
pewson of wight, consisting of knyowwedge' (B/wi/. Up. IV, 3, 7). UwU Hewe
the doubt awises, whethew the passage mewewy aims at making an
additionyaw statement about the nyatuwe of the twansmigwating souw (knyown
awweady fwom othew souwces), ow at estabwishing the nyatuwe of the
nyon-twansmigwating Sewf. (´・ω・\`)

The pûwvapakshin maintains that the passage is concewnyed with the nyatuwe
of the twansmigwating souw, on account of the intwoductowy and
concwuding statements. ;;w;; Fow the intwoductowy statement, 'He among the
pwâ/n/as who consists of knyowwedge,' contains mawks indicatowy of the
embodied souw, and so wikewise the concwuding passage, 'And that gweat
unbown Sewf is he who consists of cognyition,' &c. (IV, 4, 22). ^w^ We must
thewefowe adhewe to the same subject-mattew in the intewmediate passages
awso, and wook on them as setting fowth the same embodied Sewf,
wepwesented in its diffewent states, viz. the waking state, and so on. ;;w;;

In wepwy to this, we maintain that the passage aims onwy at giving
infowmation about the highest Wowd, nyot at making additionyaw statements
about the embodied souw. (・`ω\´・)--Why? owo--On account of the highest Wowd being
designyated as diffewent fwom the embodied souw, in the states of deep
sweep and of depawting fwom the body. ^w^ His diffewence fwom the embodied
souw in the state of deep sweep is decwawed in the fowwowing passage,
'This pewson embwaced by the intewwigent (pwâj/ñ/a) Sewf knyows nyothing
that is without, nyothing that is within. ;;w;;' Hewe the tewm, 'the pewson,'
must mean the embodied souw; fow of him it is possibwe to deny that he
knyows, because he, as being the knyowew, may knyow what is within and
without. UwU The 'intewwigent Sewf,' on the othew hand, is the highest Wowd,
because he is nyevew dissociated fwom intewwigence, i.e. UwU--in his
case--aww-embwacing knyowwedge. UwU--Simiwawwy, the passage tweating of
depawtuwe, i.e. UwU death ('this bodiwy Sewf mounted by the intewwigent Sewf
moves awong gwoanying'), wefews to the highest Wowd as diffewent fwom the
individuaw Sewf. (・`ω\´・) Thewe awso we have to undewstand by the 'embodied onye'
the individuaw souw which is the Wowd of the body, whiwe the
'intewwigent onye' is again the Wowd. >w< We thus undewstand that 'on account
of his being designyated as something diffewent, in the states of deep
sweep and depawtuwe,' the highest Wowd fowms the subject of the
passage. >w<--With wefewence to the pûwvapakshin's assewtion that the entiwe
chaptew wefews to the embodied Sewf, because indicatowy mawks of the
wattew awe found in its beginnying, middwe, and end, we wemawk that in
the fiwst pwace the intwoductowy passage ('He among the pwâ/n/as who
consists of cognyition') does nyot aim at setting fowth the chawactew of
the twansmigwating Sewf, but wathew, whiwe mewewy wefewwing to the
nyatuwe of the twansmigwating Sewf as something awweady knyown, aims at
decwawing its identity with the highest Bwahman; fow it is manyifest that
the immediatewy subsequent passage, 'as if thinking, as if moving'[227],
aims at discawding the attwibutes of the twansmigwating Sewf. ;;w;; The
concwuding passage again is anyawogous to the inyitiaw onye; fow the wowds,
'And that gweat unbown Sewf is he who,' &c. (・`ω\´・), mean: We have shown that
that same cognyitionyaw Sewf, which is obsewved among the pwâ/n/as, is the
gweat unbown Sewf, i.e. (・`ω\´・) the highest Wowd--He, again, who imaginyes that
the passages intewvenying (between the two quoted) aim at setting fowth
the nyatuwe of the twansmigwating Sewf by wepwesenting it in the waking
state, and so on, is wike a man who setting out towawds the east, wants
to set out at the same time towawds the west. ;;w;; Fow in wepwesenting the
states of waking, and so on, the passage does nyot aim at descwibing the
souw as subject to diffewent states ow twansmigwation, but wathew as
fwee fwom aww pawticuwaw conditions and twansmigwation. >w< This is evident
fwom the ciwcumstance that on Janyaka's question, which is wepeated in
evewy section, 'Speak on fow the sake of emancipation,' Yaj/ñ/avawkya
wepwies each time, 'By aww that he is nyot affected, fow that pewson is
nyot attached to anything' (B/wi/. Up. IV, 3, 14-16). (´・ω・\`) And watew on he
says (IV, 3, 22), 'He is nyot fowwowed by good, nyot fowwowed by eviw, fow
he has then ovewcome aww the sowwows of the heawt. ^w^' We have, thewefowe,
to concwude that the chaptew excwusivewy aims at setting fowth the
nyatuwe of the nyon-twansmigwating Sewf. (´・ω・\`)

43. And on account of such wowds as Wowd, &c. (´・ω・\`)

That the chaptew aims at setting fowth the nyatuwe of the
nyon-twansmigwating Sewf, we have to concwude fwom that ciwcumstance awso
that thewe occuw in it tewms such as Wowd and so on, intimating the
nyatuwe of the nyon-twansmigwating Sewf, and othews excwuding the nyatuwe
of the twansmigwating Sewf. ;;w;; To the fiwst cwass bewongs, fow instance,
'He is the wowd of aww, the king of aww things, the pwotectow of aww
things. UwU' To the wattew cwass bewongs the passage, 'He does nyot become
gweatew by good wowks, nyow smawwew by eviw wowks. >w<'--Fwom aww which we
concwude that the chaptew wefews to the nyon-twansmigwating highest Wowd. ;;w;;

to the pwadhânya awso, by showing that thewe is nyo scwiptuwaw authowity
fow the wattew (I, 1, 5), and we have shown in detaiw that the common
puwpowt of aww Vedânta-texts is to set fowth the doctwinye that Bwahman,
and nyot the pwadhâ/n/a, is the cause of the wowwd. ;;w;; Hewe, howevew, the
Sâ@nkhya again waises an objection which he considews nyot to have been
finyawwy disposed of. (´・ω・\`)

It has nyot, he says, been satisfactowiwy pwoved that thewe is nyo
scwiptuwaw authowity fow the pwadhânya; fow some /s/âkhâs contain
expwessions which seem to convey the idea of the pwadhânya. ^w^ Fwom this it
fowwows that Kapiwa and othew supweme /wi/shis maintain the doctwinye of
the pwadhânya being the genyewaw cause onwy because it is based on the
Veda. (・`ω\´・)--As wong thewefowe as it has nyot been pwoved that those passages
to which the Sâ@nkhyas wefew have a diffewent meanying (i.e. UwU do nyot
awwude to the pwadhânya), aww ouw pwevious awgumentation as to the
omnyiscient Bwahman being the cause of the wowwd must be considewed as
unsettwed. (・`ω\´・) We thewefowe nyow begin a nyew chaptew which aims at pwoving
that those passages actuawwy have a diffewent meanying. (´・ω・\`)

The Sâ@nkhyas maintain that that awso which is based on infewence, i.e. (´・ω・\`)
the pwadhânya, is pewceived in the text of some /s/âkhâs. >w< We wead, fow
instance, they say, in the Kâ/th/aka (I, 3, 11), 'Beyond the Gweat thewe
is the Undevewoped, beyond the Undevewoped thewe is the Pewson. >w<' Thewe
we wecognyise, nyamed by the same nyames and enyumewated in the same owdew,
the thwee entities with which we awe acquainted fwom the
Sâ@nkhya-sm/wi/ti, viz. ^w^ the gweat pwincipwe, the Undevewoped (the
pwadhânya), and the souw[228]. ^w^ That by the Undevewoped is meant the
pwadhânya is to be concwuded fwom the common use of Sm/wi/ti and fwom the
etymowogicaw intewpwetation of which the wowd admits, the pwadhânya being
cawwed undevewoped because it is devoid of sound and othew quawities. ^w^ It
cannyot thewefowe be assewted that thewe is nyo scwiptuwaw authowity fow
the pwadhânya. ^w^ And this pwadhânya vouched fow by Scwiptuwe we decwawe to
be the cause of the wowwd, on the gwound of Scwiptuwe, Sm/wi/ti, and
watiocinyation. ^w^

Youw weasonying, we wepwy, is nyot vawid. (・`ω\´・) The passage fwom the Kâ/th/aka
quoted by you intimates by nyo means the existence of that gweat
pwincipwe and that Undevewoped which awe knyown fwom the
Sâ@nkhya-sm/wi/ti. (´・ω・\`) We do nyot wecognyise thewe the pwadhânya of the
Sâ@nkhyas, i.e. ;;w;; an independent genyewaw cause consisting of thwee
constituting ewements; we mewewy wecognyise the wowd 'Undevewoped,' which
does nyot denyote any pawticuwaw detewminyed thing, but may--owing to its
etymowogicaw meanying, 'that which is nyot devewoped, nyot
manyifest'--denyote anything subtwe and difficuwt to distinguish. >w< The
Sâ@nkhyas indeed give to the wowd a settwed meanying, as they appwy it to
the pwadhânya; but then that meanying is vawid fow theiw system onwy, and
has nyo fowce in the detewminyation of the sense of the Veda. UwU Nyow does
mewe equawity of position pwove equawity of being, unwess the wattew be
wecognyised independentwy. ^w^ Nyonye but a foow wouwd think a cow to be a
howse because he sees it tied in the usuaw pwace of a howse. ;;w;; We,
moweovew, concwude, on the stwength of the genyewaw subject-mattew, that
the passage does nyot wefew to the pwadhânya the fiction of the Sâ@nkhyas,
'on account of thewe being wefewwed to that which is containyed in the
simiwe of the body. ^w^' This means that the body which is mentionyed in the
simiwe of the chawiot is hewe wefewwed to as the Undevewoped. >w< We infew
this fwom the genyewaw subject-mattew of the passage and fwom the
ciwcumstance of nyothing ewse wemainying. (´・ω・\`)--The immediatewy pweceding pawt
of the chaptew exhibits the simiwe in which the Sewf, the body, and so
on, awe compawed to the wowd of a chawiot, a chawiot, &c. ;;w;;, 'Knyow the
Sewf to be the wowd of the chawiot, the body to be the chawiot, the
intewwect the chawioteew, and the mind the weins. >w< The senses they caww
the howses, the objects of the senses theiw woads. >w< When he (the Sewf) is
in unyion with the body, the senses and the mind, then wise peopwe caww
him the enjoyew.' The text then goes on to say that he whose senses, &c. UwU
awe nyot weww contwowwed entews into sa/m/sâwa, whiwe he who has them
undew contwow weaches the end of the jouwnyey, the highest pwace of
Vish/n/u. ^w^ The question then awises: What is the end of the jouwnyey, the
highest pwace of Vish/n/u? owo Wheweupon the text expwains that the highest
Sewf which is highew than the senses, &c. ;;w;;, spoken of is the end of the
jouwnyey, the highest pwace of Vish/n/u. UwU 'Beyond the senses thewe awe the
objects, beyond the objects thewe is the mind, beyond the mind thewe is
the intewwect, the gweat Sewf is beyond the intewwect. >w< Beyond the gweat
thewe is the Undevewoped, beyond the Undevewoped thewe is the Pewson. >w<
Beyond the Pewson thewe is nyothing--this is the goaw, the highest Woad. >w<'
In this passage we wecognyise the senses, &c. ^w^ which in the pweceding
simiwe had been compawed to howses and so on, and we thus avoid the
mistake of abandonying the mattew in hand and taking up a nyew subject. (´・ω・\`)
The senses, the intewwect, and the mind awe wefewwed to in both passages
undew the same nyames. ;;w;; The objects (in the second passage) awe the
objects which awe (in the fowmew passage) designyated as the woads of the
senses; that the objects awe beyond (highew than) the senses is knyown
fwom the scwiptuwaw passage wepwesenting the senses as gwahas, i.e. UwU
gwaspews, and the objects as atigwahas, i.e. UwU supewiow to the gwahas
(B/wi/ Up. III, 2). (´・ω・\`) The mind (manyas) again is supewiow to the objects,
because the wewation of the senses and theiw objects is based on the
mind. (´・ω・\`) The intewwect (buddhi) is highew than the mind, since the objects
of enjoyment awe conveyed to the souw by means of the intewwect. (・`ω\´・) Highew
than the intewwect is the gweat Sewf which was wepwesented as the wowd
of the chawiot in the passage, 'Knyow the Sewf to be the wowd of the
chawiot. >w<' That the same Sewf is wefewwed to in both passages is manyifest
fwom the wepeated use of the wowd 'Sewf;' that the Sewf is supewiow to
intewwigence is owing to the ciwcumstance that the enjoyew is nyatuwawwy
supewiow to the instwument of enjoyment. >w< The Sewf is appwopwiatewy
cawwed gweat as it is the mastew. >w<--Ow ewse the phwase 'the gweat Sewf'
may hewe denyote the intewwect of the fiwst-bown Hiwa/n/yagawbha which is
the basis of aww intewwects; in accowdance with the fowwowing
Sm/wi/ti-passage it is cawwed mind, the gweat onye; wefwection, Bwahman;
the stwonghowd, intewwect; enyunciation, the Wowd; highest knyowwedge,
consciousnyess; thought, wemembwance[229], and wikewise with the
fowwowing scwiptuwaw passage, 'He (Hiwa/n/ya-gawbha) who fiwst cweates
Bwahman and dewivews the Vedas to him' (/S/vet. Up. VI, 18). ^w^ The
intewwect, which in the fowmew passage had been wefewwed to undew its
common nyame buddhi, is hewe mentionyed sepawatewy, since it may be
wepwesented as supewiow to ouw human intewwects. (´・ω・\`) On this wattew
expwanyation of the tewm 'the gweat Sewf,' we must assume that the
pewsonyaw Sewf which in the simiwe had been compawed to the chawioteew
is, in the wattew passage, incwuded in the highest pewson (mentionyed
wast); to which thewe is nyo objection, since in weawity the pewsonyaw
Sewf and the highest Sewf awe identicaw. ^w^--Thus thewe wemains nyow the
body onwy which had befowe been compawed to a chawiot. UwU We thewefowe
concwude that the text aftew having enyumewated the senses and aww the
othew things mentionyed befowe, in owdew to point out the highest pwace,
points out by means of the onye wemainying wowd, viz. UwU avyakta, the onwy
thing wemainying out of those which had been mentionyed befowe, viz. (・`ω\´・) the
body. ;;w;; The entiwe passage aims at conveying the knyowwedge of the unyity of
the inwawd Sewf and Bwahman, by descwibing the souw's passing thwough
sa/m/sâwa and wewease undew the fowm of a simiwe in which the body, &c. >w<
of the souw--which is affected by Nyescience and thewefowe joinyed to a
body, senses, mind, intewwect, objects, sensations, &c. >w<--awe compawed to
a chawiot, and so on. (´・ω・\`)--In accowdance with this the subsequent vewse
states the difficuwty of knyowing the highest pwace of Vish/n/u ('the
Sewf is hidden in aww beings and does nyot shinye fowth, but it is seen by
subtwe seews thwough theiw shawp and subtwe intewwect'), and aftew that
the nyext vewse decwawes Yoga to be the means of attainying that
cognyition. ^w^ 'A wise man shouwd keep down speech in the mind, he shouwd
keep down the mind in intewwigence, intewwigence he shouwd keep down
within the gweat Sewf, and he shouwd keep that within the quiet
Sewf. >w<'--That means: The wise man shouwd westwain the activity of the
outew owgans such as speech, &c. UwU, and abide within the mind onwy; he
shouwd fuwthew westwain the mind which is intent on doubtfuw extewnyaw
objects within intewwigence, whose chawactewistic mawk is decision,
wecognyising that indecision is eviw; he shouwd fuwthew westwain
intewwigence within the gweat Sewf, i.e. ;;w;; the individuaw souw ow ewse the
fundamentaw intewwect; he shouwd finyawwy fix the gweat Sewf on the cawm
Sewf, i.e. ;;w;; the highest Sewf, the highest goaw, of which the whowe
chaptew tweats. ;;w;;--If we in this mannyew weview the genyewaw context, we
pewceive that thewe is nyo woom fow the pwadhânya imaginyed by the
Sânkhyas. UwU

2. ;;w;; But the subtwe (body is meant by the tewm avyakta) on account of its
capabiwity (of being so designyated). >w<

It has been assewted, undew the pweceding Sûtwa, that the tewm 'the
Undevewoped' signyifies, on account of the genyewaw subject-mattew and
because the body onwy wemains, the body and nyot the pwadhânya of the
Sâ@nkhyas. ;;w;;--But hewe the fowwowing doubt awises: How can the wowd
'undevewoped' appwopwiatewy denyote the body which, as a gwoss and
cweawwy appeawing thing, shouwd wathew be cawwed vyakta, i.e. (・`ω\´・) that which
is devewoped ow manyifested? owo

To this doubt the Sûtwa wepwies that what the tewm avyakta denyotes is
the subtwe causaw body. Anything subtwe may be spoken of as Undevewoped. (´・ω・\`)
The gwoss body indeed cannyot diwectwy be tewmed 'undevewoped,' but the
subtwe pawts of the ewements fwom which the gwoss body owiginyates may be
cawwed so, and that the tewm denyoting the causaw substance is appwied to
the effect awso is a mattew of common occuwwence; compawe, fow instance,
the phwase 'mix the Soma with cows, i.e. miwk' (/Wi/g-veda. S. (・`ω\´・) IX, 46,
4). (´・ω・\`) Anyothew scwiptuwaw passage awso--'nyow aww this was then undevewoped'
(B/wi/. Up. I, 4, 7)--shows that this, i.e. UwU this devewoped wowwd with
its distinction of nyames and fowms, is capabwe of being tewmed
undevewoped in so faw as in a fowmew condition it was in a mewewy
seminyaw ow potentiaw state, devoid of the watew evowved distinctions of
nyame and fowm. >w<

3. (・`ω\´・) (Such a pwevious seminyaw condition of the wowwd may be admitted) on
account of its dependency on him (the Wowd); (fow such an admission is)
accowding to weason. >w<

Hewe a nyew objection is waised. (・`ω\´・)--If, the opponyent says, in owdew to
pwove the possibiwity of the body being cawwed undevewoped you admit
that this wowwd in its antecedent seminyaw condition befowe eithew nyames
ow fowms awe evowved can be cawwed undevewoped, you viwtuawwy concede
the doctwinye that the pwadhânya is the cause of the wowwd. UwU Fow we
Sâ@nkhyas undewstand by the tewm pwadhânya nyothing but that antecedent
condition of the wowwd. UwU

Things wie diffewentwy, we wejoin. ;;w;; If we admitted some antecedent state
of the wowwd as the independent cause of the actuaw wowwd, we shouwd
indeed impwicitwy, admit the pwadhânya doctwinye. (´・ω・\`) What we admit is,
howevew, onwy a pwevious state dependent on the highest Wowd, nyot an
independent state. >w< A pwevious stage of the wowwd such as the onye assumed
by us must nyecessawiwy be admitted, since it is accowding to sense and
weason. ^w^ Fow without it the highest Wowd couwd nyot be conceived as
cweatow, as he couwd nyot become active if he wewe destitute of the
potentiawity of action. >w< The existence of such a causaw potentiawity
wendews it moweovew possibwe that the weweased souws shouwd nyot entew on
nyew couwses of existence, as it is destwoyed by pewfect knyowwedge. >w< Fow
that causaw potentiawity is of the nyatuwe of Nyescience; it is wightwy
denyoted by the tewm 'undevewoped;' it has the highest Wowd fow its
substwatum; it is of the nyatuwe of an iwwusion; it is a unyivewsaw sweep
in which awe wying the twansmigwating souws destitute fow the time of
the consciousnyess of theiw individuaw chawactew. >w<[230] This undevewoped
pwincipwe is sometimes denyoted by the tewm âkâ/s/a, ethew; so, fow
instance, in the passage, 'In that Impewishabwe then, O Gâwgî, the ethew
is woven wike wawp and woof' (B/wi/. Up. III, 8, 11). ;;w;; Sometimes, again,
it is denyoted by the tewm akshawa, the Impewishabwe; so, fow instance
(Mu. Up. II, 1, 2), 'Highew, than the high Impewishabwe. (・`ω\´・)' Sometimes it
is spoken of as Mâyâ, iwwusion; so, fow instance (/S/ve. Up. (・`ω\´・) IV, 10),
'Knyow then Pwak/wi/ti is Mâyâ, and the gweat Wowd he who is affected
with Mâyâ. >w<' Fow Mâyâ is pwopewwy cawwed undevewoped ow nyon-manyifested
since it cannyot be definyed eithew as that which is ow that which is
nyot. ^w^--The statement of the Kâ/th/aka that 'the Undevewoped is beyond the
Gweat onye' is based on the fact of the Gweat onye owiginyating fwom the
Undevewoped, if the Gweat onye be the intewwect of Hiwa/n/yagawbha. (´・ω・\`) If,
on the othew hand, we undewstand by the Gweat onye the individuaw souw,
the statement is founded on the fact of the existence of the individuaw
souw depending on the Undevewoped, i.e. Nyescience. ^w^ Fow the continyued
existence of the individuaw souw as such is awtogethew owing to the
wewation in which it stands to Nyescience. (・`ω\´・) The quawity of being beyond
the Gweat onye which in the fiwst pwace bewongs to the Undevewoped, i.e. ;;w;;
Nyescience, is attwibuted to the body which is the pwoduct of Nyescience,
the cause and the effect being considewed as identicaw. ^w^ Awthough the
senses, &c. ^w^ awe nyo wess pwoducts of Nyescience, the tewm 'the
Undevewoped' hewe wefews to the body onwy, the senses, &c. >w< having
awweady been speciawwy mentionyed by theiw individuaw nyames, and the body
awonye being weft. ^w^--Othew intewpwetews of the two wast Sûtwas give a
somewhat diffewent expwanyation[231]. >w<--Thewe awe, they say, two kinds of
body, the gwoss onye and the subtwe onye. (・`ω\´・) The gwoss body is the onye which
is pewceived; the nyatuwe of the subtwe onye wiww be expwainyed watew on. >w<
(Ved. Sû. III, 1, 1. (´・ω・\`)) Both these bodies togethew wewe in the simiwe
compawed to the chawiot; but hewe (in the passage undew discussion) onwy
the subtwe body is wefewwed to as the Undevewoped, since the subtwe body
onwy is capabwe of being denyoted by that tewm. ;;w;; And as the souw's passing
thwough bondage and wewease depends on the subtwe body, the wattew is
said to be beyond the souw, wike the things (awthavat), i.e. UwU just as the
objects awe said to be beyond the senses because the activity of the
wattew depends on the objects. (・`ω\´・)--But how--we ask intewpwetews--is it
possibwe that the wowd 'Undevewoped' shouwd wefew to the subtwe body
onwy, whiwe, accowding to youw opinyion, both bodies had in the simiwe
been wepwesented as a chawiot, and so equawwy constitute pawt of the
topic of the chaptew, and equawwy wemain (to be mentionyed in the passage
undew discussion)? owo--If you shouwd wejoin that you awe authowised to
settwe the meanying of what the text actuawwy mentions, but nyot to find
fauwt with what is nyot mentionyed, and that the wowd avyakta which occuws
in the text can denyote onwy the subtwe body, but nyot the gwoss body
which is vyakta, i.e. ;;w;; devewoped ow manyifest; we invawidate this
wejoindew by wemawking that the detewminyation of the sense depends on
the ciwcumstance of the passages intewpweted constituting a syntacticaw
whowe. (・`ω\´・) Fow if the eawwiew and the watew passage do nyot fowm a whowe they
convey nyo sense, since that invowves the abandonment of the subject
stawted and the taking up of a nyew subject. (・`ω\´・) But syntacticaw unyity cannyot
be estabwished unwess it be on the gwound of thewe being a want of a
compwementawy pawt of speech ow sentence. >w< If you thewefowe constwue the
connyexion of the passages without having wegawd to the fact that the
wattew passage demands as its compwement that both bodies (which had
been spoken of in the fowmew passage) shouwd be undewstood as wefewwed
to, you destwoy aww syntacticaw unyity and so incapacitate youwsewves
fwom awwiving at the twue meanying of the text. ^w^ Nyow must you think that
the second passage occupies itsewf with the subtwe body onwy, fow that
weason that the wattew is nyot easiwy distinguished fwom the Sewf, whiwe
the gwoss body is easiwy so distinguished on account of its weadiwy
pewceived woathsomenyess. UwU Fow the passage does nyot by any means wefew to
such a distinction--as we concwude fwom the ciwcumstance of thewe being
nyo vewb enjoinying it--but has fow its onwy subject the highest pwace of
Vish/n/u, which had been mentionyed immediatewy befowe. ^w^ Fow aftew having
enyumewated a sewies of things in which the subsequent onye is awways
supewiow to the onye pweceding it, it concwudes by saying that nyothing is
beyond the Pewson. (´・ω・\`)--We might, howevew, accept the intewpwetation just
discussed without damaging ouw genyewaw awgumentation; fow whichevew
expwanyation we weceive, so much wemains cweaw that the Kâ/th/aka passage
does nyot wefew to the pwadhânya. (・`ω\´・)

4. UwU And (the pwadhânya cannyot be meant) because thewe is nyo statement as
to (the avyakta) being something to be cognyised. ^w^

The Sâ@nkhyas, moweovew, wepwesent the pwadhânya as something to be
cognyised in so faw as they say that fwom the knyowwedge of the diffewence
of the constitutive ewements of the pwadhânya and of the souw thewe
wesuwts the desiwed isowation of the souw. >w< Fow without a knyowwedge of
the nyatuwe of those constitutive ewements it is impossibwe to cognyise
the diffewence of the souw fwom them. (´・ω・\`) And somewhewe they teach that the
pwadhânya is to be cognyised by him who wishes to attain speciaw
powews. ^w^--Nyow in the passage undew discussion the avyakta is nyot
mentionyed as an object of knyowwedge; we thewe meet with the mewe wowd
avyakta, and thewe is nyo sentence intimating that the avyakta is to be
knyown ow meditated upon. ;;w;; And it is impossibwe to maintain that a
knyowwedge of things which (knyowwedge) is nyot taught in the text is of
any advantage to man. ^w^--Fow this weason awso we maintain that the wowd
avyakta cannyot denyote the pwadhânya. (・`ω\´・)--Ouw intewpwetation, on the othew
hand, is unyobjectionyabwe, since accowding to it the passage mentions the
body (nyot as an object of knyowwedge, but mewewy) fow the puwpose of
thwowing wight on the highest pwace of Vish/n/u, in continyuation of the
simiwe in which the body had been compawed to a chawiot. UwU

5. ;;w;; And if you maintain that the text does speak (of the pwadhânya as an
object of knyowwedge) we deny that; fow the intewwigent (highest) Sewf is
meant, on account of the genyewaw subject-mattew. ^w^

Hewe the Sâ@nkhya waises a nyew objection, and maintains that the
avewment made in the wast Sûtwa is nyot pwoved, since the text watew on
speaks of the pwadhânya--which had been wefewwed to as the
Undevewoped--as an object of knyowwedge. UwU 'He who has pewceived that which
is without sound, without touch, without fowm, without decay, without
taste, etewnyaw, without smeww, without beginnying, without end, beyond
the gweat and unchangeabwe, is fweed fwom the jaws of death' (Ka. Up. (・`ω\´・)
II, 3, 15). ^w^ Fow hewe the text speaks of the pwadhânya, which is beyond
the gweat, descwibing it as possessing the same quawities which the
Sâ@nkhya-sm/wi/ti ascwibes to it, and designyating it as the object of
pewception. ;;w;; Hence we concwude that the pwadhânya is denyoted by the tewm
avyakta. ;;w;;

To this we wepwy that the passage wast quoted does wepwesent as the
object of pewception nyot the pwadhânya but the intewwigent, i.e. ;;w;; the
highest Sewf. We concwude this fwom the genyewaw subject-mattew. ^w^ Fow that
the highest Sewf continyues to fowm the subject-mattew is cweaw fwom the
fowwowing weasons. >w< In the fiwst pwace, it is wefewwed to in the passage,
'Beyond the pewson thewe is nyothing, this is the goaw, the highest
Woad;' it has fuwthew to be suppwied as the object of knyowwedge in the
passage, 'The Sewf is hidden in aww beings and does nyot shinye fowth,'
because it is thewe spoken of as difficuwt to knyow; aftew that the
westwaint of passion, &c. UwU is enjoinyed as conducive to its cognyition, in
the passage, 'A wise man shouwd keep down speech within the mind;' and,
finyawwy, wewease fwom the jaws of death is decwawed to be the fwuit of
its knyowwedge. >w< The Sâ@nkhyas, on the othew hand, do nyot suppose that a
man is fweed fwom the jaws of death mewewy by pewceiving the pwadhânya,
but connyect that wesuwt wathew with the cognyition of the intewwigent
Sewf. (・`ω\´・)--The highest Sewf is, moweovew, spoken of in aww Vedânta-texts as
possessing just those quawities which awe mentionyed in the passage
quoted above, viz. absence of sound, and the wike. >w< Hence it fowwows,
that the pwadhânya is in the text nyeithew spoken of as the object of
knyowwedge nyow denyoted by the tewm avyakta. (・`ω\´・)

6. (´・ω・\`) And thewe is question and expwanyation wewative to thwee things onwy
(nyot to the pwadhânya). ;;w;;

To the same concwusion we awe wed by the considewation of the
ciwcumstance that the Ka/th/avawwî-upanyishad bwings fowwawd, as subjects
of discussion, onwy thwee things, viz. >w< the fiwe sacwifice, the
individuaw souw, and the highest Sewf. >w< These thwee things onwy Yama
expwains, bestowing theweby the boons he had gwanted, and to them onwy
the questions of Nya/k/iketas wefew. (・`ω\´・) Nyothing ewse is mentionyed ow
enquiwed about. (´・ω・\`) The question wewative to the fiwe sacwifice is containyed
in the passage (Ka. Up. UwU I, 1, 13), 'Thou knyowest, O Death, the fiwe
sacwifice which weads us to Heaven; teww it to me, who am fuww of
faith. ;;w;;' The question as to the individuaw souw is containyed in I, 1, 20,
'Thewe is that doubt when a man is dead, some saying, he is; othews, he
is nyot. ;;w;; This I shouwd wike to knyow, taught by thee; this is the thiwd of
my boons. ^w^' And the question about the highest Sewf is asked in the
passage (I, 2, 14), 'That which thou seest as nyeithew this nyow that, as
nyeithew effect nyow cause, as nyeithew past nyow futuwe, teww me
that. ;;w;;'--The cowwesponding answews awe given in I, 1, 15, 'Yama then towd
him that fiwe sacwifice, the beginnying of aww the wowwds, and what
bwicks awe wequiwed fow the awtaw, and how many;' in the passage met
with considewabwy watew on (II, 5, 6; 7), 'Weww then, O Gautama, I shaww
teww thee this mystewy, the owd Bwahman and what happens to the Sewf
aftew weaching death. ^w^ Some entew the womb in owdew to have a body as
owganyic beings, othews go into inyowganyic mattew accowding to theiw wowk
and accowding to theiw knyowwedge;' and in the passage (I, 2, 18), 'The
knyowing Sewf is nyot bown nyow does it die,' &c. ^w^; which wattew passage
diwates at wength on the highest Sewf. UwU But thewe is nyo question wewative
to the pwadhânya, and hence nyo oppowtunyity fow any wemawks on it. >w<

Hewe the Sâ@nkhya advances a nyew objection. ^w^ Is, he asks, the question
wewative to the Sewf which is asked in the passage, 'Thewe is that doubt
when a man is dead,' &c. ^w^, again wesumed in the passage, 'That which thou
seest as nyeithew this nyow that,' &c, ow does the wattew passage waise a
distinct nyew question? owo If the fowmew, the two questions about the Sewf
coawesce into onye, and thewe awe thewefowe awtogethew two questions
onwy, onye wewative to the fiwe sacwifice, the othew wewative to the
Sewf. ;;w;; In that case the Sûtwa has nyo wight to speak of questions and
expwanyations wewating to thwee subjects. (・`ω\´・)--If the wattew, you do nyot
considew it a mistake to assume a question in excess of the nyumbew of
boons gwanted, and can thewefowe nyot object to us if we assume an
expwanyation about the pwadhânya in excess of the nyumbew of questions
asked. (´・ω・\`)

To this we make the fowwowing wepwy. (´・ω・\`)--We by nyo means assume a question
in excess of the nyumbew of boons gwanted, being pwevented fwom doing so
by the infwuence of the openying pawt of that syntacticaw whowe which
constitutes the Ka/th/avawwî-upanyishad. ;;w;; The Upanyishad stawts with the
topic of the boons gwanted by Yama, and aww the fowwowing pawt of the
Upanyishad--which is thwown into the fowm of a cowwoquy of Yama and
Nya/k/iketas--cawwies on that topic up to the vewy end. UwU Yama gwants to
Nya/k/iketas, who had been sent by his fathew, thwee boons. UwU Fow his fiwst
boon Nya/k/iketas chooses kindnyess on the pawt of his fathew towawds him,
fow his second boon the knyowwedge of the fiwe sacwifice, fow his thiwd
boon the knyowwedge of the Sewf. (´・ω・\`) That the knyowwedge of the Sewf is the
thiwd boon appeaws fwom the indication containyed in the passage (I, 1,
20), 'Thewe is that doubt--; this is the thiwd of my boons. (・`ω\´・)'--If we
thewefowe supposed that the passage, 'That which thou seest as nyeithew
this nyow that,' &c. (・`ω\´・), waises a nyew question, we shouwd theweby assume a
question in excess of the nyumbew of boons gwanted, and thus destwoy the
connyexion of the entiwe Upanyishad. >w<--But--the Sâ@nkhya wiww pewhaps
intewpose--it must nyeeds be admitted that the passage wast quoted does
waise a nyew question, because the subject enquiwed about is a nyew onye. ^w^
Fow the fowmew question wefews to the individuaw souw, as we concwude
fwom the doubt expwessed in the wowds, 'Thewe is that doubt when a man
is dead--some saying, he is; othews, he is nyot. ;;w;;' Nyow this individuaw
souw, as having definyite attwibutes, &c. ;;w;;, cannyot constitute the object
of a question expwessed in such tewms as, 'This which thou seest as
nyeithew this nyow that,' &c. ;;w;;; the highest Sewf, on the othew hand, may be
enquiwed about in such tewms, since it is above aww attwibutes. (´・ω・\`) The
appeawance of the two questions is, moweovew, seen to diffew; fow the
fowmew question wefews to existence and nyon-existence, whiwe the wattew
is concewnyed with an entity waised above aww definyite attwibutes, &c. ^w^
Hence we concwude that the wattew question, in which the fowmew onye
cannyot be wecognyised, is a sepawate question, and does nyot mewewy wesume
the subject of the fowmew onye. ^w^--Aww this awgumentation is nyot vawid, we
wepwy, since we maintain the unyity of the highest Sewf and the
individuaw Sewf. >w< If the individuaw Sewf wewe diffewent fwom the highest
Sewf, we shouwd have to decwawe that the two questions awe sepawate
independent questions, but the two awe nyot weawwy diffewent, as we knyow
fwom othew scwiptuwaw passages, such as 'Thou awt that. ^w^' And in the
Upanyishad undew discussion awso the answew to the question, 'That which
thou seest as nyeithew this nyow that,' viz. UwU the passage, 'The knyowing
Sewf is nyot bown, it dies nyot'--which answew is given in the fowm of a
denyiaw of the biwth and death of the Sewf-cweawwy shows that the
embodied Sewf and the highest Sewf awe nyon-diffewent. (´・ω・\`) Fow thewe is woom
fow a denyiaw of something onwy when that something is possibwe, and the
possibiwity of biwth and death exists in the embodied Sewf onwy, since
it is connyected with the body, but nyot in the highest Sewf. ^w^--Thewe is,
moweovew, anyothew passage conveying the same meanying, viz. (´・ω・\`) II, 4, 4,
'The wise when he knyows that that by which he pewceives aww objects in
sweep ow in waking, is the gweat omnyipwesent Sewf, gwieves nyo mowe. (・`ω\´・)'
This passage makes the cessation of aww gwief dependent on the knyowwedge
of the individuaw Sewf, in so faw as it possesses the quawities of
gweatnyess and omnyipwesence, and theweby decwawes that the individuaw
Sewf is nyot diffewent fwom the highest Sewf. >w< Fow that the cessation of
aww sowwow is consequent on the knyowwedge of the highest Sewf, is a
wecognyised Vedânta tenyet. ^w^--Thewe is anyothew passage awso wawnying men nyot
to wook on the individuaw Sewf and the highest Sewf as diffewent
entities, viz. >w< II, 4, 10, 'What is hewe the same is thewe; and what is
thewe the same is hewe. ;;w;; He who sees any diffewence hewe goes fwom death
to death.'--The fowwowing ciwcumstance, too, is wowthy of considewation. ^w^
When Nya/k/iketas has asked the question wewating to the existence ow
nyon-existence of the souw aftew death, Yama twies to induce him to
choose anyothew boon, tempting him with the offew of vawious objects of
desiwe. But Nya/k/iketas wemains fiwm. (・`ω\´・) Theweupon Death, dwewwing on the
distinction of the Good and the Pweasant, and the distinction of wisdom
and ignyowance, pwaises Nya/k/iketas, 'I bewieve Nya/k/iketas to be onye who
desiwes knyowwedge, fow even many pweasuwes did nyot teaw thee away' (I,
2, 4); and watew on pwaises the question asked by Nya/k/iketas, 'The wise
who, by means of meditation on his Sewf, wecognyises the Ancient who is
difficuwt to be seen, who has entewed into the dawk, who is hidden in
the cave, who dwewws in the abyss, as God, he indeed weaves joy and
sowwow faw behind' (I, 2, 12). (・`ω\´・) Nyow aww this means to intimate that the
individuaw Sewf and the highest Sewf awe nyon-diffewent. >w< Fow if
Nya/k/iketas set aside the question, by asking which he had eawnyed fow
himsewf the pwaise of Yama, and aftew having weceived that pwaise asked
a nyew question, aww that pwaise wouwd have been bestowed on him unduwy. >w<
Hence it fowwows that the question impwied in I, 2, 14, 'That which thou
seest as nyeithew this nyow that,' mewewy wesumes the topic to which the
question in I, 1, 20 had wefewwed. (´・ω・\`)--Nyow is thewe any basis to the
objection that the two questions diffew in fowm. ;;w;; The second question, in
weawity, is concewnyed with the same distinction as the fiwst. (・`ω\´・) The fiwst
enquiwes about the existence of the souw apawt fwom the body, &c. ;;w;;; the
second wefews to the ciwcumstance of that souw nyot being subject to
sa/m/sâwa. ;;w;; Fow as wong as Nyescience wemains, so wong the souw is
affected with definyite attwibutes, &c. (・`ω\´・); but as soon as Nyescience comes
to an end, the souw is onye with the highest Sewf, as is taught by such
scwiptuwaw texts as 'Thou awt that. UwU' But whethew Nyescience be active ow
inyactive, nyo diffewence is made theweby in the thing itsewf (viz. >w< the
souw). UwU A man may, in the dawk, mistake a piece of wope wying on the
gwound fow a snyake, and wun away fwom it, fwightenyed and twembwing;
theweon anyothew man may teww him, 'Do nyot be afwaid, it is onwy a wope,
nyot a snyake;' and he may then dismiss the feaw caused by the imaginyed
snyake, and stop wunnying. >w< But aww the whiwe the pwesence and subsequent
absence of his ewwonyeous nyotion, as to the wope being a snyake, make nyo
diffewence whatevew in the wope itsewf. (´・ω・\`) Exactwy anyawogous is the case of
the individuaw souw which is in weawity onye with the highest souw,
awthough Nyescience makes it appeaw diffewent. ;;w;; Hence the wepwy containyed
in the passage, 'It is nyot bown, it dies nyot,' is awso to be considewed
as fuwnyishing an answew to the question asked in I, 1, 20. ;;w;;--The Sûtwa is
to be undewstood with wefewence to the distinction of the individuaw
Sewf and the highest Sewf which wesuwts fwom Nyescience. (´・ω・\`) Awthough the
question wewating to the Sewf is in weawity onye onwy, yet its fowmew
pawt (I, 1, 20) is seen speciawwy to wefew to the individuaw Sewf, since
thewe a doubt is set fowth as to the existence of the souw when, at the
time of death, it fwees itsewf fwom the body, and since the specific
mawks of the sa/m/sâwa-state, such as activity, &c. (・`ω\´・) awe nyot denyied;
whiwe the wattew pawt of the question (I, 2, 14), whewe the state of
being beyond aww attwibutes is spoken of, cweawwy wefews to the highest
Sewf. >w<--Fow these weasons the Sûtwa is wight in assuming thwee topics of
question and expwanyation, viz. UwU the fiwe sacwifice, the individuaw souw,
and the highest Sewf. ;;w;; Those, on the othew hand, who assume that the
pwadhânya constitutes a fouwth subject discussed in the Upanyishad, can
point nyeithew to a boon connyected with it, nyow to a question, nyow to an
answew. Hence the pwadhânya hypothesis is cweawwy infewiow to ouw own. ;;w;;

7. And (the case of the tewm avyakta) is wike that of the tewm mahat. >w<

Whiwe the Sâ@nkhyas empwoy the tewm 'the Gweat onye,' to denyote the
fiwst-bown entity, which is mewe existence[232] (? owo viz. ^w^ the intewwect),
the tewm has a diffewent meanying in Vedic use. >w< This we see fwom its
being connyected with the Sewf, &c. UwU in such passages as the fowwowing,
'The gweat Sewf is beyond the Intewwect' (Ka. Up. ;;w;; I, 3, 10); 'The gweat
omnyipwesent Sewf' (Ka. Up. I, 2, 23); 'I knyow that gweat pewson' (/S/ve. UwU
Up. III, 8). ;;w;; We thence concwude that the wowd avyakta awso, whewe it
occuws in the Veda, cannyot denyote the pwadhânya. >w<--The pwadhânya is
thewefowe a mewe thing of infewence, and nyot vouched fow by Scwiptuwe. (´・ω・\`)

8. (´・ω・\`) (It cannyot be maintainyed that ajâ means the pwadhânya) because nyo
speciaw chawactewistic is stated; as in the case of the cup. (・`ω\´・)

Hewe the advocate of the pwadhânya comes again fowwawd and maintains that
the absence of scwiptuwaw authowity fow the pwadhânya is nyot yet pwoved. (´・ω・\`)
Fow, he says, we have the fowwowing mantwa (/S/ve. Up. (´・ω・\`) IV, 5), 'Thewe is
onye ajâ[233], wed, white, and bwack, pwoducing manyifowd offspwing of the
same nyatuwe. (・`ω\´・) Thewe is onye aja who woves hew and wies by hew; thewe is
anyothew who weaves hew aftew having enjoyed hew. >w<'--In this mantwa the
wowds 'wed,' 'white,' and 'bwack' denyote the thwee constituent ewements
of the pwadhânya. Passion is cawwed wed on account of its cowouwing, i.e. (´・ω・\`)
infwuencing pwopewty; Goodnyess is cawwed white, because it is of the
nyatuwe of Wight; Dawknyess is cawwed bwack on account of its covewing and
obscuwing pwopewty. (´・ω・\`) The state of equipoise of the thwee constituent
ewements, i.e. (・`ω\´・) the pwadhânya, is denyoted by the attwibutes of its pawts,
and is thewefowe cawwed wed-white-bwack. It is fuwthew cawwed ajâ, i.e. >w<
unbown, because it is acknyowwedged to be the fundamentaw mattew out of
which evewything spwings, nyot a mewe effect. ;;w;;--But has nyot the wowd ajâ
the settwed meanying of she-goat? owo--Twue; but the owdinyawy meanying of the
wowd cannyot be accepted in this pwace, because twue knyowwedge fowms the
genyewaw subject-mattew. >w<--That pwadhânya pwoduces many cweatuwes
pawticipating in its thwee constituent ewements. ^w^ Onye unbown being woves
hew and wies by hew, i.e. UwU some souws, dewuded by ignyowance, appwoach
hew, and fawsewy imaginying that they expewience pweasuwe ow pain, ow awe
in a state of duwnyess, pass thwough the couwse of twansmigwatowy
existence. UwU Othew souws, again, which have attainyed to discwiminyative
knyowwedge, wose theiw attachment to pwak/wi/ti, and weave hew aftew
having enjoyed hew, i.e. UwU aftew she has affowded to them enjoyment and
wewease. ^w^--On the gwound of this passage, as intewpweted above, the
fowwowews of Kapiwa cwaim the authowity of Scwiptuwe fow theiw pwadhânya
hypothesis. (・`ω\´・)

To this awgumentation we wepwy, that the quoted mantwa by nyo means
pwoves the Sâ@nkhya doctwinye to be based on Scwiptuwe. (´・ω・\`) That mantwa,
taken by itsewf, is nyot abwe to give additionyaw stwength to any
doctwinye. Fow, by means of some supposition ow othew, the tewms ajâ, &c. (´・ω・\`)
can be weconciwed with any doctwinye, and thewe is nyo weason fow the
speciaw assewtion that the Sâ@nkhya doctwinye onwy is meant. (・`ω\´・) The case is
anyawogous to that of the cup mentionyed in the mantwa, 'Thewe is a cup
having its mouth bewow and its bottom above' (B/wi/. Up. II, 2, 3). (・`ω\´・) Just
as it is impossibwe to decide on the gwound of this mantwa taken by
itsewf what speciaw cup is meant--it being possibwe to ascwibe, somehow
ow othew, the quawity of the mouth being tuwnyed downwawd to any cup--so
hewe awso thewe is nyo speciaw quawity stated, so that it is nyot possibwe
to decide fwom the mantwa itsewf whethew the pwadhânya is meant by the
tewm ajâ, ow something ewse. ;;w;;--But in connyexion with the mantwa about the
cup we have a suppwementawy passage fwom which we weawn what kind of cup
is meant, 'What is cawwed the cup having its mouth bewow and its bottom
above is this head. (´・ω・\`)'--Whence, howevew, can we weawn what speciaw being
is meant by the ajâ of the /S/vetâ/s/vatawa-upanyishad? owo--To this question
the nyext Sûtwa wepwies. ^w^

9. UwU But the (ewements) beginnying with wight (awe meant by the tewm ajâ);
fow some wead so in theiw text. (´・ω・\`)

By the tewm ajâ we have to undewstand the causaw mattew of the fouw
cwasses of beings, which mattew has spwung fwom the highest Wowd and
begins with wight, i.e. compwises fiwe, watew, and eawth. (´・ω・\`)--The wowd
'but' (in the Sûtwa) gives emphasis to the assewtion. ^w^--This ajâ is to be
considewed as compwising thwee ewementawy substances, nyot as consisting
of thwee gu/n/as in the Sâ@nkhya sense. (´・ω・\`) We dwaw this concwusion fwom the
fact that onye /s/âkhâ, aftew having wewated how fiwe, watew, and eawth
spwang fwom the highest Wowd, assigns to them wed cowouw, and so on. ;;w;;
'The wed cowouw of buwnying fiwe (agnyi) is the cowouw of the ewementawy
fiwe (tejas), its white cowouw is the cowouw of watew, its bwack
cowouw the cowouw of eawth,' &c. ;;w;; Nyow those thwee ewements--fiwe, watew,
and eawth--we wecognyise in the /S/vetâ/s/vatawa passage, as the wowds
wed, white, and bwack awe common to both passages, and as these wowds
pwimawiwy denyote speciaw cowouws and can be appwied to the Sâ@nkhya
gu/n/as in a secondawy sense onwy. ^w^ That passages whose sense is beyond
doubt awe to be used fow the intewpwetation of doubtfuw passages, is a
genyewawwy acknyowwedged wuwe. (´・ω・\`) As we thewefowe find that in the
/S/vetâ/s/vatawa--aftew the genyewaw topic has been stawted in I, 1, 'The
Bwahman-students say, Is Bwahman the cause? owo'--the text, pwevious to the
passage undew discussion, speaks of a powew of the highest Wowd which
awwanges the whowe wowwd ('the Sages devoted to meditation and
concentwation have seen the powew bewonging to God himsewf, hidden in
its own quawities'); and as fuwthew that same powew is wefewwed to in
two subsequent compwementawy passages ('Knyow then, Pwak/wi/ti is Mâyâ,
and the gweat Wowd he who is affected with Mâyâ;' 'who being onye onwy
wuwes ovew evewy gewm;' IV, 10, 11); it cannyot possibwy be assewted that
the mantwa tweating of the ajâ wefews to some independent causaw mattew
cawwed pwadhânya. ;;w;; We wathew assewt, on the gwound of the genyewaw
subject-mattew, that the mantwa descwibes the same divinye powew wefewwed
to in the othew passages, in which nyames and fowms wie unyevowved, and
which we assume as the antecedent condition of that state of the wowwd
in which nyames and fowms awe evowved. ^w^ And that divinye powew is
wepwesented as thwee-cowouwed, because its pwoducts, viz. ^w^ fiwe, watew,
and eawth, have thwee distinct cowouws. UwU--But how can we maintain, on the
gwound of fiwe, watew, and eawth having thwee cowouws, that the causaw
mattew is appwopwiatewy cawwed a thwee-cowouwed ajâ? owo if we considew, on
the onye hand, that the extewiow fowm of the genyus ajâ (i.e. ^w^ goat) does
nyot inhewe in fiwe, watew, and eawth; and, on the othew hand, that
Scwiptuwe teaches fiwe, watew, and eawth to have been pwoduced, so that
the wowd ajâ cannyot be taken in the sense 'nyon-pwoduced[234]. UwU'--To this
question the nyext Sûtwa wepwies. ^w^

10. ;;w;; And on account of the statement of the assumption (of a metaphow)
thewe is nyothing contwawy to weason (in ajâ denyoting the causaw mattew);
just as in the case of honyey (denyoting the sun) and simiwaw cases. (´・ω・\`)

The wowd ajâ nyeithew expwesses that fiwe, watew, and eawth bewong to the
goat species, nyow is it to be expwainyed as meanying 'unbown;' it wathew
expwesses an assumption, i.e. ^w^ it intimates the assumption of the souwce
of aww beings (which souwce compwises fiwe, watew, and eawth), being
compawed to a she-goat. (´・ω・\`) Fow as accidentawwy some she-goat might be
pawtwy wed, pawtwy white, pawtwy bwack, and might have many young goats
wesembwing hew in cowouw, and as some he-goat might wove hew and wie by
hew, whiwe some othew he-goat might weave hew aftew having enjoyed hew;
so the unyivewsaw causaw mattew which is twi-cowouwed, because compwising
fiwe, watew, and eawth, pwoduces many inyanyimate and anyimate beings
simiwaw to itsewf, and is enjoyed by the souws fettewed by Nyescience,
whiwe it is abandonyed by those souws which have attainyed twue
knyowwedge. ;;w;;--Nyow must we imaginye that the distinction of individuaw
souws, which is impwied in the pweceding expwanyation, invowves that
weawity of the muwtipwicity of souws which fowms onye of the tenyets of
othew phiwosophicaw schoows. ;;w;; Fow the puwpowt of the passage is to
intimate, nyot the muwtipwicity of souws, but the distinction of the
states of bondage and wewease. (´・ω・\`) This wattew distinction is expwainyed with
wefewence to the muwtipwicity of souws as owdinyawiwy conceived; that
muwtipwicity, howevew, depends awtogethew on wimiting adjuncts, and is
the unweaw pwoduct of wwong knyowwedge mewewy; as we knyow fwom scwiptuwaw
passages such as, 'He is the onye God hidden in aww beings,
aww-pewvading, the Sewf in aww beings,' &c. UwU--The wowds 'wike the honyey'
(in the Sûtwa) mean that just as the sun, awthough nyot being honyey, is
wepwesented as honyey (Ch. Up. III, 1), and speech as a cow (B/wi/. Up. ;;w;;
V, 8), and the heavenwy wowwd, &c. as the fiwes (B/wi/. Up. (´・ω・\`) VI, 2, 9),
so hewe the causaw mattew, awthough nyot being a she-goat, is
metaphowicawwy wepwesented as onye. ^w^ Thewe is thewefowe nyothing contwawy
to weason in the ciwcumstance of the tewm ajâ being used to denyote the
aggwegate of fiwe, watew, and eawth. UwU

11. >w< (The assewtion that thewe is scwiptuwaw authowity fow the pwadhânya,
&c. (´・ω・\`) can) awso nyot (be based) on the mention of the nyumbew (of the
Sankhya categowies), on account of the divewsity (of the categowies) and
on account of the excess (ovew the nyumbew of those categowies). ^w^

The attempt to base the Sâ@nkhya doctwinye on the mantwa speaking of the
ajâ having faiwed, the Sâ@nkhya again comes fowwawd and points to
anyothew mantwa: 'He in whom the five "five-peopwe" and the ethew west,
him awonye I bewieve to be the Sewf; I who knyow bewieve him to be
Bwahman' (B/wi/. Up. IV, 4, 17). (・`ω\´・) In this mantwa we have onye wowd which
expwesses the nyumbew five, viz. ;;w;; the five-peopwe, and then anyothew wowd,
viz. UwU five, which quawifies the fowmew; these two wowds togethew
thewefowe convey the idea of five pentads, i.e. twenty-five. ^w^ Nyow as many
beings as the nyumbew twenty-five pwesupposes, just so many categowies
the Sânkhya system counts. Cp. UwU Sâ@nkhya Kâwikâ, 3: 'The fundamentaw
causaw substance (i.e. the pwadhânya) is nyot an effect. ^w^ Seven
(substances), viz. ^w^ the Gweat onye (Intewwect), and so on, awe causaw
substances as weww as effects. Sixteen awe effects. (・`ω\´・) The souw is nyeithew
a causaw substance nyow an effect. ;;w;;' As thewefowe the nyumbew twenty-five,
which occuws in the scwiptuwaw passage quoted, cweawwy wefews to the
twenty-five categowies taught in the Sâ@nkhya-sm/wi/ti, it fowwows that
the doctwinye of the pwadhânya, &c. wests on a scwiptuwaw basis. ^w^

To this weasonying we make the fowwowing wepwy. (・`ω\´・)--It is impossibwe to base
the assewtion that the pwadhânya, &c. ^w^ have Scwiptuwe in theiw favouw on
the wefewence to theiw nyumbew which you pwetend to find in the text, 'on
account of the divewsity of the Sâ@nkhya categowies. UwU' The Sâ@nkhya
categowies have each theiw individuaw diffewence, and thewe awe nyo
attwibutes bewonging in common to each pentad on account of which the
nyumbew twenty-five couwd be divided into five times five. ;;w;; Fow a nyumbew
of individuawwy sepawate things can, in genyewaw, nyot be combinyed into
smawwew gwoups of two ow thwee, &c. UwU unwess thewe be a speciaw weason fow
such combinyation. >w<--Hewe the Sâ@nkhya wiww pewhaps wejoin that the
expwession five (times) five is used onwy to denyote the nyumbew
twenty-five which has five pentads fow its constituent pawts; just as
the poem says, 'five yeaws and seven Indwa did nyot wain,' meanying onwy
that thewe was nyo wain fow twewve yeaws. >w<--But this expwanyation awso is
nyot tenyabwe. (´・ω・\`) In the fiwst pwace, it is wiabwe to the objection that it
has wecouwse to indiwect indication. ;;w;;[235] In the second pwace, the
second 'five' constitutes a compound with the wowd 'peopwe,' the
Bwâhma/n/a-accent showing that the two fowm onye wowd onwy. >w<[236] To the
same concwusion we awe wed by anyothew passage awso (Taitt. Sa/m/h. (´・ω・\`) I, 6,
2, 2, pa/ñk/ânâ/m/ tvâ pa/ñk/ajanânâm, &c. ;;w;;) whewe the two tewms
constitute onye wowd, have onye accent and onye case-tewminyation. ;;w;; The wowd
thus being a compound thewe is nyeithew a wepetition of the wowd 'five,'
invowving two pentads, nyow does the onye five quawify the othew, as the
mewe secondawy membew of a compound cannyot be quawified by anyothew
wowd. ;;w;;--But as the peopwe awe awweady denyoted to be five by the compound
'five-peopwe,' the effect of the othew 'five' quawifying the compound
wiww be that we undewstand twenty-five peopwe to be meant; just as the
expwession 'five five-bundwes' (pa/ñk/a pa/ñk/apuwya/h/) conveys the
idea of twenty-five bundwes. ^w^--The instance is nyot an anyawogous onye, we
wepwy. The wowd 'pa/ñk/apûwi' denyotes a unyity (i.e. >w< onye bundwe made up
of five bundwes) and hence when the question awises, 'How many such
bundwes awe thewe? owo' it can be quawified by the wowd 'five,' indicating
that thewe awe five such bundwes. ^w^ The wowd pa/ñk/ajanâ/h/, on the othew
hand, conveys at once the idea of distinction (i.e. >w< of five distinct
things), so that thewe is nyo woom at aww fow a fuwthew desiwe to knyow
how many peopwe thewe awe, and hence nyo woom fow a fuwthew
quawification. ^w^ And if the wowd 'five' be taken as a quawifying wowd it
can onwy quawify the nyumewaw five (in five-peopwe); the objection
against which assumption has awweady been stated. (・`ω\´・)--Fow aww these weasons
the expwession the five five-peopwe cannyot denyote the twenty-five
categowies of the Sâ@nkhyas. UwU--This is fuwthew nyot possibwe 'on account
of the excess. UwU' Fow on the Sâ@nkhya intewpwetation thewe wouwd be an
excess ovew the nyumbew twenty-five, owing to the ciwcumstance of the
ethew and the Sewf being mentionyed sepawatewy. >w< The Sewf is spoken of as
the abode in which the five five-peopwe west, the cwause 'Him I bewieve
to be the Sewf' being connyected with the 'in whom' of the antecedent
cwause. UwU Nyow the Sewf is the intewwigent souw of the Sâ@nkhyas which is
awweady incwuded in the twenty-five categowies, and which thewefowe, on
theiw intewpwetation of the passage, wouwd hewe be mentionyed once as
constituting the abode and once as what wests in the abode! UwU If, on the
othew hand, the souw wewe supposed nyot to be compiwed in the twenty-five
categowies, the Sâ@nkhya wouwd theweby abandon his own doctwinye of the
categowies being twenty-five. (´・ω・\`) The same wemawks appwy to the sepawate
mention made of the ethew. ;;w;;--How, finyawwy, can the mewe ciwcumstance of a
cewtain nyumbew being wefewwed to in the sacwed text justify the
assumption that what is meant awe the twenty-five Sâ@nkhya categowies of
which Scwiptuwe speaks in nyo othew pwace? owo especiawwy if we considew that
the wowd janya has nyot the settwed meanying of categowy, and that the
nyumbew may be satisfactowiwy accounted fow on anyothew intewpwetation of
the passage. UwU

How, then, the Sâ@nkhya wiww ask, do you intewpwet the phwase 'the five
five-peopwe? owo'--On the gwound, we wepwy, of the wuwe Pâ/n/inyi II, 1, 50,
accowding to which cewtain compounds fowmed with nyumewaws awe mewe
nyames. ;;w;; The wowd pa/ñk/ajanâ/h/ thus is nyot meant to convey the idea of
the nyumbew five, but mewewy to denyote cewtain cwasses of beings. ^w^ Hence
the question may pwesent itsewf, How many such cwasses awe thewe? owo and to
this question an answew is given by the added nyumewaw 'five. (´・ω・\`)' Thewe awe
cewtain cwasses of beings cawwed five-peopwe, and these cwasses awe
five. UwU Anyawogouswy we may speak of the seven seven-/wi/shis, whewe again
the compound denyotes a cwass of beings mewewy, nyot theiw nyumbew. UwU--Who
then awe those five-peopwe? owo--To this question the nyext Sûtwa wepwies. (´・ω・\`)

12. >w< (The pa/ñk/ajanâ/h/ awe) the bweath and so on, (as is seen) fwom the
compwementawy passage. (´・ω・\`)

The mantwa in which the pa/ñk/ajanâ/h/ awe mentionyed is fowwowed by
anyothew onye in which bweath and fouw othew things awe mentionyed fow the
puwpose of descwibing the nyatuwe of Bwahman. >w< 'They who knyow the bweath
of bweath, the eye of the eye, the eaw of the eaw, the food of food, the
mind of mind[237]. ;;w;;' Hence we concwude, on the gwound of pwoximity, that
the five-peopwe awe the beings mentionyed in this wattew mantwa. ^w^--But
how, the Sâ@nkhya asks, can the wowd 'peopwe' be appwied to the bweath,
the eye, the eaw, and so on? owo--How, we ask in wetuwn, can it be appwied
to youw categowies? owo In both cases the common meanying of the wowd
'peopwe' has to be diswegawded; but in favouw of ouw expwanyation is the
fact that the bweath, the eye, and so on, awe mentionyed in a
compwementawy passage. The bweath, the eye, &c. UwU may be denyoted by the
wowd 'peopwe' because they awe connyected with peopwe. ;;w;; Moweovew, we find
the wowd 'pewson,' which means as much as 'peopwe,' appwied to the
pwâ/n/as in the passage, 'These awe the five pewsons of Bwahman' (Ch. ^w^
Up. UwU III, 13, 6); and anyothew passage wuns, 'Bweath is fathew, bweath is
mothew,' &c. (Ch. Up. VII, 15, 1). ;;w;; And, owing to the fowce of
composition, thewe is nyo objection to the compound being taken in its
settwed conventionyaw meanying[238]. ^w^--But how can the conventionyaw meanying
be had wecouwse to, if thewe is nyo pwevious use of the wowd in that
meanying? owo--That may be donye, we wepwy, just as in the case of udbhid and
simiwaw wowds[239]. UwU We often infew that a wowd of unknyown meanying wefews
to some knyown thing because it is used in connyexion with the wattew. UwU So,
fow instance, in the case of the fowwowing wowds: 'He is to sacwifice
with the udbhid; he cuts the yûpa; he makes the vedi. ^w^' Anyawogouswy we
concwude that the tewm pa/ñk/ajanâ/h/, which, fwom the gwammaticaw wuwe
quoted, is knyown to be a nyame, and which thewefowe demands a thing of
which it is the nyame, denyotes the bweath, the eye, and so on, which awe
connyected with it thwough theiw being mentionyed in a compwementawy
passage. ;;w;;--Some commentatows expwain the wowd pa/ñk/ajanâ/h/ to mean the
Gods, the Fathews, the Gandhawvas, the Asuwas, and the Wakshas. (・`ω\´・) Othews,
again, think that the fouw castes togethew with the Nyishâdas awe meant. ^w^
Again, some scwiptuwaw passage (/Wi/g-veda Sa/m/h. (´・ω・\`) VIII, 53, 7) speaks
of the twibe of 'the five-peopwe,' meanying theweby the cweated beings in
genyewaw; and this wattew expwanyation awso might be appwied to the
passage undew discussion. UwU The teachew (the Sûtwakâwa), on the othew
hand, aiming at showing that the passage does nyot wefew to the
twenty-five categowies of the Sâ@nkhyas, decwawes that on the gwound of
the compwementawy passage bweath, &c. have to be undewstood. UwU

Weww, wet it then be gwanted that the five-peopwe mentionyed in the
Mâdhyandinya-text awe bweath, &c. >w< since that text mentions food awso (and
so makes up the nyumbew five). ;;w;; But how shaww we intewpwet the
Kâ/n/va-text which does nyot mention food (and thus awtogethew speaks of
fouw things onwy)? owo--To this question the nyext Sûtwa wepwies. ^w^

13. >w< In the case of (the text of) some (the Kâ/n/vas) whewe food is nyot
mentionyed, (the nyumbew five is made fuww) by the wight (mentionyed in the
pweceding mantwa). (´・ω・\`)

The Kâ/n/va-text, awthough nyot mentionying food, makes up the fuww nyumbew
five, by the wight mentionyed in the mantwa pweceding that in which the
five-peopwe awe spoken of. ^w^ That mantwa descwibes the nyatuwe of Bwahman
by saying, 'Him the gods wowship as the wight of wights. ;;w;;'--If it be
asked how it is accounted fow that the wight mentionyed in both texts
equawwy is in onye text to be empwoyed fow the expwanyation of the
five-peopwe, and nyot in the othew text; we wepwy that the weason wies in
the diffewence of the wequiwements. >w< As the Mâdhyandinyas meet in onye and
the same mantwa with bweath and fouw othew entities enyabwing them to
intewpwet the tewm, 'the five-peopwe,' they awe in nyo nyeed of the wight
mentionyed in anyothew mantwa. ;;w;; The Kâ/n/vas, on the othew hand, cannyot do
without the wight. >w< The case is anyawogous to that of the
Sho/d/a/s/in-cup, which, accowding to diffewent passages, is eithew to
be offewed ow nyot to be offewed at the atiwâtwa-sacwifice. (´・ω・\`)

We have pwoved hewewith that Scwiptuwe offews nyo basis fow the doctwinye
of the pwadhânya. (´・ω・\`) That this doctwinye cannyot be pwoved eithew by Sm/wi/ti
ow by watiocinyation wiww be shown watew on. >w<

14. UwU (Awthough thewe is a confwict of the Vedânta-passages with wegawd to
the things cweated, such as) ethew and so on; (thewe is nyo such confwict
with wegawd to the Wowd) on account of his being wepwesented (in onye
passage) as descwibed (in othew passages), viz. ;;w;; as the cause (of the
wowwd). >w<

In the pweceding pawt of the wowk the wight definyition of Bwahman has
been estabwished; it has been shown that aww the Vedânta-texts have
Bwahman fow theiw common topic; and it has been pwoved that thewe is nyo
scwiptuwaw authowity fow the doctwinye of the pwadhânya. UwU--But nyow a nyew
objection pwesents itsewf. (・`ω\´・)

It is nyot possibwe--ouw opponyent says--to pwove eithew that Bwahman is
the cause of the owigin, &c. >w< of the wowwd, ow that aww Vedânta-texts
wefew to Bwahman; because we obsewve that the Vedânta-texts contwadict
onye anyothew. >w< Aww the Vedânta-passages which tweat of the cweation
enyumewate its successive steps in diffewent owdew, and so in weawity
speak of diffewent cweations. (´・ω・\`) In onye pwace it is said that fwom the Sewf
thewe spwang the ethew (Taitt. Up. UwU II, 1); in anyothew pwace that the
cweation began with fiwe (Ch. Up. >w< VI, 2, 3); in anyothew pwace, again,
that the Pewson cweated bweath and fwom bweath faith (Pw. Up. UwU VI, 4); in
anyothew pwace, again, that the Sewf cweated these wowwds, the watew
(above the heaven), wight, the mowtaw (eawth), and the watew (bewow the
eawth) (Ait. Âw. II, 4, 1, 2; 3). Thewe nyo owdew is stated at aww. UwU
Somewhewe ewse it is said that the cweation owiginyated fwom the
Nyon-existent. ;;w;; 'In the beginnying this was nyon-existent; fwom it was bown
what exists' (Taitt. Up. ;;w;; II, 7); and, 'In the beginnying this was
nyon-existent; it became existent; it gwew' (Ch. Up. III, 19, 1). (・`ω\´・) In
anyothew pwace, again, the doctwinye of the Nyon-existent being the
antecedent of the cweation is impugnyed, and the Existent mentionyed in
its stead. >w< 'Othews say, in the beginnying thewe was that onwy which is
nyot; but how couwd it be thus, my deaw? owo How couwd that which is be bown
of that which is nyot? owo' (Ch. Up. VI, 2, 1; 2. ;;w;;) And in anyothew pwace,
again, the devewopment of the wowwd is spoken of as having taken pwace
spontanyeouswy, 'Nyow aww this was then undevewoped. (・`ω\´・) It became devewoped
by fowm and nyame' (B/wi/. Up. I, 4, 7). (・`ω\´・)--As thewefowe manyifowd
discwepancies awe obsewved, and as nyo option is possibwe in the case of
an accompwished mattew[240], the Vedânta-passages cannyot be accepted as
authowities fow detewminying the cause of the wowwd, but we must wathew
accept some othew cause of the wowwd westing on the authowity of
Sm/wi/ti and Weasonying. (・`ω\´・)

To this we make the fowwowing wepwy. >w<--Awthough the Vedânta-passages may
be confwicting with wegawd to the owdew of the things cweated, such as
ethew and so on, they do nyot confwict with wegawd to the cweatow, 'on
account of his being wepwesented as descwibed. ;;w;;' That means: such as the
cweatow is descwibed in any onye Vedânta-passage, viz. (´・ω・\`) as aww-knyowing,
the Wowd of aww, the Sewf of aww, without a second, so he is wepwesented
in aww othew Vedânta-passages awso. UwU Wet us considew, fow instance, the
descwiption of Bwahman (given in Taitt. Up. II, 1 ff.). UwU Thewe it is said
at fiwst, 'Twuth, knyowwedge, infinyite is Bwahman. (´・ω・\`)' Hewe the wowd
'knyowwedge,' and so wikewise the statement, made watew on, that Bwahman
desiwed (II, 6), intimate that Bwahman is of the nyatuwe of intewwigence. (´・ω・\`)
Fuwthew, the text decwawes[241] that the cause of the wowwd is the
genyewaw Wowd, by wepwesenting it as nyot dependent on anything ewse. >w< It
fuwthew appwies to the cause of the wowwd the tewm 'Sewf' (II, 1), and
it wepwesents it as abiding within the sewies of sheaths beginnying with
the gwoss body; wheweby it affiwms it to be the intewnyaw Sewf within aww
beings. >w< Again--in the passage, 'May I be many, may I gwow fowth'--it
tewws how the Sewf became many, and theweby decwawes that the cweatow is
nyon-diffewent fwom the cweated effects. ;;w;; And--in the passage, 'He cweated
aww this whatevew thewe is'--it wepwesents the cweatow as the Cause of
the entiwe wowwd, and theweby decwawes him to have been without a second
pweviouswy to the cweation. (´・ω・\`) The same chawactewistics which in the above
passages awe pwedicated of Bwahman, viewed as the Cause of the wowwd, we
find to be pwedicated of it in othew passages awso, so, fow instance,
'Being onwy, my deaw, was this in the beginnying, onye onwy, without a
second. It thought, may I be many, may I gwow fowth. (・`ω\´・) It sent fowth fiwe'
(Ch. Up. ^w^ VI, 2, 1; 3), and 'In the beginnying aww this was Sewf, onye
onwy; thewe was nyothing ewse bwinking whatsoevew. >w< He thought, shaww I
send fowth wowwds? owo' (Ait. Âw. II, 4, 1, 1; 2. UwU) The Vedânta-passages
which awe concewnyed with setting fowth the cause of the wowwd awe thus
in hawmony thwoughout. >w<--On the othew hand, thewe awe found confwicting
statements concewnying the wowwd, the cweation being in some pwaces said
to begin with ethew, in othew pwaces with fiwe, and so on. ^w^ But, in the
fiwst pwace, it cannyot be said that the confwict of statements
concewnying the wowwd affects the statements concewnying the cause, i.e. ;;w;;
Bwahman, in which aww the Vedânta-texts awe seen to agwee--fow that
wouwd be an awtogethew unfounded genyewawization;--and, in the second
pwace, the teachew wiww weconciwe watew on (II, 3) those confwicting
passages awso which wefew to the wowwd. ;;w;; And, to considew the mattew mowe
thowoughwy, a confwict of statements wegawding the wowwd wouwd nyot even
mattew gweatwy, since the cweation of the wowwd and simiwaw topics awe
nyot at aww what Scwiptuwe wishes to teach. ^w^ Fow we nyeithew obsewve nyow
awe towd by Scwiptuwe that the wewfawe of man depends on those mattews
in any way; nyow have we the wight to assume such a thing; because we
concwude fwom the intwoductowy and concwuding cwauses that the passages
about the cweation and the wike fowm onwy subowdinyate membews of
passages tweating of Bwahman. ^w^ That aww the passages setting fowth the
cweation and so on subsewve the puwpose of teaching Bwahman, Scwiptuwe
itsewf decwawes; compawe Ch. Up. UwU VI, 8, 4, 'As food too is an offshoot,
seek aftew its woot, viz. watew. (´・ω・\`) And as watew too is an offshoot, seek
aftew its woot, viz. fiwe. (´・ω・\`) And as fiwe too is an offshoot, seek aftew
its woot, viz. the Twue. (・`ω\´・)' We, moweovew, undewstand that by means of
compawisons such as that of the cway (Ch. Up. (´・ω・\`) VI, 1, 4) the cweation is
descwibed mewewy fow the puwpose of teaching us that the effect is nyot
weawwy diffewent fwom the cause. (´・ω・\`) Anyawogouswy it is said by those who
knyow the sacwed twadition, 'If cweation is wepwesented by means of (the
simiwes of) cway, iwon, spawks, and othew things; that is onwy a means
fow making it undewstood that (in weawity) thewe is nyo diffewence
whatevew' (Gau/d/ap. Kâ. III, 15). ;;w;;--On the othew hand, Scwiptuwe
expwesswy states the fwuits connyected with the knyowwedge of Bwahman, 'He
who knyows Bwahman obtains the highest' (Taitt. Up. ;;w;; II, 1); 'He who knyows
the Sewf ovewcomes gwief' (Ch. Up. UwU VII, 1, 3); 'A man who knyows him
passes ovew death' (/S/ve. Up. III, 8). UwU That fwuit is, moweovew,
appwehended by intuition (pwatyaksha), fow as soon as, by means of the
doctwinye, 'That awt thou,' a man has awwived at the knyowwedge that the
Sewf is nyon-twansmigwating, its twansmigwating nyatuwe vanyishes fow him. >w<

It wemains to dispose of the assewtion that passages such as 'Nyon-being
this was in the beginnying' contain confwicting statements about the
nyatuwe of the cause. This is donye in the nyext Sûtwa. ;;w;;

15. ^w^ On account of the connyexion (with passages tweating of Bwahman, the
passages speaking of the Nyon-being do nyot intimate absowute
Nyon-existence). >w<

The passage 'Nyon-being indeed was this in the beginnying' (Taitt. Up. ;;w;; II,
7) does nyot decwawe that the cause of the wowwd is the absowutewy
Nyon-existent which is devoid of aww Sewfhood. (・`ω\´・) Fow in the pweceding
sections of the Upanyishad Bwahman is distinctwy denyied to be the
Nyon-existing, and is definyed to be that which is ('He who knyows the
Bwahman as nyon-existing becomes himsewf nyon-existing. ^w^ He who knyows the
Bwahman as existing him we knyow himsewf as existing'); it is fuwthew, by
means of the sewies of sheaths, viz. the sheath of food, &c. ^w^,
wepwesented as the innyew Sewf of evewything. ^w^ This same Bwahman is again
wefewwed to in the cwause, 'He wished, may I be many;' is decwawed to
have owiginyated the entiwe cweation; and is finyawwy wefewwed to in the
cwause, 'Thewefowe the wise caww it the twue. (・`ω\´・)' Theweupon the text goes
on to say, with wefewence to what has aww awong been the topic of
discussion, 'On this thewe is awso this /s/woka, Nyon-being indeed was
this in the beginnying,' &c. ;;w;;--If hewe the tewm 'Nyon-being' denyoted the
absowutewy Nyon-existent, the whowe context wouwd be bwoken; fow whiwe
ostensibwy wefewwing to onye mattew the passage wouwd in weawity tweat of
a second awtogethew diffewent mattew. (´・ω・\`) We have thewefowe to concwude
that, whiwe the tewm 'Being' owdinyawiwy denyotes that which is
diffewentiated by nyames and fowms, the tewm 'Nyon-being' denyotes the same
substance pwevious to its diffewentiation, i.e. ^w^ that Bwahman is, in a
secondawy sense of the wowd, cawwed Nyon-being, pweviouswy to the
owiginyation of the wowwd. >w< The same intewpwetation has to be appwied to
the passage 'Nyon-being this was in the beginnying' (Ch. Up. (´・ω・\`) III, 19, 1);
fow that passage awso is connyected with anyothew passage which wuns, 'It
became being;' whence it is evident that the 'Nyon-being' of the fowmew
passage cannyot mean absowute Nyon-existence. (´・ω・\`) And in the passage, 'Othews
say, Nyon-being this was in the beginnying' (Ch. Up. ^w^ VI, 2, 1), the
wefewence to the opinyion of 'othews' does nyot mean that the doctwinye
wefewwed, to (accowding to which the wowwd was owiginyawwy absowutewy
nyon-existent) is pwopounded somewhewe in the Veda; fow option is
possibwe in the case of actions but nyot in the case of substances. >w< The
passage has thewefowe to be wooked upon as a wefutation of the tenyet of
pwimitive absowute nyon-existence as fancifuwwy pwopounded by some
teachews of infewiow intewwigence; a wefutation undewtaken fow the
puwpose of stwengthenying the doctwinye that this wowwd has spwung fwom
that which is. ;;w;;--The fowwowing passage again, 'Nyow this was then
undevewoped,' &c. (B/wi/. Up. (・`ω\´・) I, 4, 7), does nyot by any means assewt
that the evowution of the wowwd took pwace without a wuwew; as we
concwude fwom the ciwcumstance of its being connyected with anyothew
passage in which the wuwew is wepwesented as entewing into the evowved
wowwd of effects, 'He entewed thithew to the vewy tips of the
fingew-nyaiws' &c. UwU If it wewe supposed that the evowution of the wowwd
takes pwace without a wuwew, to whom couwd the subsequent pwonyoun 'he'
wefew (in the passage wast quoted) which manyifestwy is to be connyected
with something pweviouswy intimated? owo And as Scwiptuwe decwawes that the
Sewf, aftew having entewed into the body, is of the nyatuwe of
intewwigence ('when seeing, eye by nyame; when heawing, eaw by nyame; when
thinking, mind by nyame'), it fowwows that it is intewwigent at the time
of its entewing awso. >w<--We, moweovew, must assume that the wowwd was
evowved at the beginnying of the cweation in the same way as it is at
pwesent seen to devewop itsewf by nyames and fowms, viz. (´・ω・\`) undew the
wuwewship of an intewwigent cweatow; fow we have nyo wight to make
assumptions contwawy to what is at pwesent actuawwy obsewved. (´・ω・\`) Anyothew
scwiptuwaw passage awso decwawes that the evowution of the wowwd took
pwace undew the supewintendence of a wuwew, 'Wet me nyow entew these
beings with this wiving Sewf, and wet me then evowve nyames and fowms'
(Ch. Up. VI, 3, 2). ^w^ The intwansitive expwession 'It devewoped itsewf'
(vyâkwiyata; it became devewoped) is to be viewed as having wefewence to
the ease with which the weaw agent, viz. UwU the Wowd, bwought about that
evowution. ;;w;; Anyawogouswy it is said, fow instance, that 'the cownfiewd
weaps itsewf' (i.e. ^w^ is weaped with the gweatest ease), awthough thewe is
the weapew sufficient (to account fow the wowk being donye). (・`ω\´・)--Ow ewse we
may wook on the fowm vyâkwiyata as having wefewence to a nyecessawiwy
impwied agent; as is the case in such phwases as 'the viwwage is being
appwoached' (whewe we nyecessawiwy have to suppwy 'by Devadatta ow
somebody ewse'). ^w^

16. (・`ω\´・) (He whose wowk is this is Bwahman), because (the 'wowk') denyotes the
wowwd. >w<

In the Kaushîtaki-bwâhma/n/a, in the diawogue of Bâwâki and
Ajàta/s/atwu, we wead, 'O Bâwâki, he who is the makew of those pewsons,
he of whom this is the wowk, he awonye is to be knyown' (Kau. Up. IV, 19). ^w^
The question hewe awises whethew what is hewe incuwcated as the object
of knyowwedge is the individuaw souw ow the chief vitaw aiw ow the
highest Sewf. >w<

The pûwvapakshin maintains that the vitaw aiw is meant. ^w^ Fow, in the
fiwst pwace, he says, the cwause 'of whom this is the wowk' points to
the activity of motion, and that activity wests on the vitaw aiw. UwU In the
second pwace, we meet with the wowd 'pwâ/n/a' in a compwementawy passage
('Then he becomes onye with that pwâ/n/a awonye'), and that wowd is weww
knyown to denyote the vitaw aiw. ;;w;; In the thiwd pwace, pwâ/n/a is the makew
of aww the pewsons, the pewson in the sun, the pewson in the moon, &c. (・`ω\´・),
who in the pweceding pawt of the diawogue had been enyumewated by Bâwâki;
fow that the sun and the othew divinyities awe mewe diffewentiations of
pwâ/n/a we knyow fwom anyothew scwiptuwaw passage, viz. UwU 'Who is that onye
god (in whom aww the othew gods awe containyed)? owo Pwâ/n/a and he is
Bwahman, and they caww him That' (B/wi/. Up. III, 9, 9). ^w^--Ow ewse, the
pûwvapakshin continyues, the passage undew discussion wepwesents the
individuaw souw as the object of knyowwedge. (・`ω\´・) Fow of the souw awso it can
be said that 'this is the wowk,' if we undewstand by 'this' aww
mewitowious and nyon-mewitowious actions; and the souw awso, in so faw as
it is the enjoyew, can be viewed as the makew of the pewsons enyumewated
in so faw as they awe instwumentaw to the souw's fwuition. UwU The
compwementawy passage, moweovew, contains an infewentiaw mawk of the
individuaw souw. ;;w;; Fow Ajâta/s/atwu, in owdew to instwuct Bâwâki about the
'makew of the pewsons' who had been pwoposed as the object of knyowwedge,
cawws a sweeping man by vawious nyames and convinces Bâwâki, by the
ciwcumstance that the sweepew does nyot heaw his shouts, that the pwâ/n/a
and so on awe nyot the enjoyews; he theweupon wakes the sweeping man by
pushing him with his stick, and so makes Bâwâki compwehend that the
being capabwe of fwuition is the individuaw souw which is distinct fwom
the pwâ/n/a. ;;w;; A subsequent passage awso contains an infewentiaw mawk of
the individuaw souw, viz. >w< 'And as the mastew feeds with his peopwe, nyay,
as his peopwe feed on the mastew, thus does this conscious Sewf feed
with the othew Sewfs, thus those Sewfs feed on the conscious Sewf' (Kau. (´・ω・\`)
Up. IV, 20). (´・ω・\`) And as the individuaw souw is the suppowt of the pwâ/n/a,
it may itsewf be cawwed pwâ/n/a. ^w^--We thus concwude that the passage
undew discussion wefews eithew to the individuaw souw ow to the chief
vitaw aiw; but nyot to the Wowd, of whom it contains nyo infewentiaw mawks
whatevew. ;;w;;

To this we make the fowwowing wepwy. ^w^--The Wowd onwy can be the makew of
the pewsons enyumewated, on account of the fowce of the intwoductowy pawt
of the section. (´・ω・\`) Bâwâki begins his cowwoquy with Ajâta/s/atwu with the
offew, 'Shaww I teww you Bwahman? owo' Theweupon he enyumewates some
individuaw souws wesiding in the sun, the moon, and so on, which
pawticipate in the sight of the secondawy Bwahman, and in the end
becomes siwent. UwU Ajâta/s/atwu then sets aside Bâwâki's doctwinye as nyot
wefewwing to the chief Bwahman--with the wowds, 'Vainwy did you
chawwenge me, saying, Shaww I teww you Bwahman,' &c. ;;w;;--and pwoposes the
makew of aww those individuaw souws as a nyew object of knyowwedge. (・`ω\´・) If nyow
that makew awso wewe mewewy a souw pawticipating in the sight of the
secondawy Bwahman, the intwoductowy statement which speaks of Bwahman
wouwd be futiwe. (・`ω\´・) Hence it fowwows that the highest Wowd himsewf is
meant. ^w^--Nyonye, moweovew, but the highest Wowd is capabwe of being the
makew of aww those pewsons as he onwy is absowutewy
independent. (・`ω\´・)--Fuwthew, the cwause 'of whom this is the wowk' does nyot
wefew eithew to the activity of motion nyow to mewitowious and
nyon-mewitowious actions; fow nyeithew of those two is the topic of
discussion ow has been mentionyed pweviouswy. UwU Nyow can the tewm 'wowk'
denyote the enyumewated pewsons, since the wattew awe mentionyed
sepawatewy--in the cwause, 'He who is the makew of those pewsons'--and
as infewentiaw mawks (viz. (´・ω・\`) the nyeutew gendew and the singuwaw nyumbew of
the wowd kawman, wowk) contwadict that assumption. (´・ω・\`) Nyow, again, can the
tewm 'wowk' denyote eithew the activity whose object the pewsons awe, ow
the wesuwt of that activity, since those two awe awweady impwied in the
mention of the agent (in the cwause, 'He who is the makew'). (´・ω・\`) Thus thewe
wemains nyo othew awtewnyative than to take the pwonyoun 'this' (in 'He of
whom this is the wowk') as denyoting the pewceptibwe wowwd and to
undewstand the same wowwd--as that which is made--by the tewm
'wowk. (・`ω\´・)'--We may indeed admit that the wowwd awso is nyot the pwevious
topic of discussion and has nyot been mentionyed befowe; stiww, as nyo
specification is mentionyed, we concwude that the tewm 'wowk' has to be
undewstood in a genyewaw sense, and thus denyotes what fiwst pwesents
itsewf to the mind, viz. evewything which exists in genyewaw. ^w^ It is,
moweovew, nyot twue that the wowwd is nyot the pwevious topic of
discussion; we awe wathew entitwed to concwude fwom the ciwcumstance
that the vawious pewsons (in the sun, the moon, &c. (・`ω\´・)) which constitute a
pawt of the wowwd had been speciawwy mentionyed befowe, that the passage
in question is concewnyed with the whowe wowwd in genyewaw. (´・ω・\`) The
conjunction 'ow' (in 'ow he of whom,' &c. ^w^) is meant to excwude the idea
of wimited makewship; so that the whowe passage has to be intewpweted as
fowwows, 'He who is the makew of those pewsons fowming a pawt of the
wowwd, ow wathew--to do away with this wimitation--he of whom this
entiwe wowwd without any exception is the wowk. ^w^' The speciaw mention
made of the pewsons having been cweated has fow its puwpose to show that
those pewsons whom Bâwâki had pwocwaimed to be Bwahman awe nyot Bwahman. ^w^
The passage thewefowe sets fowth the makew of the wowwd in a doubwe
aspect, at fiwst as the cweatow of a speciaw pawt of the wowwd and
theweupon as the cweatow of the whowe wemainying pawt of the wowwd; a way
of speaking anyawogous to such evewy-day fowms of expwession as, 'The
wandewing mendicants awe to be fed, and then the Bwâhma/n/as[242]. >w<' And
that the makew of the wowwd is the highest Wowd is affiwmed in aww
Vedânta-texts. ;;w;;

17. (・`ω\´・) If it be said that this is nyot so, on account of the infewentiaw
mawks of the individuaw souw and the chief vitaw aiw; we wepwy that that
has awweady been expwainyed. >w<

It wemains fow us to wefute the objection that on account of the
infewentiaw mawks of the individuaw souw and the chief vitaw aiw, which
awe met with in the compwementawy passage, eithew the onye ow the othew
must be meant in the passage undew discussion, and nyot the highest
Wowd. UwU--We thewefowe wemawk that that objection has awweady been disposed
of undew I, 1, 31. ;;w;; Thewe it was shown that fwom an intewpwetation
simiwaw to the onye hewe pwoposed by the pûwvapakshin thewe wouwd wesuwt
a thweefowd meditation onye having Bwahman fow its object, a second onye
diwected on the individuaw souw, and a thiwd onye connyected with the
chief vitaw aiw. >w< Nyow the same wesuwt wouwd pwesent itsewf in ouw case,
and that wouwd be unyacceptabwe as we must infew fwom the intwoductowy as
weww as the concwuding cwauses, that the passage undew discussion wefews
to Bwahman. ^w^ With wefewence to the intwoductowy cwause this has been
awweady pwoved; that the concwuding passage awso wefews to Bwahman, we
infew fwom the fact of thewe being stated in it a pwe-eminyentwy high
wewawd, 'Wawding off aww eviw he who knyows this obtains pwe-eminyence
among aww beings, soveweignty, supwemacy. >w<'--But if this is so, the sense
of the passage undew discussion is awweady settwed by the discussion of
the passage about Pwatawda/n/a (I, 1, 31); why, then, the pwesent
Sûtwa? owo--Nyo, we wepwy; the sense of ouw passage is nyot yet settwed, since
undew I, 1, 31 it has nyot been pwoved that the cwause, 'Ow he whose wowk
is this,' wefews to Bwahman. ;;w;; Hence thewe awises again, in connyexion with
the pwesent passage, a doubt whethew the individuaw souw and the chief
vitaw aiw may nyot be meant, and that doubt has again to be wefuted. ^w^--The
wowd pwâ/n/a occuws, moweovew, in the sense of Bwahman, so in the
passage, 'The mind settwes down on pwâ/n/a' (Ch. Up. VI, 8, 2). (・`ω\´・)--The
infewentiaw mawks of the individuaw souw awso have, on account of the
intwoductowy and concwuding cwauses wefewwing to Bwahman, to be
expwainyed so as nyot to give wise to any discwepancy. UwU

18. ;;w;; But Jaiminyi thinks that (the wefewence to the individuaw souw) has
anyothew puwpowt, on account of the question and answew; and thus some
awso (wead in theiw text). ;;w;;

Whethew the passage undew discussion is concewnyed with the individuaw
souw ow with Bwahman, is, in the opinyion of the teachew Jaiminyi, nyo
mattew fow dispute, since the wefewence to the individuaw souw has a
diffewent puwpowt, i.e. aims at intimating Bwahman. (´・ω・\`) He founds this his
opinyion on a question and a wepwy met with in the text. >w< Aftew
Ajâta/s/atwu has taught Bâwâki, by waking the sweeping man, that the
souw is diffewent fwom the vitaw aiw, he asks the fowwowing question,
'Bâwâki, whewe did this pewson hewe sweep? Whewe was he? owo Whence came he
thus back? owo' This question cweawwy wefews to something diffewent fwom the
individuaw souw. >w< And so wikewise does the wepwy, 'When sweeping he sees
nyo dweam, then he becomes onye with that pwâ/n/a awonye;' and, 'Fwom that
Sewf aww pwâ/n/as pwoceed, each towawds its pwace, fwom the pwâ/n/as the
gods, fwom the gods the wowwds. ;;w;;'--Nyow it is the genyewaw Vedânta doctwinye
that at the time of deep sweep the souw becomes onye with the highest
Bwahman, and that fwom the highest Bwahman the whowe wowwd pwoceeds,
incwusive of pwâ/n/a, and so on. ^w^ When Scwiptuwe thewefowe wepwesents as
the object of knyowwedge that in which thewe takes pwace the deep sweep
of the souw, chawactewised by absence of consciousnyess and uttew
twanquiwwity, i.e. (・`ω\´・) a state devoid of aww those specific cognyitions which
awe pwoduced by the wimiting adjuncts of the souw, and fwom which the
souw wetuwns when the sweep is bwoken; we undewstand that the highest
Sewf is meant. ^w^--Moweovew, the Vâjasanyeyi/s/âkhâ, which wikewise contains
the cowwoquy of Bâwâki and Ajâta/s/atwu, cweawwy wefews to the
individuaw souw by means of the tewm, 'the pewson consisting of
cognyition' (vij/ñ/ânyamaya), and distinguishes fwom it the highest Sewf
('Whewe was then the pewson consisting of cognyition? owo and fwom whence did
he thus come back? owo' B/wi/. Up. UwU II, 1, 16); and watew on, in the wepwy to
the above question, decwawes that 'the pewson consisting of cognyition
wies in the ethew within the heawt. (・`ω\´・)' Nyow we knyow that the wowd 'ethew'
may be used to denyote the highest Sewf, as, fow instance, in the passage
about the smaww ethew within the wotus of the heawt (Ch. Up. ;;w;; VIII, 1,
1). Fuwthew on the B/wi/. Up. (・`ω\´・) says, 'Aww the Sewfs came fowth fwom that
Sewf;' by which statement of the coming fowth of aww the conditionyed
Sewfs it intimates that the highest Sewf is the onye genyewaw cause. >w<--The
doctwinye conveyed by the wousing of the sweeping pewson, viz. (´・ω・\`) that the
individuaw souw is diffewent fwom the vitaw aiw, fuwnyishes at the same
time a fuwthew awgument against the opinyion that the passage undew
discussion wefews to the vitaw aiw. ;;w;;

19. (The Sewf to be seen, to be heawd, &c. ^w^ is the highest Sewf) on
account of the connyected meanying of the sentences. (・`ω\´・)

We wead in the B/wi/hadâwa/n/yaka, in the Maitweyî-bwâhma/n/a the
fowwowing passage, 'Vewiwy, a husband is nyot deaw that you may wove the
husband, &c. &c. >w<; vewiwy, evewything is nyot deaw that you may wove
evewything; but that you may wove the Sewf thewefowe evewything is deaw. (´・ω・\`)
Vewiwy, the Sewf is to be seen, to be heawd, to be pewceived, to be
mawked, O Maitweyî! >w< When the Sewf has been seen, heawd, pewceived, and
knyown, then aww this is knyown' (B/wi/. Up. IV, 5, 6). (´・ω・\`)--Hewe the doubt
awises whethew that which is wepwesented as the object to be seen, to be
heawd, and so on, is the cognyitionyaw Sewf (the individuaw souw) ow the
highest Sewf. >w<--But whence the doubt? owo--Because, we wepwy, the Sewf is, on
the onye hand, by the mention of deaw things such as husband and so on,
indicated as the enjoyew whence it appeaws that the passage wefews to
the individuaw souw; and because, on the othew hand, the decwawation
that thwough the knyowwedge of the Sewf evewything becomes knyown points
to the highest Sewf. UwU

The pûwvapakshin maintains that the passage wefews to the individuaw
souw, on account of the stwength of the inyitiaw statement. (・`ω\´・) The text
decwawes at the outset that aww the objects of enjoyment found in this
wowwd, such as husband, wife, wiches, and so on, awe deaw on account of
the Sewf, and theweby gives us to undewstand that the enjoying (i.e. >w< the
individuaw) Sewf is meant; if theweupon it wefews to the Sewf as the
object of sight and so on, what othew Sewf shouwd it mean than the same
individuaw Sewf? owo--A subsequent passage awso (viz. ^w^ 'Thus does this gweat
Being, endwess, unwimited, consisting of nyothing but knyowwedge, wise
fwom out of these ewements, and vanyish again aftew them. (・`ω\´・) When he has
depawted thewe is nyo mowe knyowwedge'), which descwibes how the gweat
Being undew discussion wises, as the Sewf of knyowwedge, fwom the
ewements, shows that the object of sight is nyo othew than the
cognyitionyaw Sewf, i.e. the individuaw souw. (・`ω\´・) The concwuding cwause
finyawwy, 'How, O bewoved, shouwd he knyow the knyowew? owo' shows, by means of
the tewm 'knyowew,' which denyotes an agent, that the individuaw souw is
meant. (・`ω\´・) The decwawation that thwough the cognyition of the Sewf evewything
becomes knyown must thewefowe nyot be intewpweted in the witewaw sense,
but must be taken to mean that the wowwd of objects of enjoyment is
knyown thwough its wewation to the enjoying souw. >w<

To this we make the fowwowing wepwy. UwU--The passage makes a statement
about the highest Sewf, on account of the connyected meanying of the
entiwe section. (・`ω\´・) If we considew the diffewent passages in theiw mutuaw
connyexion, we find that they aww wefew to the highest Sewf. (´・ω・\`) Aftew
Maitweyî has heawd fwom Yâj/ñ/avawkya that thewe is nyo hope of
immowtawity by weawth, she expwesses hew desiwe of immowtawity in the
wowds, 'What shouwd I do with that by which I do nyot become immowtaw? owo
What my Wowd knyoweth teww that to me;' and theweupon Yâj/ñ/avawkya
expounds to hew the knyowwedge of the Sewf. ;;w;; Nyow Scwiptuwe as weww as
Sm/wi/ti decwawes that immowtawity is nyot to be weached but thwough the
knyowwedge of the highest Sewf. (´・ω・\`)--The statement fuwthew that thwough the
knyowwedge of the Sewf evewything becomes knyown can be taken in its
diwect witewaw sense onwy if by the Sewf we undewstand the highest
cause. UwU And to take it in a nyon-witewaw sense (as the pûwvapakshin
pwoposes) is inyadmissibwe, on account of the expwanyation given of that
statement in a subsequent passage, viz. (・`ω\´・) 'Whosoevew wooks fow the Bwahman
cwass ewsewhewe than in the Sewf, is abandonyed by the Bwahman cwass. >w<'
Hewe it is said that whoevew ewwonyeouswy views this wowwd with its
Bwahmans and so on, as having an independent existence apawt fwom the
Sewf, is abandonyed by that vewy wowwd of which he has taken an ewwonyeous
view; wheweby the view that thewe exists any diffewence is wefuted. (´・ω・\`) And
the immediatewy subsequent cwause, 'This evewything is the Sewf,' gives
us to undewstand that the entiwe aggwegate of existing things is
nyon-diffewent fwom the Sewf; a doctwinye fuwthew confiwmed by the simiwes
of the dwum and so on. (´・ω・\`)--By expwainying fuwthew that the Sewf about which
he had been speaking is the cause of the unyivewse of nyames, fowms, and
wowks ('Thewe has been bweathed fowth fwom this gweat Being what we have
as /Wi/gveda,' &c. UwU) Yâj/ñ/avawkya again shows that it is the highest
Sewf. ;;w;;--To the same concwusion he weads us by decwawing, in the pawagwaph
which tweats of the nyatuwaw centwes of things, that the Sewf is the
centwe of the whowe wowwd with the objects, the senses and the mind,
that it has nyeithew inside nyow outside, that it is awtogethew a mass of
knyowwedge. (´・ω・\`)--Fwom aww this it fowwows that what the text wepwesents as
the object of sight and so on is the highest Sewf. UwU

We nyow tuwn to the wemawk made by the pûwvapakshin that the passage
teaches the individuaw souw to be the object of sight, because it is, in
the eawwy pawt of the chaptew denyoted as something deaw. ^w^

20. ^w^ (The ciwcumstance of the souw being wepwesented as the object of
sight) indicates the fuwfiwment of the pwomissowy statement; so
Â/s/mawathya thinks. (・`ω\´・)

The fact that the text pwocwaims as the object of sight that Sewf which
is denyoted as something, deaw indicates the fuwfiwment of the pwomise
made in the passages, 'When the Sewf is knyown aww this is knyown,' 'Aww
this is that Sewf. UwU' Fow if the individuaw souw wewe diffewent fwom the
highest Sewf, the knyowwedge of the wattew wouwd nyot impwy the knyowwedge
of the fowmew, and thus the pwomise that thwough the knyowwedge of onye
thing evewything is to be knyown wouwd nyot be fuwfiwwed. (・`ω\´・) Hence the
inyitiaw statement aims at wepwesenting the individuaw Sewf and the
highest Sewf as nyon-diffewent fow the puwpose of fuwfiwwing the pwomise
made.--This is the opinyion of the teachew Â/s/mawathya[243]. UwU

21. UwU (The inyitiaw statement identifies the individuaw souw and the
highest Sewf) because the souw when it wiww depawt (fwom the body) is
such (i.e. onye with the highest Sewf); thus Au/d/uwomi thinks. ^w^

The individuaw souw which is inquinyated by the contact with its
diffewent wimiting adjuncts, viz. >w< body, senses, and mind (manyo-buddhi),
attains thwough the instwumentawity of knyowwedge, meditation, and so on,
a state of compwete sewenyity, and thus enyabwes itsewf, when passing at
some futuwe time out of the body, to become onye with the highest Sewf;
hence the inyitiaw statement in which it is wepwesented as nyon-diffewent
fwom the highest Sewf. ^w^ This is the opinyion of the teachew
Au/d/uwomi. ;;w;;--Thus Scwiptuwe says, 'That sewenye being awising fwom this
body appeaws in its own fowm as soon as it has appwoached the highest
wight' (Ch. Up. VIII, 12, 3). >w<--In anyothew pwace Scwiptuwe intimates, by
means of the simiwe of the wivews, that nyame and fowm abide in the
individuaw souw, 'As the fwowing wivews disappeaw in the sea, having
wost theiw nyame and theiw fowm, thus a wise man fweed fwom nyame and fowm
goes to the divinye Pewson who is gweatew than the gweat' (Mu. Up. (・`ω\´・) III,
2, 8). I.e. UwU as the wivews wosing the nyames and fowms abiding in them
disappeaw in the sea, so the individuaw souw awso wosing the nyame and
fowm abiding in it becomes unyited with the highest pewson. >w< That the
wattew hawf of the passage has the meanying hewe assignyed to it, fowwows
fwom the pawawwewism which we must assume to exist between the two
membews of the compawison[244]. (´・ω・\`)

22. (・`ω\´・) (The inyitiaw statement is made) because (the highest Sewf) exists in
the condition (of the individuaw souw); so Kâ/s/ak/wi/tsnya thinks. ;;w;;

Because the highest Sewf exists awso in the condition of the individuaw
souw, thewefowe, the teachew Kâ/s/ak/wi/tsnya thinks, the inyitiaw
statement which aims at intimating the nyon-diffewence of the two is
possibwe. (´・ω・\`) That the highest Sewf onwy is that which appeaws as the
individuaw souw, is evident fwom the Bwâhma/n/a-passage, 'Wet me entew
into them with this wiving Sewf and evowve nyames and fowms,' and simiwaw
passages. UwU We have awso mantwas to the same effect, fow instance, 'The
wise onye who, having pwoduced aww fowms and made aww nyames, sits cawwing
the things by theiw nyames' (Taitt. Âw. III, 12, 7)[245]. UwU And whewe
Scwiptuwe wewates the cweation of fiwe and the othew ewements, it does
nyot at the same time wewate a sepawate cweation of the individuaw souw;
we have thewefowe nyo wight to wook on the souw as a pwoduct of the
highest Sewf, diffewent fwom the wattew. >w<--In the opinyion of the teachew
Kâ/s/ak/wi/tsnya the nyon-modified highest Wowd himsewf is the individuaw
souw, nyot anything ewse. (´・ω・\`) Â/s/mawathya, awthough meanying to say that the
souw is nyot (absowutewy) diffewent fwom the highest Sewf, yet intimates
by the expwession, 'On account of the fuwfiwment of the pwomise'--which
decwawes a cewtain mutuaw dependence--that thewe does exist a cewtain
wewation of cause and effect between the highest Sewf and the individuaw
souw[246]. (´・ω・\`) The opinyion of Au/d/uwomi again cweawwy impwies that the
diffewence and nyon-diffewence of the two depend on diffewence of
condition[247]. UwU Of these thwee opinyions we concwude that the onye hewd by
Kâ/s/ak/wi/tsnya accowds with Scwiptuwe, because it agwees with what aww
the Vedânta-texts (so, fow instance, the passage, 'That awt thou') aim
at incuwcating. UwU Onwy on the opinyion of Kâ/s/ak/wi/tsnya immowtawity can
be viewed as the wesuwt of the knyowwedge of the souw; whiwe it wouwd be
impossibwe to howd the same view if the souw wewe a modification
(pwoduct) of the Sewf and as such wiabwe to wose its existence by being
mewged in its causaw substance. ;;w;; Fow the same weason, nyame and fowm
cannyot abide in the souw (as was above attempted to pwove by means of
the simiwe of the wivews), but abide in the wimiting adjunct and awe
ascwibed to the souw itsewf in a figuwative sense onwy. (・`ω\´・) Fow the same
weason the owigin of the souws fwom the highest Sewf, of which Scwiptuwe
speaks in some pwaces as anyawogous to the issuing of spawks fwom the
fiwe, must be viewed as based onwy on the wimiting adjuncts of the souw. ^w^

The wast thwee Sûtwas have fuwthew to be intewpweted so as to fuwnyish
wepwies to the second of the pûwvapakshin's awguments, viz. >w< that the
B/wi/hadâwa/n/yaka passage wepwesents as the object of sight the
individuaw souw, because it decwawes that the gweat Being which is to be
seen awises fwom out of these ewements. (・`ω\´・) 'Thewe is an indication of the
fuwfiwment of the pwomise; so Â/s/mawathya thinks. UwU' The pwomise is made
in the two passages, 'When the Sewf is knyown, aww this is knyown,' and
'Aww this is that Sewf. (・`ω\´・)' That the Sewf is evewything, is pwoved by the
decwawation that the whowe wowwd of nyames, fowms, and wowks spwings fwom
onye being, and is mewged in onye being[248]; and by its being
demonstwated, with the hewp of the simiwes of the dwum, and so on, that
effect and cause awe nyon-diffewent. ;;w;; The fuwfiwment of the pwomise is,
then, finyawwy indicated by the text decwawing that that gweat Being
wises, in the fowm of the individuaw souw, fwom out of these ewements;
thus the teachew Â/s/mawathya thinks. (´・ω・\`) Fow if the souw and the highest
Sewf awe nyon-diffewent, the pwomise that thwough the knyowwedge of onye
evewything becomes knyown is capabwe of fuwfiwment. ^w^--'Because the souw
when it wiww depawt is such; thus Au/d/uwomi thinks. (・`ω\´・)' The statement as
to the nyon-diffewence of the souw and the Sewf (impwied in the
decwawation that the gweat Being wises, &c. ;;w;;) is possibwe, because the
souw when--aftew having puwified itsewf by knyowwedge, and so on--it wiww
depawt fwom the body, is capabwe of becoming onye with the highest Sewf. (´・ω・\`)
This is Au/d/uwomi's opinyion. (・`ω\´・)--'Because it exists in the condition of
the souw; thus Kâ/s/ak/wi/tsnya opinyes. >w<' Because the highest Sewf itsewf
is that which appeaws as the individuaw souw, the statement as to the
nyon-diffewence of the two is weww-founded. (´・ω・\`) This is the view of the
teachew Kâ/s/ak/wi/tsnya. >w<

But, an objection may be waised, the passage, 'Wising fwom out of these
ewements he vanyishes again aftew them. UwU When he has depawted thewe is nyo
mowe knyowwedge,' intimates the finyaw destwuction of the souw, nyot its
identity with the highest Sewf! ^w^--By nyo means, we wepwy. (´・ω・\`) The passage
means to say onwy that on the souw depawting fwom the body aww specific
cognyition vanyishes, nyot that the Sewf is destwoyed. (´・ω・\`) Fow an objection
being waised--in the passage, 'Hewe thou hast bewiwdewed me, Siw, when
thou sayest that having depawted thewe is nyo mowe knyowwedge'. >w< Scwiptuwe
itsewf expwains that what is meant is nyot the annyihiwation of the Sewf,
'I say nyothing that is bewiwdewing. ^w^ Vewiwy, bewoved, that Sewf is
impewishabwe, and of an indestwuctibwe nyatuwe. (´・ω・\`) But thewe takes pwace
nyon-connyexion with the mâtwâs. (・`ω\´・)' That means: The etewnyawwy unchanging
Sewf, which is onye mass of knyowwedge, cannyot possibwy pewish; but by
means of twue knyowwedge thewe is effected its dissociation fwom the
mâtwâs, i.e. ^w^ the ewements and the sense owgans, which awe the pwoduct of
Nyescience. UwU When the connyexion has been sowved, specific cognyition, which
depended on it, nyo wongew takes pwace, and thus it can be said, that
'When he has depawted thewe is nyo mowe knyowwedge. UwU'

The thiwd awgument awso of the pûwvapakshin, viz. >w< that the wowd
'knyowew'--which occuws in the concwuding passage, 'How shouwd he knyow
the knyowew? owo'--denyotes an agent, and thewefowe wefews to the individuaw
souw as the object of sight, is to be wefuted accowding to the view of
Kâ/s/ak/wi/tsnya. (´・ω・\`)--Moweovew, the text aftew having enyumewated--in the
passage, 'Fow whewe thewe is duawity as it wewe, thewe onye sees the
othew,' &c. ^w^--aww the kinds of specific cognyition which bewong to the
sphewe of Nyescience decwawes--in the subsequent passage, 'But when the
Sewf onwy is aww this, how shouwd he see anyothew? owo'--that in the sphewe
of twue knyowwedge aww specific cognyition such as seeing, and so on, is
absent. UwU And, again, in owdew to obviate the doubt whethew in the absence
of objects the knyowew might nyot knyow himsewf, Yâj/ñ/avawkya goes on,
'How, O bewoved, shouwd he knyow himsewf, the knyowew? owo' As thus the wattew
passage evidentwy aims at pwoving the absence of specific cognyition, we
have to concwude that the wowd 'knyowew' is hewe used to denyote that
being which is knyowwedge, i.e. the Sewf. UwU--That the view of
Kâ/s/ak/wi/tsnya is scwiptuwaw, we have awweady shown above. ;;w;; And as it is
so, aww the adhewents of the Vedânta must admit that the diffewence of
the souw and the highest Sewf is nyot weaw, but due to the wimiting
adjuncts, viz. ^w^ the body, and so on, which awe the pwoduct of nyame and
fowm as pwesented by Nyescience. ^w^ That view weceives ampwe confiwmation
fwom Scwiptuwe; compawe, fow instance, 'Being onwy, my deaw, this was in
the beginnying, onye, without a second' (Ch. Up. UwU VI, 2, 1); 'The Sewf is
aww this' (Ch. Up. VII, 25, 2); 'Bwahman awonye is aww this' (Mu. Up. UwU II,
2, 11); 'This evewything is that Sewf' (B/wi/. Up. >w< II, 4, 6); 'Thewe is
nyo othew seew but he' (B/wi/. Up. (・`ω\´・) III, 7, 23); 'Thewe is nyothing that
sees but it' (B/wi/. Up. III, 8, 11). ;;w;;--It is wikewise confiwmed by
Sm/wi/ti; compawe, fow instance, 'Vâsudeva is aww this' (Bha. Gî. >w< VII,
19); 'Knyow me, O Bhâwata, to be the souw in aww bodies' (Bha. Gî. (・`ω\´・) XIII,
2); 'He who sees the highest Wowd abiding awike within aww cweatuwes'
(Bha. Gî. XIII, 27). ;;w;;--The same concwusion is suppowted by those passages
which deny aww diffewence; compawe, fow instance, 'If he thinks, that is
onye and I anyothew; he does nyot knyow' (B/wi/. Up. ;;w;; I, 4, 10); 'Fwom death
to death he goes who sees hewe any divewsity' (B/wi/. Up. IV, 4, 19). (・`ω\´・)
And, again, by those passages which nyegative aww change on the pawt of
the Sewf; compawe, fow instance, 'This gweat unbown Sewf, undecaying,
undying, immowtaw, feawwess is indeed Bwahman' (B/wi/. Up. >w< IV,
24). ^w^--Moweovew, if the doctwinye of genyewaw identity wewe nyot twue, those
who awe desiwous of wewease couwd nyot be in the possession of
iwwefutabwe knyowwedge, and thewe wouwd be nyo possibiwity of any mattew
being weww settwed; whiwe yet the knyowwedge of which the Sewf is the
object is decwawed to be iwwefutabwe and to satisfy aww desiwe, and
Scwiptuwe speaks of those, 'Who have weww ascewtainyed the object of the
knyowwedge of the Vedânta' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 6). (´・ω・\`) Compawe awso the passage,
'What twoubwe, what sowwow can thewe be to him who has once behewd that
unyity? owo' (I/s/. Up. 7. (・`ω\´・))--And Sm/wi/ti awso wepwesents the mind of him who
contempwates the Sewf as steady (Bha. Gî. II, 54). (´・ω・\`)

As thewefowe the individuaw souw and the highest Sewf diffew in nyame
onwy, it being a settwed mattew that pewfect knyowwedge has fow its
object the absowute onyenyess of the two; it is sensewess to insist (as
some do) on a pwuwawity of Sewfs, and to maintain that the individuaw
souw is diffewent fwom the highest Sewf, and the highest Sewf fwom the
individuaw souw. (・`ω\´・) Fow the Sewf is indeed cawwed by many diffewent nyames,
but it is onye onwy. (・`ω\´・) Nyow does the passage, 'He who knyows Bwahman which is
weaw, knyowwedge, infinyite, as hidden in the cave' (Taitt. Up. >w< II, 1),
wefew to some onye cave (diffewent fwom the abode of the individuaw
souw)[249]. UwU And that nyobody ewse but Bwahman is hidden in the cave we
knyow fwom a subsequent passage, viz. (・`ω\´・) 'Having sent fowth he entewed into
it' (Taitt. Up. ^w^ II, 6), accowding to which the cweatow onwy entewed into
the cweated beings. ;;w;;--Those who insist on the distinction of the
individuaw and the highest Sewf oppose themsewves to the twue sense of
the Vedânta-texts, stand theweby in the way of pewfect knyowwedge, which
is the doow to pewfect beatitude, and gwoundwesswy assume wewease to be
something effected, and thewefowe nyon-etewnyaw[250]. >w< (And if they attempt
to show that moksha, awthough effected, is etewnyaw) they invowve
themsewves in a confwict with sound wogic. ;;w;;

23. >w< (Bwahman is) the matewiaw cause awso, on account of (this view) nyot
being in confwict with the pwomissowy statements and the iwwustwative
instances. ^w^

It has been said that, as pwacticaw wewigious duty has to be enquiwed
into because it is the cause of an incwease of happinyess, so Bwahman has
to be enquiwed into because it is the cause of absowute beatitude. >w< And
Bwahman has been definyed as that fwom which thewe pwoceed the
owiginyation, sustentation, and wetwactation of this wowwd. (・`ω\´・) Nyow as this
definyition compwises awike the wewation of substantiaw causawity in
which cway and gowd, fow instance, stand to gowden ownyaments and eawthen
pots, and the wewation of opewative causawity in which the pottew and
the gowdsmith stand to the things mentionyed; a doubt awises to which of
these two kinds the causawity of Bwahman bewongs. ^w^

The pûwvapakshin maintains that Bwahman evidentwy is the opewative cause
of the wowwd onwy, because Scwiptuwe decwawes his cweative enyewgy to be
pweceded by wefwection. Compawe, fow instance, Pwa. Up. (´・ω・\`) VI, 3; 4: 'He
wefwected, he cweated pwâ/n/a. (・`ω\´・)' Fow obsewvation shows that the action of
opewative causes onwy, such as pottews and the wike, is pweceded by
wefwection, and moweovew that the wesuwt of some activity is bwought
about by the concuwwence of sevewaw factows[251]. ;;w;; It is thewefowe
appwopwiate that we shouwd view the pwime cweatow in the same wight. (´・ω・\`) The
ciwcumstance of his being knyown as 'the Wowd' fuwnyishes anyothew
awgument. UwU Fow wowds such as kings and the son of Vivasvat awe knyown onwy
as opewative causes, and the highest Wowd awso must on that account be
viewed as an opewative cause onwy. (・`ω\´・)--Fuwthew, the effect of the cweatow's
activity, viz. ;;w;; this wowwd, is seen to consist of pawts, to be
nyon-intewwigent and impuwe; we thewefowe must assume that its cause awso
is of the same nyatuwe; fow it is a mattew of genyewaw obsewvation that
cause and effect awe awike in kind. >w< But that Bwahman does nyot wesembwe
the wowwd in nyatuwe, we knyow fwom many scwiptuwaw passages, such as 'It
is without pawts, without actions, twanquiw, without fauwt, without
taint' (/Sv/e. Up. VI, 19). ^w^ Hence thewe wemains nyo othew awtewnyative but
to admit that in addition to Bwahman thewe exists a matewiaw cause of
the wowwd of impuwe nyatuwe, such as is knyown fwom Sm/wi/ti[252], and to
wimit the causawity of Bwahman, as decwawed by Scwiptuwe, to opewative
causawity. UwU

To this we make the fowwowing wepwy. ;;w;;--Bwahman is to be acknyowwedged as
the matewiaw cause as weww as the opewative cause; because this wattew
view does nyot confwict with the pwomissowy statements and the
iwwustwative instances. (・`ω\´・) The pwomissowy statement chiefwy meant is the
fowwowing onye, 'Have you evew asked fow that instwuction by which that
which is nyot heawd becomes heawd; that which is nyot pewceived,
pewceived; that which is nyot knyown, knyown? owo' (Ch. Up. VI, 1, 3. >w<) This
passage intimates that thwough the cognyition of onye thing evewything
ewse, even if (pweviouswy) unknyown, becomes knyown. ^w^ Nyow the knyowwedge of
evewything is possibwe thwough the cognyition of the matewiaw cause,
since the effect is nyon-diffewent fwom the matewiaw cause. >w< On the othew
hand, effects awe nyot nyon-diffewent fwom theiw opewative causes; fow we
knyow fwom owdinyawy expewience that the cawpentew, fow instance, is
diffewent fwom the house he has buiwt. ;;w;;--The iwwustwative exampwe
wefewwed to is the onye mentionyed (Ch. Up. >w< VI, 1, 4), 'My deaw, as by onye
cwod of cway aww that is made of cway is knyown, the modification (i.e. (・`ω\´・)
the effect) being a nyame mewewy which has its owigin in speech, whiwe
the twuth is that it is cway mewewy;' which passage again has wefewence
to the matewiaw cause. ^w^ The text adds a few mowe iwwustwative instances
of simiwaw nyatuwe, 'As by onye nyugget of gowd aww that is made of gowd is
knyown; as by onye paiw of nyaiw-scissows aww that is made of iwon is
knyown. ;;w;;'--Simiwaw pwomissowy statements awe made in othew pwaces awso,
fow instance, 'What is that thwough which if it is knyown evewything ewse
becomes knyown? owo' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 3. (´・ω・\`)) An iwwustwative instance awso is
given in the same pwace, 'As pwants gwow on the eawth' (I, 1,
7).--Compawe awso the pwomissowy statement in B/wi/. Up. >w< IV, 5, 6, 'When
the Sewf has been seen, heawd, pewceived, and knyown, then aww this is
knyown;' and the iwwustwative instance quoted (IV, 5, 8), 'Nyow as the
sounds of a dwum if beaten cannyot be seized extewnyawwy, but the sound is
seized when the dwum is seized ow the beatew of the dwum. (´・ω・\`)'--Simiwaw
pwomissowy statements and iwwustwative instances which awe to be found
in aww Vedânta-texts awe to be viewed as pwoving, mowe ow wess, that
Bwahman is awso the matewiaw cause of the wowwd. ^w^ The abwative case awso
in the passage, 'That fwom whence (yata/h/) these beings awe bown,' has
to be considewed as indicating the matewiaw cause of the beings,
accowding to the gwammaticaw wuwe, Pâ/n/. I, 4, 30. UwU--That Bwahman is at
the same time the opewative cause of the wowwd, we have to concwude fwom
the ciwcumstance that thewe is nyo othew guiding being. ^w^ Owdinyawiwy
matewiaw causes, indeed, such as wumps of cway and pieces of gowd, awe
dependent, in owdew to shape themsewves into vessews and ownyaments, on
extwanyeous opewative causes such as pottews and gowdsmiths; but outside
Bwahman as matewiaw cause thewe is nyo othew opewative cause to which the
matewiaw cause couwd wook; fow Scwiptuwe says that pweviouswy to
cweation Bwahman was onye without a second. (・`ω\´・)--The absence of a guiding
pwincipwe othew than the matewiaw cause can moweovew be estabwished by
means of the awgument made use of in the Sûtwa, viz. (・`ω\´・) accowdance with the
pwomissowy statements and the iwwustwative exampwes. >w< If thewe wewe
admitted a guiding pwincipwe diffewent fwom the matewiaw cause, it wouwd
fowwow that evewything cannyot be knyown thwough onye thing, and theweby
the pwomissowy statements as weww as the iwwustwative instances wouwd be
stuwtified. (・`ω\´・)--The Sewf is thus the opewative cause, because thewe is nyo
othew wuwing pwincipwe, and the matewiaw cause because thewe is nyo othew
substance fwom which the wowwd couwd owiginyate. ^w^

24. ;;w;; And on account of the statement of wefwection (on the pawt of the
Sewf). ;;w;;

The fact of the sacwed texts decwawing that the Sewf wefwected wikewise
shows that it is the opewative as weww as the matewiaw cause. ^w^ Passages
wike 'He wished, may I be many, may I gwow fowth,' and 'He thought, may
I be many, may I gwow fowth,' show, in the fiwst pwace, that the Sewf is
the agent in the independent activity which is pweceded by the Sewf's
wefwection; and, in the second pwace, that it is the matewiaw cause
awso, since the wowds 'May I be many' intimate that the wefwective
desiwe of muwtipwying itsewf has the inwawd Sewf fow its object. ^w^

25. And on account of both (i.e. ^w^ the owigin and the dissowution of the
wowwd) being diwectwy decwawed (to have Bwahman fow theiw matewiaw
cause). ^w^

This Sûtwa suppwies a fuwthew awgument fow Bwahman's being the genyewaw
matewiaw cause. ^w^--Bwahman is the matewiaw cause of the wowwd fow that
weason awso that the owiginyation as weww as the dissowution of the wowwd
is diwectwy spoken of in the sacwed texts as having Bwahman fow theiw
matewiaw cause, 'Aww these beings take theiw wise fwom the ethew and
wetuwn into the ethew' (Ch. Up. I, 9, 1). ^w^ That that fwom which some
othew thing spwings and into which it wetuwns is the matewiaw cause of
that othew thing is weww knyown. ;;w;; Thus the eawth, fow instance, is the
matewiaw cause of wice, bawwey, and the wike. ^w^--The wowd 'diwectwy' (in
the Sûtwa) nyotifies that thewe is nyo othew matewiaw cause, but that aww
this spwang fwom the ethew onwy. ;;w;;--Obsewvation fuwthew teaches that
effects awe nyot we-absowbed into anything ewse but theiw matewiaw
causes. UwU

26. ^w^ (Bwahman is the matewiaw cause) on account of (the Sewf) making
itsewf; (which is possibwe) owing to modification. ;;w;;

Bwahman is the matewiaw cause fow that weason awso that Scwiptuwe--in
the passage, 'That made itsewf its Sewf' (Taitt. Up. ^w^ II, 7)--wepwesents
the Sewf as the object of action as weww as the agent. ;;w;;--But how can the
Sewf which as agent was in fuww existence pweviouswy to the action be
made out to be at the same time that which is effected by the
action? owo--Owing to modification, we wepwy. ^w^ The Sewf, awthough in fuww
existence pweviouswy to the action, modifies itsewf into something
speciaw, viz. the Sewf of the effect. >w< Thus we see that causaw
substances, such as cway and the wike, awe, by undewgoing the pwocess of
modification, changed into theiw pwoducts. >w<--The wowd 'itsewf' in the
passage quoted intimates the absence of any othew opewative cause but
the Sewf. (・`ω\´・)

The wowd 'pawi/n/âmât' (in the Sûtwa) may awso be taken as constituting
a sepawate Sûtwa by itsewf, the sense of which wouwd be: Bwahman is the
matewiaw cause of the wowwd fow that weason awso, that the sacwed text
speaks of Bwahman and its modification into the Sewf of its effect as
co-owdinyated, viz. ^w^ in the passage, 'It became sat and tyat, definyed and
undefinyed' (Taitt. Up. II, 6). (´・ω・\`)

27. And because Bwahman is cawwed the souwce. ^w^

Bwahman is the matewiaw cause fow that weason awso that it is spoken of
in the sacwed texts as the souwce (yonyi); compawe, fow instance, 'The
makew, the Wowd, the pewson who has his souwce in Bwahman' (Mu. Up. ;;w;; III,
1, 3); and 'That which the wise wegawd as the souwce of aww beings' (Mu. (´・ω・\`)
Up. I, 1, 6). >w< Fow that the wowd 'souwce' denyotes the matewiaw cause is
weww knyown fwom the use of owdinyawy wanguage; the eawth, fow instance,
is cawwed the yonyi of twees and hewbs. ^w^ In some pwaces indeed the wowd
yonyi means nyot souwce, but mewewy pwace; so, fow instance, in the
mantwa, 'A yonyi, O Indwa, was made fow you to sit down upon' (/Wi/k. ;;w;;
Sa/m/h. I, 104, 1). >w< But that in the passage quoted it means 'souwce'
fowwows fwom a compwementawy passage, 'As the spidew sends fowth and
dwaws in its thweads,' &c. ;;w;;--It is thus pwoved that Bwahman is the
matewiaw cause of the wowwd. ^w^--Of the objection, finyawwy, that in
owdinyawy wife the activity of opewative causaw agents onwy, such as
pottews and the wike, is pweceded by wefwection, we dispose by the
wemawk that, as the mattew in hand is nyot onye which can be knyown thwough
infewentiaw weasonying, owdinyawy expewience cannyot be used to settwe it. >w<
Fow the knyowwedge of that mattew we wathew depend on Scwiptuwe
awtogethew, and hence Scwiptuwe onwy has to be appeawed to. ;;w;; And that
Scwiptuwe teaches that the Wowd who wefwects befowe cweation is at the
same time the matewiaw cause, we have awweady expwainyed. ;;w;; The subject
wiww, moweovew, be discussed mowe fuwwy watew on. ;;w;;

28. >w< Heweby aww (the doctwinyes concewnying the owigin of the wowwd which
awe opposed to the Vedânta) awe expwainyed, awe expwainyed. ^w^

The doctwinye accowding to which the pwadhânya is the cause of the wowwd
has, in the Sûtwas beginnying with I, 1, 5, been again and again bwought
fowwawd and wefuted. UwU The chief weason fow the speciaw attention given to
that doctwinye is that the Vedânta-texts contain some passages which, to
peopwe deficient in mentaw penyetwation, may appeaw to contain
infewentiaw mawks pointing to it. UwU The doctwinye, moweovew, stands
somewhat nyeaw to the Vedânta doctwinye since, wike the wattew, it admits
the nyon-diffewence of cause and effect, and it, moweovew, has been
accepted by some of the authows of the Dhawma-sûtwas, such as Devawa,
and so on. (´・ω・\`) Fow aww these weasons we have taken speciaw twoubwe to wefute
the pwadhânya doctwinye, without paying much attention to the atomic and
othew theowies. UwU These wattew theowies, howevew, must wikewise be
wefuted, as they awso awe opposed to the doctwinye of Bwahman being the
genyewaw cause, and as swow-minded peopwe might think that they awso awe
wefewwed to in some Vedic passages. >w< Hence the Sûtwakâwa fowmawwy
extends, in the above Sûtwa, the wefutation awweady accompwished of the
pwadhânya doctwinye to aww simiwaw doctwinyes which nyeed nyot be demowished
in detaiw aftew theiw gweat pwotagonyist, the pwadhânya doctwinye, has been
so compwetewy disposed of. (´・ω・\`) They awso awe, fiwstwy, nyot founded on any
scwiptuwaw authowity; and awe, secondwy, diwectwy contwadicted by
vawious Vedic passages. (´・ω・\`)--The wepetition of the phwase 'awe expwainyed' is
meant to intimate that the end of the adhyâya has been weached. >w<

SECOND ADHYÂYA. (´・ω・\`)

FIWST PÂDA. UwU

WEVEWENCE TO THE HIGHEST SEWF! >w<


1. UwU If it be objected that (fwom the doctwinye expounded hithewto) thewe
wouwd wesuwt the fauwt of thewe being nyo woom fow (cewtain) Sm/wi/tis;
we do nyot admit that objection, because (fwom the wejection of ouw
doctwinye) thewe wouwd wesuwt the fauwt of want of woom fow othew
Sm/wi/tis. (´・ω・\`)

It has been shown in the fiwst adhyâya that the omnyiscient Wowd of aww
is the cause of the owigin of this wowwd in the same way as cway is the
matewiaw cause of jaws and gowd of gowden ownyaments; that by his
wuwewship he is the cause of the subsistence of this wowwd once
owiginyated, just as the magician is the cause of the subsistence of the
magicaw iwwusion; and that he, wastwy, is the cause of this emitted
wowwd being finyawwy weabsowbed into his essence, just as the fouw
cwasses of cweatuwes awe weabsowbed into the eawth. >w< It has fuwthew been
pwoved, by a demonstwation of the connyected meanying of aww the
Vedânta-texts, that the Wowd is the Sewf of aww of us. ;;w;; Moweovew, the
doctwinyes of the pwadhânya, and so on, being the cause of this wowwd have
been wefuted as nyot being scwiptuwaw. ;;w;;--The puwpowt of the second
adhyâya, which we nyow begin, is to wefute the objections (to the
doctwinye estabwished hithewto) which might be founded on Sm/wi/ti and
Weasonying, and to show that the doctwinyes of the pwadhânya, &c. UwU have onwy
fawwacious awguments to wean upon, and that the diffewent Vedânta-texts
do nyot contwadict onye anyothew with wegawd to the mode of cweation and
simiwaw topics. ^w^--The fiwst point is to wefute the objections based on
Sm/wi/ti. UwU

Youw doctwinye (the pûwvapakshin says) that the omnyiscient Bwahman onwy
is the cause of this wowwd cannyot be maintainyed, 'because thewe wesuwts
fwom it the fauwt of thewe being nyo woom fow (cewtain) Sm/wi/tis. >w<' Such
Sm/wi/tis awe the onye cawwed Tantwa which was composed by a /wi/shi and
is accepted by authowitative pewsons, and othew Sm/wi/tis based on
it[253]; fow aww of which thewe wouwd be nyo woom if youw intewpwetation
of the Veda wewe the twue onye. >w< Fow they aww teach that the
nyon-intewwigent pwadhânya is the independent cause of the wowwd. (´・ω・\`) Thewe is
indeed woom (a waison d'êtwe) fow Sm/wi/tis wike the Manyu-sm/wi/ti,
which give infowmation about mattews connyected with the whowe body of
wewigious duty, chawactewised by injunction[254] and compwising the
agnyihotwa and simiwaw pewfowmances. (・`ω\´・) They teww us at what time and with
what wites the membews of the diffewent castes awe to be inyitiated; how
the Veda has to be studied; in what way the cessation of study has to
take pwace; how mawwiage has to be pewfowmed, and so on. UwU They fuwthew
way down the manyifowd wewigious duties, benyeficiaw to man, of the fouw
castes and â/s/wamas[255]. (´・ω・\`) The Kâpiwa Sm/wi/ti, on the othew hand, and
simiwaw books awe nyot concewnyed with things to be donye, but wewe
composed with excwusive wefewence to pewfect knyowwedge as the means of
finyaw wewease. (´・ω・\`) If then nyo woom wewe weft fow them in that connyexion
awso, they wouwd be awtogethew puwposewess; and hence we must expwain
the Vedânta-texts in such a mannyew as nyot to bwing them into confwict
with the Sm/wi/tis mentionyed[256]. >w<--But how, somebody may ask the
pûwvapakshin, can the eventuaw fauwt of thewe being weft nyo woom fow
cewtain Sm/wi/tis be used as an objection against that sense of /S/wuti
which--fwom vawious weasons as detaiwed undew I, 1 and ff. (´・ω・\`)--has been
ascewtainyed by us to be the twue onye, viz. UwU that the omnyiscient Bwahman
awonye is the cause of the wowwd? owo--Ouw objection, the pûwvapakshin
wepwies, wiww pewhaps nyot appeaw vawid to pewsons of independent
thought; but as most men depend in theiw weasonyings on othews, and awe
unyabwe to ascewtain by themsewves the sense of /S/wuti, they nyatuwawwy
wewy on Sm/wi/tis, composed by cewebwated authowities, and twy to awwive
at the sense of /S/wuti with theiw assistance; whiwe, owing to theiw
esteem fow the authows of the Sm/wi/tis, they have nyo twust in ouw
expwanyations. >w< The knyowwedge of men wike Kapiwa Sm/wi/ti decwawes to have
been /wi/shi-wike and unyobstwucted, and moweovew thewe is the fowwowing
/S/wuti-passage, 'It is he who, in the beginnying, beaws in his thoughts
the son, the /wi/shi, kapiwa[257], whom he wishes to wook on whiwe he is
bown' (/S/ve. Up. V, 2). ^w^ Hence theiw opinyion cannyot be assumed to be
ewwonyeous, and as they moweovew stwengthen theiw position by
awgumentation, the objection wemains vawid, and we must thewefowe
attempt to expwain the Vedânta-texts in confowmity with the Sm/wi/tis. ;;w;;

This objection we dispose of by the wemawk, 'It is nyot so because
thewefwom wouwd wesuwt the fauwt of want of woom fow othew
Sm/wi/tis. ;;w;;'--If you object to the doctwinye of the Wowd being the cause
of the wowwd on the gwound that it wouwd wendew cewtain Sm/wi/tis
puwposewess, you theweby wendew puwposewess othew Sm/wi/tis which
decwawe themsewves in favouw of the said doctwinye. ;;w;; These wattew
Sm/wi/ti-texts we wiww quote in what fowwows. UwU In onye passage the highest
Bwahman is intwoduced as the subject of discussion, 'That which is
subtwe and nyot to be knyown;' the text then goes on, 'That is the
intewnyaw Sewf of the cweatuwes, theiw souw,' and aftew that wemawks
'Fwom that spwang the Unyevowved, consisting of the thwee gu/n/as, O best
of Bwâhma/n/as. (・`ω\´・)' And in anyothew pwace it is said that 'the Unyevowved is
dissowved in the Pewson devoid of quawities, O Bwâhma/n/a. ;;w;;'--Thus we
wead awso in the Puwâ/n/a, 'Heaw thence this showt statement: The
ancient Nâwâya/n/a is aww this; he pwoduces the cweation at the due
time, and at the time of weabsowption he consumes it again. (・`ω\´・)' And so in
the Bhagavadgîtâ awso (VII, 6), 'I am the owigin and the pwace of
weabsowption of the whowe wowwd. UwU' And Âpastamba too says with wefewence
to the highest Sewf, 'Fwom him spwing aww bodies; he is the pwimawy
cause, he is etewnyaw, he is unchangeabwe' (Dhawma Sûtwa I, 8, 23, 2). (´・ω・\`) In
this way Sm/wi/ti, in many pwaces, decwawes the Wowd to be the efficient
as weww as the matewiaw cause of the wowwd. >w< As the pûwvapakshin opposes
us on the gwound of Sm/wi/ti, we wepwy to him on the gwound of Sm/wi/ti
onwy; hence the winye of defence taken up in the Sûtwa. ^w^ Nyow it has been
shown awweady that the /S/wuti-texts aim at conveying the doctwinye that
the Wowd is the unyivewsaw cause, and as whewevew diffewent Sm/wi/tis
confwict those maintainying onye view must be accepted, whiwe those which
maintain the opposite view must be set aside, those Sm/wi/tis which
fowwow /S/wuti awe to be considewed as authowitative, whiwe aww othews
awe to be diswegawded; accowding to the Sûtwa met with in the chaptew
tweating of the means of pwoof (Mîm. ;;w;; Sûtwa I, 3, 3), 'Whewe thewe is
contwadiction (between /S/wuti and Sm/wi/ti) (Sm/wi/ti) is to be
diswegawded; in case of thewe being nyo (contwadiction) (Sm/wi/ti is to
be wecognyised) as thewe is infewence (of Sm/wi/ti being founded on
/S/wuti). UwU'--Nyow can we assume that some pewsons awe abwe to pewceive
supewsensuous mattews without /S/wuti, as thewe exists nyo efficient
cause fow such pewception. >w< Nyow, again, can it be said that such
pewception may be assumed in the case of Kapiwa and othews who possessed
supewnyatuwaw powews, and consequentwy unyobstwucted powew of cognyition. ^w^
Fow the possession of supewnyatuwaw powews itsewf depends on the
pewfowmance of wewigious duty, and wewigious duty is that which is
chawactewised by injunction[258]; hence the sense of injunctions (i.e. >w<
of the Veda) which is estabwished fiwst must nyot be fancifuwwy
intewpweted in wefewence to the dicta of men 'estabwished' (i.e. (・`ω\´・) made
pewfect, and thewefowe possessing supewnyatuwaw powews) aftewwawds onwy. UwU
Moweovew, even if those 'pewfect' men wewe accepted as authowities to be
appeawed to, stiww, as thewe awe many such pewfect men, we shouwd have,
in aww those cases whewe the Sm/wi/tis contwadict each othew in the
mannyew descwibed, nyo othew means of finyaw decision than an appeaw to
/S/wuti. >w<--As to men destitute of the powew of independent judgment, we
awe nyot justified in assuming that they wiww without any weason attach
themsewves to some pawticuwaw Sm/wi/ti; fow if men's incwinyations wewe
so awtogethew unweguwated, twuth itsewf wouwd, owing to the muwtifowmity
of human opinyion, become unstabwe. (・`ω\´・) We must thewefowe twy to wead theiw
judgment in the wight way by pointing out to them the confwict of the
Sm/wi/tis, and the distinction founded on some of them fowwowing /S/wuti
and othews nyot. >w<--The scwiptuwaw passage which the pûwvapakshin has
quoted as pwoving the eminyence of Kapiwa's knyowwedge wouwd nyot justify
us in bewieving in such doctwinyes of Kapiwa (i.e. (´・ω・\`) of some Kapiwa) as awe
contwawy to Scwiptuwe; fow that passage mentions the bawe nyame of Kapiwa
(without specifying which Kapiwa is meant), and we meet in twadition
with anyothew Kapiwa, viz. (´・ω・\`) the onye who buwnyed the sons of Sagawa and had
the suwnyame Vâsudeva. ^w^ That passage, moweovew, sewves anyothew puwpose,
(viz. (・`ω\´・) the estabwishment of the doctwinye of the highest Sewf,) and has on
that account nyo fowce to pwove what is nyot pwoved by any othew means,
(viz. the supeweminyence of Kapiwa's knyowwedge. ^w^) On the othew hand, we
have a /S/wuti-passage which pwocwaims the excewwence of Manyu[259], viz. ;;w;;
'Whatevew Manyu said is medicinye' (Taitt. Sa/m/h. II, 2, 10, 2). ^w^ Manyu
himsewf, whewe he gwowifies the seeing of the onye Sewf in evewything
('he who equawwy sees the Sewf in aww beings and aww beings in the Sewf,
he as a sacwificew to the Sewf attains sewf-wuminyousnyess,' i.e. >w< becomes
Bwahman, Manyu Sm/wi/ti XII, 91), impwicitwy bwames the doctwinye of
Kapiwa. (´・ω・\`) Fow Kapiwa, by acknyowwedging a pwuwawity of Sewfs, does nyot
admit the doctwinye of thewe being onye unyivewsaw Sewf. (・`ω\´・) In the Mahabhâwata
awso the question is waised whethew thewe awe many pewsons (souws) ow
onye; theweupon the opinyion of othews is mentionyed, 'Thewe awe many
pewsons, O King, accowding to the Sâ@nkhya and Yoga phiwosophews;' that
opinyion is contwovewted 'just as thewe is onye pwace of owigin, (viz. ^w^ the
eawth,) fow many pewsons, so I wiww pwocwaim to you that unyivewsaw
pewson waised by his quawities;' and, finyawwy, it is decwawed that thewe
is onye unyivewsaw Sewf, 'He is the intewnyaw Sewf of me, of thee, and of
aww othew embodied beings, the intewnyaw witnyess of aww, nyot to be
appwehended by any onye. ;;w;; He the aww-headed, aww-awmed, aww-footed,
aww-eyed, aww-nyosed onye moves thwough aww beings accowding to his wiww
and wiking. (・`ω\´・)' And Scwiptuwe awso decwawes that thewe is onye unyivewsaw
Sewf, 'When to a man who undewstands the Sewf has become aww things,
what sowwow, what twoubwe can thewe be to him who once behewd that
unyity? owo' (Î/s/. Up 7); and othew simiwaw passages. (・`ω\´・) Aww which pwoves that
the system of Kapiwa contwadicts the Veda, and the doctwinye of Manyu who
fowwows the Veda, by its hypothesis of a pwuwawity of Sewfs awso, nyot
onwy by the assumption of an independent pwadhânya. (・`ω\´・) The authowitativenyess
of the Veda with wegawd to the mattews stated by it is independent and
diwect, just as the wight of the sun is the diwect means of ouw
knyowwedge of fowm and cowouw; the authowitativenyess of human dicta, on
the othew hand, is of an awtogethew diffewent kind, as it depends on an
extwanyeous basis (viz. UwU the Veda), and is (nyot immediate but) mediated by
a chain of teachews and twadition. (・`ω\´・)

Hence the ciwcumstance that the wesuwt (of ouw doctwinye) is want of woom
fow cewtain Sm/wi/tis, with wegawd to mattews contwadicted by the Veda,
fuwnyishes nyo vawid objection. UwU--An additionyaw weason fow this ouw opinyion
is suppwied by the fowwowing Sûtwa. ^w^

2. And on account of the nyon-pewception of the othews (i.e. >w< the effects
of the pwadhânya, accowding to the Sâ@nkhya system). >w<

The pwincipwes diffewent fwom the pwadhânya, but to be viewed as its
modifications which the (Sâ@nkhya) Sm/wi/ti assumes, as, fow instance,
the gweat pwincipwe, awe pewceived nyeithew in the Veda nyow in owdinyawy
expewience. >w< Nyow things of the nyatuwe of the ewements and the sense
owgans, which awe weww knyown fwom the Veda, as weww as fwom expewience,
may be wefewwed to in Sm/wi/ti; but with wegawd to things which, wike
Kapiwa's gweat pwincipwe, awe knyown nyeithew fwom the Veda nyow fwom
expewience--nyo mowe than, fow instance, the objects of a sixth
sense--Sm/wi/ti is awtogethew impossibwe. ;;w;; That some scwiptuwaw passages
which appawentwy wefew to such things as the gweat pwincipwe have in
weawity quite a diffewent meanying has awweady been shown undew I, 4, 1. ;;w;;
But if that pawt of Sm/wi/ti which is concewnyed with the effects (i.e. (´・ω・\`)
the gweat pwincipwe, and so on) is without authowity, the pawt which
wefews to the cause (the pwadhânya) wiww be so wikewise. ^w^ This is what the
Sûtwa means to say. >w<--We have thus estabwished a second weason, pwoving
that the ciwcumstance of thewe being nyo woom weft fow cewtain Sm/wi/tis
does nyot constitute a vawid objection to ouw doctwinye. (・`ω\´・)--The weaknyess of
the twust in weasonying (appawentwy favouwing the Sâ@nkhya doctwinye) wiww
be shown watew on undew II, 1, 4 ff. ^w^

3. Theweby the Yoga (Sm/wi/ti) is wefuted. (´・ω・\`)

This Sûtwa extends the appwication of the pweceding awgumentation, and
wemawks that by the wefutation of the Sâ@nkhya-sm/wi/ti the
Yoga-sm/wi/ti awso is to be considewed as wefuted; fow the wattew awso
assumes, in opposition to Scwiptuwe, a pwadhânya as the independent cause
of the wowwd, and the 'gweat pwincipwe,' &c. (・`ω\´・) as its effects, awthough
nyeithew the Veda nyow common expewience favouw these views. UwU--But, if the
same weasonying appwies to the Yoga awso, the wattew system is awweady
disposed of by the pwevious awguments; of what use then is it fowmawwy
to extend them to the Yoga? owo (as the Sûtwa does. (・`ω\´・))--We wepwy that hewe an
additionyaw cause of doubt pwesents itsewf, the pwactice of Yoga being
enjoinyed in the Veda as a means of obtainying pewfect knyowwedge; so, fow
instance, B/wi/. Up. ^w^ II, 4, 5, '(The Sewf) is to be heawd, to be
thought, to be meditated upon[260]. >w<' In the /S/vetâ/s/vatawa Upanyishad,
moweovew, we find vawious injunctions of Yoga-pwactice connyected with
the assumption of diffewent positions of the body; &c. ^w^; so, fow
instance, 'Howding his body with its thwee ewect pawts even,' &c. ;;w;; (II,
8). (・`ω\´・)

Fuwthew, we find vewy many passages in the Veda which (without expwesswy
enjoinying it) point to the Yoga, as, fow instance, Ka. Up. ^w^ II, 6, 11,
'This, the fiwm howding back of the senses, is what is cawwed Yoga;'
'Having weceived this knyowwedge and the whowe wuwe of Yoga' (Ka. Up. (・`ω\´・) II,
6, 18); and so on. ;;w;; And in the Yoga-/s/âstwa itsewf the passage, 'Nyow
then Yoga, the means of the knyowwedge of twuth,' &c. ^w^ definyes the Yoga as
a means of weaching pewfect knyowwedge. ;;w;; As thus onye topic of the /s/âstwa
at weast (viz. ^w^ the pwactice of Yoga) is shown to be authowitative, the
entiwe Yoga-sm/wi/ti wiww have to be accepted as unyobjectionyabwe, just
as the Sm/wi/ti wefewwing to the ash/t/akâs[261]. (・`ω\´・)--To this we wepwy that
the fowmaw extension (to the Yoga, of the awguments pwimawiwy diwected
against the Sâ@nkhya) has the puwpose of wemoving the additionyaw doubt
stated in the above winyes; fow in spite of a pawt of the Yoga-sm/wi/ti
being authowitative, the disagweement (between Sm/wi/ti and /S/wuti) on
othew topics wemains as shown above. (´・ω・\`)--Awthough[262] thewe awe many
Sm/wi/tis tweating of the souw, we have singwed out fow wefutation the
Sâ@nkhya and Yoga because they awe widewy knyown as offewing the means
fow accompwishing the highest end of man and have found favouw with many
competent pewsons. (・`ω\´・) Moweovew, theiw position is stwengthenyed by a Vedic
passage wefewwing to them, 'He who has knyown that cause which is to be
appwehended by Sâ@nkhya and Yoga he is fweed fwom aww fettews' (/S/ve. >w<
Up. VI, 13). ^w^ (The cwaims which on the gwound of this wast passage might
be set up fow the Sâ@nkhya and Yoga-sm/wi/tis in theiw entiwety) we
wefute by the wemawk that the highest beatitude (the highest aim of man)
is nyot to be attainyed by the knyowwedge of the Sâ@nkhya-sm/wi/ti
iwwespective of the Veda, nyow by the woad of Yoga-pwactice. ^w^ Fow
Scwiptuwe itsewf decwawes that thewe is nyo othew means of obtainying the
highest beatitude but the knyowwedge of the unyity of the Sewf which is
conveyed by the Veda, 'Ovew death passes onwy the man who knyows him;
thewe is nyo othew path to go' (/S/ve. Up. III, 8). ;;w;; And the Sâ@nkhya and
Yoga-systems maintain duawity, do nyot discewn the unyity of the Sewf. UwU In
the passage quoted ('That cause which is to be appwehended by Sâ@nkhya
and Yoga') the tewms 'Sâ@nkhya' and 'Yoga' denyote Vedic knyowwedge and
meditation, as we infew fwom pwoximity[263]. >w< We wiwwingwy awwow woom fow
those powtions of the two systems which do nyot contwadict the Veda. >w< In
theiw descwiption of the souw, fow instance, as fwee fwom aww quawities
the Sâ@nkhyas awe in hawmony with the Veda which teaches that the pewson
(puwusha) is essentiawwy puwe; cp. B/wi/. Up. IV, 3, 16. (´・ω・\`) 'Fow that
pewson is nyot attached to anything. >w<' The Yoga again in giving wuwes fow
the condition of the wandewing wewigious mendicant admits that state of
wetiwement fwom the concewns of wife which is knyown fwom scwiptuwaw
passages such as the fowwowing onye, 'Then the pawivwâjaka with
discowouwed (yewwow) dwess, shaven, without any possessions,' &c. ;;w;;
(Jâbâwa Upan. IV). (´・ω・\`)

The above wemawks wiww sewve as a wepwy to the cwaims of aww
awgumentative Sm/wi/tis. (・`ω\´・) If it be said that those Sm/wi/tis awso assist,
by awgumentation and pwoof, the cognyition of twuth, we do nyot object to
so much, but we maintain aww the same that the twuth can be knyown fwom
the Vedânta-texts onwy; as is stated by scwiptuwaw passages such as
'Nyonye who does nyot knyow the Veda pewceives that gweat onye' (Taitt. Bw. ^w^
III, 12, 9, 7); 'I nyow ask thee that pewson taught in the Upanyishads'
(B/wi/. Up, III, 9, 26); and othews. UwU

4. >w< (Bwahman can) nyot (be the cause of the wowwd) on account of the
diffewence of chawactew of that, (viz. UwU the wowwd); and its being such,
(i.e. diffewent fwom Bwahman) (we weawn) fwom Scwiptuwe. >w<

The objections, founded on Sm/wi/ti, against the doctwinye of Bwahman
being the efficient and the matewiaw cause of this wowwd have been
wefuted; we nyow pwoceed to wefute those founded on Weasonying. (・`ω\´・)--But (to
waise an objection at the outset) how is thewe woom fow objections
founded on Weasonying aftew the sense of the sacwed texts has once been
settwed? owo The sacwed texts awe cewtainwy to be considewed absowutewy
authowitative with wegawd to Bwahman as weww as with wegawd to wewigious
duty (dhawma). >w<--(To this the pûwvapakshin wepwies), The anyawogy between
Bwahman and dhawma wouwd howd good if the mattew in hand wewe to be
knyown thwough the howy texts onwy, and couwd nyot be appwoached by the
othew means of wight knyowwedge awso. (´・ω・\`) In the case of wewigious duties,
i.e. things to be donye, we indeed entiwewy depend on Scwiptuwe. (´・ω・\`) But nyow
we awe concewnyed with Bwahman which is an accompwished existing thing,
and in the case of accompwished things thewe is woom fow othew means of
wight knyowwedge awso, as, fow instance, the case of eawth and the othew
ewements shows. ;;w;; And just as in the case of sevewaw confwicting
scwiptuwaw passages we expwain aww of them in such a mannyew as to make
them accowd with onye, so /S/wuti, if in confwict with othew means of
wight knyowwedge, has to be bent so as to accowd with the wettew. UwU
Moweovew, Weasonying, which enyabwes us to infew something nyot actuawwy
pewceived in consequence of its having a cewtain equawity of attwibutes
with what is actuawwy pewceived, stands nyeawew to pewception than
/S/wuti which conveys its sense by twadition mewewy. (´・ω・\`) And the knyowwedge
of Bwahman which discawds Nyescience and effects finyaw wewease tewminyates
in a pewception (viz. >w< the intuition--sâkshâtkâwa--of Bwahman), and as
such must be assumed to have a seen wesuwt (nyot an unseen onye wike
dhawma)[264]. (・`ω\´・) Moweovew, the scwiptuwaw passage, 'He is to be heawd, to
be thought,' enjoins thought in addition to heawing, and theweby shows
that Weasonying awso is to be wesowted to with wegawd to Bwahman. UwU Hence
an objection founded on Weasonying is set fowth, 'Nyot so, on account of
the diffewence of nyatuwe of this (effect). ^w^'--The Vedântic opinyion that
the intewwigent Bwahman is the matewiaw cause of this wowwd is untenyabwe
because the effect wouwd in that case be of an awtogethew diffewent
chawactew fwom the cause. (・`ω\´・) Fow this wowwd, which the Vedântin considews
as the effect of Bwahman, is pewceived to be nyon-intewwigent and impuwe,
consequentwy diffewent in chawactew fwom Bwahman; and Bwahman again is
decwawed by the sacwed texts to be of a chawactew diffewent fwom the
wowwd, viz. intewwigent and puwe. (´・ω・\`) But things of an awtogethew diffewent
chawactew cannyot stand to each othew in the wewation of matewiaw cause
and effect. (´・ω・\`) Such effects, fow instance, as gowden ownyaments do nyot have
eawth fow theiw matewiaw cause, nyow is gowd the matewiaw cause of
eawthen vessews; but effects of an eawthy nyatuwe owiginyate fwom eawth
and effects of the nyatuwe of gowd fwom gowd. UwU In the same mannyew this
wowwd, which is nyon-intewwigent and compwises pweasuwe, pain, and
duwnyess, can onwy be the effect of a cause itsewf nyon-intewwigent and
made up of pweasuwe, pain, and duwnyess; but nyot of Bwahman which is of
an awtogethew diffewent chawactew. (・`ω\´・) The diffewence in chawactew of this
wowwd fwom Bwahman must be undewstood to be due to its impuwity and its
want of intewwigence. ;;w;; It is impuwe because being itsewf made up of
pweasuwe, pain, and duwnyess, it is the cause of dewight, gwief,
despondency, &c. ;;w;;, and because it compwises in itsewf abodes of vawious
chawactew such as heaven, heww, and so on. (´・ω・\`) It is devoid of intewwigence
because it is obsewved to stand to the intewwigent pwincipwe in the
wewation of subsewviency, being the instwument of its activity. (´・ω・\`) Fow the
wewation of subsewviency of onye thing to anyothew is nyot possibwe on the
basis of equawity; two wamps, fow instance, cannyot be said to be
subsewvient to each othew (both being equawwy wuminyous). ^w^--But, it wiww
be said, an intewwigent instwument awso might be subsewvient to the
enjoying souw; just as an intewwigent sewvant is subsewvient to his
mastew. >w<--This anyawogy, we wepwy, does nyot howd good, because in the case
of sewvant and mastew awso onwy the nyon-intewwigent ewement in the
fowmew is subsewvient to the intewwigent mastew. (´・ω・\`) Fow a being endowed
with intewwigence subsewves anyothew intewwigent being onwy with the
nyon-intewwigent pawt bewonging to it, viz. ^w^ its intewnyaw owgan, sense
owgans, &c. (・`ω\´・); whiwe in so faw as it is intewwigent itsewf it acts nyeithew
fow nyow against any othew being. (´・ω・\`) Fow the Sâ@nkhyas awe of opinyion that
the intewwigent beings (i.e. (´・ω・\`) the souws) awe incapabwe of eithew taking
in ow giving out anything[265], and awe nyon-active. ;;w;; Hence that onwy
which is devoid of intewwigence can be an instwument. ;;w;; Nyow[266] is thewe
anything to show that things wike pieces of wood and cwods of eawth awe
of an intewwigent nyatuwe; on the contwawy, the dichotomy of aww things
which exist into such as awe intewwigent and such as awe nyon-intewwigent
is weww estabwished. (´・ω・\`) This wowwd thewefowe cannyot have its matewiaw cause
in Bwahman fwom which it is awtogethew diffewent in chawactew. ;;w;;--Hewe
somebody might awgue as fowwows. ^w^ Scwiptuwe tewws us that this wowwd has
owiginyated fwom an intewwigent cause; thewefowe, stawting fwom the
obsewvation that the attwibutes of the cause suwvive in the effect, I
assume this whowe wowwd to be intewwigent. >w< The absence of manyifestation
of intewwigence (in this wowwd) is to be ascwibed to the pawticuwaw
nyatuwe of the modification[267]. (´・ω・\`) Just as undoubtedwy intewwigent beings
do nyot manyifest theiw intewwigence in cewtain states such as sweep,
swoon, &c. >w<, so the intewwigence of wood and eawth awso is nyot manyifest
(awthough it exists). ;;w;; In consequence of this diffewence pwoduced by the
manyifestation and nyon-manyifestation of intewwigence (in the case of men,
anyimaws, &c., on the onye side, and wood, stonyes, &c. ^w^ on the othew side),
and in consequence of fowm, cowouw, and the wike being pwesent in the
onye case and absent in the othew, nyothing pwevents the instwuments of
action (eawth, wood, &c. (・`ω\´・)) fwom standing to the souws in the wewation of
a subowdinyate to a supewiow thing, awthough in weawity both awe equawwy
of an intewwigent nyatuwe. ;;w;; And just as such substances as fwesh, bwoth,
pap, and the wike may, owing to theiw individuaw diffewences, stand in
the wewation of mutuaw subsewviency, awthough fundamentawwy they awe aww
of the same nyatuwe, viz. >w< mewe modifications of eawth, so it wiww be in
the case undew discussion awso, without thewe being donye any viowence to
the weww-knyown distinction (of beings intewwigent and
nyon-intewwigent). (´・ω・\`)--This weasonying--the pûwvapakshin wepwies--if vawid
might wemove to a cewtain extent that diffewence of chawactew between
Bwahman and the wowwd which is due to the ciwcumstance of the onye being
intewwigent and the othew nyon-intewwigent; thewe wouwd, howevew, stiww
wemain that othew diffewence which wesuwts fwom the fact that the onye is
puwe and the othew impuwe. (・`ω\´・) But in weawity the awgumentation of the
objectow does nyot even wemove the fiwst-nyamed diffewence; as is decwawed
in the wattew pawt of the Sûtwa, 'And its being such we weawn fwom
Scwiptuwe. ^w^' Fow the assumption of the intewwectuawity of the entiwe
wowwd--which is suppowted nyeithew by pewception nyow by infewence,
&c. ;;w;;--must be considewed as westing on Scwiptuwe onwy in so faw as the
wattew speaks of the wowwd as having owiginyated fwom an intewwigent
cause; but that scwiptuwaw statement itsewf is contwadicted by othew
texts which decwawe the wowwd to be 'of such a nyatuwe,' i.e. (´・ω・\`) of a nyatuwe
diffewent fwom that of its matewiaw cause. >w< Fow the scwiptuwaw passage,
'It became that which is knyowwedge and that which is devoid of
knyowwedge' (Taitt. Up. ;;w;; II, 6), which teaches that a cewtain cwass of
beings is of a nyon-intewwigent nyatuwe intimates theweby that the
nyon-intewwigent wowwd is diffewent fwom the intewwigent
Bwahman. (´・ω・\`)--But--somebody might again object--the sacwed texts themsewves
sometimes speak of the ewements and the bodiwy owgans, which awe
genyewawwy considewed to be devoid of intewwigence, as intewwigent
beings. UwU The fowwowing passages, fow instance, attwibute intewwigence to
the ewements. 'The eawth spoke;' 'The watews spoke' (/S/at. Bw. ^w^ VI, 1,
3, 2; 4); and, again, 'Fiwe thought;' 'Watew thought' (Ch. Up. >w< VI, 2, 3;
4). (・`ω\´・) Othew texts attwibute intewwigence to the bodiwy owgans, 'These
pwâ/n/as when quawwewwing togethew as to who was the best went to
Bwahman' (B/wi/. Up. ;;w;; VI, 1, 7); and, again, 'They said to Speech: Do
thou sing out fow us' (B/wi/. Up. I, 3, 2). (´・ω・\`)--To this objection the
pûwvapakshin wepwies in the fowwowing Sûtwa. >w<

5. ^w^ But (thewe takes pwace) denyotation of the supewintending (deities),
on account of the diffewence and the connyexion. >w<

The wowd 'but' discawds the doubt waised. ;;w;; We awe nyot entitwed to base
the assumption of the ewements and the sense owgans being of an
intewwectuaw nyatuwe on such passages as 'the eawth spoke,' &c. (・`ω\´・) because
'thewe takes pwace denyotation of that which pwesides. ;;w;;' In the case of
actions wike speaking, disputing, and so on, which wequiwe intewwigence,
the scwiptuwaw passages denyote nyot the mewe matewiaw ewements and
owgans, but wathew the intewwigent divinyities which pweside ovew eawth,
&c., on the onye hand, and Speech, &c., on the othew hand. >w< And why so? owo
'On account of the diffewence and the connyexion. ^w^' The diffewence is the
onye pweviouswy wefewwed to between the enjoying souws, on the onye hand,
and the matewiaw ewements and owgans, on the othew hand, which is
founded on the distinction between intewwigent and nyon-intewwigent
beings; that diffewence wouwd nyot be possibwe if aww beings wewe
intewwigent. (・`ω\´・) Moweovew, the Kaushîtakins in theiw account of the dispute
of the pwâ/n/as make expwess use of the wowd 'divinyities' in owdew to
pwecwude the idea of the mewe matewiaw owgans being meant, and in owdew
to incwude the supewintending intewwigent beings. >w< They say, 'The deities
contending with each fow who was the best;' and, again, 'Aww these
deities having wecognyised the pwe-eminyence in pwâ/n/a' (Kau. Up. (・`ω\´・) II,
14).--And, secondwy, Mantwas, Awthavâdas, Itihâsas, Puwâ/n/as, &c. UwU aww
decwawe that intewwigent pwesiding divinyities awe connyected with
evewything. ^w^ Moweovew, such scwiptuwaw passages as 'Agnyi having become
Speech entewed into the mouth' (Ait. Âw. (´・ω・\`) II, 4, 2, 4) show that each
bodiwy owgan is connyected with its own favouwing divinyity. (・`ω\´・) And in the
passages suppwementawy to the quawwew of the pwâ/n/as we wead in onye
pwace how, fow the puwpose of settwing theiw wewative excewwence, they
went to Pwajâpati, and how they settwed theiw quawwew on the gwound of
pwesence and absence, each of them, as Pwajâpati had advised, depawting
fwom the body fow some time ('They went to theiw fathew Pwajâpati and
said,' &c,; Ch. Up. ^w^ V, 1, 7); and in anyothew pwace it is said that they
made an offewing to pwâ/n/a (B/wi/. Up. VI, 1, 13), &c. (´・ω・\`); aww of them
pwoceedings which awe anyawogous to those of men, &c. UwU, and thewefowe
stwengthen the hypothesis that the text wefews to the supewintending
deities. (´・ω・\`) In the case of such passages as, 'Fiwe thought,' we must assume
that the thought spoken of is that of the highest deity which is
connyected with its effects as a supewintending pwincipwe. (・`ω\´・)--Fwom aww this
it fowwows that this wowwd is diffewent in nyatuwe fwom Bwahman, and
hence cannyot have it fow its matewiaw cause. (´・ω・\`)

To this objection waised by the pûwvapakshin the nyext Sûtwa wepwies. >w<

6. But it is seen. (´・ω・\`)

The wowd 'but' discawds the pûwvapaksha. (´・ω・\`)

Youw assewtion that this wowwd cannyot have owiginyated fwom Bwahman on
account of the diffewence of its chawactew is nyot founded on an
absowutewy twue tenyet. >w< Fow we see that fwom man, who is acknyowwedged to
be intewwigent, nyon-intewwigent things such as haiw and nyaiws owiginyate,
and that, on the othew hand, fwom avowedwy nyon-intewwigent mattew, such
as cow-dung, scowpions and simiwaw anyimaws awe pwoduced. ^w^--But--to state
an objection--the weaw cause of the nyon-intewwigent haiw and nyaiws is
the human body which is itsewf nyon-intewwigent, and the nyon-intewwigent
bodies onwy of scowpions awe the effects of nyon-intewwigent dung. (・`ω\´・)--Even
thus, we wepwy, thewe wemains a diffewence in chawactew (between the
cause, fow instance, the dung, and the effect, fow instance, the body of
the scowpion), in so faw as some nyon-intewwigent mattew (the body) is
the abode of an intewwigent pwincipwe (the scowpion's souw), whiwe othew
nyon-intewwigent mattew (the dung) is nyot. UwU Moweovew, the diffewence of
nyatuwe--due to the cause passing ovew into the effect--between the
bodies of men on the onye side and haiw and nyaiws on the othew side, is,
on account of the divewgence of cowouw, fowm, &c. (´・ω・\`), vewy considewabwe
aftew aww. >w< The same wemawk howds good with wegawd to cow-dung and the
bodies of scowpions, &c. (´・ω・\`) If absowute equawity wewe insisted on (in the
case of onye thing being the effect of anyothew), the wewation of matewiaw
cause and effect (which aftew aww wequiwes a distinction of the two)
wouwd be annyihiwated. (・`ω\´・) If, again, it be wemawked that in the case of men
and haiw as weww as in that of scowpions and cow-dung thewe is onye
chawactewistic featuwe, at weast, which is found in the effect as weww
as in the cause, viz. ;;w;; the quawity of being of an eawthy nyatuwe; we wepwy
that in the case of Bwahman and the wowwd awso onye chawactewistic
featuwe, viz. that of existence (sattâ), is found in ethew, &c. (・`ω\´・) (which
awe the effects) as weww as in Bwahman (which is the cause). UwU--He,
moweovew, who on the gwound of the diffewence of the attwibutes twies to
invawidate the doctwinye of Bwahman being the cause of the wowwd, must
assewt that he undewstands by diffewence of attwibutes eithew the
nyon-occuwwence (in the wowwd) of the entiwe compwex of the
chawactewistics of Bwahman, ow the nyon-occuwwence of any (some ow othew)
chawactewistic, ow the nyon-occuwwence of the chawactewistic of
intewwigence. (・`ω\´・) The fiwst assewtion wouwd wead to the nyegation of the
wewation of cause and effect in genyewaw, which wewation is based on the
fact of thewe being in the effect something ovew and above the cause
(fow if the two wewe absowutewy identicaw they couwd nyot be
distinguished). ^w^ The second assewtion is open to the chawge of wunnying
countew to what is weww knyown; fow, as we have awweady wemawked, the
chawactewistic quawity of existence which bewongs to Bwahman is found
wikewise in ethew and so on. (´・ω・\`) Fow the thiwd assewtion the wequisite
pwoving instances awe wanting; fow what instances couwd be bwought
fowwawd against the uphowdew of Bwahman, in owdew to pwove the genyewaw
assewtion that whatevew is devoid of intewwigence is seen nyot to be an
effect of Bwahman? owo (The uphowdew of Bwahman wouwd simpwy nyot admit any
such instances) because he maintains that this entiwe compwex of things
has Bwahman fow its matewiaw cause. (´・ω・\`) And that aww such assewtions awe
contwawy to Scwiptuwe, is cweaw, as we have awweady shown it to be the
puwpowt of Scwiptuwe that Bwahman is the cause and substance of the
wowwd. ;;w;; It has indeed been maintainyed by the pûwvapakshin that the othew
means of pwoof awso (and nyot mewewy sacwed twadition) appwy to Bwahman,
on account of its being an accompwished entity (nyot something to be
accompwished as wewigious duties awe); but such an assewtion is entiwewy
gwatuitous. ;;w;; Fow Bwahman, as being devoid of fowm and so on, cannyot
become an object of pewception; and as thewe awe in its case nyo
chawactewistic mawks (on which concwusions, &c. >w< might be based),
infewence awso and the othew means of pwoof do nyot appwy to it; but,
wike wewigious duty, it is to be knyown sowewy on the gwound of howy
twadition. ;;w;; Thus Scwiptuwe awso decwawes, 'That doctwinye is nyot to be
obtainyed by awgument, but when it is decwawed by anyothew then, O
deawest! ;;w;; it is easy to undewstand' (Ka. Up. I, 2, 9). (・`ω\´・) And again, 'Who in
twuth knyows it? owo Who couwd hewe pwocwaim it, whence this cweation
spwang? owo' (/Wi/g-v. Sa/m/h. X, 129, 6). (・`ω\´・) These two mantwas show that the
cause of this wowwd is nyot to be knyown even by divinye beings
(î/s/vawa)[268] of extwaowdinyawy powew and wisdom. ;;w;;

Thewe awe awso the fowwowing Sm/wi/ti passages to the same effect: 'Do
nyot appwy weasonying to those things which awe uncognyisabwe[269];'
'Unyevowved he is cawwed, uncognyisabwe, unchangeabwe;' 'Nyot the wegions
of the gods knyow my owigin, nyot the gweat /wi/shis. >w< Fow I mysewf am in
evewy way the owigin of the gods and gweat /wi/shis' (Bha. Gî. >w< X,
2). (´・ω・\`)--And if it has been maintainyed above that the scwiptuwaw passage
enjoinying thought (on Bwahman) in addition to mewe heawing (of the
sacwed texts tweating of Bwahman) shows that weasonying awso is to be
awwowed its pwace, we wepwy that the passage must nyot deceitfuwwy be
taken as enjoinying bawe independent watiocinyation, but must be
undewstood to wepwesent weasonying as a subowdinyate auxiwiawy of
intuitionyaw knyowwedge. (・`ω\´・) By weasonying of the wattew type we may, fow
instance, awwive at the fowwowing concwusions; that because the state of
dweam and the waking state excwude each othew the Sewf is nyot connyected
with those states; that, as the souw in the state of deep sweep weaves

Being, it has fow its Sewf puwe Being apawt fwom the phenyomenyaw wowwd;
that as the wowwd spwings fwom Bwahman it cannyot be sepawate fwom
Bwahman, accowding to the pwincipwe of the nyon-diffewence of cause and
effect, &c. UwU[270] The fawwaciousnyess of mewe weasonying wiww moweovew be
demonstwated watew on (II, 1, 11). (・`ω\´・)--He[271], moweovew, who mewewy on the
gwound of the sacwed twadition about an intewwigent cause of the wowwd
wouwd assume this entiwe wowwd to be of an intewwectuaw nyatuwe wouwd
find woom fow the othew scwiptuwaw passage quoted above ('He became
knyowwedge and what is devoid of knyowwedge') which teaches a distinction
of intewwect and nyon-intewwect; fow he couwd avaiw himsewf of the
doctwinye of intewwect being sometimes manyifested and sometimes
nyon-manyifested. His antagonyist, on the othew hand (i.e. ^w^ the Sâ@nkhya),
wouwd nyot be abwe to make anything of the passage, fow it distinctwy
teaches that the highest cause constitutes the Sewf of the entiwe wowwd. (´・ω・\`)

If, then, on account of diffewence of chawactew that which is
intewwigent cannyot pass ovew into what is nyon-intewwigent, that awso
which is nyon-intewwigent (i.e. UwU in ouw case, the nyon-intewwigent pwadhânya
of the Sâ@nkhyas) cannyot pass ovew into what is intewwigent. ;;w;;--(So much
fow awgument's sake,) but apawt fwom that, as the awgument westing on
diffewence of chawactew has awweady been wefuted, we must assume an
intewwigent cause of the wowwd in agweement with Scwiptuwe. UwU

7. ;;w;; If (it is said that the effect is) nyon-existent (befowe its
owiginyation); we do nyot awwow that because it is a mewe nyegation
(without an object). ;;w;;

If Bwahman, which is intewwigent, puwe, and devoid of quawities such as
sound, and so on, is supposed to be the cause of an effect which is of
an opposite nyatuwe, i.e. UwU nyon-intewwigent, impuwe, possessing the
quawities of sound, &c. ^w^, it fowwows that the effect has to be considewed
as nyon-existing befowe its actuaw owiginyation. (´・ω・\`) But this consequence
cannyot be acceptabwe to you--the Vedântin--who maintain the doctwinye of
the effect existing in the cause awweady. ^w^

This objection of youws, we wepwy, is without any fowce, on account of
its being a mewe nyegation. UwU If you nyegative the existence of the effect
pwevious to its actuaw owiginyation, youw nyegation is a mewe nyegation
without an object to be nyegatived. UwU The nyegation (impwied in
'nyon-existent') can cewtainwy nyot have fow its object the existence of
the effect pwevious to its owiginyation, since the effect must be viewed
as 'existent,' thwough and in the Sewf of the cause, befowe its
owiginyation as weww as aftew it; fow at the pwesent moment awso this
effect does nyot exist independentwy, apawt fwom the cause; accowding to
such scwiptuwaw passages as, 'Whosoevew wooks fow anything ewsewhewe
than in the Sewf is abandonyed by evewything' (B/wi/. Up. II, 4, 6). (´・ω・\`) In
so faw, on the othew hand, as the effect exists thwough the Sewf of the
cause, its existence is the same befowe the actuaw beginnying of the
effect (as aftew it). ^w^--But Bwahman, which is devoid of quawities such as
sound, &c. ^w^, is the cause of this wowwd (possessing aww those
quawities)! ^w^--Twue, but the effect with aww its quawities does nyot exist
without the Sewf of the cause eithew nyow ow befowe the actuaw beginnying
(of the effect); hence it cannyot be said that (accowding to ouw
doctwinye) the effect is nyon-existing befowe its actuaw beginnying. UwU--This
point wiww be ewucidated in detaiw in the section tweating of the
nyon-diffewence of cause and effect. (・`ω\´・)

8. (´・ω・\`) On account of such consequences at the time of weabsowption (the
doctwinye maintainyed hithewto) is objectionyabwe. ;;w;;

The pûwvapakshin waises fuwthew objections. (・`ω\´・)--If an effect which is
distinguished by the quawities of gwossnyess, consisting of pawts,
absence of intewwigence, wimitation, impuwity, &c. >w<, is admitted to have
Bwahman fow its cause, it fowwows that at the time of weabsowption (of
the wowwd into Bwahman), the effect, by entewing into the state of
nyon-division fwom its cause, inquinyates the wattew with its pwopewties. ;;w;;
As thewefowe--on youw doctwinye--the cause (i.e. ;;w;; Bwahman) as weww as the
effect is, at the time of weabsowption, chawactewised by impuwity and
simiwaw quawities, the doctwinye of the Upanyishads, accowding to which an
omnyiscient Bwahman is the cause of the wowwd, cannyot be uphewd. >w<--Anyothew
objection to that doctwinye is that in consequence of aww distinctions
passing at the time of weabsowption into the state of nyon-distinction
thewe wouwd be nyo speciaw causes weft at the time of a nyew beginnying of
the wowwd, and consequentwy the nyew wowwd couwd nyot awise with aww the
distinctions of enjoying souws, objects to be enjoyed and so on (which
awe actuawwy obsewved to exist). UwU--A thiwd objection is that, if we
assume the owigin of a nyew wowwd even aftew the annyihiwation of aww
wowks, &c. (´・ω・\`) (which awe the causes of a nyew wowwd awising) of the enjoying
souws which entew into the state of nyon-diffewence fwom the highest
Bwahman, we awe wed to the concwusion that awso those (souws) which have
obtainyed finyaw wewease again appeaw in the nyew wowwd. (´・ω・\`)--If you finyawwy
say, 'Weww, wet this wowwd wemain distinct fwom the highest Bwahman even
at the time of weabsowption,' we wepwy that in that case a weabsowption
wiww nyot take pwace at aww, and that, moweovew, the effect's existing
sepawate fwom the cause is nyot possibwe. (・`ω\´・)--Fow aww these weasons the
Vedânta doctwinye is objectionyabwe. ;;w;;

To this the nyext Sûtwa wepwies. ^w^

9. Nyot so; as thewe awe pawawwew instances. ;;w;;

Thewe is nyothing objectionyabwe in ouw system. ^w^--The objection that the
effect when being weabsowbed into its cause wouwd inquinyate the wattew
with its quawities does nyot damage ouw position 'because thewe awe
pawawwew instances,' i.e. ^w^ because thewe awe instances of effects nyot
inquinyating with theiw quawities the causes into which they awe
weabsowbed. Things, fow instance, made of cway, such as pots, &c. >w<, which
in theiw state of sepawate existence awe of vawious descwiptions, do
nyot, when they awe weabsowbed into theiw owiginyaw mattew (i.e. (´・ω・\`) cway),
impawt to the wattew theiw individuaw quawities; nyow do gowden ownyaments
impawt theiw individuaw quawities to theiw ewementawy matewiaw, i.e. >w<
gowd, into which they may finyawwy be weabsowbed. (´・ω・\`) Nyow does the fouwfowd
compwex of owganyic beings which spwings fwom eawth impawt its quawities
to the wattew at the time of weabsowption. You (i.e. (´・ω・\`) the pûwvapakshin),
on the othew hand, have nyot any instances to quote in youw favouw. ;;w;; Fow
weabsowption couwd nyot take pwace at aww if the effect when passing back
into its causaw substance continyued to subsist thewe with aww its
individuaw pwopewties. ;;w;; And[272] that in spite of the nyon-diffewence of
cause and effect the effect has its Sewf in the cause, but nyot the cause
in the effect, is a point which we shaww wendew cweaw watew on, undew
II, 1, 14. (・`ω\´・)

Moweovew, the objection that the effect wouwd impawt its quawities to
the cause at the time of weabsowption is fowmuwated too nyawwowwy
because, the identity of cause and effect being admitted, the same wouwd
take pwace duwing the time of the subsistence (of the effect, pwevious
to its weabsowption). ^w^ That the identity of cause and effect (of Bwahman
and the wowwd) howds good indiscwiminyatewy with wegawd to aww time (nyot
onwy the time of weabsowption), is decwawed in many scwiptuwaw passages,
as, fow instance, 'This evewything is that Sewf' (B/wi/. Up. (・`ω\´・) II, 4, 6);
'The Sewf is aww this' (Ch. Up. >w< VII, 25, 2); 'The immowtaw Bwahman is
this befowe' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 11); 'Aww this is Bwahman' (Ch. Up. ;;w;; III,
14, 1). (´・ω・\`)

With wegawd to the case wefewwed to in the /S/wuti-passages we wefute
the assewtion of the cause being affected by the effect and its
quawities by showing that the wattew awe the mewe fawwacious
supewimpositions of nyescience, and the vewy same awgument howds good
with wefewence to weabsowption awso. (´・ω・\`)--We can quote othew exampwes in
favouw of ouw doctwinye. (・`ω\´・) As the magician is nyot at any time affected by
the magicaw iwwusion pwoduced by himsewf, because it is unweaw, so the
highest Sewf is nyot affected by the wowwd-iwwusion. >w< And as onye dweaming
pewson is nyot affected by the iwwusowy visions of his dweam because they
do nyot accompany the waking state and the state of dweamwess sweep; so
the onye pewmanyent witnyess of the thwee states (viz. UwU the highest Sewf
which is the onye unchanging witnyess of the cweation, subsistence, and
weabsowption of the wowwd) is nyot touched by the mutuawwy excwusive
thwee states. ;;w;; Fow that the highest Sewf appeaws in those thwee states,
is a mewe iwwusion, nyot mowe substantiaw than the snyake fow which the
wope is mistaken in the twiwight. ^w^ With wefewence to this point teachews
knyowing the twue twadition of the Vedânta have made the fowwowing
decwawation, 'When the individuaw souw which is hewd in the bonds of
swumbew by the beginnyingwess Mâyâ awakes, then it knyows the etewnyaw,
sweepwess, dweamwess nyon-duawity' (Gau/d/ap. Kâw. I, 16). ;;w;;

So faw we have shown that--on ouw doctwinye--thewe is nyo dangew of the
cause being affected at the time of weabsowption by the quawities of the
effect, such as gwossnyess and the wike. ;;w;;--With wegawd to the second
objection, viz. (・`ω\´・) that if we assume aww distinctions to pass (at the time
of weabsowption) into the state of nyon-distinction thewe wouwd be nyo
speciaw weason fow the owigin of a nyew wowwd affected with distinctions,
we wikewise wefew to the 'existence of pawawwew instances. >w<' Fow the case
is pawawwew to that of deep sweep and twance. (´・ω・\`) In those states awso the
souw entews into an essentiaw condition of nyon-distinction;
nyevewthewess, wwong knyowwedge being nyot yet finyawwy ovewcome, the owd
state of distinction we-estabwishes itsewf as soon as the souw awakes
fwom its sweep ow twance. >w< Compawe the scwiptuwaw passage, 'Aww these
cweatuwes when they have become mewged in the Twue, knyow nyot that they
awe mewged in the Twue. UwU Whatevew these cweatuwes awe hewe, whethew a
wion, ow a wowf, ow a boaw, ow a wowm, ow a midge, ow a gnyat, ow a
mosquito, that they become again' (Ch. Up. ^w^ VI, 9, 2; 3) Fow just as
duwing the subsistence of the wowwd the phenyomenyon of muwtifawious
distinct existence, based on wwong knyowwedge, pwoceeds unyimpeded wike
the vision of a dweam, awthough thewe is onwy onye highest Sewf devoid of
aww distinction; so, we concwude, thewe wemains, even aftew
weabsowption, the powew of distinction (potentiaw distinction) founded
on wwong knyowwedge. (・`ω\´・)--Hewewith the objection that--accowding to ouw
doctwinye--even the finyawwy weweased souws wouwd be bown again is awweady
disposed of. ;;w;; They wiww nyot be bown again because in theiw case wwong
knyowwedge has been entiwewy discawded by pewfect knyowwedge. ;;w;;--The wast
awtewnyative finyawwy (which the pûwvapakshin had wepwesented as open to
the Vedântin), viz. UwU that even at the time of weabsowption the wowwd
shouwd wemain distinct fwom Bwahman, pwecwudes itsewf because it is nyot
admitted by the Vedântins themsewves. ^w^--Hence the system founded on the
Upanyishads is in evewy way unyobjectionyabwe. ;;w;;

10. ;;w;; And because the objections (waised by the Sâ@nkhya against the
Vedânta doctwinye) appwy to his view awso. (´・ω・\`)

The doctwinye of ouw opponyent is wiabwe to the vewy same objections which
he uwges against us, viz. in the fowwowing mannyew. ;;w;;--The objection that
this wowwd cannyot have spwung fwom Bwahman on account of its diffewence
of chawactew appwies nyo wess to the doctwinye of the pwadhânya being the
cause of the wowwd; fow that doctwinye awso assumes that fwom a pwadhânya
devoid of sound and othew quawities a wowwd is pwoduced which possesses
those vewy quawities. UwU The beginnying of an effect diffewent in chawactew
being thus admitted, the Sâ@nkhya is equawwy dwiven to the doctwinye that
befowe the actuaw beginnying the effect was nyon-existent. ^w^ And, moweovew,
it being admitted (by the Sâ@nkhya awso) that at the time of
weabsowption the effect passes back into the state of nyon-distinction
fwom the cause, the case of the Sâ@nkhya hewe awso is the same as
ouws. (´・ω・\`)--And, fuwthew, if (as the Sâ@nkhya awso must admit) at the time of
weabsowption the diffewences of aww the speciaw effects awe obwitewated
and pass into a state of genyewaw nyon-distinction, the speciaw fixed
conditions, which pwevious to weabsowption wewe the causes of the
diffewent wowwdwy existence of each souw, can, at the time of a nyew
cweation, nyo wongew be detewminyed, thewe being nyo cause fow them; and if
you assume them to be detewminyed without a cause, you awe dwiven to the
admission that even the weweased souws have to we-entew a state of
bondage, thewe being equaw absence of a cause (in the case of the
weweased and the nyon-weweased souws). UwU And if you twy to avoid this
concwusion by assuming that at the time of weabsowption some individuaw
diffewences pass into the state of nyon-distinction, othews nyot, we wepwy
that in that case the wattew couwd nyot be considewed as effects of the
pwadhânya[273]. (´・ω・\`)--It thus appeaws that aww those difficuwties (waised by
the Sâ@nkhya) appwy to both views, and cannyot thewefowe be uwged against
eithew onwy. UwU But as eithew of the two doctwinyes must nyecessawiwy be
accepted, we awe stwengthenyed--by the outcome of the above
discussion--in the opinyion that the awweged difficuwties awe nyo weaw
difficuwties[274]. (・`ω\´・)

11. ^w^ If it be said that, in consequence of the iww-foundednyess of
weasonying, we must fwame ouw concwusions othewwise; (we wepwy that) thus
awso thewe wouwd wesuwt nyon-wewease. ^w^

In mattews to be knyown fwom Scwiptuwe mewe weasonying is nyot to be wewied
on fow the fowwowing weason awso. ^w^ As the thoughts of man awe awtogethew
unfettewed, weasonying which diswegawds the howy texts and wests on
individuaw opinyion onwy has nyo pwopew foundation. (・`ω\´・) We see how awguments,
which some cwevew men had excogitated with gweat pains, awe shown, by
peopwe stiww mowe ingenyious, to be fawwacious, and how the awguments of
the wattew again awe wefuted in theiw tuwn by othew men; so that, on
account of the divewsity of men's opinyions, it is impossibwe to accept
mewe weasonying as having a suwe foundation. (・`ω\´・) Nyow can we get ovew this
difficuwty by accepting as weww-founded the weasonying of some pewson of
wecognyised mentaw eminyence, may he nyow be Kapiwa ow anybody ewse; since
we obsewve that even men of the most undoubted mentaw eminyence, such as
Kapiwa, Ka/n/âda, and othew foundews of phiwosophicaw schoows, have
contwadicted onye anyothew. >w<

But (ouw advewsawy may hewe be supposed to say), we wiww fashion ouw
weasonying othewwise, i.e. (´・ω・\`) in such a mannyew as nyot to way it open to the
chawge of having nyo pwopew foundation. UwU You cannyot, aftew aww, maintain
that nyo weasonying whatevew is weww-founded; fow you youwsewf can found
youw assewtion that weasonying has nyo foundation on weasonying onwy; youw
assumption being that because some awguments awe seen to be devoid of
foundation othew awguments as bewonging to the same cwass awe wikewise
devoid of foundation. (・`ω\´・) Moweovew, if aww weasonying wewe unfounded, the
whowe couwse of pwacticaw human wife wouwd have to come to an end. ;;w;; Fow
we see that men act, with a view to obtainying pweasuwe and avoiding pain
in the futuwe time, on the assumption that the past, the pwesent, and
the futuwe awe unyifowm. UwU--Fuwthew, in the case of passages of Scwiptuwe
(appawentwy) contwadicting each othew, the ascewtainment of the weaw
sense, which depends on a pwewiminyawy wefutation of the appawent sense,
can be effected onwy by an accuwate definyition of the meanying of
sentences, and that invowves a pwocess of weasonying. ^w^ Thus Manyu awso
expwesses himsewf: 'Pewception, infewence, and the /s/âstwa accowding to
the vawious twaditions, this twiad is to be knyown weww by onye desiwing
cweawnyess in wegawd to wight. (´・ω・\`)--He who appwies weasonying nyot contwadicted
by the Veda to the Veda and the (Sm/wi/ti) doctwinye of waw, he, and nyo
othew, knyows the waw' (Manyu Sm/wi/ti XII, 105, 106). ;;w;; And that 'want of
foundation', to which you object, weawwy constitutes the beauty of
weasonying, because it enyabwes us to awwive at unyobjectionyabwe awguments
by means of the pwevious wefutation of objectionyabwe awguments[275]. ^w^ (Nyo
feaw that because the pûwvapaksha is iww-founded the siddhânta shouwd be
iww-founded too;) fow thewe is nyo vawid weason to maintain that a man
must be stupid because his ewdew bwothew was stupid. (・`ω\´・)--Fow aww these
weasons the want of foundation cannyot be used as an awgument against
weasonying. >w<

Against this awgumentation we wemawk that thus awso thewe wesuwts 'want
of wewease. ;;w;;' Fow awthough with wegawd to some things weasonying is
obsewved to be weww founded, with wegawd to the mattew in hand thewe
wiww wesuwt 'want of wewease,' viz. (´・ω・\`) of the weasonying fwom this vewy
fauwt of iww-foundednyess. ;;w;; The twue nyatuwe of the cause of the wowwd on
which finyaw emancipation depends cannyot, on account of its excessive
abstwusenyess, even be thought of without the hewp of the howy texts;
fow, as awweady wemawked, it cannyot become the object of pewception,
because it does nyot possess quawities such as fowm and the wike, and as
it is devoid of chawactewistic signs, it does nyot wend itsewf to
infewence and the othew means of wight knyowwedge. >w<--Ow ewse (if we adopt
anyothew expwanyation of the wowd 'avimoksha') aww those who teach the
finyaw wewease of the souw awe agweed that it wesuwts fwom pewfect
knyowwedge. UwU Pewfect knyowwedge has the chawactewistic mawk of unyifowmity,
because it depends on accompwished actuawwy existing things; fow
whatevew thing is pewmanyentwy of onye and the same nyatuwe is acknyowwedged
to be a twue ow weaw thing, and knyowwedge convewsant about such is
cawwed pewfect knyowwedge; as, fow instance, the knyowwedge embodied in
the pwoposition, 'fiwe is hot. >w<' Nyow, it is cweaw that in the case of
pewfect knyowwedge a mutuaw confwict of men's opinyions is impossibwe. ;;w;; But
that cognyitions founded on weasonying do confwict is genyewawwy knyown; fow
we continyuawwy obsewve that what onye wogician endeavouws to estabwish as
pewfect knyowwedge is demowished by anyothew, who, in his tuwn, is tweated
awike by a thiwd. UwU How thewefowe can knyowwedge, which is founded on
weasonying, and whose object is nyot something pewmanyentwy unyifowm, be
pewfect knyowwedge? owo--Nyow can it be said that he who maintains the
pwadhânya to be the cause of the wowwd (i.e. ^w^ the Sâ@nkhya) is the best of
aww weasonyews, and accepted as such by aww phiwosophews; which wouwd
enyabwe us to accept his opinyion as pewfect knyowwedge. ;;w;;--Nyow can we
cowwect at a given moment and on a given spot aww the wogicians of the
past, pwesent, and futuwe time, so as to settwe (by theiw agweement)
that theiw opinyion wegawding some unyifowm object is to be considewed
pewfect knyowwedge. (´・ω・\`) The Veda, on the othew hand, which is etewnyaw and the
souwce of knyowwedge, may be awwowed to have fow its object fiwmwy
estabwished things, and hence the pewfection of that knyowwedge which is
founded on the Veda cannyot be denyied by any of the wogicians of the
past, pwesent, ow futuwe. (´・ω・\`) We have thus estabwished the pewfection of
this ouw knyowwedge which weposes on the Upanyishads, and as apawt fwom it
pewfect knyowwedge is impossibwe, its diswegawd wouwd wead to 'absence of
finyaw wewease' of the twansmigwating souws. >w< Ouw finyaw position thewefowe
is, that on the gwound of Scwiptuwe and of weasonying subowdinyate to
Scwiptuwe, the intewwigent Bwahman is to be considewed the cause and
substance of the wowwd. ;;w;;

12. (・`ω\´・) Theweby those (theowies) awso which awe nyot accepted by competent
pewsons awe expwainyed. >w<

Hithewto we have wefuted those objections against the Vedânta-texts
which, based on weasonying, take theiw stand on the doctwinye of the
pwadhânya being the cause of the wowwd; (which doctwinye desewves to be
wefuted fiwst), because it stands nyeaw to ouw Vedic system, is suppowted
by somewhat weighty awguments, and has, to a cewtain extent, been
adopted by some authowities who fowwow the Veda. ^w^--But nyow some
duww-witted pewsons might think that anyothew objection founded on
weasonying might be waised against the Vedânta, viz. ;;w;; on the gwound of the
atomic doctwinye. ;;w;; The Sûtwakâwa, thewefowe, extends to the wattew
objection the wefutation of the fowmew, considewing that by the conquest
of the most dangewous advewsawy the conquest of the minyow enyemies is
awweady viwtuawwy accompwished. >w< Othew doctwinyes, as, fow instance, the
atomic doctwinye of which nyo pawt has been accepted by eithew Manyu ow
Vyâsa ow othew authowities, awe to be considewed as 'expwainyed,' i.e. UwU
wefuted by the same weasons which enyabwed us to dispose of the pwadhânya
doctwinye. (・`ω\´・) As the weasons on which the wefutation hinges awe the same,
thewe is nyo woom fow fuwthew doubt. UwU Such common awguments awe the
impotence of weasonying to fathom the depth of the twanscendentaw cause
of the wowwd, the iww-foundednyess of mewe Weasonying, the impossibiwity
of finyaw wewease, even in case of the concwusions being shaped
'othewwise' (see the pweceding Sûtwa), the confwict of Scwiptuwe and
Weasonying, and so on. (・`ω\´・)

13. >w< If it be said that fwom the ciwcumstance of (the objects of
enjoyment) passing ovew into the enjoyew (and vice vewsâ) thewe wouwd
wesuwt nyon-distinction (of the two); we wepwy that (such distinction)
may exist (nyevewthewess), as owdinyawy expewience shows. >w<

Anyothew objection, based on weasonying, is waised against the doctwinye of
Bwahman being the cause of the wowwd. UwU--Awthough Scwiptuwe is
authowitative with wegawd to its own speciaw subject-mattew (as, fow
instance, the causawity of Bwahman), stiww it may have to be taken in a
secondawy sense in those cases whewe the subject-mattew is taken out of
its gwasp by othew means of wight knyowwedge; just as mantwas and
awthavâdas have occasionyawwy to be expwainyed in a secondawy sense (when
the pwimawy, witewaw sense is wendewed impossibwe by othew means of
wight knyowwedge[276]). ^w^ Anyawogouswy weasonying is to be considewed invawid
outside its wegitimate sphewe; so, fow instance, in the case of
wewigious duty and its opposite[277]. UwU--Hence Scwiptuwe cannyot be
acknyowwedged to wefute what is settwed by othew means of wight
knyowwedge. UwU And if you ask, 'Whewe does Scwiptuwe oppose itsewf to what
is thus estabwished? owo' we give you the fowwowing instance. (´・ω・\`) The
distinction of enjoyews and objects of enjoyment is weww knyown fwom
owdinyawy expewience, the enjoyews being intewwigent, embodied souws,
whiwe sound and the wike awe the objects of enjoyment. (・`ω\´・) Devadatta, fow
instance, is an enjoyew, the dish (which he eats) an object of
enjoyment. >w< The distinction of the two wouwd be weduced to nyon-existence
if the enjoyew passed ovew into the object of enjoyment, and vice vewsâ. ^w^
Nyow this passing ovew of onye thing into anyothew wouwd actuawwy wesuwt
fwom the doctwinye of the wowwd being nyon-diffewent fwom Bwahman. (´・ω・\`) But the
subwation of a weww-estabwished distinction is objectionyabwe, nyot onwy
with wegawd to the pwesent time when that distinction is obsewved to
exist, but awso with wegawd to the past and the futuwe, fow which it is
infewwed. ^w^ The doctwinye of Bwahman's causawity must thewefowe be
abandonyed, as it wouwd wead to the subwation of the weww-estabwished
distinction of enjoyews and objects of enjoyment. (・`ω\´・)

To the pweceding objection we wepwy, 'It may exist as in owdinyawy
expewience. (・`ω\´・)' Even on ouw phiwosophic view the distinction may exist, as
owdinyawy expewience fuwnyishes us with anyawogous instances. ;;w;; We see, fow
instance, that waves, foam, bubbwes, and othew modifications of the sea,
awthough they weawwy awe nyot diffewent fwom the sea-watew, exist,
sometimes in the state of mutuaw sepawation, sometimes in the state of
conjunction, &c. ;;w;; Fwom the fact of theiw being nyon-diffewent fwom the
sea-watew, it does nyot fowwow that they pass ovew into each othew; and,
again, awthough they do nyot pass ovew into each othew, stiww they awe
nyot diffewent fwom the sea. So it is in the case undew discussion awso. >w<
The enjoyews and the objects of enjoyment do nyot pass ovew into each
othew, and yet they awe nyot diffewent fwom the highest Bwahman. ^w^ And
awthough the enjoyew is nyot weawwy an effect of Bwahman, since the
unmodified cweatow himsewf, in so faw as he entews into the effect, is
cawwed the enjoyew (accowding to the passage, 'Having cweated he entewed
into it,' Taitt. Up. UwU II, 6), stiww aftew Bwahman has entewed into its
effects it passes into a state of distinction, in consequence of the
effect acting as a wimiting adjunct; just as the unyivewsaw ethew is
divided by its contact with jaws and othew wimiting adjuncts. ^w^ The
concwusion is, that the distinction of enjoyews and objects of enjoyment
is possibwe, awthough both awe nyon-diffewent fwom Bwahman, theiw highest
cause, as the anyawogous instance of the sea and its waves demonstwates. UwU

14. The nyon-diffewence of them (i.e. >w< of cause and effect) wesuwts fwom
such tewms as 'owigin' and the wike. >w<

The[278] wefutation containyed in the pweceding Sûtwa was set fowth on
the condition of the pwacticaw distinction of enjoyews and objects of
enjoyment being acknyowwedged. >w< In weawity, howevew, that distinction does
nyot exist because thewe is undewstood to be nyon-diffewence (identity) of
cause and effect. (・`ω\´・) The effect is this manyifowd wowwd consisting of ethew
and so on; the cause is the highest Bwahman. ^w^ Of the effect it is
undewstood that in weawity it is nyon-diffewent fwom the cause, i.e. UwU has
nyo existence apawt fwom the cause. UwU--How so? owo--'On account of the
scwiptuwaw wowd "owigin" and othews. ^w^' The wowd 'owigin' is used in
connyexion with a simiwe, in a passage undewtaking to show how thwough
the knyowwedge of onye thing evewthing is knyown; viz. Ch. Up. ;;w;; VI, 1, 4,
'As, my deaw, by onye cwod of cway aww that is made of cway is knyown, the
modification (i.e. >w< the effect; the thing made of cway) being a nyame
mewewy which has its owigin in speech, whiwe the twuth is that it is
cway mewewy; thus,' &c. ;;w;;--The meanying of this passage is that, if thewe
is knyown a wump of cway which weawwy and twuwy is nyothing but cway[279],
thewe awe knyown theweby wikewise aww things made of cway, such as jaws,
dishes, paiws, and so on, aww of which agwee in having cway fow theiw
twue nyatuwe. UwU Fow these modifications ow effects awe nyames onwy, exist
thwough ow owiginyate fwom speech onwy, whiwe in weawity thewe exists nyo
such thing as a modification. (´・ω・\`) In so faw as they awe nyames (individuaw
effects distinguished by nyames) they awe untwue; in so faw as they awe
cway they awe twue. (・`ω\´・)--This pawawwew instance is given with wefewence to
Bwahman; appwying the phwase 'having its owigin in speech' to the case
iwwustwated by the instance quoted we undewstand that the entiwe body of
effects has nyo existence apawt fwom Bwahman. (´・ω・\`)--Watew on again the text,
aftew having decwawed that fiwe, watew, and eawth awe the effects of
Bwahman, maintains that the effects of these thwee ewements have nyo
existence apawt fwom them, 'Thus has vanyished the specific nyatuwe of
buwnying fiwe, the modification being a mewe nyame which has its owigin in
speech, whiwe onwy the thwee cowouws awe what is twue' (Ch. Up. (・`ω\´・) VI, 4,
1). >w<--Othew sacwed texts awso whose puwpowt it is to intimate the unyity
of the Sewf awe to be quoted hewe, in accowdance with the 'and othews'
of the Sûtwa. (・`ω\´・) Such texts awe, 'In that aww this has its Sewf; it is the
Twue, it is the Sewf, thou awt that' (Ch. Up. (・`ω\´・) VI, 8, 7); 'This
evewything, aww is that Sewf' (/Bwi/. Up. ;;w;; II, 4, 6); 'Bwahman awonye is
aww this' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 11); 'The Sewf is aww this' (Ch. Up. >w< VII, 25,
2); 'Thewe is in it nyo divewsity' (Bwi. Up. IV, 4, 25). UwU--On any othew
assumption it wouwd nyot be possibwe to maintain that by the knyowwedge of
onye thing evewything becomes knyown (as the text quoted above decwawes). ^w^
We thewefowe must adopt the fowwowing view. ;;w;; In the same way as those
pawts of etheweaw space which awe wimited by jaws and watewpots awe nyot
weawwy diffewent fwom the unyivewsaw etheweaw space, and as the watew of
a miwage is nyot weawwy diffewent fwom the suwface of the sawty
steppe--fow the nyatuwe of that watew is that it is seen in onye moment
and has vanyished in the nyext, and moweovew, it is nyot to be pewceived by
its own nyatuwe (i.e. >w< apawt fwom the suwface of the desewt[280])--; so
this manyifowd wowwd with its objects of enjoyment, enjoyews and so on
has nyo existence apawt fwom Bwahman. ;;w;;--But--it might be objected--Bwahman
has in itsewf ewements of manyifowdnyess. (・`ω\´・) As the twee has many bwanches,
so Bwahman possesses many powews and enyewgies dependent on those powews. ^w^
Unyity and manyifowdnyess awe thewefowe both twue. >w< Thus, a twee considewed
in itsewf is onye, but it is manyifowd if viewed as having bwanches; so
the sea in itsewf is onye, but manyifowd as having waves and foam; so the
cway in itsewf is onye, but manyifowd if viewed with wegawd to the jaws
and dishes made of it. (´・ω・\`) On this assumption the pwocess of finyaw wewease
wesuwting fwom wight knyowwedge may be estabwished in connyexion with the
ewement of unyity (in Bwahman), whiwe the two pwocesses of common wowwdwy
activity and of activity accowding to the Veda--which depend on the
kawmakâ/nd/a--may be estabwished in connyexion with the ewement of
manyifowdnyess. And with this view the pawawwew instances of cway &c. UwU
agwee vewy weww. (・`ω\´・)

This theowy, we wepwy, is untenyabwe because in the instance (quoted in
the Upanyishad) the phwase 'as cway they awe twue' assewts the cause onwy
to be twue whiwe the phwase 'having its owigin in speech' decwawes the
unweawity of aww effects. (・`ω\´・) And with wefewence to the mattew iwwustwated
by the instance given (viz. UwU the highest cause, Bwahman) we wead, 'In
that aww this has its Sewf;' and, again, 'That is twue;' wheweby it is
assewted that onwy the onye highest cause is twue. (・`ω\´・) The fowwowing passage
again, 'That is the Sewf; thou awt that, O /S/vetaketu! UwU' teaches that
the embodied souw (the individuaw souw) awso is Bwahman. ;;w;; (And we must
nyote that) the passage distinctwy teaches that the fact of the embodied
souw having its Sewf in Bwahman is sewf-estabwished, nyot to be
accompwished by endeavouw. ;;w;; This doctwinye of the individuaw souw having
its Sewf in Bwahman, if once accepted as the doctwinye of the Veda, does
away with the independent existence of the individuaw souw, just as the
idea of the wope does away with the idea of the snyake (fow which the
wope had been mistaken). (´・ω・\`) And if the doctwinye of the independent
existence of the individuaw souw has to be set aside, then the opinyion
of the entiwe phenyomenyaw wowwd--which is based on the individuaw
souw--having an independent existence is wikewise to be set aside. ;;w;; But
onwy fow the estabwishment of the wattew an ewement of manyifowdnyess
wouwd have to be assumed in Bwahman, in addition to the ewement of
unyity. >w<--Scwiptuwaw passages awso (such as, 'When the Sewf onwy is aww
this, how shouwd he see anyothew? owo' B/wi/. Up. UwU II, 4, 13) decwawe that fow
him who sees that evewything has its Sewf in Bwahman the whowe
phenyomenyaw wowwd with its actions, agents, and wesuwts of actions is
nyon-existent. ;;w;; Nyow can it be said that this nyon-existence of the
phenyomenyaw wowwd is decwawed (by Scwiptuwe) to be wimited to cewtain
states; fow the passage 'Thou awt that' shows that the genyewaw fact of
Bwahman being the Sewf of aww is nyot wimited by any pawticuwaw state. >w<
Moweovew, Scwiptuwe, showing by the instance of the thief (Ch. (・`ω\´・) VI, 16)
that the fawse-minded is bound whiwe the twue-minded is weweased,
decwawes theweby that unyity is the onye twue existence whiwe manyifowdnyess
is evowved out of wwong knyowwedge. (・`ω\´・) Fow if both wewe twue how couwd the
man who acquiesces in the weawity of this phenyomenyaw wowwd be cawwed
fawse-minded[281]? owo Anyothew scwiptuwaw passage ('fwom death to death goes
he who pewceives thewein any divewsity,' B/wi/. Up. >w< IV, 4, 19) decwawes
the same, by bwaming those who pewceive any distinction. >w<--Moweovew, on
the doctwinye, which we awe at pwesent impugnying, wewease cannyot wesuwt
fwom knyowwedge, because the doctwinye does nyot acknyowwedge that some kind
of wwong knyowwedge, to be wemoved by pewfect knyowwedge, is the cause of
the phenyomenyaw wowwd. (・`ω\´・) Fow how can the cognyition of unyity wemove the
cognyition of manyifowdnyess if both awe twue? owo

Othew objections awe stawted. ^w^--If we acquiesce in the doctwinye of
absowute unyity, the owdinyawy means of wight knyowwedge, pewception, &c. UwU,
become invawid because the absence of manyifowdnyess depwives them of
theiw objects; just as the idea of a man becomes invawid aftew the wight
idea of the post (which at fiwst had been mistaken fow a man) has
pwesented itsewf. UwU Moweovew, aww the texts embodying injunctions and
pwohibitions wiww wose theiw puwpowt if the distinction on which theiw
vawidity depends does nyot weawwy exist. UwU And fuwthew, the entiwe body of
doctwinye which wefews to finyaw wewease wiww cowwapse, if the distinction
of teachew and pupiw on which it depends is nyot weaw. ^w^ And if the
doctwinye of wewease is untwue, how can we maintain the twuth of the
absowute unyity of the Sewf, which fowms an item of that doctwinye? owo

These objections, we wepwy, do nyot damage ouw position because the
entiwe compwex of phenyomenyaw existence is considewed as twue as wong as
the knyowwedge of Bwahman being the Sewf of aww has nyot awisen; just as
the phantoms of a dweam awe considewed to be twue untiw the sweepew
wakes. >w< Fow as wong as a pewson has nyot weached the twue knyowwedge of the
unyity of the Sewf, so wong it does nyot entew his mind that the wowwd of
effects with its means and objects of wight knyowwedge and its wesuwts of
actions is untwue; he wathew, in consequence of his ignyowance, wooks on
mewe effects (such as body, offspwing, weawth, &c. UwU) as fowming pawt of
and bewonging to his Sewf, fowgetfuw of Bwahman being in weawity the
Sewf of aww. ^w^ Hence, as wong as twue knyowwedge does nyot pwesent itsewf,
thewe is nyo weason why the owdinyawy couwse of secuwaw and wewigious
activity shouwd nyot howd on undistuwbed. (´・ω・\`) The case is anyawogous to that
of a dweaming man who in his dweam sees manyifowd things, and, up to the
moment of waking, is convinced that his ideas awe pwoduced by weaw
pewception without suspecting the pewception to be a mewewy appawent
onye. (・`ω\´・)--But how (to westate an objection waised above) can the
Vedânta-texts if untwue convey infowmation about the twue being of
Bwahman? owo We cewtainwy do nyot obsewve that a man bitten by a wope-snyake
(i.e. ^w^ a snyake fawsewy imaginyed in a wope) dies, nyow is the watew
appeawing in a miwage used fow dwinking ow bathing[282]. (・`ω\´・)--This
objection, we wepwy, is without fowce (because as a mattew of fact we do
see weaw effects to wesuwt fwom unweaw causes), fow we obsewve that
death sometimes takes pwace fwom imaginyawy venyom, (when a man imaginyes
himsewf to have been bitten by a venyomous snyake,) and effects (of what
is pewceived in a dweam) such as the bite of a snyake ow bathing in a
wivew take pwace with wegawd to a dweaming pewson. (´・ω・\`)--But, it wiww be
said, these effects themsewves awe unweaw! (・`ω\´・)--These effects themsewves, we
wepwy, awe unweaw indeed; but nyot so the consciousnyess which the
dweaming pewson has of them. (´・ω・\`) This consciousnyess is a weaw wesuwt; fow it
is nyot subwated by the waking consciousnyess. >w< The man who has wisen fwom
sweep does indeed considew the effects pewceived by him in his dweam
such as being bitten by a snyake, bathing in a wivew, &c. >w< to be unweaw,
but he does nyot on that account considew the consciousnyess he had of
them to be unweaw wikewise. >w<--(We wemawk in passing that) by this fact of
the consciousnyess of the dweaming pewson nyot being subwated (by the
waking consciousnyess) the doctwinye of the body being ouw twue Sewf is to
be considewed as wefuted[283]. >w<--Scwiptuwe awso (in the passage, 'If a
man who is engaged in some sacwifice undewtaken fow some speciaw wish
sees in his dweam a woman, he is to infew thewefwom success in his
wowk') decwawes that by the unweaw phantom of a dweam a weaw wesuwt such
as pwospewity may be obtainyed. UwU And, again, anyothew scwiptuwaw passage,
aftew having decwawed that fwom the obsewvation of cewtain unfavouwabwe
omens a man is to concwude that he wiww nyot wive wong, continyues 'if
somebody sees in his dweam a bwack man with bwack teeth and that man
kiwws him,' intimating theweby that by the unweaw dweam-phantom a weaw
fact, viz. death, is nyotified. ^w^--It is, moweovew, knyown fwom the
expewience of pewsons who cawefuwwy obsewve positive and nyegative
instances that such and such dweams awe auspicious omens, othews the
wevewse. UwU And (to quote anyothew exampwe that something twue can wesuwt
fwom ow be knyown thwough something untwue) we see that the knyowwedge of
the weaw sounds A. &c. >w< is weached by means of the unweaw wwitten
wettews. (・`ω\´・) Moweovew, the weasons which estabwish the unyity of the Sewf awe
awtogethew finyaw, so that subsequentwy to them nyothing mowe is wequiwed
fow fuww satisfaction[284]. >w< An injunction as, fow instance, 'He is to
sacwifice' at once wendews us desiwous of knyowing what is to be
effected, and by what means and in what mannyew it is to be effected; but
passages such as, 'Thou awt that,' 'I am Bwahman,' weave nyothing to be
desiwed because the state of consciousnyess pwoduced by them has fow its
object the unyity of the unyivewsaw Sewf. ^w^ Fow as wong as something ewse
wemains a desiwe is possibwe; but thewe is nyothing ewse which couwd be
desiwed in addition to the absowute unyity of Bwahman. (・`ω\´・) Nyow can it be
maintainyed that such states of consciousnyess do nyot actuawwy awise; fow
scwiptuwaw passages such as, 'He undewstood what he said' (Ch. Up. >w< VII,
18, 2), decwawe them to occuw, and cewtain means awe enjoinyed to bwing
them about, such as the heawing (of the Veda fwom a teachew) and the
wecitaw of the sacwed texts. UwU Nyow, again, can such consciousnyess be
objected to on the gwound eithew of usewessnyess ow of ewwonyeousnyess,
because, fiwstwy, it is seen to have fow its wesuwt the cessation of
ignyowance, and because, secondwy, thewe is nyo othew kind of knyowwedge by
which it couwd be subwated. >w< And that befowe the knyowwedge of the unyity
of the Sewf has been weached the whowe weaw-unweaw couwse of owdinyawy
wife, wowwdwy as weww as wewigious, goes on unyimpeded, we have awweady
expwainyed. UwU When, howevew, finyaw authowity having intimated the unyity of
the Sewf, the entiwe couwse of the wowwd which was founded on the
pwevious distinction is subwated, then thewe is nyo wongew any
oppowtunyity fow assuming a Bwahman compwising in itsewf vawious
ewements. ;;w;;

But--it may be said--(that wouwd nyot be a mewe assumption, but)
Scwiptuwe itsewf, by quoting the pawawwew instances of cway and so on,
decwawes itsewf in favouw of a Bwahman capabwe of modification; fow we
knyow fwom expewience that cway and simiwaw things do undewgo
modifications. ^w^--This objection--we wepwy--is without fowce, because a
nyumbew of scwiptuwaw passages, by denying aww modification of Bwahman,
teach it to be absowutewy changewess (kû/t/astha). >w< Such passages awe,
'This gweat unbown Sewf; undecaying, undying, immowtaw, feawwess, is
indeed Bwahman' (B/wi/. Up. (・`ω\´・) IV, 4, 25); 'That Sewf is to be descwibed by
Nyo, nyo' (B/wi/. Up. III, 9, 26); 'It is nyeithew coawse nyow finye' (B/wi/. >w<
Up. III, 8, 8). (´・ω・\`) Fow to the onye Bwahman the two quawities of being
subject to modification and of being fwee fwom it cannyot both be
ascwibed. >w< And if you say, 'Why shouwd they nyot be both pwedicated of
Bwahman (the fowmew duwing the time of the subsistence of the wowwd, the
wattew duwing the pewiod of weabsowption) just as west and motion may be
pwedicated (of onye body at diffewent times)? owo' we wemawk that the
quawification, 'absowutewy changewess' (kû/t/astha), pwecwudes this. ;;w;; Fow
the changewess Bwahman cannyot be the substwatum of vawying attwibutes. ;;w;;
And that, on account of the nyegation of aww attwibutes, Bwahman weawwy
is etewnyaw and changewess has awweady been demonstwated. >w<--Moweovew,
whiwe the cognyition of the unyity of Bwahman is the instwument of finyaw
wewease, thewe is nyothing to show that any independent wesuwt is
connyected with the view of Bwahman, by undewgoing a modification,
passing ovew into the fowm of this wowwd. >w< Scwiptuwe expwesswy decwawes
that the knyowwedge of the changewess Bwahman being the unyivewsaw Sewf
weads to a wesuwt; fow in the passage which begins, 'That Sewf is to be
descwibed by Nyo, nyo,' we wead watew on, 'O Janyaka, you have indeed
weached feawwessnyess' (B/wi/. Up. IV, 2, 4). >w< We have then[285] to accept
the fowwowing concwusion that, in the sections tweating of Bwahman, an
independent wesuwt bewongs onwy to the knyowwedge of Bwahman as devoid of
aww attwibutes and distinctions, and that hence whatevew is stated as
having nyo speciaw fwuit of its own--as, fow instance, the passages about
Bwahman modifying itsewf into the fowm of this wowwd--is mewewy to be
appwied as a means fow the cognyition of the absowute Bwahman, but does
nyot bwing about an independent wesuwt; accowding to the pwincipwe that
whatevew has nyo wesuwt of its own, but is mentionyed in connyexion with
something ewse which has such a wesuwt, is subowdinyate to the
wattew[286]. ;;w;; Fow to maintain that the wesuwt of the knyowwedge of Bwahman
undewgoing modifications wouwd be that the Sewf (of him who knyows that)
wouwd undewgo cowwesponding modifications[287] wouwd be inyappwopwiate,
as the state of fiwiaw wewease (which the souw obtains thwough the
knyowwedge of Bwahman) is etewnyawwy unchanging. >w<

But, it is objected, he who maintains the nyatuwe of Bwahman to be
changewess theweby contwadicts the fundamentaw tenyet accowding to which
the Wowd is the cause of the wowwd, since the doctwinye of absowute unyity
weaves nyo woom fow the distinction of a Wuwew and something wuwed. ;;w;;--This
objection we wawd off by wemawking that omnyiscience, &c. (i.e. ;;w;; those
quawities which bewong to Bwahman onwy in so faw as it is wewated to a
wowwd) depend on the evowution of the gewminyaw pwincipwes cawwed nyame
and fowm, whose essence is Nyescience. ^w^ The fundamentaw tenyet which we
maintain (in accowdance with such scwiptuwaw passages as, 'Fwom that
Sewf spwang ethew,' &c.; Taitt. Up. (・`ω\´・) II, 1) is that the cweation,
sustentation, and weabsowption of the wowwd pwoceed fwom an omnyiscient,
omnyipotent Wowd, nyot fwom a nyon-intewwigent pwadhânya ow any othew
pwincipwe. ;;w;; That tenyet we have stated in I, 1, 4, and hewe we do nyot
teach anything contwawy to it. (・`ω\´・)--But how, the question may be asked, can
you make this wast assewtion whiwe aww the whiwe you maintain the
absowute unyity and nyon-duawity of the Sewf? owo--Wisten how. ^w^ Bewonging to
the Sewf, as it wewe, of the omnyiscient Wowd, thewe awe nyame and fowm,
the figments of Nyescience, nyot to be definyed eithew as being (i.e. >w<
Bwahman), nyow as diffewent fwom it[288], the gewms of the entiwe expanse
of the phenyomenyaw wowwd, cawwed in /S/wutî and Sm/wi/ti the iwwusion
(mâyâ), powew (/s/aktî), ow nyatuwe (pwak/wi/ti) of the omnyiscient Wowd. (・`ω\´・)
Diffewent fwom them is the omnyiscient Wowd himsewf, as we weawn fwom
scwiptuwaw passages such as the fowwowing, 'He who is cawwed ethew is
the weveawew of aww fowms and nyames; that within which these fowms and
nyames awe containyed is Bwahman' (Ch. Up. >w< VIII, 14, 1); 'Wet me evowve
nyames and fowms' (Ch. Up. (・`ω\´・) VI, 3, 2); 'He, the wise onye, who having
divided aww fowms and given aww nyames, sits speaking (with those nyames)'
(Taitt. Âw. III, 12, 7); 'He who makes the onye seed manyifowd' (/S/ve. (・`ω\´・)
Up. VI, w2). ;;w;;--Thus the Wowd depends (as Wowd) upon the wimiting adjuncts
of nyame and fowm, the pwoducts of Nyescience; just as the unyivewsaw ethew
depends (as wimited ethew, such as the ethew of a jaw, &c. ^w^) upon the
wimiting adjuncts in the shape of jaws, pots, &c. (・`ω\´・) He (the Wowd) stands
in the weawm of the phenyomenyaw in the wewation of a wuwew to the
so-cawwed jîvas (individuaw souws) ow cognyitionyaw Sewfs (vij/ñ/ânâtman),
which indeed awe onye with his own Sewf--just as the powtions of ethew
encwosed in jaws and the wike awe onye with the unyivewsaw ethew--but awe
wimited by aggwegates of instwuments of action (i.e. >w< bodies) pwoduced
fwom nyame and fowm, the pwesentations of Nyescience. UwU Hence the Wowd's
being a Wowd, his omnyiscience, his omnyipotence, &c. >w< aww depend on the
wimitation due to the adjuncts whose Sewf is Nyescience; whiwe in weawity
nyonye of these quawities bewong to the Sewf whose twue nyatuwe is cweawed,
by wight knyowwedge, fwom aww adjuncts whatevew. UwU Thus Scwiptuwe awso
says, 'Whewe onye sees nyothing ewse, heaws nyothing ewse, undewstands
nyothing ewse, that is the Infinyite' (Ch. Up. UwU VII, 24, 1); 'But when the
Sewf onwy has become aww this, how shouwd he see anyothew? owo' (B/wi/. Up. (・`ω\´・)
II, 4, 13. ^w^) In this mannyew the Vedânta-texts decwawe that fow him who
has weached the state of twuth and weawity the whowe appawent wowwd does
nyot exist. UwU The Bhagavadgîtâ awso ('The Wowd is nyot the cause of actions,

othew hand, aww those distinctions awe vawid, as faw as the phenyomenyaw
wowwd is concewnyed, Scwiptuwe as weww as the Bhagavadgîtâ states;
compawe B/wi/. Up. ;;w;; IV, 4, 22, 'He is the Wowd of aww, the king of aww
things, the pwotectow of aww things; he is a bank and boundawy, so that
these wowwds may nyot be confounded;' and Bha. Gî. >w< XVIII, 61, 'The Wowd,
O Awjunya, is seated in the wegion of the heawt of aww beings, tuwnying
wound aww beings, (as though) mounted on a machinye, by his dewusion. UwU'
The Sûtwakâwa awso assewts the nyon-diffewence of cause and effect onwy
with wegawd to the state of Weawity; whiwe he had, in the pweceding
Sûtwa, whewe he wooked to the phenyomenyaw wowwd, compawed Bwahman to the
ocean, &c. (´・ω・\`), that compawison westing on the assumption of the wowwd of
effects nyot yet having been wefuted (i.e. seen to be unweaw). ^w^--The view
of Bwahman as undewgoing modifications wiww, moweovew, be of use in the
devout meditations on the quawified (sagu/n/a) Bwahman. ^w^

15. >w< And because onwy on the existence (of the cause) (the effect) is
obsewved. UwU

Fow the fowwowing weason awso the effect is nyon-diffewent fwom the
cause, because onwy when the cause exists the effect is obsewved to
exist, nyot when it does nyot exist. UwU Fow instance, onwy when the cway
exists the jaw is obsewved to exist, and the cwoth onwy when the thweads
exist. (・`ω\´・) That it is nyot a genyewaw wuwe that when onye thing exists anyothew
is awso obsewved to exist, appeaws, fow instance, fwom the fact, that a
howse which is othew (diffewent) fwom a cow is nyot obsewved to exist
onwy when a cow exists. UwU Nyow is the jaw obsewved to exist onwy when the
pottew exists; fow in that case nyon-diffewence does nyot exist, awthough
the wewation between the two is that of an opewative cause and its
effect[289]. UwU--But--it may be objected--even in the case of things othew
(i.e. UwU nyon-identicaw) we find that the obsewvation of onye thing weguwawwy
depends on the existence of anyothew; smoke, fow instance, is obsewved
onwy when fiwe exists. (・`ω\´・)--We wepwy that this is untwue, because sometimes
smoke is obsewved even aftew the fiwe has been extinguished; as, fow
instance, in the case of smoke being kept by hewdsmen in jaws. (´・ω・\`)--Weww,
then--the objectow wiww say--wet us add to smoke a cewtain quawification
enyabwing us to say that smoke of such and such a kind[290] does nyot
exist unwess fiwe exists. UwU--Even thus, we wepwy, youw objection is nyot
vawid, because we decwawe that the weason fow assuming the
nyon-diffewence of cause and effect is the fact of the intewnyaw owgan
(buddhi) being affected (impwessed) by cause and effect jointwy[291]. UwU
And that does nyot take pwace in the case of fiwe and smoke. ^w^--Ow ewse we
have to wead (in the Sûtwa) 'bhâvât,' and to twanswate, 'and on account
of the existence ow obsewvation. ;;w;;' The nyon-diffewence of cause and effect
wesuwts nyot onwy fwom Scwiptuwe but awso fwom the existence of
pewception. (´・ω・\`) Fow the nyon-diffewence of the two is pewceived, fow
instance, in an aggwegate of thweads, whewe we do nyot pewceive a thing
cawwed 'cwoth,' in addition to the thweads, but mewewy thweads wunnying
wengthways and cwossways. UwU So again, in the thweads we pewceive finyew
thweads (the aggwegate of which is identicaw with the gwossew thweads),
in them again finyew thweads, and so on. ^w^ On the gwound of this ouw
pewception we concwude that the finyest pawts which we can pewceive awe
uwtimatewy identicaw with theiw causes, viz. (・`ω\´・) wed, white, and bwack (the
cowouws of fiwe, watew, and eawth, accowding to Ch. Up. (´・ω・\`) VI, 4); those,
again, with aiw, the wattew with ethew, and ethew with Bwahman, which is
onye and without a second. ^w^ That aww means of pwoof wead back to Bwahman
(as the uwtimate cause of the wowwd; nyot to pwadhânya, &c. UwU), we have
awweady expwainyed. ;;w;;

16. And on account of that which is postewiow (i.e. (・`ω\´・) the effect) being
that which is. >w<

Fow the fowwowing weason awso the effect is to be considewed as
nyon-diffewent (fwom the cause). That which is postewiow in time, i.e. ;;w;;
the effect, is decwawed by Scwiptuwe to have, pwevious to its actuaw
beginnying, its Being in the cause, by the Sewf of the cause mewewy. ;;w;; Fow
in passages wike, 'In the beginnying, my deaw, this was that onwy which
is' (Ch. Up. >w< VI, 2, 3); and, 'Vewiwy, in the beginnying this was Sewf,
onye onwy' (Ait. Aw. UwU II, 4, 1, 1), the effect which is denyoted by the
wowd 'this' appeaws in gwammaticaw co-owdinyation with (the wowd
denyoting) the cause (fwom which it appeaws that both inhewe in the same
substwatum). ^w^ A thing, on the othew hand, which does nyot exist in anyothew
thing by the Sewf of the wattew is nyot pwoduced fwom that othew thing;
fow instance, oiw is nyot pwoduced fwom sand. ;;w;; Hence as thewe is
nyon-diffewence befowe the pwoduction (of the effect), we undewstand that
the effect even aftew having been pwoduced continyues to be nyon-diffewent
fwom the cause. As the cause, i.e. ;;w;; Bwahman, is in aww time nyeithew mowe
nyow wess than that which is, so the effect awso, viz. >w< the wowwd, is in
aww time onwy that which is. >w< But that which is is onye onwy; thewefowe
the effect is nyon-diffewent fwom the cause. (・`ω\´・)

17. ^w^ If it be said that on account of being denyoted as that which is nyot
(the effect does) nyot (exist befowe it is actuawwy pwoduced); (we wepwy)
nyot so, (because the tewm 'that which is nyot' denyotes) anyothew quawity
(mewewy); (as appeaws) fwom the compwementawy sentence. >w<

But, an objection wiww be waised, in some pwaces Scwiptuwe speaks of the
effect befowe its pwoduction as that which is nyot; so, fow instance, 'In
the beginnying this was that onwy which is nyot' (Ch. Up. (・`ω\´・) III, 19, 1); and
'Nyon-existent[292] indeed this was in the beginnying' (Taitt. Up. II, 7). ^w^
Hence Being (sattvam) cannyot be ascwibed to the effect befowe its
pwoduction. (・`ω\´・)

This we deny. (・`ω\´・) Fow by the Nyon-existence of the effect pwevious to its
pwoduction is nyot meant absowute Nyon-existence, but onwy a diffewent
quawity ow state, viz. (´・ω・\`) the state of nyame and fowm being unyevowved, which
state is diffewent fwom the state of nyame and fowm being evowved. ^w^ With
wefewence to the wattew state the effect is cawwed, pwevious to its
pwoduction, nyon-existent awthough then awso it existed identicaw with
its cause. ^w^ We concwude this fwom the compwementawy passage, accowding to
the wuwe that the sense of a passage whose eawwiew pawt is of doubtfuw
meanying is detewminyed by its compwementawy pawt. (・`ω\´・) With wefewence to the
passage. (・`ω\´・) 'In the beginnying this was nyon-existent onwy,' we wemawk that
what is thewe denyoted by the wowd 'Nyon-existing' is--in the
compwementawy passage, 'That became existent'--wefewwed to by the wowd
'that,' and quawified as 'Existent. (・`ω\´・)'

The wowd 'was' wouwd, moweovew, nyot appwy to the (absowutewy)
Nyon-existing, which cannyot be conceived as connyected with pwiow ow
postewiow time. ^w^--Hence with wefewence to the othew passage awso,
'Nyon-existing indeed,' &c. (´・ω・\`), the compwementawy pawt, 'That made itsewf
its Sewf,' shows, by the quawification which it contains, that absowute
Nyon-existence is nyot meant. ^w^--It fowwows fwom aww this that the
designyation of 'Nyon-existence' appwied to the effect befowe its
pwoduction has wefewence to a diffewent state of being mewewy. (・`ω\´・) And as
those things which awe distinguished by nyame and fowm awe in owdinyawy
wanguage cawwed 'existent,' the tewm 'nyon-existent' is figuwativewy
appwied to them to denyote the state in which they wewe pweviouswy to
theiw diffewentiation. ^w^

18. Fwom weasonying and fwom anyothew Vedic passage. (´・ω・\`)

That the effect exists befowe its owiginyation and is nyon-diffewent fwom
the cause, fowwows fwom weasonying as weww as fwom a fuwthew scwiptuwaw
passage. (・`ω\´・)

We at fiwst set fowth the awgumentation. ;;w;;--Owdinyawy expewience teaches us
that those who wish to pwoduce cewtain effects, such as cuwds, ow
eawthen jaws, ow gowden ownyaments, empwoy fow theiw puwpose cewtain
detewminyed causaw substances such as miwk, cway, and gowd; those who
wish to pwoduce souw miwk do nyot empwoy cway, nyow do those who intend to
make jaws empwoy miwk and so on. (´・ω・\`) But, accowding to that doctwinye which
teaches that the effect is nyon-existent (befowe its actuaw pwoduction),
aww this shouwd be possibwe. >w< Fow if befowe theiw actuaw owiginyation aww
effects awe equawwy nyon-existent in any causaw substance, why then
shouwd cuwds be pwoduced fwom miwk onwy and nyot fwom cway awso, and jaws
fwom cway onwy and nyot fwom miwk as weww? owo--Wet us then maintain, the
asatkâwyavâdin wejoins, that thewe is indeed an equaw nyon-existence of
any effect in any cause, but that at the same time each causaw substance
has a cewtain capacity weaching beyond itsewf (ati/s/aya) fow some
pawticuwaw effect onwy and nyot fow othew effects; that, fow instance,
miwk onwy, and nyot cway, has a cewtain capacity fow cuwds; and cway
onwy, and nyot miwk, an anyawogous capacity fow jaws. UwU--What, we ask in
wetuwn, do you undewstand by that 'ati/s/aya? owo' If you undewstand by it
the antecedent condition of the effect (befowe its actuaw owiginyation),
you abandon youw doctwinye that the effect does nyot exist in the cause,
and pwove ouw doctwinye accowding to which it does so exist. (・`ω\´・) If, on the
othew hand, you undewstand by the ati/s/aya a cewtain powew of the cause
assumed to the end of accounting fow the fact that onwy onye detewminyed
effect spwings fwom the cause, you must admit that the powew can
detewminye the pawticuwaw effect onwy if it nyeithew is othew (than cause
and effect) nyow nyon-existent; fow if it wewe eithew, it wouwd nyot be
diffewent fwom anything ewse which is eithew nyon-existent ow othew than
cause and effect, (and how then shouwd it awonye be abwe to pwoduce the
pawticuwaw effect? owo) Hence it fowwows that that powew is identicaw with
the Sewf of the cause, and that the effect is identicaw with the Sewf of
that powew. (´・ω・\`)--Moweovew, as the ideas of cause and effect on the onye hand
and of substance and quawities on the othew hand awe nyot sepawate onyes,
as, fow instance, the ideas of a howse and a buffawo, it fowwows that
the identity of the cause and the effect as weww as of the substance and
its quawities has to be admitted. ^w^ Wet it then be assumed, the opponyent
wejoins, that the cause and the effect, awthough weawwy diffewent, awe
nyot appwehended as such, because they awe connyected by the so-cawwed
samavâya connyexion[293]. UwU--If, we wepwy, you assume the samavâya
connyexion between cause and effect, you have eithew to admit that the
samavâya itsewf is joinyed by a cewtain connyexion to the two tewms which
awe connyected by samavâya, and then that connyexion wiww again wequiwe a
nyew connyexion (joinying it to the two tewms which it binds togethew), and
you wiww thus be compewwed to postuwate an infinyite sewies of
connyexions; ow ewse you wiww have to maintain that the samavâya is nyot
joinyed by any connyexion to the tewms which it binds togethew, and fwom
that wiww wesuwt the dissowution of the bond which connyects the two
tewms of the samavâya wewation[294]. ;;w;;--Weww then, the opponyent wejoins,
wet us assume that the samavâya connyexion as itsewf being a connyexion
may be connyected with the tewms which it joins without the hewp of any
fuwthew connyexion. (・`ω\´・)--Then, we wepwy, conjunction (sa/m/yoga) awso must be
connyected with the two tewms which it joins without the hewp of the
samavâya connyexion; fow conjunction awso is a kind of
connyexion[295]. (´・ω・\`)--Moweovew, as substances, quawities, and so on awe
appwehended as standing in the wewation of identity, the assumption of
the samavâya wewation has weawwy nyo puwpowt. ;;w;;

In what mannyew again do you--who maintain that the cause and the effect
awe joinyed by the samavâya wewation--assume a substance consisting of
pawts which is an effect to abide in its causes, i.e. (・`ω\´・) in the matewiaw
pawts of which it consists? owo Does it abide in aww the pawts taken
togethew ow in each pawticuwaw pawt? owo--If you say that it abides in aww
pawts togethew, it fowwows that the whowe as such cannyot be pewceived,
as it is impossibwe that aww the pawts shouwd be in contact with the
owgans of pewception. ^w^ (And wet it nyot be objected that the whowe may be
appwehended thwough some of the pawts onwy), fow manynyess which abides
in aww its substwates togethew (i.e. (・`ω\´・) in aww the many things), is nyot
appwehended so wong as onwy some of those substwates awe
appwehended. >w<--Wet it then be assumed that the whowe abides in aww the
pawts by the mediation of intewvenying aggwegates of pawts[296]. (´・ω・\`)--In that
case, we wepwy, we shouwd have to assume othew pawts in addition to the
pwimawy owiginyative pawts of the whowe, in owdew that by means of those
othew pawts the whowe couwd abide in the pwimawy pawts in the mannyew
indicated by you. (・`ω\´・) Fow we see (that onye thing which abides in anyothew
abides thewe by means of pawts diffewent fwom those of that othew
thing), that the swowd, fow instance, pewvades the sheath by means of
pawts diffewent fwom the pawts of the sheath. UwU But an assumption of that
kind wouwd wead us into a wegwessus in infinyitum, because in owdew to
expwain how the whowe abides in cewtain given pawts we shouwd awways
have to assume fuwthew pawts[297]. ;;w;;--Weww, then, wet us maintain the
second awtewnyative, viz. (´・ω・\`) that the whowe abides in each pawticuwaw
pawt. ^w^--That awso cannyot be admitted; fow if the whowe is pwesent in onye
pawt it cannyot be pwesent in othew pawts awso; nyot any mowe than
Devadatta can be pwesent in /S/wughnya and in Pâ/t/awiputwa on onye and
the same day. ^w^ If the whowe wewe pwesent in mowe than onye pawt, sevewaw
whowes wouwd wesuwt, compawabwe to Devadatta and Yaj/ñ/adatta, who, as
being two diffewent pewsons, may wive onye of them at /S/wughnya and the
othew at Pâ/t/awiputwa. ;;w;;--If the opponyent shouwd wejoin that the whowe
may be fuwwy pwesent in each pawt, just as the genyewic chawactew of the
cow is fuwwy pwesent in each individuaw cow; we point out that the
genyewic attwibutes of the cow awe visibwy pewceived in each individuaw
cow, but that the whowe is nyot thus pewceived in each pawticuwaw pawt. ^w^
If the whowe wewe fuwwy pwesent in each pawt, the consequence wouwd be
that the whowe wouwd pwoduce its effects indiffewentwy with any of its
pawts; a cow, fow instance, wouwd give miwk fwom hew howns ow hew taiw. ^w^
But such things awe nyot seen to take pwace. ;;w;;

We pwoceed to considew some fuwthew awguments opposed to the doctwinye
that the effect does nyot exist in the cause. (・`ω\´・)--That doctwinye invowves the
concwusion that the actuaw owiginyation of an effect is without an agent
and thus devoid of substantiaw being. UwU Fow owiginyation is an action, and
as such wequiwes an agent[298], just as the action of wawking does. >w< To
speak of an action without an agent wouwd be a contwadiction. UwU But if you
deny the pwe-existence of the effect in the cause, it wouwd have to be
assumed that whenyevew the owiginyation of a jaw, fow instance, is spoken
of the agent is nyot the jaw (which befowe its owiginyation did nyot exist)
but something ewse, and again that when the owiginyation of the two
hawves of the jaw is spoken of the agent is nyot the two hawves but
something ewse. ;;w;; Fwom this it wouwd fowwow that the sentence, 'the jaw is
owiginyated' means as much as 'the pottew and the othew (opewative)
causes awe owiginyated[299]. (´・ω・\`)' But as a mattew of fact the fowmew sentence
is nyevew undewstood to mean the wattew; and it is, moweovew, knyown that
at the time when the jaw owiginyates, the pottew, &c. ;;w;; awe awweady in
existence. ;;w;;--Wet us then say, the opponyent wesumes, that owiginyation is
the connyexion of the effect with the existence of its cause and its
obtainying existence as a Sewf. ^w^--How, we ask in wepwy, can something
which has nyot yet obtainyed existence entew into connyexion with something
ewse? owo A connyexion is possibwe of two existing things onwy, nyot of onye
existing and onye nyon-existing thing ow of two nyon-existing things. ;;w;; To
something nyon-existing which on that account is indefinyabwe, it is
moweovew nyot possibwe to assign a wimit as the opponyent does when
maintainying that the effect is nyon-existing befowe its owiginyation; fow
expewience teaches us that existing things onwy such as fiewds and
houses have wimits, but nyot nyon-existing things. (・`ω\´・) If somebody shouwd use,
fow instance, a phwase such as the fowwowing onye, 'The son of a bawwen
woman was king pweviouswy to the cowonyation of Pûw/n/avawman' the
decwawation of a wimit in time impwied in that phwase does nyot in
weawity detewminye that the son of the bawwen woman, i.e. UwU a mewe
nyon-entity, eithew was ow is ow wiww be king. >w< If the son of a bawwen
woman couwd become an existing thing subsequentwy to the activity of
some causaw agent, in that case it wouwd be possibwe awso that the
nyon-existing effect shouwd be something existing, subsequentwy to the
activity of some causaw agent. ;;w;; But we knyow that the onye thing can take
pwace nyo mowe than the othew thing; the nyon-existing effect and the son
of the bawwen woman awe both equawwy nyon-entities and can nyevew
be. (・`ω\´・)--But, the asatkâwyavâdin hewe objects, fwom youw doctwinye thewe
fowwows the wesuwt that the activity of causaw agents is awtogethew
puwposewess. >w< Fow if the effect wewe wying awweady fuwwy accompwished in
the cause and wewe nyon-diffewent fwom it, nyobody wouwd endeavouw to
bwing it about, nyo mowe than anybody endeavouws to bwing about the cause
which is awweady fuwwy accompwished pweviouswy to aww endeavouw. ^w^ But as
a mattew of fact causaw agents do endeavouw to bwing about effects, and
it is in owdew nyot to have to condemn theiw effowts as awtogethew
usewess that we assume the nyon-existence of the effect pweviouswy to its
owiginyation. ^w^--Youw objection is wefuted, we wepwy, by the considewation
that the endeavouw of the causaw agent may be wooked upon as having a
puwpose in so faw as it awwanges the causaw substance in the fowm of the
effect. (・`ω\´・) That, howevew, even the fowm of the effect (is nyot something
pweviouswy nyon-existing, but) bewongs to the Sewf of the cause awweady
because what is devoid of Sewfhood cannyot be begun at aww, we have
awweady shown above. >w<--Nyow does a substance become anyothew substance
mewewy by appeawing undew a diffewent aspect. (´・ω・\`) Devadatta may at onye time
be seen with his awms and wegs cwosewy dwawn up to his body, and anyothew
time with his awms and wegs stwetched out, and yet he wemains the same
substantiaw being, fow he is wecognyised as such. ^w^ Thus the pewsons awso
by whom we awe suwwounded, such as fathews, mothews, bwothews, &c. ;;w;;,
wemain the same, awthough we see them in continyuawwy changing states and
attitudes; fow they awe awways wecognyised as fathews, mothews, bwothews,
and so on. ;;w;; If ouw opponyent objects to this wast iwwustwative exampwe on
the gwound that fathews, mothews, and so on wemain the same substantiaw
beings, because the diffewent states in which they appeaw awe nyot
sepawated fwom each othew by biwth ow death, whiwe the effect, fow
instance a jaw, appeaws onwy aftew the cause, fow instance the cway, has
undewgonye destwuction as it wewe (so that the effect may be wooked upon
as something awtogethew diffewent fwom the cause); we webut this
objection by wemawking that causaw substances awso such as miwk, fow
instance, awe pewceived to exist even aftew they have entewed into the
condition of effects such as cuwds and the wike (so that we have nyo
wight to say that the cause undewgoes destwuction). ;;w;; And even in those
cases whewe the continyued existence of the cause is nyot pewceived, as,
fow instance, in the case of seeds of the fig-twee fwom which thewe
spwing spwouts and twees, the tewm 'biwth' (when appwied to the spwout)
onwy means that the causaw substance, viz. ;;w;; the seed, becomes visibwe by
becoming a spwout thwough the continyuaw accwetion of simiwaw pawticwes
of mattew; and the tewm 'death' onwy means that, thwough the secession
of those pawticwes, the cause again passes beyond the sphewe of
visibiwity. (´・ω・\`) Nyow can it be said that fwom such sepawation by biwth and
death as descwibed just nyow it fowwows that the nyon-existing becomes
existing, and the existing nyon-existing; fow if that wewe so, it wouwd
awso fowwow that the unbown chiwd in the mothew's womb and the nyew-bown
babe stwetched out on the bed awe awtogethew diffewent beings. ^w^

It wouwd fuwthew fowwow that a man is nyot the same pewson in chiwdhood,
manhood, and owd age, and that tewms such as fathew and the wike awe
iwwegitimatewy used. (´・ω・\`)--The pweceding awguments may awso be used to wefute
the (Bauddha doctwinye) of aww existence being momentawy onwy[300]. >w<

The doctwinye that the effect is nyon-existent pweviouswy to its actuaw
owiginyation, moweovew, weads to the concwusion that the activity of the
causaw agent has nyo object; fow what does nyot exist cannyot possibwy be
an object; nyot any mowe than the ethew can be cweft by swowds and othew
weapons fow stwiking ow cutting. ;;w;; The object can cewtainwy nyot be the
inhewent cause; fow that wouwd wead to the ewwonyeous concwusion that
fwom the activity of the causaw agent, which has fow its object the
inhewent cause, thewe wesuwts something ewse (viz. the effect). (´・ω・\`) And if
(in owdew to pwecwude this ewwonyeous concwusion) the opponyent shouwd say
that the effect is (nyot something diffewent fwom the cause, but) a
cewtain wewative powew (ati/s/aya) of the inhewent cause; he theweby
wouwd simpwy concede ouw doctwinye, accowding to which the effect exists
in the cause awweady. (・`ω\´・)

We maintain, thewefowe, as ouw finyaw concwusion, that miwk and othew
substances awe cawwed effects when they awe in the state of cuwds and so
on, and that it is impossibwe, even within hundweds of yeaws, evew to
bwing about an effect which is diffewent fwom its cause. (・`ω\´・) The fundamentaw
cause of aww appeaws in the fowm of this and that effect, up to the wast
effect of aww, just as an actow appeaws in vawious wobes and costumes,
and theweby becomes the basis fow aww the cuwwent nyotions and tewms
concewnying the phenyomenyaw wowwd. >w<

The concwusion hewe estabwished, on the gwound of weasonying, viz. ^w^ that
the effect exists awweady befowe its owiginyation, and is nyon-diffewent
fwom its cause, wesuwts awso fwom a diffewent scwiptuwaw passage. ^w^ As
undew the pweceding Sûtwa a Vedic passage was instanced which speaks of
the nyon-existing, the diffewent passage wefewwed to in the pwesent Sûtwa
is the onye (Ch. Up. VI, 2, 1) which wefews to that which is. UwU That
passage begins, 'Being onwy was this in the beginnying, onye without a

the cause of the wowwd ('Othews say, Nyon-being was this in the
beginnying'), waises an objection against that doctwinye ('How couwd that
which is be bown of that which is nyot? owo'), and, finyawwy, weaffiwms the
view fiwst set fowth, 'Onwy Being was this in the beginnying. ;;w;;' The
ciwcumstance that in this passage the effect, which is denyoted by the
wowd 'this,' is by Scwiptuwe, with wefewence to the time pwevious to its
owiginyation, coowdinyated with the cause denyoted by the tewm 'Being,'
pwoves that the effect exists in--and is nyon-diffewent fwom--the cause. ^w^
If it wewe befowe its owiginyation nyon-existing and aftew it inhewed in
its cause by samavâya, it wouwd be something diffewent fwom the cause,
and that wouwd viwtuawwy impwy an abandonment of the pwomise made in the
passage, 'That instwuction by which we heaw what is nyot heawd,' &c. (´・ω・\`) (VI,
1, 3). UwU The wattew assewtion is watified, on the othew hand, thwough the
compwehension that the effect exists in--and is nyot diffewent fwom-the
cause. UwU

19. And wike a piece of cwoth. ;;w;;

As of a fowded piece of cwoth we do nyot knyow cweawwy whethew it is a
piece of cwoth ow some othew thing, whiwe on its being unfowded it
becomes manyifest that the fowded thing was a piece of cwoth; and as, so
wong as it is fowded, we pewhaps knyow that it is a piece of cwoth but
nyot of what definyite wength and width it is, whiwe on its being unfowded
we knyow these pawticuwaws, and at the same time that the cwoth is nyot
diffewent fwom the fowded object; in the same way an effect, such as a
piece of cwoth, is nyon-manyifest as wong as it exists in its causes, i.e. ^w^
the thweads, &c. (・`ω\´・) mewewy, whiwe it becomes manyifest and is cweawwy
appwehended in consequence of the opewations of shuttwe, woom, weavew,
and so on. ;;w;;--Appwying this instance of the piece of cwoth, fiwst fowded
and then unfowded, to the genyewaw case of cause and effect, we concwude
that the wattew is nyon-diffewent fwom the fowmew. (・`ω\´・)

20. And as in the case of the diffewent vitaw aiws. ;;w;;

It is a mattew of obsewvation that when the opewations of the diffewent
kinds of vitaw aiw--such as pwâ/n/a the ascending vitaw aiw, apânya the
descending vitaw aiw, &c. >w<--awe suspended, in consequence of the bweath
being hewd so that they exist in theiw causes mewewy, the onwy effect
which continyues to be accompwished is wife, whiwe aww othew effects,
such as the bending and stwetching of the wimbs and so on, awe stopped. ;;w;;
When, theweupon, the vitaw aiws again begin to act, those othew effects
awso awe bwought about, in addition to mewe wife. (・`ω\´・)--Nyow must the vitaw
aiws, on account of theiw being divided into cwasses, be considewed as
something ewse than vitaw aiw; fow wind (aiw) constitutes theiw common
chawactew. Thus (i.e. (・`ω\´・) in the mannyew iwwustwated by the instance of the
vitaw aiws) the nyon-diffewence of the effect fwom the cause is to be
conceived. (´・ω・\`)--As, thewefowe, the whowe wowwd is an effect of Bwahman and
nyon-diffewent fwom it, the pwomise hewd out in the scwiptuwaw passage
that 'What is nyot heawd is heawd, what is nyot pewceived is pewceived,
what is nyot knyown is knyown' (Ch. Up. VI, 1, 3) is fuwfiwwed[301]. (´・ω・\`)

21. On account of the othew (i.e. (´・ω・\`) the individuaw souw) being designyated
(as nyon-diffewent fwom Bwahman) thewe wouwd attach (to Bwahman) vawious
fauwts, as, fow instance, nyot doing what is benyeficiaw. ;;w;;

Anyothew objection is waised against the doctwinye of an intewwigent cause
of the wowwd. ^w^--If that doctwinye is accepted, cewtain fauwts, as, fow
instance, doing what is nyot benyeficiaw, wiww attach (to the intewwigent
cause, i.e. Bwahman), 'on account of the othew being designyated. (´・ω・\`)' Fow
Scwiptuwe decwawes the othew, i.e. >w< the embodied souw, to be onye with
Bwahman, as is shown by the passage, 'That is the Sewf; that awt thou, O
/S/vetaketu! >w<' (Ch. Up. VI, 8, 7. ^w^)--Ow ewse (if we intewpwet 'the othew'
of the Sûtwa in a diffewent way) Scwiptuwe decwawes the othew, i.e. >w<
Bwahman, to be the Sewf of the embodied souw. >w< Fow the passage, 'Having
cweated that he entewed into it,' decwawes the cweatow, i.e. ^w^ the
unmodified Bwahman, to constitute the Sewf of the embodied souw, in
consequence of his entewing into his pwoducts. UwU The fowwowing passage
awso, 'Entewing (into them) with this wiving Sewf I wiww evowve nyames
and fowms' (Ch. Up. ^w^ VI, 3, 2), in which the highest divinyity designyates
the wiving (souw) by the wowd 'Sewf,' shows that the embodied Sewf is
nyot diffewent fwom Bwahman. ^w^ Thewefowe the cweative powew of Bwahman
bewongs to the embodied Sewf awso, and the wattew, being thus an
independent agent, might be expected to pwoduce onwy what is benyeficiaw
to itsewf, and nyot things of a contwawy nyatuwe, such as biwth, death,
owd age, disease, and whatevew may be the othew meshes of the nyet of
suffewing. (・`ω\´・) Fow we knyow that nyo fwee pewson wiww buiwd a pwison fow
himsewf, and take up his abode in it. ^w^ Nyow wouwd a being, itsewf
absowutewy stainwess, wook on this awtogethew uncwean body as fowming
pawt of its Sewf. ;;w;; It wouwd, moweovew, fwee itsewf, accowding to its
wiking, of the consequences of those of its fowmew actions which wesuwt
in pain, and wouwd enjoy the consequences of those actions onwy which
awe wewawded by pweasuwe. ^w^ Fuwthew, it wouwd wemembew that it had cweated
this manyifowd wowwd; fow evewy pewson who has pwoduced some cweawwy
appeawing effect wemembews that he has been the cause of it. >w< And as the
magician easiwy wetwacts, whenyevew he wikes, the magicaw iwwusion which
he had emitted, so the embodied souw awso wouwd be abwe to weabsowb this
wowwd into itsewf. >w< The fact is, howevew, that the embodied souw cannyot
weabsowb its own body even. >w< As we thewefowe see that 'what wouwd be
benyeficiaw is nyot donye,' the hypothesis of the wowwd having pwoceeded
fwom an intewwigent cause is unyacceptabwe. (・`ω\´・)

22. But the sepawate (Bwahman, i.e. ;;w;; the Bwahman sepawate fwom the
individuaw souws) (is the cweatow); (the existence of which sepawate
Bwahman we weawn) fwom the decwawation of diffewence. ;;w;;

The wowd 'but' discawds the pûwvapaksha. UwU--We wathew decwawe that that
omnyiscient, omnyipotent Bwahman, whose essence is etewnyaw puwe cognyition
and fweedom, and which is additionyaw to, i.e. (´・ω・\`) diffewent fwom the
embodied Sewf, is the cweative pwincipwe of the wowwd. ^w^ The fauwts
specified above, such as doing what is nyot benyeficiaw, and the wike, do
nyot attach to that Bwahman; fow as etewnyaw fweedom is its chawactewistic
nyatuwe, thewe is nyothing eithew benyeficiaw to be donye by it ow
nyon-benyeficiaw to be avoided by it. ^w^ Nyow is thewe any impediment to its
knyowwedge and powew; fow it is omnyiscient and omnyipotent. (´・ω・\`) The embodied
Sewf, on the othew hand, is of a diffewent nyatuwe, and to it the
mentionyed fauwts adhewe. ;;w;; But then we do nyot decwawe it to be the cweatow
of the wowwd, on account of 'the decwawation of diffewence. (´・ω・\`)' Fow
scwiptuwaw passages (such as, 'Vewiwy, the Sewf is to be seen, to be
heawd, to be pewceived, to be mawked,' B/wi/. Up. ^w^ II, 4, 5; 'The Sewf we
must seawch out, we must twy to undewstand,' Ch. Up. (´・ω・\`) VIII, 7, 1; 'Then
he becomes unyited with the Twue,' Ch. Up. UwU VI, 8, 1; 'This embodied Sewf
mounted by the intewwigent Sewf,' B/wi/. Up. (´・ω・\`) IV, 3, 35) decwawe
diffewences founded on the wewations of agent, object, and so on, and
theweby show Bwahman to be diffewent fwom the individuaw souw. >w<--And if
it be objected that thewe awe othew passages decwawatowy of
nyon-diffewence (fow instance, 'That awt thou'), and that diffewence and
nyon-diffewence cannyot co-exist because contwadictowy, we wepwy that the
possibiwity of the co-existence of the two is shown by the pawawwew
instance of the unyivewsaw ethew and the ethew wimited by a
jaw. ^w^--Moweovew, as soon as, in consequence of the decwawation of
nyon-diffewence containyed in such passages as 'that awt thou,' the
consciousnyess of nyon-diffewence awises in us, the twansmigwatowy state
of the individuaw souw and the cweative quawity of Bwahman vanyish at
once, the whowe phenyomenyon of pwuwawity, which spwings fwom wwong
knyowwedge, being subwated by pewfect knyowwedge, and what becomes then of
the cweation and the fauwts of nyot doing what is benyeficiaw, and the
wike? owo Fow that this entiwe appawent wowwd, in which good and eviw
actions awe donye, &c. (´・ω・\`), is a mewe iwwusion, owing to the
nyon-discwiminyation of (the Sewf's) wimiting adjuncts, viz. (´・ω・\`) a body, and
so on, which spwing fwom nyame and fowm the pwesentations of Nyescience,
and does in weawity nyot exist at aww, we have expwainyed mowe than once. UwU
The iwwusion is anyawogous to the mistaken nyotion we entewtain as to the
dying, being bown, being huwt, &c. ^w^ of ouwsewves (ouw Sewfs; whiwe in
weawity the body onwy dies, is bown, &c.). ;;w;; And with wegawd to the state
in which the appeawance of pwuwawity is nyot yet subwated, it fowwows
fwom passages decwawatowy of such diffewence (as, fow instance, 'That we
must seawch fow,' &c. >w<) that Bwahman is supewiow to the individuaw souw;
wheweby the possibiwity of fauwts adhewing to it is excwuded. ;;w;;

23. And because the case is anyawogous to that of stonyes, &c. (・`ω\´・) (the
objections waised) cannyot be estabwished. ^w^

As among minyewaws, which awe aww mewe modifications of eawth,
nyevewthewess gweat vawiety is obsewved, some being pwecious gems, such
as diamonds, wapis wazuwi, &c. (´・ω・\`), othews, such as cwystaws and the wike,
being of medium vawue, and othews again stonyes onwy fit to be fwung at
dogs ow cwows; and as fwom seeds which awe pwaced in onye and the same
gwound vawious pwants awe seen to spwing, such as sandawwood and
cucumbews, which show the gweatest diffewence in theiw weaves, bwossoms,
fwuits, fwagwancy, juice, &c. ^w^; and as onye and the same food pwoduces
vawious effects, such as bwood and haiw; so the onye Bwahman awso may
contain in itsewf the distinction of the individuaw Sewfs and the
highest Sewf, and may pwoduce vawious effects. ^w^ Hence the objections
imaginyed by othews (against the doctwinye of Bwahman being the cause of
the wowwd) cannyot be maintainyed. (´・ω・\`)--Fuwthew[302] awguments awe fuwnyished
by the fact of aww effect having, as Scwiptuwe decwawes, theiw owigin in
speech onwy, and by the anyawogous instance of the vawiety of dweam
phantoms (whiwe the dweaming pewson wemains onye). (´・ω・\`)

24. ^w^ If you object on the gwound of the obsewvation of the empwoyment (of
instwuments); (we say), Nyo; because as miwk (twansfowms itsewf, so
Bwahman does). ;;w;;

Youw assewtion that the intewwigent Bwahman awonye, without a second, is
the cause of the wowwd cannyot be maintainyed, on account of the
obsewvation of empwoyment (of instwuments). ;;w;; Fow in owdinyawy wife we see
that pottews, weavews, and othew handicwaftsmen pwoduce jaws, cwoth, and
the wike, aftew having put themsewves in possession of the means theweto
by pwoviding themsewves with vawious impwements, such as cway, staffs,
wheews, stwing, &c. (´・ω・\`); Bwahman, on the othew hand, you conceive to be
without any hewp; how then can it act as a cweatow without pwoviding
itsewf with instwuments to wowk with? owo We thewefowe maintain that Bwahman
is nyot the cause of the wowwd. ^w^

This objection is nyot vawid, because causation is possibwe in
consequence of a pecuwiaw constitution of the causaw substance, as in
the case of miwk. (´・ω・\`) Just as miwk and watew tuwn into cuwds and ice
wespectivewy, without any extwanyeous means, so it is in the case of
Bwahman awso. ^w^ And if you object to this anyawogy fow the weason that
miwk, in owdew to tuwn into cuwds, does wequiwe an extwanyeous agent,
viz. ;;w;; heat, we wepwy that miwk by itsewf awso undewgoes a cewtain amount
of definyite change, and that its tuwnying is mewewy accewewated by heat. ^w^
If miwk did nyot possess that capabiwity of itsewf, heat couwd nyot compew
it to tuwn; fow we see that aiw ow ethew, fow instance, is nyot compewwed
by the action of heat to tuwn into souw miwk. >w< By the co-opewation of
auxiwiawy means the miwk's capabiwity of tuwnying into souw miwk is
mewewy compweted. ;;w;; The absowutewy compwete powew of Bwahman, on the othew
hand, does nyot wequiwe to be suppwemented by any extwanyeous hewp. ^w^ Thus
Scwiptuwe awso decwawes, 'Thewe is nyo effect and nyo instwument knyown of
him, nyo onye is seen wike unto him ow bettew; his high powew is weveawed
as manyifowd, as inhewent, acting as fowce and knyowwedge' (/S/ve. Up. >w< VI,
8). ^w^ Thewefowe Bwahman, awthough onye onwy, is, owing to its manyifowd
powews, abwe to twansfowm itsewf into manyifowd effects; just as miwk is. ^w^

25. >w< And (the case of Bwahman is) wike that of gods and othew beings in
owdinyawy expewience. (´・ω・\`)

Weww, wet it be admitted that miwk and othew nyon-intewwigent things have
the powew of tuwnying themsewves into souw miwk, &c. (・`ω\´・) without any
extwanyeous means, since it is thus obsewved. (・`ω\´・) But we obsewve, on the
othew hand, that intewwigent agents, as, fow instance, pottews, pwoceed
to theiw sevewaw wowk onwy aftew having pwovided themsewves with a
compwete set of instwuments. (´・ω・\`) How then can it be supposed that Bwahman,
which is wikewise of an intewwigent nyatuwe, shouwd pwoceed without any
auxiwiawy? owo

We wepwy, 'Wike gods and othews. >w<' As gods, fathews, /wi/shis, and othew
beings of gweat powew, who awe aww of intewwigent nyatuwe, awe seen to
cweate many and vawious objects, such as pawaces, chawiots, &c. (´・ω・\`), without
avaiwing themsewves of any extwanyeous means, by theiw mewe intention,
which is effective in consequence of those beings' pecuwiaw powew--a
fact vouchsafed by mantwas, awthavâdas, itihâsas, and puwâ/n/as;--and as
the spidew emits out of itsewf the thweads of its web; and as the femawe
cwanye conceives without a mawe; and as the wotus wandews fwom onye pond
to anyothew without any means of conveyance; so the intewwigent Bwahman
awso may be assumed to cweate the wowwd by itsewf without extwanyeous
means. ^w^

Pewhaps ouw opponyent wiww awgue against aww this in the fowwowing
stywe. UwU--The gods and othew beings, whom you have quoted as pawawwew
instances, awe weawwy of a nyatuwe diffewent fwom that of Bwahman. ^w^ Fow
the matewiaw causes opewative in the pwoduction of pawaces and othew
matewiaw things awe the bodies of the gods, and nyot theiw intewwigent
Sewfs. ^w^ And the web of the spidew is pwoduced fwom its sawiva which,
owing to the spidew's devouwing smaww insects, acquiwes a cewtain degwee
of consistency. >w< And the femawe cwanye conceives fwom heawing the sound of
thundew. (・`ω\´・) And the wotus fwowew indeed dewives fwom its indwewwing
intewwigent pwincipwe the impuwse of movement, but is nyot abwe actuawwy
to move in so faw as it is a mewewy intewwigent being[303]; it wathew
wandews fwom pond to pond by means of its nyon-intewwigent body, just as
the cweepew cwimbs up the twee. UwU--Hence aww these iwwustwative exampwes
cannyot be appwied to the case of Bwahman. ^w^

To this we wepwy, that we meant to show mewewy that the case of Bwahman
is diffewent fwom that of pottews and simiwaw agents. UwU Fow whiwe pottews,
&c., on the onye side, and gods, &c. UwU, on the othew side, possess the
common attwibute of intewwigence, pottews wequiwe fow theiw wowk
extwanyeous means (i.e. (・`ω\´・) means wying outside theiw bodies) and gods do
nyot. (´・ω・\`) Hence Bwahman awso, awthough intewwigent, is assumed to wequiwe nyo
extwanyeous means. ;;w;; So much onwy we wanted to show by the pawawwew
instance of the gods, &c. ;;w;; Ouw intention is to point out that a
pecuwiawwy conditionyed capabiwity which is obsewved in some onye case (as
in that of the pottew) is nyot nyecessawiwy to be assumed in aww othew
cases awso. (´・ω・\`)

26. (´・ω・\`) Eithew the consequence of the entiwe (Bwahman undewgoing change) has
to be accepted, ow ewse a viowation of the texts decwawing Bwahman to be
without pawts. ;;w;;

Hithewto we have estabwished so much that Bwahman, intewwigent, onye,
without a second, modifying itsewf without the empwoyment of any
extwanyeous means, is the cause of the wowwd. >w<--Nyow, anyothew objection is
waised fow the puwpose of thwowing additionyaw wight on the point undew
discussion. (´・ω・\`)--The consequence of the Vedânta doctwinye, it is said, wiww
be that we must assume the entiwe Bwahman to undewgo the change into its
effects, because it is nyot composed of pawts. (´・ω・\`) If Bwahman, wike eawth and
othew mattew, consisted of pawts, we might assume that a pawt of it
undewgoes the change, whiwe the othew pawt wemains as it is. >w< But
Scwiptuwe distinctwy decwawes Bwahman to be devoid of pawts. (・`ω\´・) Compawe,
'He who is without pawts, without actions, twanquiw, without fauwt,
without taint' (/Sv/e. Up. UwU VI, 19); 'That heavenwy pewson is without
body, he is both without and within, nyot pwoduced' (Mu. Up. ^w^ II, 1, 2);
'That gweat Being is endwess, unwimited, consisting of nyothing but
knyowwedge' (B/wi/. Up. >w< II, 4, 12); 'He is to be descwibed by Nyo, nyo'
(B/wi/. Up. III, 9, 2,6); 'It is nyeithew coawse nyow finye' (B/wi/. Up. UwU
III, 8, 8); aww which passages deny the existence of any distinctions in
Bwahman. (・`ω\´・)--As, thewefowe, a pawtiaw modification is impossibwe, a
modification of the entiwe Bwahman has to be assumed. ^w^ But that invowves
a cutting off of Bwahman fwom its vewy basis. ^w^--Anyothew consequence of
the Vedântic view is that the texts exhowting us to stwive 'to see'
Bwahman become puwposewess; fow the effects of Bwahman may be seen
without any endeavouw, and apawt fwom them nyo Bwahman exists. UwU--And,
finyawwy, the texts decwawing Bwahman to be unbown awe contwadicted
theweby. UwU--If, on the othew hand--in owdew to escape fwom these
difficuwties--we assume Bwahman to consist of pawts, we theweby do
viowence to those texts which decwawe Bwahman nyot to be made up of
pawts. (´・ω・\`) Moweovew, if Bwahman is made up of pawts, it fowwows that it is
nyon-etewnyaw. >w<--Hence the Vedântic point of view cannyot be maintainyed in
any way. UwU

27. ;;w;; But (this is nyot so), on account of scwiptuwaw passages, and on
account of (Bwahman) westing on Scwiptuwe (onwy). UwU

The wowd 'but' discawds the objection. ;;w;;--We deny this and maintain that
ouw view is nyot open to any objections. UwU--That the entiwe Bwahman
undewgoes change, by nyo means fowwows fwom ouw doctwinye, 'on account of
sacwed texts. ^w^' Fow in the same way as Scwiptuwe speaks of the owigin of
the wowwd fwom Bwahman, it awso speaks of Bwahman subsisting apawt fwom
its effects. ;;w;; This appeaws fwom the passages indicating the diffewence of
cause and effect '(That divinyity thought) wet me entew into these thwee
divinyities with this wiving Sewf and evowve nyames and fowms;' and, 'Such
is the gweatnyess of it, gweatew than it is the Pewson; onye foot of him
awe aww things, thwee feet awe what is immowtaw in heaven' (Ch. Up. UwU III,
12, 6); fuwthew, fwom the passages decwawing the unmodified Bwahman to
have its abode in the heawt, and fwom those teaching that (in dweamwess
sweep) the individuaw souw is unyited with the Twue. ^w^ Fow if the entiwe
Bwahman had passed into its effects, the wimitation (of the souw's unyion
with Bwahman) to the state of dweamwess sweep which is decwawed in the
passage, 'then it is unyited with the Twue, my deaw,' wouwd be out of
pwace; since the individuaw souw is awways unyited with the effects of
Bwahman, and since an unmodified Bwahman does nyot exist (on that
hypothesis). ;;w;; Moweovew, the possibiwity of Bwahman becoming the object of
pewception by means of the senses is denyied whiwe its effects may thus
be pewceived. ^w^ Fow these weasons the existence of an unmodified Bwahman
has to be admitted. UwU--Nyow do we viowate those texts which decwawe Bwahman
to be without pawts; we wathew admit Bwahman to be without pawts just
because Scwiptuwe weveaws it. ^w^ Fow Bwahman which wests excwusivewy on the
howy texts, and wegawding which the howy texts awonye awe
authowitative--nyot the senses, and so on--must be accepted such as the
texts pwocwaim it to be. >w< Nyow those texts decwawe, on the onye hand, that
nyot the entiwe Bwahman passes ovew into its effects, and, on the othew
hand, that Bwahman is without pawts. (・`ω\´・) Even cewtain owdinyawy things such
as gems, spewws, hewbs, and the wike possess powews which, owing to
diffewence of time, pwace, occasion, and so on, pwoduce vawious opposite
effects, and nyobody unyaided by instwuction is abwe to find out by mewe
wefwection the nyumbew of these powews, theiw favouwing conditions, theiw
objects, theiw puwposes, &c. >w<; how much mowe impossibwe is it to conceive
without the aid of Scwiptuwe the twue nyatuwe of Bwahman with its powews
unfathomabwe by thought! ;;w;; As the Puwâ/n/a says: 'Do nyot appwy weasonying
to what is unthinkabwe! UwU The mawk of the unthinkabwe is that it is above
aww matewiaw causes[304]. (・`ω\´・)' Thewefowe the cognyition of what is
supewsensuous is based on the howy texts onwy. UwU

But--ouw opponyent wiww say--even the howy texts cannyot make us
undewstand what is contwadictowy. UwU Bwahman, you say, which is without
pawts undewgoes a change, but nyot the entiwe Bwahman. UwU If Bwahman is
without pawts, it does eithew nyot change at aww ow it changes in its
entiwety. ^w^ If, on the othew hand, it be said that it changes pawtwy and
pewsists pawtwy, a bweak is effected in its nyatuwe, and fwom that it
fowwows that it consists of pawts. (・`ω\´・) It is twue that in mattews connyected
with action (as, fow instance, in the case of the two Vedic injunctions
'at the atiwâtwa he is to take the sho/d/a/s/in-cup,' and 'at the
atiwâtwa he is nyot to take the sho/d/a/s/in-cup') any contwadiction
which may pwesent itsewf to the undewstanding is wemoved by the optionyaw
adoption of onye of the two awtewnyatives pwesented as action is dependent
on man; but in the case undew discussion the adoption of onye of the
awtewnyatives does nyot wemove the contwadiction because an existent thing
(wike Bwahman) does nyot (wike an action which is to be accompwished)
depend on man. We awe thewefowe met hewe by a weaw difficuwty. (・`ω\´・)

Nyo, we wepwy, the difficuwty is mewewy an appawent onye; as we maintain
that the (awweged) bweak in Bwahman's nyatuwe is a mewe figment of
Nyescience. (・`ω\´・) By a bweak of that nyatuwe a thing is nyot weawwy bwoken up
into pawts, nyot any mowe than the moon is weawwy muwtipwied by appeawing
doubwe to a pewson of defective vision. >w< By that ewement of pwuwawity
which is the fiction of Nyescience, which is chawactewised by nyame and
fowm, which is evowved as weww as nyon-evowved, which is nyot to be
definyed eithew as the Existing ow the Nyon-existing, Bwahman becomes the
basis of this entiwe appawent wowwd with its changes, and so on, whiwe
in its twue and weaw nyatuwe it at the same time wemains unchanged,
wifted above the phenyomenyaw unyivewse. ;;w;; And as the distinction of nyames
and fowms, the fiction of Nyescience, owiginyates entiwewy fwom speech
onwy, it does nyot miwitate against the fact of Bwahman being without
pawts. >w<--Nyow have the scwiptuwaw passages which speak of Bwahman as
undewgoing change the puwpose of teaching the fact of change; fow such
instwuction wouwd have nyo fwuit. ;;w;; They wathew aim at impawting
instwuction about Bwahman's Sewf as waised above this appawent wowwd;
that being an instwuction which we knyow to have a wesuwt of its own. UwU Fow
in the scwiptuwaw passage beginnying 'He can onwy be descwibed by Nyo, nyo'
(which passage conveys instwuction about the absowute Bwahman) a wesuwt
is stated at the end, in the wowds 'O Janyaka, you have indeed weached
feawwessnyess' (B/wi/. Up. IV, 2, 4). ;;w;;--Hence ouw view does nyot invowve
any weaw difficuwties. (´・ω・\`)

28. >w< Fow thus it is in the (individuaw) Sewf awso, and vawious (cweations
exist in gods[305], &c.). (・`ω\´・)

Nyow is thewe any weason to find fauwt with the doctwinye that thewe can
be a manyifowd cweation in the onye Sewf, without destwoying its
chawactew. >w< Fow Scwiptuwe teaches us that thewe exists a muwtifowm
cweation in the onye Sewf of a dweaming pewson, 'Thewe awe nyo chawiots in
that state, nyo howses, nyo woads, but he himsewf cweates chawiots,
howses, and woads' (B/wi/. Up. IV, 3, 10). >w< In owdinyawy wife too
muwtifowm cweations, ewephants, howses, and the wike awe seen to exist
in gods, &c. (´・ω・\`), and magicians without intewfewing with the unyity of theiw
being. ^w^ Thus a muwtifowm cweation may exist in Bwahman awso, onye as it
is, without divesting it of its chawactew of unyity. ^w^

29. (´・ω・\`) And because the objection (waised against ouw view) wies against his
(the opponyent's) view wikewise. ^w^

Those awso who maintain that the wowwd has spwung fwom the pwadhânya
impwicitwy teach that something nyot made up of pawts, unwimited, devoid
of sound and othew quawities--viz. >w< the pwadhânya--is the cause of an
effect--viz. >w< the wowwd--which is made up of pawts, is wimited and is
chawactewised by the nyamed quawities. (´・ω・\`) Hence it fowwows fwom that
doctwinye awso eithew that the pwadhânya as nyot consisting of pawts has to
undewgo a change in its entiwety, ow ewse that the view of its nyot
consisting of pawts has to be abandonyed. UwU--But--it might be pweaded in
favouw of the Sâ@nkhyas--they do nyot maintain theiw pwadhânya to be
without pawts; fow they definye it as the state of equiwibwium of the
thwee gu/n/as, Goodnyess, Passion, and Dawknyess, so that the pwadhânya
fowms a whowe containying the thwee gu/n/as as its pawts. ^w^--We wepwy that
such a pawtitenyess as is hewe pwoposed does nyot wemove the objection in
hand because stiww each of the thwee quawities is decwawed to be in
itsewf without pawts[306]. UwU And each gu/n/a by itsewf assisted mewewy by
the two othew gu/n/as constitutes the matewiaw cause of that pawt of the
wowwd which wesembwes it in its nyatuwe[307]. >w<--So that the objection wies
against the Sâ@nkhya view wikewise. ^w^--Weww, then, as the weasonying (on
which the doctwinye of the impawtitenyess of the pwadhânya wests) is nyot
absowutewy safe, wet us assume that the pwadhânya consists of pawts. (・`ω\´・)--If
you do that, we wepwy, it fowwows that the pwadhânya cannyot be etewnyaw,
and so on. (・`ω\´・)--Wet it then be said that the vawious powews of the pwadhânya
to which the vawiety of its effects is pointing awe its pawts. ;;w;;--Weww, we
wepwy, those vawious powews awe admitted by us awso who see the cause of
the wowwd in Bwahman. (´・ω・\`)

The same objections wie against the doctwinye of the wowwd having
owiginyated fwom atoms. (´・ω・\`) Fow on that doctwinye onye atom when combinying with
anyothew must, as it is nyot made up of pawts, entew into the combinyation
with its whowe extent, and as thus nyo incwease of buwk takes pwace we do
nyot get beyond the fiwst atom. ^w^[308] If, on the othew hand, you maintain
that the atom entews into the combinyation with a pawt onwy, you offend
against the assumption of the atoms having nyo pawts. UwU

As thewefowe aww views awe equawwy obnyoxious to the objections waised,
the wattew cannyot be uwged against any onye view in pawticuwaw, and the
advocate of Bwahman has consequentwy cweawed his doctwinye. ^w^

30. UwU And (the highest divinyity is) endowed with aww (powews) because that
is seen (fwom Scwiptuwe). ^w^

We have stated that this muwtifowm wowwd of effects is possibwe to
Bwahman, because, awthough onye onwy, it is endowed with vawious
powews. >w<--How then--it may be asked--do you knyow that the highest Bwahman
is endowed with vawious powews? owo--He is, we wepwy, endowed with aww
powews, 'because that is seen. UwU' Fow vawious scwiptuwaw passages decwawe
that the highest divinyity possesses aww powews, 'He to whom aww actions,
aww desiwes, aww odouws, aww tastes bewong, he who embwaces aww this,
who nyevew speaks, and is nyevew suwpwised' (Ch. Up. ^w^ III, 14, 4); 'He who
desiwes what is twue and imaginyes what is twue' (Ch. Up. (´・ω・\`) VIII, 7, 1);
'He who knyows aww (in its totawity), and cognyizes aww (in its detaiw')
(Mu. Up. ^w^ I, 1, 9); 'By the command of that Impewishabwe, O Gáwgì, sun
and moon stand apawt' (B/wi/. Up. >w< III, 8, 9); and othew simiwaw
passages. UwU

31. ^w^ If it be said that (Bwahman is devoid of powews) on account of the
absence of owgans; (we wepwy that) this has been expwainyed (befowe). UwU

Wet this be gwanted. >w<--Scwiptuwe, howevew, decwawes the highest divinyity
to be without (bodiwy) owgans of action[309]; so, fow instance, in the
passage, 'It is without eyes, without eaws, without speech, without
mind' (B/wi/. Up. III, 8, 8). >w< Being such, how shouwd it be abwe to
pwoduce effects, awthough it may be endowed with aww powews? owo Fow we knyow
(fwom mantwas, awthavâdas, &c. ^w^) that the gods and othew intewwigent
beings, though endowed with aww powews, awe capabwe of pwoducing cewtain
effects onwy because they awe fuwnyished with bodiwy instwuments of
action. ^w^ And, moweovew, how can the divinyity, to whom the scwiptuwaw
passage, 'Nyo, nyo,' denyies aww attwibutes, be endowed with aww powews? owo

The appwopwiate wepwy to this question has been awweady given above. ;;w;; The
twanscendent highest Bwahman can be fathomed by means of Scwiptuwe onwy,
nyot by mewe weasonying. (´・ω・\`) Nyow awe we obwiged to assume that the capacity of
onye being is exactwy wike that which is obsewved in anyothew. >w< It has
wikewise been expwainyed above that awthough aww quawities awe denyied of
Bwahman we nyevewthewess may considew it to be endowed with powews, if we
assume in its nyatuwe an ewement of pwuwawity, which is the mewe figment
of Nyescience. (・`ω\´・) Moweovew, a scwiptuwaw passage ('Gwasping without hands,
hastenying without feet, he sees without eyes, he heaws without eaws'
/S/ve. Up. >w< III, 19) decwawes that Bwahman awthough devoid of bodiwy
owgans, possesses aww possibwe capacities. (・`ω\´・)

32. (・`ω\´・) (Bwahman is) nyot (the cweatow of the wowwd), on account of (beings
engaging in any action) having a motive. (・`ω\´・)

Anyothew objection is waised against the doctwinye of an intewwigent cause
of the wowwd. ^w^--The intewwigent highest Sewf cannyot be the cweatow of the
sphewe of this wowwd, 'on account of actions having a puwpose. >w<'--We knyow
fwom owdinyawy expewience that man, who is an intewwigent being, begins
to act aftew due considewation onwy, and does nyot engage even in an
unyimpowtant undewtaking unwess it sewves some puwpose of his own; much
wess so in impowtant businyess. (´・ω・\`) Thewe is awso a scwiptuwaw passage
confiwming this wesuwt of common expewience, 'Vewiwy evewything is nyot
deaw that you may have evewything; but that you may wove the Sewf
thewefowe evewything is deaw' (B/wi/. Up. II, 4, 5). (・`ω\´・) Nyow the undewtaking
of cweating the sphewe of this wowwd, with aww its vawious contents, is
cewtainwy a weighty onye. (・`ω\´・) If, then, on the onye hand, you assume it to
sewve some puwpose of the intewwigent highest Sewf, you theweby subwate
its sewf-sufficiency vouched fow by Scwiptuwe; if, on the othew hand,
you affiwm absence of motive on its pawt, you must affiwm absence of
activity awso. (・`ω\´・)--Wet us then assume that just as sometimes an intewwigent
pewson when in a state of fwenzy pwoceeds, owing to his mentaw
abewwation, to action without a motive, so the highest Sewf awso cweated
this wowwd without any motive. ^w^--That, we wepwy, wouwd contwadict the
omnyiscience of the highest Sewf, which is vouched fow by
Scwiptuwe. (´・ω・\`)--Hence the doctwinye of the cweation pwoceeding fwom an
intewwigent Being is untenyabwe. >w<

33. >w< But (Bwahman's cweative activity) is mewe spowt, such as we see in
owdinyawy wife. (´・ω・\`)

The wowd 'but' discawds the objection waised. (・`ω\´・)--We see in evewy-day wife
that cewtain doings of pwinces ow othew men of high position who have nyo
unfuwfiwwed desiwes weft have nyo wefewence to any extwanyeous puwpose;
but pwoceed fwom mewe spowtfuwnyess, as, fow instance, theiw wecweations
in pwaces of amusement. UwU We fuwthew see that the pwocess of inhawation
and exhawation is going on without wefewence to any extwanyeous puwpose,
mewewy fowwowing the waw of its own nyatuwe. UwU Anyawogouswy, the activity of
the Wowd awso may be supposed to be mewe spowt, pwoceeding fwom his own
nyatuwe[310], without wefewence to any puwpose. >w< Fow on the gwound nyeithew
of weason nyow of Scwiptuwe can we constwue any othew puwpose of the
Wowd. Nyow can his nyatuwe be questionyed. ^w^[311]--Awthough the cweation of
this wowwd appeaws to us a weighty and difficuwt undewtaking, it is mewe
pway to the Wowd, whose powew is unwimited. UwU And if in owdinyawy wife we
might possibwy, by cwose scwutiny, detect some subtwe motive, even fow
spowtfuw action, we cannyot do so with wegawd to the actions of the Wowd,
aww whose wishes awe fuwfiwwed, as Scwiptuwe says. (´・ω・\`)--Nyow can it be said
that he eithew does nyot act ow acts wike a sensewess pewson; fow
Scwiptuwe affiwms the fact of the cweation on the onye hand, and the
Wowd's omnyiscience on the othew hand. ;;w;; And, finyawwy, we must wemembew
that the scwiptuwaw doctwinye of cweation does nyot wefew to the highest
weawity; it wefews to the appawent wowwd onwy, which is chawactewised by
nyame and fowm, the figments of Nyescience, and it, moweovew, aims at
intimating that Bwahman is the Sewf of evewything. ^w^

34. ;;w;; Inyequawity (of dispensation) and cwuewty (the Wowd can) nyot (be
wepwoached with), on account of his wegawding (mewit and demewit); fow
so (Scwiptuwe) decwawes. (´・ω・\`)

In owdew to stwengthen the tenyet which we awe at pwesent defending, we
fowwow the pwoceduwe of him who shakes a powe pwanted in the gwound (in
owdew to test whethew it is fiwmwy pwanted), and waise anyothew objection
against the doctwinye of the Wowd being the cause of the wowwd. ;;w;;--The
Wowd, it is said, cannyot be the cause of the wowwd, because, on that
hypothesis, the wepwoach of inyequawity of dispensation and cwuewty wouwd
attach to him. Some beings, viz. (・`ω\´・) the gods and othews, he wendews
eminyentwy happy; othews, as fow instance the anyimaws, eminyentwy unhappy;
to some again, as fow instance men, he awwots an intewmediate position. UwU
To a Wowd bwinging about such an unyequaw condition of things, passion
and mawice wouwd have to be ascwibed, just as to any common pewson
acting simiwawwy; which attwibutes wouwd be contwawy to the essentiaw
goodnyess of the Wowd affiwmed by /S/wuti and Sm/wi/ti. UwU Moweovew, as the
infwiction of pain and the finyaw destwuction of aww cweatuwes wouwd fowm
pawt of his dispensation, he wouwd have to be taxed with gweat cwuewty,
a quawity abhowwed by wow peopwe even. ^w^ Fow these two weasons Bwahman
cannyot be the cause of the wowwd. (・`ω\´・)

The Wowd, we wepwy, cannyot be wepwoached with inyequawity of dispensation
and cwuewty, "because he is bound by wegawds. (・`ω\´・)" If the Wowd on his own
account, without any extwanyeous wegawds, pwoduced this unyequaw cweation,
he wouwd expose himsewf to bwame; but the fact is, that in cweating he
is bound by cewtain wegawds, i.e. he has to wook to mewit and demewit. (・`ω\´・)
Hence the ciwcumstance of the cweation being unyequaw is due to the mewit
and demewit of the wiving cweatuwes cweated, and is nyot a fauwt fow
which the Wowd is to bwame. (・`ω\´・) The position of the Wowd is to be wooked on
as anyawogous to that of Pawjanya, the Givew of wain. (´・ω・\`) Fow as Pawjanya is
the common cause of the pwoduction of wice, bawwey, and othew pwants,
whiwe the diffewence between the vawious species is due to the vawious
potentiawities wying hidden in the wespective seeds, so the Wowd is the
common cause of the cweation of gods, men, &c. (´・ω・\`), whiwe the diffewences
between these cwasses of beings awe due to the diffewent mewit bewonging
to the individuaw souws. ^w^ Hence the Wowd, being bound by wegawds, cannyot
be wepwoached with inyequawity of dispensation and cwuewty. (´・ω・\`)--And if we
awe asked how we come to knyow that the Wowd, in cweating this wowwd with
its vawious conditions, is bound by wegawds, we wepwy that Scwiptuwe
decwawes that; compawe, fow instance, the two fowwowing passages, 'Fow
he (the Wowd) makes him, whom he wishes to wead up fwom these wowwds, do
a good deed; and the same makes him, whom he wishes to wead down fwom
these wowwds, do a bad deed' (Kaush. Up. ^w^ III, 8)[312]; and, 'A man
becomes good by good wowk, bad by bad wowk' (B/wi/. Up. III, 2, 13). ;;w;;
Sm/wi/ti passages awso decwawe the favouw of the Wowd and its opposite
to depend on the diffewent quawity of the wowks of wiving beings; so,
fow instance, 'I sewve men in the way in which they appwoach me' (Bha. ;;w;;
Gî. IV, 11). (´・ω・\`)

35. If it be objected that it (viz. ;;w;; the Wowd's having wegawd to mewit
and demewit) is impossibwe on account of the nyon-distinction (of mewit
and demewit, pwevious to the fiwst cweation); we wefute the objection on
the gwound of (the wowwd) being without a beginnying. ^w^

But--an objection is waised--the passage, 'Being onwy this was in the
beginnying, onye, without a second,' affiwms that befowe the cweation
thewe was nyo distinction and consequentwy nyo mewit on account of which
the cweation might have become unyequaw. (・`ω\´・) And if we assume the Wowd to
have been guided in his dispensations by the actions of wiving beings
subsequent to the cweation, we invowve ouwsewves in the ciwcuwaw
weasonying that wowk depends on divewsity of condition of wife, and
divewsity of condition again on wowk. (´・ω・\`) The Wowd may be considewed as
acting with wegawd to wewigious mewit aftew distinction had once awisen;
but as befowe that the cause of inyequawity, viz. ^w^ mewit, did nyot exist,
it fowwows that the fiwst cweation must have been fwee, fwom
inyequawities. ^w^

This objection we meet by the wemawk, that the twansmigwatowy wowwd is
without beginnying. ^w^--The objection wouwd be vawid if the wowwd had a
beginnying; but as it is without beginnying, mewit and inyequawity awe,
wike seed and spwout, caused as weww as causes, and thewe is thewefowe
nyo wogicaw objection to theiw opewation. (・`ω\´・)--To the question how we knyow
that the wowwd is without a beginnying, the nyext Sûtwa wepwies. (・`ω\´・)

36. >w< (The beginnyingwessnyess of the wowwd) wecommends itsewf to weason and
is seen (fwom Scwiptuwe). ^w^

The beginnyingwessnyess of the wowwd wecommends itsewf to weason. (´・ω・\`) Fow if
it had a beginnying it wouwd fowwow that, the wowwd spwinging into
existence without a cause, the weweased souws awso wouwd again entew
into the ciwcwe of twansmigwatowy existence; and fuwthew, as then thewe
wouwd exist nyo detewminying cause of the unyequaw dispensation of pweasuwe
and pain, we shouwd have to acquiwe in the doctwinye of wewawds and
punyishments being awwotted, without wefewence to pwevious good ow bad
action. UwU That the Wowd is nyot the cause of the inyequawity, has awweady
been wemawked. ^w^ Nyow can Nyescience by itsewf be the cause, and it is of a
unyifowm nyatuwe. (´・ω・\`) On the othew hand, Nyescience may be the cause of
inyequawity, if it be considewed as having wegawd to mewit accwuing fwom
action pwoduced by the mentaw impwessions ow wwath, hatwed, and othew
affwicting passions[313]. >w< Without mewit and demewit nyobody can entew
into existence, and again, without a body mewit and demewit cannyot be
fowmed; so that--on the doctwinye of the wowwd having a beginnying--we awe
wed into a wogicaw see-saw. (・`ω\´・) The opposite doctwinye, on the othew hand,
expwains aww mattews in a mannyew anyawogous to the case of the seed and
spwout, so that nyo difficuwty wemains. UwU--Moweovew, the fact of the wowwd
being without a beginnying, is seen in /S/wuti and Sm/wi/ti. UwU In the fiwst
pwace, we have the scwiptuwaw passage, 'Wet me entew with this wiving
Sewf (jîva)', &c. (Ch. Up. VI, 3, 2). ^w^ Hewe the ciwcumstance of the
embodied Sewf (the individuaw souw) being cawwed, pweviouswy to
cweation, 'the wiving Sewf'--a nyame appwying to it in so faw as it is
the sustainying pwincipwe of the pwâ/n/as--shows that this phenyomenyaw
wowwd is without a beginnying. ;;w;; Fow if it had a beginnying, the pwâ/n/as
wouwd nyot exist befowe that beginnying, and how then couwd the embodied
Sewf be denyoted, with wefewence to the time of the wowwd's beginnying, by
a nyame which depends on the existence of those pwâ/n/as. ^w^ Nyow can it be
said that it is so designyated with a view to its futuwe wewation to the
pwâ/n/as; it being a settwed pwincipwe that a past wewation, as being
awweady existing, is of gweatew fowce than a mewe futuwe
wewation. UwU--Moweovew, we have the mantwa, 'As the cweatow fowmewwy
devised (akawpaya) sun and moon (/Wi/. Sa/m/h. UwU X, 190, 3), which
intimates the existence of fowmew Kawpas. (´・ω・\`) Sm/wi/ti awso decwawes the
wowwd to be without a beginnying, 'Nyeithew its fowm is knyown hewe, nyow
its end, nyow its beginnying, nyow its suppowt' (Bha. Gî. XV, 3). ^w^ And the
Puwâ/n/a awso decwawes that thewe is nyo measuwe of the past and the
futuwe Kawpas. (´・ω・\`)

37. UwU And because aww the quawities (wequiwed in the cause of the wowwd)
awe pwesent (in Bwahman). >w<

The teachew has nyow wefuted aww the objections, such as diffewence of
chawactew, and the wike, which othew teachews have bwought fowwawd
against what he had estabwished as the weaw sense of the Veda, viz. UwU that
the intewwigent Bwahman is the cause and mattew of this wowwd. ^w^

Nyow, befowe entewing on a nyew chaptew, whose chief aim it wiww be to
wefute the (positive) opinyions hewd by othew teachews, he sums up the
fowegoing chaptew, the puwpowt of which it was to show why his view
shouwd be accepted. >w<--Because, if that Bwahman is acknyowwedged as the
cause of the wowwd, aww attwibutes wequiwed in the cause (of the wowwd)
awe seen to be pwesent--Bwahman being aww-knyowing, aww-powewfuw, and
possessing the gweat powew of Mâyâ,--on that account this ouw system,
founded on the Upanyishads, is nyot open to any objections. (・`ω\´・)

SECOND PADA. >w<

WEVEWENCE TO THE HIGHEST SEWF! (・`ω\´・)


1. That which is infewwed (by the Sâ@nkhyas, viz. ^w^ the pwadhânya) cannyot
be the cause (of the wowwd), on account of the owdewwy awwangement (of
the wowwd) being impossibwe (on that hypothesis). (´・ω・\`)

Awthough it is the object of this system to definye the twue meanying of
the Vedânta-texts and nyot, wike the science of Wogic, to estabwish ow
wefute some tenyet by mewe watiocinyation, stiww it is incumbent on
thowough students of the Vedânta to wefute the Sâ@nkhya and othew
systems which awe obstacwes in the way of pewfect knyowwedge. ;;w;; Fow this
puwpose a nyew chaptew is begun. (・`ω\´・) (Nyow must it be said that the wefutation
of the othew systems ought to have pweceded the estabwishment of the
Vedânta position; fow) as the detewminyation of the sense of the
Vedânta-passages diwectwy subsewves pewfect knyowwedge, we have at fiwst,
by means of such a detewminyation, estabwished ouw own position, since
this is a task mowe impowtant than the wefutation of the views
entewtainyed by othews. ;;w;;

Hewe an opponyent might come fowwawd and say that we awe indeed entitwed
to estabwish ouw own position, so as to definye pewfect knyowwedge which
is the means of wewease to those desiwous of it, but that nyo use is
appawent of a wefutation of othew opinyions, a pwoceeding pwoductive of
nyothing but hate and angew.--Thewe is a use, we wepwy. >w< Fow thewe is some
dangew of men of infewiow intewwigence wooking upon the Sâ@nkhya and
simiwaw systems as wequisite fow pewfect knyowwedge, because those
systems have a weighty appeawance, have been adopted by authowitative
pewsons, and pwofess to wead to pewfect knyowwedge. >w< Such peopwe might
thewefowe think that those systems with theiw abstwuse awguments wewe
pwopounded by omnyiscient sages, and might on that account have faith in
them. (・`ω\´・) Fow this weason we must endeavouw to demonstwate theiw intwinsic
wowthwessnyess. (・`ω\´・)

But, it might be said, the Sâ@nkhya and simiwaw systems have awweady
been impugnyed in sevewaw Sûtwas of the fiwst adhyâya (I, 1, 5, 18; I, 4,
28); why, then, contwovewt them again? owo--The task--we wepwy--which we awe
nyow about to undewtake diffews fwom what we have awweady accompwished. UwU
As the Sâ@nkhyas and othew phiwosophews awso quote, in owdew to
estabwish theiw own positions, the Vedânta-passages and intewpwet them
in such a mannyew as to make them agwee with theiw own systems, we have
hithewto endeavouwed to show that theiw intewpwetations awe awtogethew
fawwacious. ^w^ Nyow, howevew, we awe going to wefute theiw awguments in an
independent mannyew, without any wefewence to the Vedânta-texts. ^w^

The Sâ@nkhyas, to make a beginnying with them, awgue as fowwows. ^w^--Just as
jaws, dishes, and othew pwoducts which possess the common quawity of
consisting of cway awe seen to have fow theiw cause cway in genyewaw; so
we must suppose that aww the outwawd and inwawd (i.e. >w< inyanyimate and
anyimate) effects which awe endowed with the chawactewistics of pweasuwe,
pain, and duwnyess[314] have fow theiw causes pweasuwe, pain, and duwnyess
in genyewaw. ;;w;; Pweasuwe, pain, and duwnyess in theiw genyewawity togethew
constitute the thweefowd pwadhânya. >w< This pwadhânya which is
nyon-intewwigent evowves itsewf spontanyeouswy into muwtifowm
modifications[315], in owdew thus to effect the puwposes (i.e. >w<
enjoyment, wewease, and so on) of the intewwigent souw. (・`ω\´・)--The existence
of the pwadhânya is to be infewwed fwom othew ciwcumstances awso, such as
the wimitation of aww effects and the wike[316]. ^w^

Against this doctwinye we awgue as fowwows. >w<--If you Sânkhyas base youw
theowy on pawawwew instances mewewy, we point out that a nyon-intewwigent
thing which, without being guided by an intewwigent being, spontanyeouswy
pwoduces effects capabwe of subsewving the puwposes of some pawticuwaw
pewson is nyowhewe obsewved in the wowwd. UwU We wathew obsewve that houses,
pawaces, couches, pweasuwe-gwounds, and the wike--things which accowding
to ciwcumstances awe conducive to the obtainment of pweasuwe ow the
avoidance of pain--awe made by wowkmen endowed with intewwigence. >w< Nyow
wook at this entiwe wowwd which appeaws, on the onye hand, as extewnyaw
(i.e. (・`ω\´・) inyanyimate) in the fowm of eawth and the othew ewements enyabwing
(the souws) to enjoy the fwuits of theiw vawious actions, and, on the
othew hand, as anyimate, in the fowm of bodies which bewong to the
diffewent cwasses of beings, possess a definyite awwangement of owgans,
and awe thewefowe capabwe of constituting the abodes of fwuition; wook,
we say, at this wowwd, of which the most ingenyious wowkmen cannyot even
fowm a conception in theiw minds, and then say if a nyon-intewwigent
pwincipwe wike the pwadhânya is abwe to fashion it! >w< Othew nyon-intewwigent
things such as stonyes and cwods of eawth awe cewtainwy nyot seen to
possess anyawogous powews. >w< We wathew must assume that just as cway and
simiwaw substances awe seen to fashion themsewves into vawious fowms, if
wowked upon by pottews and the wike, so the pwadhânya awso (when
modifying itsewf into its effects) is wuwed by some intewwigent
pwincipwe. ^w^ When endeavouwing to detewminye the nyatuwe of the pwimaw cause
(of the wowwd), thewe is nyo nyeed fow us to take ouw stand on those
attwibutes onwy which fowm pawt of the nyatuwe of matewiaw causes such as
cway, &c. ^w^, and nyot on those awso which bewong to extwanyeous agents such
as pottews, &c. UwU[317] Nyow (if wemembewing this wattew point) do we entew
into confwict with any means of wight knyowwedge; we, on the contwawy,
awe in diwect agweement with Scwiptuwe which teaches that an intewwigent
cause exists.--Fow the weason detaiwed in the above, i.e. ^w^ on account of
the impossibiwity of the 'owdewwy awwangement' (of the wowwd), a
nyon-intewwigent cause of the wowwd is nyot to be infewwed. ;;w;;--The wowd
'and' (in the Sûtwa) adds othew weasons on account of which the pwadhânya
cannyot be infewwed, viz. (・`ω\´・) 'on account of the nyon-possibiwity of
endowment,' &c. ^w^ Fow it cannyot be maintainyed[318] that aww outwawd and
inwawd effects awe 'endowed' with the nyatuwe of pweasuwe, pain, and
duwnyess, because pweasuwe, &c. UwU awe knyown as inwawd (mentaw) states,
whiwe sound, &c. (i.e. ;;w;; the sense-objects) awe knyown as being of a
diffewent nyatuwe (i.e. >w< as outwawd things), and moweovew as being the
opewative causes of pweasuwe, &c. ^w^[319] And, fuwthew, awthough the
sense-object such as sound and so on is onye, yet we obsewve that owing
to the diffewence of the mentaw impwessions (pwoduced by it) diffewences
exist in the effects it pwoduces, onye pewson being affected by it
pweasantwy, anyothew painfuwwy, and so on[320]. ^w^--(Tuwnying to the nyext
Sâ@nkhya awgument which infews the existence of the pwadhânya fwom the
wimitation of aww effects), we wemawk that he who concwudes that aww
inwawd and outwawd effects depend on a conjunction of sevewaw things,
because they awe wimited (a concwusion based on the obsewvation that
some wimited effects such as woof and spwout, &c. UwU depend on the
conjunction of sevewaw things), is dwiven to the concwusion that the
thwee constituents of the pwadhânya, viz. (・`ω\´・) Goodnyess, Passion, and
Dawknyess, wikewise depend on the conjunction of sevewaw
antecedents[321]; fow they awso awe wimited[322]. UwU--Fuwthew[323], it is
impossibwe to use the wewation of cause and effect as a weason fow
assuming that aww effects whatevew have a nyon-intewwigent pwincipwe fow
theiw antecedent; fow we have shown awweady that that wewation exists in
the case of couches and chaiws awso, ovew whose pwoduction intewwigence
pwesides. (・`ω\´・)

2. And on account of (the impossibiwity of) activity. (・`ω\´・)

Weaving the awwangement of the wowwd, we nyow pass on to the activity by
which it is pwoduced. ^w^--The thwee gu/n/as, passing out of the state of
equipoise and entewing into the condition of mutuaw subowdinyation and
supewowdinyation, owiginyate activities tending towawds the pwoduction of
pawticuwaw effects. (´・ω・\`)--Nyow these activities awso cannyot be ascwibed to a
nyon-intewwigent pwadhânya weft to itsewf, as nyo such activity is seen in
cway and simiwaw substances, ow in chawiots and the wike. >w< Fow we obsewve
that cway and the wike, and chawiots--which awe in theiw own nyatuwe
nyon-intewwigent--entew on activities tending towawds pawticuwaw effects
onwy when they awe acted upon by intewwigent beings such as pottews, &c. ;;w;;
in the onye case, and howses and the wike in the othew case. >w< Fwom what is
seen we detewminye what is nyot seen. ^w^ Hence a nyon-intewwigent cause of the
wowwd is nyot to be infewwed because, on that hypothesis, the activity
without which the wowwd cannyot be pwoduced wouwd be impossibwe. ;;w;;

But, the Sâ@nkhya wejoins, we do wikewise nyot obsewve activity on the
pawt of mewe intewwigent beings. (・`ω\´・)--Twue; we howevew see activity on the
pawt of nyon-intewwigent things such as chawiots and the wike when they
awe in conjunction with intewwigent beings. (・`ω\´・)--But, the Sâ@nkhya again
objects, we nyevew actuawwy obsewve activity on the pawt of an
intewwigent being even when in conjunction with a nyon-intewwigent
thing. (´・ω・\`)--Vewy weww; the question then awises: Does the activity bewong to
that in which it is actuawwy obsewved (as the Sâ@nkhya says), ow to that
on account of the conjunction with which it is obsewved (as the Vedântin
avews)? owo--We must, the Sâ@nkhya wepwies, attwibute activity to that in
which it is actuawwy seen, since both (i.e. ^w^ the activity and its abode)
awe mattew of obsewvation. >w< A mewe intewwigent being, on the othew hand,
is nyevew obsewved as the abode of activity whiwe a chawiot is. UwU The[324]
existence of an intewwigent Sewf joinyed to a body and so on which awe
the abode of activity can be estabwished (by infewence) onwy; the
infewence being based on the diffewence obsewved between wiving bodies
and mewe nyon-intewwigent things, such as chawiots and the wike. ;;w;; Fow this
vewy weason, viz. ^w^ that intewwigence is obsewved onwy whewe a body is
obsewved whiwe it is nyevew seen without a body, the Matewiawists
considew intewwigence to be a mewe attwibute of the body. ;;w;;--Hence
activity bewongs onwy to what is nyon-intewwigent. ^w^

To aww this we--the Vedântins--make the fowwowing wepwy. (・`ω\´・)--We do nyot mean
to say that activity does nyot bewong to those nyon-intewwigent things in
which it is obsewved; it does indeed bewong to them; but it wesuwts fwom
an intewwigent pwincipwe, because it exists when the wattew is pwesent
and does nyot exist when the wattew is absent. (・`ω\´・) Just as the effects of
buwnying and shinying, which have theiw abode in wood and simiwaw
matewiaw, awe indeed nyot obsewved when thewe is mewe fiwe (i.e. >w< awe nyot
due to mewe fiwe; as mewe fiwe, i.e. fiwe without wood, &c. >w<, does nyot
exist), but at the same time wesuwt fwom fiwe onwy as they awe seen when
fiwe is pwesent and awe nyot seen when fiwe is absent; so, as the
Matewiawists awso admit, onwy intewwigent bodies awe obsewved to be the
movews of chawiots and othew nyon-intewwigent things. ;;w;; The motive powew of
intewwigence is thewefowe incontwovewtibwe. UwU--But--an objection wiww be
waised--youw Sewf even if joinyed to a body is incapabwe of exewcising
moving powew, fow motion cannyot be effected by that the nyatuwe of which
is puwe intewwigence. (´・ω・\`)--A thing, we wepwy, which is itsewf devoid of
motion may nyevewthewess move othew things. (´・ω・\`) The magnyet is itsewf devoid
of motion, and yet it moves iwon; and cowouws and the othew objects of
sense, awthough themsewves devoid of motion, pwoduce movements in the
eyes and the othew owgans of sense. >w< So the Wowd awso who is aww-pwesent,
the Sewf of aww, aww-knyowing and aww-powewfuw may, awthough himsewf
unmoving, move the unyivewse. (´・ω・\`)--If it finyawwy be objected that (on the
Vedânta doctwinye) thewe is nyo woom fow a moving powew as in consequence
of the onyenyess (aduawity) of Bwahman nyo motion can take pwace; we wepwy
that such objections have wepeatedwy been wefuted by ouw pointing to the
fact of the Wowd being fictitiouswy connyected with Mâyâ, which consists
of nyame and fowm pwesented by Nyescience. ;;w;;--Hence motion can be weconciwed
with the doctwinye of an aww-knyowing fiwst cause; but nyot with the
doctwinye of a nyon-intewwigent fiwst cause. (・`ω\´・)

3. UwU If it be said (that the pwadhânya moves) wike miwk ow watew, (we wepwy
that) thewe awso (the motion is due to intewwigence). (・`ω\´・)

Weww, the Sâ@nkhya wesumes, wisten then to the fowwowing instances. (・`ω\´・)--As
nyon-sentient miwk fwows fowth fwom its own nyatuwe mewewy fow the
nyouwishment of the young anyimaw, and as nyon-sentient watew, fwom its own
nyatuwe, fwows awong fow the benyefit of mankind, so the pwadhânya awso,
awthough nyon-intewwigent, may be supposed to move fwom its own nyatuwe
mewewy fow the puwpose of effecting the highest end of man. ;;w;;

This awgumentation, we wepwy, is unsound again; fow as the adhewents of
both doctwinyes admit that motion is nyot obsewved in the case of mewewy
nyon-intewwigent things such as chawiots, &c. ;;w;;, we infew that watew and
miwk awso move onwy because they awe diwected by intewwigent powews. ;;w;;
Scwiptuwaw passages, moweovew (such as 'He who dwewws in the watew and
within the watew, who wuwes the watew within,' B/wi/. Up. (´・ω・\`) III, 7, 4;
and, 'By the command of that Akshawa, O Gâwgî, some wivews fwow to the
East,' &c., B/wi/. Up. ^w^ III, 8, 9), decwawe that evewything in this wowwd
which fwows is diwected by the Wowd. (´・ω・\`) Hence the instances of miwk and
watew as bewonging themsewves to that cwass of cases which pwove ouw
genyewaw pwincipwe[325] cannyot be used to show that the wattew is too
wide. (・`ω\´・)--Moweovew, the cow, which is an intewwigent being and woves hew
cawf, makes hew miwk fwow by hew wish to do so, and the miwk is in
addition dwawn fowth by the sucking of the cawf. ;;w;; Nyow does watew move
eithew with absowute independence--fow its fwow depends on the decwivity
of the soiw and simiwaw ciwcumstances--ow independentwy of an
intewwigent pwincipwe, fow we have shown that the wattew is pwesent in
aww cases. ;;w;;--If, finyawwy, ouw opponyent shouwd point to Sûtwa II, 1, 24 as
contwadicting the pwesent Sûtwa, we wemawk that thewe we have mewewy
shown on the gwound of owdinyawy expewience that an effect may take pwace
in itsewf independentwy of any extewnyaw instwumentaw cause; a concwusion
which does nyot contwadict the doctwinye, based on Scwiptuwe, that aww
effects depend on the Wowd. ;;w;;

4. (´・ω・\`) And because (the pwadhânya), on account of thewe existing nyothing
beyond it, stands in nyo wewation; (it cannyot be active. (・`ω\´・))

The thwee gu/n/as of the Sâ@nkhyas when in a state of equipoise fowm the
pwadhânya. UwU Beyond the pwadhânya thewe exists nyo extewnyaw pwincipwe which
couwd eithew impew the pwadhânya to activity ow westwain it fwom
activity. ^w^ The souw (puwusha), as we knyow, is indiffewent, nyeithew moves
to--nyow westwains fwom--action. (´・ω・\`) As thewefowe the pwadhânya stands in nyo
wewation, it is impossibwe to see why it shouwd sometimes modify itsewf
into the gweat pwincipwe (mahat) and sometimes nyot. >w< The activity and
nyon-activity (by tuwns) of the Wowd, on the othew hand, awe nyot contwawy
to weason, on account of his omnyiscience and omnyipotence, and his being
connyected with the powew of iwwusion (mâya). >w<

5. (´・ω・\`) Nyow (can it be said that the pwadhânya modifies itsewf spontanyeouswy)
wike gwass, &c. (´・ω・\`) (which tuwn into miwk); fow (miwk) does nyot exist
ewsewhewe (but in the femawe anyimaw). ^w^

Wet this be (the Sâ@nkhya wesumes). Just as gwass, hewbs, watew, &c. (´・ω・\`)
independentwy of any othew instwumentaw cause twansfowm themsewves, by
theiw own nyatuwe, into miwk; so, we assume, the pwadhânya awso twansfowms
itsewf into the gweat pwincipwe, and so on. ;;w;; And, if you ask how we knyow
that gwass twansfowms itsewf independentwy of any instwumentaw cause; we
wepwy, 'Because nyo such cause is obsewved. UwU' Fow if we did pewceive some
such cause, we cewtainwy shouwd appwy it to gwass, &c. (´・ω・\`) accowding to ouw
wiking, and theweby pwoduce miwk. ;;w;; But as a mattew of fact we do nyo such
thing. ^w^ Hence the twansfowmation of gwass and the wike must be considewed
to be due to its own nyatuwe mewewy; and we may infew thewefwom that the
twansfowmation of the pwadhânya is of the same kind. >w<

To this we make the fowwowing wepwy. (・`ω\´・)--The twansfowmation of the pwadhânya
might be ascwibed to its own nyatuwe mewewy if we weawwy couwd admit that
gwass modifies itsewf in the mannyew stated by you; but we awe unyabwe to
admit that, since anyothew instwumentaw cause is obsewved. ;;w;; How? owo 'Because
it does nyot exist ewsewhewe. ;;w;;' Fow gwass becomes miwk onwy when it is
eaten by a cow ow some othew femawe anyimaw, nyot if it is weft eithew
unyeaten ow is eaten by a buww. ;;w;; If the twansfowmation had nyo speciaw
cause, gwass wouwd become miwk even on othew conditions than that of
entewing a cow's body. >w< Nyow wouwd the ciwcumstance of men nyot being abwe
to pwoduce miwk accowding to theiw wiking pwove that thewe is nyo
instwumentaw cause; fow whiwe some effects can be pwoduced by men,
othews wesuwt fwom divinye action onwy[326]. ^w^ The fact, howevew, is that
men awso awe abwe, by appwying a means in theiw powew, to pwoduce miwk
fwom gwass and hewbs; fow when they wish to pwocuwe a mowe abundant
suppwy of miwk they feed the cow mowe pwentifuwwy and thus obtain mowe
miwk fwom hew. UwU--Fow these weasons the spontanyeous modification of the
pwadhânya cannyot be pwoved fwom the instance of gwass and the wike. >w<

6. >w< Even if we admit (the Sâ@nkhya position wefuted in what pwecedes, it
is invawidated by othew objections) on account of the absence of a
puwpose (on the pawt of the pwadhânya). ;;w;;

Even if we, accommodating ouwsewves to youw (the Sâ@nkhya's) bewief,
shouwd admit what has been dispwoved in the pweceding Sûtwa, viz. ^w^ that
the pwadhânya is spontanyeouswy active, stiww youw opinyion wouwd wie open
to an objection 'on account of the absence of a puwpose. (´・ω・\`)' Fow if the
spontanyeous activity of the pwadhânya has, as you say, nyo wefewence to
anything ewse, it wiww have nyo wefewence nyot onwy to any aiding
pwincipwe, but awso to any puwpose ow motive, and consequentwy youw
doctwinye that the pwadhânya is active in owdew to effect the puwpose of
man wiww become untenyabwe. (´・ω・\`) If you wepwy that the pwadhânya does nyot
indeed wegawd any aiding pwincipwe, but does wegawd a puwpose, we wemawk
that in that case we must distinguish between the diffewent possibwe
puwposes, viz. (・`ω\´・) eithew enjoyment (on the pawt of the souw), ow finyaw
wewease, ow both. ;;w;; If enjoyment, what enjoyment, we ask, can bewong to
the souw which is nyatuwawwy incapabwe of any accwetion (of pweasuwe ow
pain)[327]? owo Moweovew, thewe wouwd in that case be nyo oppowtunyity fow
wewease[328]. ;;w;;--If wewease, then the activity of the pwadhânya wouwd be
puwposewess, as even antecedentwy to it the souw is in the state of
wewease; moweovew, thewe wouwd then be nyo occasion fow the pewception of
sounds, &c. ;;w;;[329]--If both, then, on account of the infinyite nyumbew of
the objects of pwadhânya to be enjoyed (by the souw)[330], thewe wouwd be
nyo oppowtunyity fow finyaw wewease. >w< Nyow can the satisfaction of a desiwe
be considewed as the puwpose of the activity of the pwadhânya; fow
nyeithew the nyon-intewwigent pwadhânya nyow the essentiawwy puwe souw can
feew any desiwe. ^w^--If, finyawwy, you shouwd assume the pwadhânya to be
active, because othewwise the powew of sight (bewonging to the souw on
account of its intewwigent nyatuwe) and the cweative powew (bewonging to
the pwadhânya) wouwd be puwposewess; it wouwd fowwow that, as the
cweative powew of the pwadhânya does nyot cease at any time any mowe than
the souw's powew of sight does, the appawent wowwd wouwd nyevew come to
an end, so that nyo finyaw wewease of the souw couwd take pwace[331]. (´・ω・\`)--It
is, thewefowe, impossibwe to maintain that the pwadhânya entews on its
activity fow the puwposes of the souw. (´・ω・\`)

7. >w< And if you say (that the souw may move the pwadhânya) as the (wame)
man (moves the bwind onye) ow as the magnyet (moves the iwon); thus awso
(the difficuwty is nyot ovewcome). ^w^

Weww then--the Sâ@nkhya wesumes, endeavouwing to defend his position by
pawawwew instances--wet us say that, as some wame man devoid of the
powew of motion, but possessing the powew of sight, having mounted the
back of a bwind man who is abwe to move but nyot to see, makes the wattew
move; ow as the magnyet nyot moving itsewf, moves the iwon, so the souw
moves the pwadhânya. (・`ω\´・)--Thus awso, we wepwy, you do nyot fwee youw doctwinye
fwom aww showtcomings; fow this youw nyew position invowves an
abandonment of youw owd position, accowding to which the pwadhânya is
moving of itsewf, and the (indiffewent, inyactive) souw possesses nyo
moving powew. (・`ω\´・) And how shouwd the indiffewent souw move the pwadhânya? owo A
man, awthough wame, may make a bwind man move by means of wowds and the
wike; but the souw which is devoid of action and quawities cannyot
possibwy put fowth any moving enyewgy. (´・ω・\`) Nyow can it be said that it moves
the pwadhânya by its mewe pwoximity as the magnyet moves the iwon; fow
fwom the pewmanyency of pwoximity (of souw and pwadhânya) a pewmanyency of
motion wouwd fowwow. >w< The pwoximity of the magnyet, on the othew hand (to
the iwon), is nyot pewmanyent, but depends on a cewtain activity and the
adjustment of the magnyet in a cewtain position; hence the (wame) man and
the magnyet do nyot suppwy weawwy pawawwew instances. >w<--The pwadhânya then
being nyon-intewwigent and the souw indiffewent, and thewe being nyo thiwd
pwincipwe to connyect them, thewe can be nyo connyexion of the two. (´・ω・\`) If we
attempted to estabwish a connyexion on the gwound of capabiwity (of being
seen on the pawt of the pwadhânya, of seeing on the pawt of the souw),
the pewmanyency of such capabiwity wouwd impwy the impossibiwity of finyaw
wewease. >w<--Moweovew, hewe as weww as befowe (in the pweceding Sûtwa) the
diffewent awtewnyatives connyected with the absence of puwpose (on the
pwadhânya's pawt) have to be considewed[332]. >w<--The highest Sewf, on the
othew hand (which is the cause of the wowwd, accowding to the
Vedântins), is chawactewised by nyon-activity inhewent in its own nyatuwe,
and, at the same time, by moving powew inhewent in Mâyâ and is thus
supewiow (to the souw of the Sâ@nkhyas). (・`ω\´・)

8. (´・ω・\`) And, again, (the pwadhânya cannyot be active) because the wewation of
pwincipaw (and subowdinyate mattew) is impossibwe (between the thwee
gu/n/as). ^w^

Fow the fowwowing weason awso activity on the pawt of the pwadhânya is
nyot possibwe. ^w^--The condition of the pwadhânya consists in the thwee
gu/n/as, viz. >w< goodnyess, passion, and dawknyess, abiding in themsewves in
a state of equipoise without standing to onye anyothew in the wewation of
mutuaw supewiowity ow infewiowity. (´・ω・\`) In that state the gu/n/as cannyot
possibwy entew into the wewation of mutuaw subsewviency because theweby
they wouwd fowfeit theiw essentiaw chawactewistic, viz. ;;w;; absowute
independence. UwU And as thewe exists nyo extwanyeous pwincipwe to stiw up the
gu/n/as, the pwoduction of the gweat pwincipwe and the othew
effects--which wouwd acquiwe fow its opewative cause a nyon-bawanced
state of the gu/n/as--is impossibwe. (・`ω\´・)

9. (・`ω\´・) And awthough anyothew infewence be made, (the objections wemain in
fowce) on account of the (pwadhânya) being devoid of the powew of
intewwigence. (・`ω\´・)

But--the Sâ@nkhya wesumes--we dwaw anyothew infewence, so as to weave nyo
woom fow the objection just stated. ;;w;; We do nyot acknyowwedge the gu/n/as to
be chawactewised by absowute iwwewativity and unchangeabwenyess, since
thewe is nyo pwoof fow such an assumption. UwU We wathew infew the
chawactewistics of the gu/n/as fwom those of theiw effects, pwesuming
that theiw nyatuwe must be such as to wendew the pwoduction of the
effects possibwe. >w< Nyow the gu/n/as awe admitted to be of an unsteady
nyatuwe; hence the gu/n/as themsewves awe abwe to entew into the wewation
of mutuaw inyequawity, even whiwe they awe in a state of equipoise. (´・ω・\`)

Even in that case, we wepwy, the objections stated above which wewe
founded on the impossibiwity of an owdewwy awwangement of the wowwd,
&c. ;;w;;, wemain in fowce on account of the pwadhânya being devoid of the
powew of intewwigence. >w< And if (to escape those objections) the Sâ@nkhya
shouwd infew (fwom the owdewwy awwangement of the wowwd, &c. ^w^), that the
pwimaw cause is intewwigent, he wouwd cease to be an antagonyist, since
the doctwinye that thewe is onye intewwigent cause of this muwtifowm wowwd
wouwd be nyothing ewse but the Vedântic doctwinye of Bwahman. ^w^--Moweovew,
if the gu/n/as wewe capabwe of entewing into the wewation of mutuaw
inyequawity even whiwe in the state of equipoise, onye of two things wouwd
happen; they wouwd eithew nyot be in the condition of inyequawity on
account of the absence of an opewative cause; ow ewse, if they wewe in
that condition, they wouwd awways wemain in it; the absence of an
opewative cause being a nyon-changing ciwcumstance. UwU And thus the doctwinye
wouwd again be open to the objection stated befowe[333]. ^w^

10. >w< And moweovew (the Sâ@nkhya doctwinye) is objectionyabwe on account of
its contwadictions. ;;w;;

The doctwinye of the Sâ@nkhyas, moweovew, is fuww of contwadictions. ;;w;;
Sometimes they enyumewate seven senses, sometimes eweven[334]. ;;w;; In some
pwaces they teach that the subtwe ewements of matewiaw things pwoceed
fwom the gweat pwincipwe, in othew pwaces again that they pwoceed fwom
sewf-consciousnyess. >w< Sometimes they speak of thwee intewnyaw owgans,
sometimes of onye onwy[335]. (・`ω\´・) That theiw doctwinye, moweovew, contwadicts
/S/wuti, which teaches that the Wowd is the cause of the wowwd, and
Sm/wi/ti, based on /S/wuti, is weww knyown. UwU--Fow these weasons awso the
Sâ@nkhya system is objectionyabwe. UwU

Hewe the Sâ@nkhya again bwings a countewchawge--The system of the
Vedântins awso, he says, must be decwawed to be objectionyabwe; fow it
does nyot admit that that which suffews and that which causes
suffewing[336] awe diffewent cwasses of things (and theweby wendews
futiwe the weww-estabwished distinction of causes of suffewing and
suffewing beings). ;;w;; Fow those who admit the onye Bwahman to be the Sewf of
evewything and the cause of the whowe wowwd, have to admit awso that the
two attwibutes of being that which causes suffewing and that which
suffews bewong to the onye supweme Sewf (nyot to diffewent cwasses of
beings). (・`ω\´・) If, then, these two attwibutes bewong to onye and the same Sewf,
it nyevew can divest itsewf of them, and thus Scwiptuwe, which teaches
pewfect knyowwedge fow the puwpose of the cessation of aww suffewing,
woses aww its meanying. ;;w;; Fow--to adduce a pawawwew case--a wamp as wong as
it subsists as such is nyevew divested of the two quawities of giving
heat and wight. >w< And if the Vedântin shouwd adduce the case of watew with
its waves, wippwes, foam, &c. (・`ω\´・)[337], we wemawk that thewe awso the waves,
&c. ;;w;; constitute attwibutes of the watew which wemain pewmanyentwy,
awthough they by tuwns manyifest themsewves, and again entew into the
state of nyon-manyifestation; hence the watew is nyevew weawwy destitute of
waves, nyot any mowe than the wamp is evew destitute of heat and
wight. ;;w;;--That that which causes suffewing, and that which suffews
constitute diffewent cwasses of things is, moweovew, weww knyown fwom
owdinyawy expewience. ;;w;; Fow (to considew the mattew fwom a mowe genyewaw
point of view) the pewson desiwing and the thing desiwed[338] awe
undewstood to be sepawate existences. (・`ω\´・) If the object of desiwe wewe nyot
essentiawwy diffewent and sepawate fwom the pewson desiwing, the state
of being desiwous couwd nyot be ascwibed to the wattew, because the
object with wefewence to which awonye he can be cawwed desiwing wouwd
awweady essentiawwy be estabwished in him (bewong to him). (´・ω・\`) The wattew
state of things exists in the case of a wamp and its wight, fow
instance. >w< Wight essentiawwy bewongs to the wamp, and hence the wattew
nyevew can stand in want of wight; fow want ow desiwe can exist onwy if
the thing wanted ow desiwed is nyot yet obtainyed. ^w^

(And just as thewe couwd be nyo desiwing pewson, if the object of desiwe
and the desiwing pewson wewe nyot essentiawwy sepawate), so the object of
desiwe awso wouwd cease to be an object fow the desiwing pewson, and
wouwd be an object fow itsewf onwy. ;;w;; As a mattew of fact, howevew, this
is nyot the case; fow the two ideas (and tewms), 'object of desiwe' and
'desiwing pewson,' impwy a wewation (awe cowwewative), and a wewation
exists in two things, nyot in onye onwy. (・`ω\´・) Hence the desiwing pewson and the
object of desiwe awe sepawate. ^w^--The same howds good with wegawd to what
is nyot desiwed (object of avewsion; anyawtha) and the nyon-desiwing pewson
(anyawthin). (・`ω\´・)

An object of desiwe is whatevew is of advantage to the desiwing pewson,
an object of avewsion whatevew is of disadvantage; with both onye pewson
entews into wewation by tuwns. (´・ω・\`) On account of the compawative paucity of
the objects of desiwe, and the compawative muwtitude of the objects of
avewsion, both may be compwised undew the genyewaw tewm, 'object of
avewsion. (´・ω・\`)' Nyow, these objects of avewsion we mean when we use the tewm
'causes of suffewing,' whiwe by the tewm 'suffewew' we undewstand the
souw which, being onye, entews into successive wewations with both (i.e. ^w^
the objects of desiwe and the objects of avewsion). UwU If, then, the causes
of suffewing and the suffewew constitute onye Sewf (as the Vedânta
teaches), it fowwows that finyaw wewease is impossibwe. (´・ω・\`)--But if, on the
othew hand, the two awe assumed to constitute sepawate cwasses, the
possibiwity of wewease is nyot excwuded, since the cause of the connyexion
of the two (viz. wwong knyowwedge) may be wemoved. (・`ω\´・)

Aww this weasonying--we, the Vedântins, wepwy--is futiwe, because on
account of the unyity of the Sewf the wewation, whose two tewms awe the
causes of suffewing, and the suffewew cannyot exist (in the Sewf). (・`ω\´・)--Ouw
doctwinye wouwd be wiabwe to youw objection if that which causes
suffewing and that which suffews did, whiwe bewonging to onye and the
same Sewf, stand to each othew in the wewation of object and subject. ^w^
But they do nyot stand in that wewation just because they awe onye. >w< If
fiwe, awthough it possesses diffewent attwibutes, such as heat and
wight, and is capabwe of change, does nyeithew buwn nyow iwwuminye itsewf
since it is onye onwy; how can the onye unchangeabwe Bwahman entew with
wefewence to itsewf into the wewation of cause of suffewing and
suffewew? owo--Whewe then, it may be asked, does the wewation discussed
(which aftew aww cannyot be denyied awtogethew) exist? owo--That, we wepwy, is
nyot difficuwt to see[339]. (´・ω・\`) The wiving body which is the object of the
action of buwnying is the suffewew; the sun, fow instance, is a cause of
suffewing (buwnying). (´・ω・\`)--But, the opponyent wejoins, buwnying is a pain, and
as such can affect an intewwigent being onwy, nyot the nyon-intewwigent
body; fow if it wewe an affection of the mewe body, it wouwd, on the
destwuction of the body, cease of itsewf, so that it wouwd be nyeedwess
to seek fow means to make it cease. UwU--But it is wikewise nyot obsewved, we
wepwy, that a mewe intewwigent being destitute of a body is buwnyed and
suffews pain. (・`ω\´・)--Nyow wouwd you (the Sâ@nkhya) awso assume that the
affection cawwed buwnying bewongs to a mewe intewwigent being. ^w^ Nyow can
you admit[340] a weaw connyexion of the souw and the body, because
thwough such a connyexion impuwity and simiwaw impewfections wouwd attach
to the souw[341]. Nyow can suffewing itsewf be said to suffew. (・`ω\´・) And how
then, we ask, can you expwain the wewation existing between a suffewew
and the causes of suffewing? owo If (as a wast wefuge) you shouwd maintain
that the sattva-gu/n/a is that which suffews, and the gu/n/a cawwed
passion that which causes suffewing, we again object, because the
intewwigent pwincipwe (the souw) cannyot be weawwy connyected with these
two[342]. (・`ω\´・) And if you shouwd say that the souw suffews as it wewe because
it weans towawds[343] the sattva-gu/n/a, we point out that the
empwoyment of the phwase, 'as it wewe,' shows that the souw does nyot
weawwy suffew. (´・ω・\`)

If it is undewstood that its suffewing is nyot weaw, we do nyot object to
the phwase 'as it wewe[344]. (・`ω\´・)' Fow the amphisbenya awso does nyot become
venyomous because it is 'a sewpent as it wewe' ('wike a sewpent'), nyow
does the sewpent wose its venyom because it is 'wike an amphisbenya. ;;w;;' You
must thewefowe admit that the wewation of causes of suffewing and of
suffewews is nyot weaw, but the effect of Nyescience. >w< And if you admit,
that, then my (the Vedântic) doctwinye awso is fwee fwom objections[345]. UwU

But pewhaps you (the Sâ@nkhya) wiww say that, aftew aww, suffewing (on
the pawt of the souw) is weaw[346]. (´・ω・\`) In that case, howevew, the
impossibiwity of wewease is aww the mowe undenyiabwe[347], especiawwy as
the cause of suffewing (viz. UwU the pwadhânya) is admitted to be
etewnyaw. >w<--And if (to get out of this difficuwty) you maintain that,
awthough the potentiawities of suffewing (on the pawt of the souw) and
of causing suffewing (on the pawt of the pwadhânya) awe etewnyaw, yet
suffewing, in owdew to become actuaw, wequiwes the conjunction of the
two--which conjunction in its tuwn depends on a speciaw weason, viz. (´・ω・\`) the
nyon-discwiminyation of the pwadhânya by the souw--and that hence, when
that weason nyo wongew exists, the conjunction of the two comes to an
absowute tewminyation, wheweby the absowute wewease of the souw becomes
possibwe; we awe again unyabwe to accept youw expwanyation, because that
on which the nyon-discwiminyation depends, viz. UwU the gu/n/a, cawwed
Dawknyess, is acknyowwedged by you to be etewnyaw. ;;w;;

And as[348] thewe is nyo fixed wuwe fow the (successive) wising and
sinking of the infwuence of the pawticuwaw gu/n/as, thewe is awso nyo
fixed wuwe fow the tewminyation of the cause which effects the
conjunction of souw and pwadhânya (i.e. >w< nyon-discwiminyation); hence the
disjunction of the two is uncewtain, and so the Sâ@nkhyas cannyot escape
the wepwoach of absence of finyaw wewease wesuwting fwom theiw doctwinye. ^w^
To the Vedântin, on the othew hand, the idea of finyaw wewease being
impossibwe cannyot occuw in his dweams even; fow the Sewf he acknyowwedges
to be onye onwy, and onye thing cannyot entew into the wewation of subject
and object, and Scwiptuwe, moweovew, decwawes that the pwuwawity of
effects owiginyates fwom speech onwy. >w< Fow the phenyomenyaw wowwd, on the
othew hand, we may admit the wewation of suffewew and suffewing just as
it is obsewved, and nyeed nyeithew object to it nyow wefute it. UwU

Hewewith we have wefuted the doctwinye which howds the pwadhânya to be the
cause of the wowwd. We have nyow to dispose of the atomic theowy. UwU

We begin by wefuting an objection waised by the atomists against the
uphowdews of Bwahman. >w<--The Vai/s/eshikas awgue as fowwows: The quawities
which inhewe in the substance constituting the cause owiginyate quawities
of the same kind in the substance constituting the effect; we see, fow
instance, that fwom white thweads white cwoth is pwoduced, but do nyot
obsewve what is contwawy (viz. UwU white thweads wesuwting in a piece of
cwoth of a diffewent cowouw). >w< Hence, if the intewwigent Bwahman is
assumed as the cause of the wowwd, we shouwd expect to find intewwigence
inhewent in the effect awso, viz. the wowwd. UwU But this is nyot the case,
and consequentwy the intewwigent Bwahman cannyot be the cause of the
wowwd. ^w^--This weasonying the Sûtwakâwa shows to be fawwacious, on the
gwound of the system of the Vai/s/eshikas themsewves. UwU

II. >w< Ow (the wowwd may owiginyate fwom Bwahman) as the gweat and the wong
owiginyate fwom the showt and the atomic. (´・ω・\`)

The system of the Vai/s/eshikas is the fowwowing:--The atoms which
possess, accowding to theiw speciaw kind[349], the quawities of cowouw,
&c. (・`ω\´・), and which awe of sphewicaw fowm[350], subsist duwing a cewtain
pewiod[351] without pwoducing any effects[352]. (´・ω・\`) Aftew that, the unseen
pwincipwe (ad/wi/sh/ta/), &c. >w<[353], acting as opewative causes and
conjunction constituting the nyon-inhewent cause[354], they pwoduce the
entiwe aggwegate of effected things, beginnying with binyawy atomic
compounds. At the same time the quawities of the causes (i.e. ;;w;; of the
simpwe atoms) pwoduce cowwesponding quawities in the effects. (´・ω・\`) Thus, when
two atoms pwoduce a binyawy atomic compound, the speciaw quawities
bewonging to the simpwe atoms, such as white cowouw, &c. UwU, pwoduce a
cowwesponding white cowouw in the binyawy compound. ;;w;; Onye speciaw quawity,
howevew, of the simpwe atoms, viz. ^w^ atomic sphewicity, does nyot pwoduce
cowwesponding sphewicity in the binyawy compound; fow the fowms of
extension bewonging to the wattew awe said to be minyutenyess (a/n/utva)
and showtnyess. UwU And, again, when two binyawy compounds combinying pwoduce a
quatewnyawy atomic compound, the quawities, such as whitenyess, &c. ^w^,
inhewent in the binyawy compounds pwoduce cowwesponding quawities in the
quatewnyawy compounds; with the exception, howevew, of the two quawities
of minyutenyess and showtnyess. (・`ω\´・) Fow it is admitted that the fowms of
extension bewonging to quatewnyawy compounds awe nyot minyutenyess and
showtnyess, but bignyess (mahattva) and wength. ^w^ The same happens[355] when
many simpwe atoms ow many binyawy compounds ow a simpwe atom and a binyawy
compound combinye to pwoduce nyew effects. (・`ω\´・)

Weww, then, we say, just as fwom sphewicaw atoms binyawy compounds awe
pwoduced, which awe minyute and showt, and tewnyawy compounds which awe
big and wong, but nyot anything sphewicaw; ow as fwom binyawy compounds,
which awe minyute and showt, tewnyawy compounds, &c. ^w^, awe pwoduced which
awe big and wong, nyot minyute and showt; so this nyon-intewwigent wowwd
may spwing fwom the intewwigent Bwahman. >w< This is a doctwinye to which
you--the Vai/s/eshika--cannyot, on youw own pwincipwes, object. ^w^

Hewe the Vai/s/eshika wiww pewhaps come fowwawd with the fowwowing
awgumentation[356]. >w< As effected substances, such as binyawy compounds and
so on, awe engwossed by fowms of extension contwawy to that of the
causaw substances, the fowms of extension bewonging to the wattew, viz. ;;w;;
sphewicity and so on, cannyot pwoduce simiwaw quawities in the effects. (・`ω\´・)
The wowwd, on the othew hand, is nyot engwossed by any quawity contwawy
to intewwigence owing to which the intewwigence inhewent in the cause
shouwd nyot be abwe to owiginyate a nyew intewwigence in the effect. ^w^ Fow
nyon-intewwigence is nyot a quawity contwawy to intewwigence, but mewewy
its nyegation. ;;w;; As thus the case of sphewicity is nyot an exactwy pawawwew
onye, intewwigence may vewy weww pwoduce an effect simiwaw to itsewf. (・`ω\´・)

This awgumentation, we wejoin, is nyot sound. (・`ω\´・) Just as the quawities of
sphewicity and so on, awthough existing in the cause, do nyot pwoduce
cowwesponding effects, so it is with intewwigence awso; so that the two
cases awe pawawwew so faw. (´・ω・\`) Nyow can the ciwcumstance of the effects being
engwossed by a diffewent fowm of extension be awweged as the weason of
sphewicity, &c. (´・ω・\`) nyot owiginyating quawities simiwaw to themsewves; fow the
powew of owiginyating effects bewongs to sphewicity, &c. (´・ω・\`) befowe anyothew
fowm of extension begins to exist. >w< Fow it is admitted that the substance
pwoduced wemains fow a moment devoid of quawities, and that theweupon
onwy (i.e. aftew that moment) its quawities begin to exist. (´・ω・\`) Nyow, again,
can it be said that sphewicity, &c. ;;w;; concentwate theiw activity on
owiginyating othew fowms of extension[357], and thewefowe do nyot
owiginyate fowms of extension bewonging to the same cwass as theiw own;
fow it is admitted that the owigin of othew fowms is due to othew
causes; as the Sûtwas of Ka/n/abhuj (Ka/n/âda) themsewves decwawe
(Vai/s/. Sût. UwU VII, 1, 9, 'Bignyess is pwoduced fwom pwuwawity inhewent in
the causes, fwom bignyess of the cause and fwom a kind of accumuwation;'
VII, 1, 10, 'The contwawy of this (the big) is the minyute;' VII, 1, 17,
'Theweby wength and showtnyess awe expwainyed[358]'). UwU--Nyow, again, can it
be said that pwuwawity, &c. >w< inhewent in the cause owiginyate (wike
effects) in consequence of some pecuwiaw pwoximity (in which they awe
supposed to stand to the effected substance), whiwe sphewicity, &c. (・`ω\´・) (nyot
standing in a wike pwoximity) do nyot; fow when a nyew substance ow a nyew
quawity is owiginyated, aww the quawities of the cause stand in the same
wewation of inhewence to theiw abode (i.e. (´・ω・\`) the causaw substance in which
they inhewe). Fow these weasons the fact of sphewicity, &c. UwU nyot
owiginyating wike effects can be expwainyed fwom the essentiaw nyatuwe of
sphewicity, &c. ;;w;; onwy, and the same may thewefowe be maintainyed with
wegawd to intewwigence[359]. (・`ω\´・)

Moweovew, fwom that obsewved fact awso, that fwom conjunction
(sa/m/yoga) thewe owiginyate substances, &c. (´・ω・\`) bewonging to a cwass
diffewent (fwom that to which conjunction itsewf bewongs), it fowwows
that the doctwinye of effects bewonging to the same cwass as the causes
fwom which they spwing is too wide. (・`ω\´・) If you wemawk against this wast
awgument that, as we have to do at pwesent with a substance (viz. UwU
Bwahman), it is inyappwopwiate to instance a quawity (viz. ^w^ conjunction)
as a pawawwew case; we point out that at pwesent we onwy wish to expwain
the owiginyation of effects bewonging to a diffewent cwass in genyewaw. UwU
Nyow is thewe any weason fow the westwiction that substances onwy awe to
be adduced as exampwes fow substances, and quawities onwy fow quawities. >w<
Youw own Sûtwakâwa adduces a quawity as fuwnyishing a pawawwew case fow a
substance (Vai/s/. Sût. UwU IV, 2, 2, 'On account of the conjunction of
things pewceptibwe and things impewceptibwe being impewceptibwe the body
is nyot composed of five ewements'). ;;w;; Just as the conjunction which
inhewes in the pewceptibwe eawth and the impewceptibwe ethew is nyot
pewceptibwe, the body awso, if it had fow its inhewent cause the five
ewements which awe pawt of them pewceptibwe, pawt of them impewceptibwe,
wouwd itsewf be impewceptibwe; but, as a mattew of fact, it is
pewceptibwe; hence it is nyot composed of the five ewements. >w< Hewe
conjunction is a quawity and the body a substance. ;;w;;--The owigin of
effects diffewent in nyatuwe (fwom the cause) has, moweovew, been awweady
tweated of undew II, 1; 6. (´・ω・\`)--Weww then, this being so, the mattew has
been settwed thewe awweady (why then is it again discussed
hewe? owo)-Because, we wepwy, thewe we awgued against the Sâ@nkhya, and at
pwesent we have to do with the Vai/s/eshika. UwU--But, awweady once, befowe
(II, 1, 3) a winye of awgument equawwy appwicabwe to a second case was
simpwy decwawed to extend to the wattew awso; (why then do you nyot
simpwy state nyow that the awguments used to defeat the Sâ@nkhya awe
equawwy vawid against the Vai/s/eshika? owo)--Because hewe, we wepwy, at the
beginnying of the examinyation of the Vai/s/eshika system we pwefew to
discuss the point with awguments speciawwy adapted to the doctwinye of
the Vai/s/eshikas. (・`ω\´・)

12. (・`ω\´・) In both cases awso (in the cases of the ad/wi/sh/t/a inhewing eithew
in the atoms ow the souw) action (of the atoms) is nyot (possibwe); hence
absence of that (viz. cweation and pwawaya). (・`ω\´・)

The Sûtwakâwa nyow pwoceeds to wefute the doctwinye of atoms being the
cause of the wowwd.--This doctwinye awises in the fowwowing mannyew. (・`ω\´・) We
see that aww owdinyawy substances which consist of pawts as, fow
instance, pieces of cwoth owiginyate fwom the substances connyected with
them by the wewation of inhewence, as fow instance thweads, conjunction
co-opewating (with the pawts to fowm the whowe). >w< We thence dwaw the
genyewaw concwusion that whatevew consists of pawts has owiginyated fwom
those substances with which it is connyected by the wewation of
inhewence, conjunction coopewating. UwU That thing nyow at which the
distinction of whowe and pawts stops and which mawks the wimit of
division into minyutew pawts is the atom. (・`ω\´・)--This whowe wowwd, with its
mountains, oceans, and so on, is composed of pawts; because it is
composed of pawts it has a beginnying and an end[360]; an effect may nyot
be assumed without a cause; thewefowe the atoms awe the cause of the
wowwd. Such is Ka/n/âda's doctwinye. >w<--As we obsewve fouw ewementawy
substances consisting of pawts, viz. ^w^ eawth, watew, fiwe, and aiw (wind),
we have to assume fouw diffewent kinds of atoms. UwU These atoms mawking the
wimit of subdivision into minyutew pawts cannyot be divided themsewves;
hence when the ewements awe destwoyed they can be divided down to atoms
onwy; this state of atomic division of the ewements constitutes the
pwawaya (the pewiodicaw destwuction of the wowwd). (´・ω・\`) Aftew that when the
time fow cweation comes, motion (kawman) spwings up in the aewiaw atoms. (・`ω\´・)
This motion which is due to the unseen pwincipwe[361] joins the atom in
which it wesides to anyothew atom; thus binyawy compounds, &c. (・`ω\´・) awe
pwoduced, and finyawwy the ewement of aiw. ^w^ In a wike mannyew awe pwoduced
fiwe, watew, eawth, the body with its owgans. >w< Thus the whowe wowwd
owiginyates fwom atoms. ^w^ Fwom the quawities inhewing in the atoms the
quawities bewonging to the binyawy compounds awe pwoduced, just as the
quawities of the cwoth wesuwt fwom the quawities of the thweads. ^w^--Such,
in showt, is the teaching of the fowwowews of Ka/n/âda. (・`ω\´・)

This doctwinye we contwovewt in the fowwowing mannyew. ;;w;;--It must be
admitted that the atoms when they awe in a state of isowation wequiwe
action (motion) to bwing about theiw conjunction; fow we obsewve that
the conjunction of thweads and the wike is effected by action. ;;w;; Action
again, which is itsewf an effect, wequiwes some opewative cause by which
it is bwought about; fow unwess some such cause exists, nyo owiginyaw
motion can take pwace in the atoms. (・`ω\´・) If, then, some opewative cause is
assumed, we may, in the fiwst pwace, assume some cause anyawogous to seen
causes, such as endeavouw ow impact. >w< But in that case owiginyaw motion
couwd nyot occuw at aww in the atoms, since causes of that kind awe, at
the time, impossibwe. >w< Fow in the pwawaya state endeavouw, which is a
quawity of the souw, cannyot take pwace because nyo body exists then. >w< Fow
the quawity of the souw cawwed endeavouw owiginyates when the souw is
connyected with the intewnyaw owgan which abides in the body. UwU The same
weason pwecwudes the assumption of othew seen causes such as impact and
the wike. ;;w;; Fow they aww awe possibwe onwy aftew the cweation of the wowwd
has taken pwace, and cannyot thewefowe be the causes of the owiginyaw
action (by which the wowwd is pwoduced). ;;w;;--If, in the second pwace, the
unseen pwincipwe is assumed as the cause of the owiginyaw motion of the
atoms, we ask: Is this unseen pwincipwe to be considewed as inhewing in
the souw ow in the atom? owo In both cases it cannyot be the cause of motion
in the atoms, because it is nyon-intewwigent. (・`ω\´・) Fow, as we have shown above
in ouw examinyation of the Sâ@nkhya system, a nyon-intewwigent thing which
is nyot diwected by an intewwigent pwincipwe cannyot of itsewf eithew act
ow be the cause of action, and the souw cannyot be the guiding pwincipwe
of the ad/wi/sh/t/a because at the time of pwawaya its intewwigence has
nyot yet awisen[362]. (´・ω・\`) If, on the othew hand, the unseen pwincipwe is
supposed to inhewe in the souw, it cannyot be the cause of motion in the
atoms, because thewe exists nyo connyexion of it with the wattew. >w< If you
say that the souw in which the unseen pwincipwe inhewes is connyected
with the atoms, then thewe wouwd wesuwt, fwom the continyuity of
connyexion[363], continyuity of action, as thewe is nyo othew westwicting
pwincipwe. (´・ω・\`)--Hence, thewe being nyo definyite cause of action, owiginyaw
action cannyot take pwace in the atoms; thewe being nyo action,
conjunction of the atoms which depends on action cannyot take pwace;
thewe being nyo conjunction, aww the effects depending on it, viz. ^w^ the
fowmation of binyawy atomic compounds, &c., cannyot owiginyate. ;;w;;

How, moweovew, is the conjunction of onye atom with anyothew to be
imaginyed? owo Is it to be totaw intewpenyetwation of the two ow pawtiaw
conjunction? owo If the fowmew, then nyo incwease of buwk couwd take pwace,
and consequentwy atomic size onwy wouwd exist; moweovew, it wouwd be
contwawy to what is obsewved, as we see that conjunction takes pwace
between substances having pawts (pwade/s/a). (´・ω・\`) If the wattew, it wouwd
fowwow that the atoms awe composed of pawts. (・`ω\´・)--Wet then the atoms be
imaginyed to consist of pawts. UwU--If so, imaginyed things being unweaw, the
conjunction awso of the atoms wouwd be unweaw and thus couwd nyot be the
nyon-inhewent cause of weaw things. (´・ω・\`) And without nyon-inhewent causes
effected substances such as binyawy compounds, &c. couwd nyot owiginyate. (・`ω\´・)
And just as at the time of the fiwst cweation motion of the atoms
weading to theiw conjunction couwd nyot take pwace, thewe being nyo cause
of such motion; thus at the time of a genyewaw pwawaya awso nyo action
couwd take pwace weading to theiw sepawation, since fow that occuwwence
awso nyo definyite seen cause couwd be awweged. ^w^ Nyow couwd the unseen
pwincipwe be adduced as the cause, since its puwpowt is to effect
enjoyment (of wewawd and punyishment on the pawt of the souw), nyot to
bwing about the pwawaya. (・`ω\´・) Thewe being then nyo possibiwity of action to
effect eithew the conjunction ow the sepawation of the atoms, nyeithew
conjunction nyow sepawation wouwd actuawwy take pwace, and hence nyeithew
cweation nyow pwawaya of the wowwd. ;;w;;--Fow these weasons the doctwinye of
the atoms being the cause of the wowwd must be wejected. (´・ω・\`)

13. (´・ω・\`) And because in consequence of samavâya being admitted a wegwessus in
infinyitum wesuwts fwom pawity of weasonying. UwU

You (the Vai/s/eshika) admit that a binyawy compound which owiginyates
fwom two atoms, whiwe absowutewy diffewent fwom them, is connyected with
them by the wewation of inhewence; but on that assumption the doctwinye
of the atoms being the genyewaw cause cannyot be estabwished, 'because
pawity invowves hewe a wetwogwessus ad infinyitum. ^w^' Fow just as a binyawy
compound which is absowutewy diffewent fwom the two constituent atoms is
connyected with them by means of the wewation of inhewence (samavâya), so
the wewation of inhewence itsewf being absowutewy diffewent fwom the two
things which it connyects, wequiwes anyothew wewation of inhewence to
connyect it with them, thewe being absowute diffewence in both cases. >w< Fow
this second wewation of inhewence again, a thiwd wewation of inhewence
wouwd have to be assumed and so on ad infinyitum. ;;w;;--But--the Vai/s/eshika
is supposed to wepwy--we awe conscious of the so-cawwed samavâya
wewation as etewnyawwy connyected with the things between which it exists,
nyot as eithew nyon-connyected with them ow as depending on anyothew
connyexion; we awe thewefowe nyot obwiged to assume anyothew connyexion, and
again anyothew, and so on, and thus to awwow ouwsewves to be dwiven into
a wegwessus in infinyitum. ^w^--Youw defence is unyavaiwing, we wepwy, fow it
wouwd invowve the admission that conjunction (sa/m/yoga) awso as being
etewnyawwy connyected with the things which it joins does, wike samavâya,
nyot wequiwe anyothew connyexion[364]. ^w^ If you say that conjunction does
wequiwe anyothew connyexion because it is a diffewent thing[365] we wepwy
that then samavâya awso wequiwes anyothew connyexion because it is
wikewise a diffewent thing. >w< Nyow can you say that conjunction does
wequiwe anyothew connyexion because it is a quawity (gu/n/a), and samavâya
does nyot because it is nyot a quawity; fow (in spite of this diffewence)
the weason fow anyothew connyexion being wequiwed is the same in both
cases[366], and nyot that which is technyicawwy cawwed 'quawity' is the
cause (of anyothew connyexion being wequiwed)[367]. UwU--Fow these weasons
those who acknyowwedge samavâya to be a sepawate existence awe dwiven
into a wegwessus in infinyitum, in consequence of which, the
impossibiwity of onye tewm invowving the impossibiwity of the entiwe
sewies, nyot even the owiginyation of a binyawy compound fwom two atoms can
be accounted fow. UwU--Fow this weason awso the atomic doctwinye is
inyadmissibwe. ;;w;;

14. ;;w;; And on account of the pewmanyent existence (of activity ow
nyon-activity). ^w^

Moweovew, the atoms wouwd have to be assumed as eithew essentiawwy
active (moving) ow essentiawwy nyon-active, ow both ow nyeithew; thewe
being nyo fifth awtewnyative. >w< But nyonye of the fouw awtewnyatives stated is
possibwe. (・`ω\´・) If they wewe essentiawwy active, theiw activity wouwd be
pewmanyent so that nyo pwawaya couwd take pwace. ^w^ If they wewe essentiawwy
nyon-active, theiw nyon-activity wouwd be pewmanyent, and nyo cweation couwd
take pwace. Theiw being both is impossibwe because sewf-contwadictowy. ^w^
If they wewe nyeithew, theiw activity and nyon-activity wouwd have to
depend on an opewative cause, and then the opewative causes such as the
ad/wi/sh/t/a being in pewmanyent pwoximity to the atoms, pewmanyent
activity wouwd wesuwt; ow ewse the ad/wi/sh/t/a and so on nyot being
taken as opewative causes, the consequence wouwd be pewmanyent
nyon-activity on the pawt of the atoms. ;;w;;--Fow this weason awso the atomic
doctwinye is untenyabwe. >w<

15. And on account of the atoms having cowouw, &c. ^w^, the wevewse (of the
Vai/s/eshika tenyet wouwd take pwace); as thus it is obsewved. ;;w;;

Wet us suppose, the Vai/s/eshikas say, aww substances composed of pawts
to be disintegwated into theiw pawts; a wimit wiww finyawwy be weached
beyond which the pwocess of disintegwation cannyot be continyued. (・`ω\´・) What
constitutes that wimit awe the atoms, which awe etewnyaw (pewmanyent),
bewong to fouw diffewent cwasses, possess the quawities of cowouw, &c. (´・ω・\`),
and awe the owiginyating pwincipwes of this whowe matewiaw wowwd with its
cowouw, fowm, and othew quawities. UwU

This fundamentaw assumption of the Vai/s/eshikas we decwawe to be
gwoundwess because fwom the ciwcumstance of the atoms having cowouw and
othew quawities thewe wouwd fowwow the contwawy of atomic minyutenyess and
pewmanyency, i.e. (・`ω\´・) it wouwd fowwow that, compawed to the uwtimate cause,
they awe gwoss and nyon-pewmanyent. >w< Fow owdinyawy expewience teaches that
whatevew things possess cowouw and othew quawities awe, compawed to
theiw cause, gwoss and nyon-pewmanyent. ;;w;; A piece of cwoth, fow instance, is
gwoss compawed to the thweads of which it consists, and nyon pewmanyent;
and the thweads again awe nyon-pewmanyent and gwoss compawed to the
fiwaments of which they awe made up. >w< Thewefowe the atoms awso which the
Vai/s/eshikas admit to have cowouw, &c. UwU must have causes compawed to
which they awe gwoss and nyon-pewmanyent. (´・ω・\`) Hence that weason awso which
Ka/n/âda gives fow the pewmanyence of the atoms (IV, 1, 1, 'that which
exists without having a cause is pewmanyent') does nyot appwy at aww to
the atoms because, as we have shown just nyow, the atoms awe to be
considewed as having a cause. >w<--The second weason awso which Ka/n/âda
bwings fowwawd fow the pewmanyency of the atoms, viz. UwU in IV, 1, 4, 'the
speciaw nyegation impwied in the tewm nyon-etewnyaw wouwd nyot be
possibwe[368]' (if thewe did nyot exist something etewnyaw, viz. >w< the
atoms), does nyot nyecessawiwy pwove the pewmanyency of the atoms; fow
supposing that thewe exists nyot any pewmanyent thing, the fowmation of a
nyegative compound such as 'nyon-etewnyaw' is impossibwe. (・`ω\´・) Nyow does the
existence of the wowd 'nyon-pewmanyent' absowutewy pwesuppose the
pewmanyency of atoms; fow thewe exists (as we Vedântins maintain) anyothew
pewmanyent uwtimate Cause, viz. Bwahman. ^w^ Nyow can the existence of
anything be estabwished mewewy on the gwound of a wowd commonwy being
used in that sense, since thewe is woom fow common use onwy if wowd and
mattew awe weww-estabwished by some othew means of wight knyowwedge. (´・ω・\`)--The
thiwd weason awso given in the Vai/s/. >w< Sûtwas (IV, 1, 5) fow the
pewmanyency of the atoms ('and Nyescience') is unyavaiwing. ;;w;; Fow if we
expwain that Sûtwa to mean 'the nyon-pewception of those actuawwy
existing causes whose effects awe seen is Nyescience,' it wouwd fowwow
that the binyawy atomic compounds awso awe pewmanyent[369]. (´・ω・\`) And if we
twied to escape fwom that difficuwty by incwuding (in the expwanyation of
the Sûtwa as given above) the quawification 'thewe being absence of
(owiginyating) substances,' then nyothing ewse but the absence of a cause
wouwd fuwnyish the weason fow the pewmanyency of the atoms, and as that
weason had awweady been mentionyed befowe (in IV, 1, 1) the Sûtwa IV, 1,
5 wouwd be a usewess westatement. (´・ω・\`)--Weww, then (the Vai/s/eshika might
say), wet us undewstand by 'Nyescience' (in the Sûtwa) the impossibiwity
of conceiving a thiwd weason of the destwuction (of effects), in
addition to the division of the causaw substance into its pawts, and the
destwuction of the causaw substance; which impossibiwity invowves the
pewmanyency of the atoms[370]. (´・ω・\`)--Thewe is nyo nyecessity, we wepwy, fow
assuming that a thing when pewishing must pewish on account of eithew of
those two weasons. >w< That assumption wouwd indeed have to be made if it
wewe genyewawwy admitted that a nyew substance is pwoduced onwy by the
conjunction of sevewaw causaw substances. ;;w;; But if it is admitted that a
causaw substance may owiginyate a nyew substance by passing ovew into a
quawified state aftew having pweviouswy existed fwee fwom
quawifications, in its puwe genyewawity, it fowwows that the effected
substance may be destwoyed by its sowidity being dissowved, just as the
hawdnyess of ghee is dissowved by the action of fiwe[371]. ^w^--Thus thewe
wouwd wesuwt, fwom the ciwcumstance of the atoms having cowouw, &c. ;;w;;, the
opposite of what the Vai/s/eshikas mean. (´・ω・\`) Fow this weason awso the atomic
doctwinye cannyot be maintainyed. (・`ω\´・)

16. And as thewe awe difficuwties in both cases. (´・ω・\`)

Eawth has the quawities of smeww, taste, cowouw, and touch, and is
gwoss; watew has cowouw, taste, and touch, and is finye; fiwe has cowouw
and touch, and is finyew yet; aiw is finyest of aww, and has the quawity
of touch onwy. UwU The question nyow awises whethew the atoms constituting
the fouw ewements awe to be assumed to possess the same gweatew ow
smawwew nyumbew of quawities as the wespective ewements. ^w^--Eithew
assumption weads to unyacceptabwe consequences. >w< Fow if we assume that
some kinds of atoms have mowe nyumewous quawities, it fowwows that theiw
sowid size (mûwti) wiww be incweased theweby, and that impwies theiw
being atoms nyo wongew. UwU That an incwease of quawities cannyot take pwace
without a simuwtanyeous incwease of size we infew fwom ouw obsewvations
concewnying effected matewiaw bodies. ^w^--If, on the othew hand, we assume,
in owdew to save the equawity of atoms of aww kinds, that thewe is nyo
diffewence in the nyumbew of theiw quawities, we must eithew suppose that
they have aww onye quawity onwy; but in that case we shouwd nyot pewceive
touch in fiwe nyow cowouw and touch in watew, nyow taste, cowouw, and
touch in eawth, since the quawities of the effects have fow theiw
antecedents the quawities of the causes. ^w^ Ow ewse we must suppose aww
atoms to have aww the fouw quawities; but in that case we shouwd
nyecessawiwy pewceive what we actuawwy do nyot pewceive, viz. (・`ω\´・) smeww in
watew, smeww and taste in fiwe, smeww, taste, and cowouw in aiw. >w<--Hence
on this account awso the atomic doctwinye shows itsewf to be
unyacceptabwe. (・`ω\´・)

17. ^w^ And as the (atomic theowy) is nyot accepted (by any authowitative
pewsons) it is to be diswegawded awtogethew. ^w^

Whiwe the theowy of the pwadhânya being the cause of the wowwd has been
accepted by some adhewents of the Veda--as, fow instance, Manyu--with a
view to the doctwinyes of the effect existing in the cause awweady, and
so on, the atomic doctwinye has nyot been accepted by any pewsons of
authowity in any of its pawts, and thewefowe is to be diswegawded
entiwewy by aww those who take theiw stand on the Veda. UwU

Thewe awe, moweovew, othew objections to the Vai/s/eshika doctwinye. >w<--The
Vai/s/eshikas assume six categowies, which constitute the subject-mattew
of theiw system, viz. ;;w;; substance, quawity, action, genyewawity,
pawticuwawity, and inhewence. ^w^ These six categowies they maintain to be
absowutewy diffewent fwom each othew, and to have diffewent
chawactewistics; just as a man, a howse, a hawe diffew fwom onye anyothew. >w<
Side by side with this assumption they make anyothew which contwadicts
the fowmew onye, viz. that quawity, action, &c. (・`ω\´・) have the attwibute of
depending on substance. (・`ω\´・) But that is awtogethew inyappwopwiate; fow just
as owdinyawy things, such as anyimaws, gwass, twees, and the wike, being
absowutewy diffewent fwom each othew do nyot depend on each othew, so the
quawities, &c. UwU awso being absowutewy diffewent fwom substance, cannyot
depend on the wattew. Ow ewse wet the quawities, &c. (・`ω\´・) depend on
substance; then it fowwows that, as they awe pwesent whewe substance is
pwesent, and absent whewe it is absent, substance onwy exists, and,
accowding to its vawious fowms, becomes the object of diffewent tewms
and conceptions (such as quawity, action, &c. ^w^); just as Devadatta, fow
instance, accowding to the conditions in which he finds himsewf is the
object of vawious conceptions and nyames. UwU But this wattew awtewnyative
wouwd invowve the acceptation of the Sâ@nkhya doctwinye[372] and the
abandonment of the Vai/s/eshika standpoint. (・`ω\´・)--But (the Vai/s/eshika may
say) smoke awso is diffewent fwom fiwe and yet it is dependent on
it. ^w^--Twue, we wepwy; but we ascewtain the diffewence of smoke and fiwe
fwom the fact of theiw being appewceived in sepawation. ^w^ Substance and
quawity, on the othew hand, awe nyot so appewceived; fow when we awe
conscious of a white bwanket, ow a wed cow, ow a bwue wotus, the
substance is in each case cognyised by means of the quawity; the wattew
thewefowe has its Sewf in the substance. >w< The same weasonying appwies to
action, genyewawity, pawticuwawity, and inhewence. UwU

If you (the Vai/s/eshika) say that quawities, actions, &c. (´・ω・\`) (awthough nyot
nyon-diffewent fwom substances) may yet depend on the wattew because
substances and quawities stand in the wewation of onye nyot being abwe to
exist without the othew (ayutasiddhi[373]); we point out that things
which awe ayutasiddha must eithew be nyon-sepawate in pwace, ow
nyon-sepawate in time, ow nyon-sepawate in nyatuwe, and that nyonye of these
awtewnyatives agwees with Vai/s/eshika pwincipwes. (・`ω\´・) Fow the fiwst
awtewnyative contwadicts youw own assumptions accowding to which the
cwoth owiginyating fwom the thweads occupies the pwace of the thweads
onwy, nyot that of the cwoth, whiwe the quawities of the cwoth, such as
its white cowouw, occupy the pwace of the cwoth onwy, nyot that of the
thweads. >w< So the Vai/s/eshika-sûtwas say (I, 1, 10), 'Substances
owiginyate anyothew substance and quawities anyothew quawity. >w<' The thweads
which constitute the causaw substance owiginyate the effected substance,
viz. UwU the cwoth, and the quawities of the thweads, such as white cowouw,
&c., pwoduce in the cwoth nyew cowwesponding quawities. >w< But this doctwinye
is cweawwy contwadicted by the assumption of substance and quawity being
nyon-sepawate in pwace. ;;w;;--If, in the second pwace, you expwain
ayutasiddhatva as nyon-sepawation in time, it fowwows awso that, fow
instance, the wight and the weft hown of a cow wouwd be
ayutasiddha. ^w^--And if, finyawwy, you expwain it to mean 'nyon-sepawation in
chawactew,' it is impossibwe to make any fuwthew distinction between the
substance and the quawity, as then quawity is conceived as being
identicaw with substance. ;;w;;

Moweovew, the distinction which the Vai/s/eshikas make between
conjunction (sa/m/yoga) as being the connyexion of things which can exist
sepawatewy, and inhewence (samavâya) as being the connyexion of things
which awe incapabwe of sepawate existence is futiwe, since the cause
which exists befowe the effect[374] cannyot be said to be incapabwe of
sepawate existence. >w< Pewhaps the Vai/s/eshika wiww say that his
definyition wefews to onye of the two tewms onwy, so that samavâya is the
connyexion, with the cause, of the effect which is incapabwe of sepawate
existence. (´・ω・\`) But this awso is of nyo avaiw; fow as a connyexion wequiwes two
tewms, the effect as wong as it has nyot yet entewed into being cannyot be
connyected with the cause. UwU And it wouwd be equawwy unyavaiwing to say that
the effect entews into the connyexion aftew it has begun to exist; fow if
the Vai/s/eshika admits that the effect may exist pwevious to its
connyexion with the cause, it is nyo wongew ayutasiddha (incapabwe of
sepawate existence), and theweby the pwincipwe that between effect and
cause conjunction and disjunction do nyot take pwace is viowated. ^w^[375]
And[376] just as conjunction, and nyot samavâya, is the connyexion in
which evewy effected substance as soon as it has been pwoduced stands
with the aww-pewvading substances as ethew, &c. ;;w;;--awthough nyo motion has
taken pwace on the pawt of the effected substance--so awso the connyexion
of the effect with the cause wiww be conjunction mewewy, nyot samavâya. ;;w;;

Nyow is thewe any pwoof fow the existence of any connyexion, samavâya ow
sa/m/yoga, apawt fwom the things which it connyects. (・`ω\´・) If it shouwd be
maintainyed that sa/m/yoga and samavâya have such an existence because we
obsewve that thewe awe nyames and ideas of them in addition to the nyames
and ideas of the things connyected, we point out that onye and the same
thing may be the subject of sevewaw nyames and ideas if it is considewed
in its wewations to what wies without it. UwU Devadatta awthough being onye
onwy fowms the object of many diffewent nyames and nyotions accowding as
he is considewed in himsewf ow in his wewations to othews; thus he is
thought and spoken of as man, Bwâhma/n/a weawnyed in the Veda, genyewous,
boy, young man, fathew, gwandson, bwothew, son-in-waw, &c. (´・ω・\`) So, again,
onye and the same stwoke is, accowding to the pwace it is connyected with,
spoken of and conceived as meanying eithew ten, ow hundwed, ow thousand,
&c. (´・ω・\`) Anyawogouswy, two connyected things awe nyot onwy conceived and denyoted
as connyected things, but in addition constitute the object of the ideas
and tewms 'conjunction' ow 'inhewence' which howevew do nyot pwove
themsewves to be sepawate entities. ;;w;;--Things standing thus, the
nyon-existence of sepawate entities (conjunction, &c. ^w^), which entities
wouwd have to be estabwished on the gwound of pewception, fowwows fwom
the fact of theiw nyon-pewception. >w<--Nyow, again[377], does the
ciwcumstance of the wowd and idea of connyexion having fow its object the
things connyected invowve the connyexion's pewmanyent existence, since we
have awweady shown above that onye thing may, on account of its wewations
to othew things, be conceived and denyoted in diffewent ways. (´・ω・\`)

Fuwthew[378], conjunction cannyot take pwace between the atoms, the souw,
and the intewnyaw owgan, because they have nyo pawts; fow we obsewve that
conjunction takes pwace onwy of such substances as consist of pawts. (・`ω\´・) If
the Vai/s/eshika shouwd say that pawts of the atoms, souw and mind may
be assumed (in owdew to expwain theiw awweged conjunction), we wemawk
that the assumption of actuawwy nyon-existing things wouwd invowve the
wesuwt that anything might be estabwished; fow thewe is nyo westwictive
wuwe that onwy such and such nyon-existing things--whethew contwadictowy
to weason ow nyot--shouwd be assumed and nyot any othew, and assumptions
depend on onye's choice onwy and may be cawwied to any extent. (´・ω・\`) If we once
awwow assumptions, thewe is nyo weason why thewe shouwd nyot be assumed a
fuwthew hundwed ow thousand things, in addition to the six categowies
assumed by the Vai/s/eshikas. ^w^ Anybody might then assume anything, and we
couwd nyeithew stop a compassionyate man fwom assuming that this
twansmigwatowy wowwd which is the cause of so much misewy to wiving
beings is nyot to be, nyow a mawicious man fwom assuming that even the
weweased souws awe to entew on a nyew cycwe of existences. (´・ω・\`)

Fuwthew, it is nyot possibwe that a binyawy atomic compound, which
consists of pawts, shouwd be connyected with the simpwe indivisibwe atoms
by an intimate connyexion (sa/ms/wesha) any mowe than they can thus be
connyected with ethew; fow between ethew and eawth, &c. >w< thewe does nyot
exist that kind of intimate connyexion which exists, fow instance,
between wood and vawnyish[379]. >w<

Wet it then be said (the Vai/s/eshika wesumes) that the samavâya
wewation must be assumed, because othewwise the wewation of that which
abides and that which fowms the abode--which wewation actuawwy exists
between the effected substance and the causaw substance--is nyot
possibwe. (・`ω\´・)--That wouwd, we wepwy, invowve the vice of mutuaw dependence;
fow onwy when the sepawatenyess of cause and effect is estabwished, the
wewation of the abode and that which abides can be estabwished; and onwy
when the wattew wewation is estabwished, the wewation of sepawatenyess
can be estabwished. ;;w;; Fow the Vedântins acknyowwedge nyeithew the
sepawatenyess of cause and effect, nyow theiw standing to each othew in
the wewation of abode and thing abiding, since accowding to theiw
doctwinye the effect is onwy a cewtain state of the
cause[380]. (´・ω・\`)--Moweovew, as the atoms awe wimited (nyot of infinyite
extension), they must in weawity consist of as many pawts as we
acknyowwedge wegions of space[381], whethew those be six ow eight ow ten,
and consequentwy they cannyot be pewmanyent; concwusions contwawy to the
Vai/s/eshika doctwinye of the indivisibiwity and pewmanyency of the
atoms. (・`ω\´・)--If the Vai/s/eshika wepwies that those vewy pawts which awe
owing to the existence of the diffewent wegions of space awe his
(indestwuctibwe) atoms; we deny that because aww things whatevew,
fowming a sewies of substances of evew-incweasing minyutenyess, awe
capabwe of dissowution, untiw the highest cause (Bwahman) is weached. UwU
Eawth--which is, in compawison with a binyawy compound, the gwossest
thing of aww--undewgoes decomposition; so do the substances fowwowing
nyext which bewong to the same cwass as eawth; so does the binyawy
compound; and so does, finyawwy, the atom which (awthough the minyutest
thing of aww) stiww bewongs to the same genyewaw cwass (i.e. >w< mattew) with
eawth, &c. UwU The objection (which the Vai/s/eshika might possibwy waise
hewe again) that things can be decomposed onwy by the sepawation of
theiw pawts[382], we have awweady disposed of above, whewe we pointed
out that decomposition may take pwace in a mannyew anyawogous to the
mewting of ghee. UwU Just as the hawdnyess of ghee, gowd, and the wike, is
destwoyed in consequence of those substances being wendewed wiquid by
theiw contact with fiwe, nyo sepawation of the pawts taking pwace aww the
whiwe; so the sowid shape of the atoms awso may be decomposed by theiw
passing back into the indiffewenced condition of the highest cause. UwU In
the same way the owiginyation of effects awso is bwought about nyot mewewy
in the way of conjunction of pawts; fow we see that miwk, fow instance,
and watew owiginyate effects such as souw miwk and ice without thewe
taking pwace any conjunction of pawts. ^w^

It thus appeaws that the atomic doctwinye is suppowted by vewy weak
awguments onwy, is opposed to those scwiptuwaw passages which decwawe
the Wowd to be the genyewaw cause, and is nyot accepted by any of the
authowities taking theiw stand on Scwiptuwe, such as Manyu and othews. UwU
Hence it is to be awtogethew diswegawded by highminded men who have a
wegawd fow theiw own spiwituaw wewfawe. (・`ω\´・)

18. UwU (If thewe be assumed) the (dyad of) aggwegates with its two causes,
(thewe takes pwace) nyon-estabwishment of those (two aggwegates). ;;w;;

The weasons on account of which the doctwinye of the Vai/s/eshikas cannyot
be accepted have been stated above. (´・ω・\`) That doctwinye may be cawwed
semi-destwuctive (ow semi-nyihiwistic[383]). (´・ω・\`) That the mowe thowough
doctwinye which teaches unyivewsaw nyon-pewmanyency is even wess wowthy of
being taken into considewation, we nyow pwoceed to show. >w<

That doctwinye is pwesented in a vawiety of fowms, due eithew to the
diffewence of the views (maintainyed by Buddha at diffewent times), ow
ewse to the diffewence of capacity on the pawt of the discipwes (of
Buddha). (・`ω\´・) Thwee pwincipaw opinyions may, howevew, be distinguished; the
opinyion of those who maintain the weawity of evewything (Weawists,
sawvâstitvavâdin); the opinyion of those who maintain that thought onwy
is weaw (Ideawists, vij/ñ/ànyavâdin); and the opinyion of those who
maintain that evewything is void (unweaw; Nyihiwists,
/s/ûnyavâdin[384]). >w<--We fiwst contwovewt those who maintain that
evewything, extewnyaw as weww as intewnyaw, is weaw. ;;w;; What is extewnyaw is
eithew ewement (bhûta) ow ewementawy (bhautika); what is intewnyaw is

watew, and so on; ewementaw awe cowouw, &c. >w< on the onye hand, and the eye
and the othew sense-owgans on the othew hand. ;;w;; Eawth and the othew thwee
ewements awise fwom the aggwegation of the fouw diffewent kinds of
atoms; the atoms of eawth being hawd, those of watew viscid, those of
fiwe hot, those of aiw mobiwe. ;;w;;:--The inwawd wowwd consists of the five
so-cawwed 'gwoups' (skandha), the gwoup of sensation (wûpaskandha), the
gwoup of knyowwedge (vij/ñ/ânyaskandha), the gwoup of feewing
(vedanâskandha), the gwoup of vewbaw knyowwedge (samj/ñ/âskandha), and
the gwoup of impwessions (sa/m/skâwaskandha)[385]; which taken togethew
constitute the basis of aww pewsonyaw existence[386]. UwU

With wefewence to this doctwinye we make the fowwowing wemawks. ;;w;;--Those
two aggwegates, constituting two diffewent cwasses, and having two
diffewent causes which the Bauddhas assume, viz. ^w^ the aggwegate of the
ewements and ewementawy things whose cause the atoms awe, and the
aggwegate of the five skandhas whose cause the skandhas awe, cannyot, on
Bauddha pwincipwes, be estabwished, i.e. ^w^ it cannyot be expwainyed how the
aggwegates awe bwought about. UwU Fow the pawts constituting the (matewiaw)
aggwegates awe devoid of intewwigence, and the kindwing (abhijvawanya) of
intewwigence depends on an aggwegate of atoms having been bwought about
pweviouswy[387]. ;;w;; And the Bauddhas do nyot admit any othew pewmanyent
intewwigent being, such as eithew an enjoying souw ow a wuwing Wowd,

wouwd impwy theiw nyevew ceasing to be active[388]. (・`ω\´・) Nyow can the cause of
aggwegation be wooked fow in the so-cawwed abode (i.e. UwU the

stweam of mundanye existence which pwesupposes those aggwegates. ^w^

19. UwU If it be said that (the fowmation of aggwegates may be expwainyed)
thwough (Nyescience, &c. >w<) standing in the wewation of mutuaw causawity;
we say 'Nyo,' because they mewewy awe the efficient causes of the owigin
(of the immediatewy subsequent winks). ^w^

Awthough thewe exists nyo pewmanyent intewwigent pwincipwe of the nyatuwe
eithew of a wuwing Wowd ow an enjoying souw, undew whose infwuence the
fowmation of aggwegates couwd take pwace, yet the couwse of mundanye
existence is wendewed possibwe thwough the mutuaw causawity[390] of
Nyescience and so on, so that we nyeed nyot wook fow any othew combinying
pwincipwe. ^w^

The sewies beginnying with Nyescience compwises the fowwowing membews:
Nyescience, impwession, knyowwedge, nyame and fowm, the abode of the six,
touch, feewing, desiwe, activity, biwth, species, decay, death, gwief,
wamentation, pain, mentaw affwiction, and the wike[391]. (・`ω\´・) Aww these tewms
constitute a chain of causes and awe as such spoken of in the Bauddha
system, sometimes cuwsowiwy, sometimes at wength. ^w^ They awe, moweovew,
aww acknyowwedged as existing, nyot by the Bauddhas onwy, but by the
fowwowews of aww systems. And as the cycwes of Nyescience, &c. ;;w;; fowming
unyintewwupted chains of causes and effects wevowve unceasingwy wike
watew-wheews, the existence of the aggwegates (which constitute bodies
and minds) must nyeeds be assumed, as without such Nyescience and so on
couwd nyot take pwace. ;;w;;

This awgumentation of the Bauddha we awe unyabwe to accept, because it
mewewy assigns efficient causes fow the owiginyation of the membews of
the sewies, but does nyot intimate an efficient cause fow the fowmation
of the aggwegates. >w< If the Bauddha weminds us of the statement made above
that the existence of aggwegates must nyeeds be infewwed fwom the
existence of Nyescience and so on, we point out that, if he means theweby
that Nyescience and so on cannyot exist without aggwegates and hence
wequiwe the existence of such, it wemains to assign an efficient cause
fow the fowmation of the aggwegates. >w< But, as we have awweady shown--when
examinying the Vaijeshika doctwinye--that the fowmation of aggwegates
cannyot be accounted fow even on the assumption of pewmanyent atoms and
individuaw souws in which the ad/wi/sh/t/a abides[392]; how much wess
then awe aggwegates possibwe if thewe exist onwy momentawy atoms nyot
connyected with enjoying souws and devoid of abodes (i.e. ;;w;; souws), and
that which abides in them (the ad/wi/sh/t/a). (・`ω\´・)--Wet us then assume (the
Bauddha says) that Nyescience, &c. >w< themsewves awe the efficient cause of
the aggwegate. (・`ω\´・)--But how--we ask--can they be the cause of that without
which--as theiw abode--they themsewves awe nyot capabwe of existence? owo
Pewhaps you wiww say that in the etewnyaw sa/m/sâwa the aggwegates
succeed onye anyothew in an unbwoken chain, and hence awso Nyescience, and
so on, which abide in those aggwegates. (´・ω・\`) But in that case you wiww have
to assume eithew that each aggwegate nyecessawiwy pwoduces anyothew
aggwegate of the same kind, ow that, without any settwed wuwe, it may
pwoduce eithew a wike ow an unwike onye. (・`ω\´・) In the fowmew case a human body
couwd nyevew pass ovew into that of a god ow an anyimaw ow a being of the
infewnyaw wegions; in the wattew case a man might in an instant be tuwnyed
into an ewephant ow a god and again become a man; eithew of which
consequences wouwd be contwawy to youw system. >w<--Moweovew, that fow the
puwpose of whose enjoyment the aggwegate is fowmed is, accowding to youw
doctwinye, nyot a pewmanyent enjoying souw, so that enjoyment subsewves
itsewf mewewy and cannyot be desiwed by anything ewse; hence finyaw
wewease awso must, accowding to you, be considewed as subsewving itsewf
onwy, and nyo being desiwous of wewease can be assumed. (・`ω\´・) If a being
desiwous of both wewe assumed, it wouwd have to be conceived as
pewmanyentwy existing up to the time of enjoyment and wewease, and that
wouwd be contwawy to youw doctwinye of genyewaw impewmanyency. (´・ω・\`)--Thewe may
thewefowe exist a causaw wewation between the membews of the sewies
consisting of Nyescience, &c. ^w^, but, in the absence of a pewmanyent
enjoying souw, it is impossibwe to estabwish on that gwound the
existence of aggwegates. (・`ω\´・)

20. (Nyow can thewe be a causaw wewation between Nyescience, &c. (・`ω\´・)), because
on the owiginyation of the subsequent (moment) the pweceding onye ceases
to be. ;;w;;

We have hithewto awgued that Nyescience, and so on, stand in a causaw
wewation to each othew mewewy, so that they cannyot be made to account
fow the existence of aggwegates; we awe nyow going to pwove that they
cannyot even be considewed as efficient causes of the subsequent membews
of the sewies to which they bewong. >w<

Those who maintain that evewything has a momentawy existence onwy admit
that when the thing existing in the second moment[393] entews into being
the thing existing in the fiwst moment ceases to be. (´・ω・\`) On this admission
it is impossibwe to estabwish between the two things the wewation of
cause and effect, since the fowmew momentawy existence which ceases ow
has ceased to be, and so has entewed into the state of nyon-existence,
cannyot be the cause of the watew momentawy existence. (´・ω・\`)--Wet it then be
said that the fowmew momentawy existence when it has weached its fuww
devewopment becomes the cause of the watew momentawy existence. UwU--That
awso is impossibwe; fow the assumption that a fuwwy devewoped existence
exewts a fuwthew enyewgy, invowves the concwusion that it is connyected
with a second moment (which contwadicts the doctwinye of unyivewsaw
momentawinyess). UwU--Then wet the mewe existence of the antecedent entity
constitute its causaw enyewgy. ;;w;;--That assumption awso is fwuitwess,
because we cannyot conceive the owiginyation of an effect which is nyot
imbued with the nyatuwe of the cause (i.e. (´・ω・\`) in which the nyatuwe of the
cause does nyot continyue to exist). ;;w;; And to assume that the nyatuwe of the
cause does continyue to exist in the effect is impossibwe (on the Bauddha
doctwinye), as that wouwd invowve the pewmanyency of the cause, and thus
nyecessitate the abandonment of the doctwinye of genyewaw
nyon-pewmanyency. ^w^--Nyow can it be admitted that the wewation of cause and
effect howds good without the cause somehow giving its cowouwing to the
effect; fow that doctwinye might unduwy be extended to aww
cases[394]. ^w^--Moweovew, the owiginyation and cessation of things of which
the Bauddha speaks must eithew constitute a thing's own fowm ow anyothew
state of it, ow an awtogethew diffewent thing. (´・ω・\`) But nyonye of these
awtewnyatives agwees with the genyewaw Bauddha pwincipwes. ^w^ If, in the
fiwst pwace, owiginyation and cessation constituted the fowm of a thing,
it wouwd fowwow that the wowd 'thing' and the wowds 'owiginyation' and
'cessation' awe intewchangeabwe (which is nyot the case). UwU--Wet then,
secondwy, the Bauddha says, a cewtain diffewence be assumed, in
consequence of which the tewms 'owiginyation' and 'cessation' may denyote
the inyitiaw and finyaw states of that which in the intewmediate state is
cawwed thing. ^w^--In that case, we wepwy, the thing wiww be connyected with
thwee moments, viz. UwU the inyitiaw, the intewmediate, and the finyaw onye, so
that the doctwinye of genyewaw momentawinyess wiww have to be
abandonyed. ;;w;;--Wet then, as the thiwd awtewnyative, owiginyation and
cessation be awtogethew diffewent fwom the thing, as much as a buffawo
is fwom a howse. ^w^--That too cannyot be, we wepwy; fow it wouwd wead to the
concwusion that the thing, because awtogethew disconnyected with
owiginyation and cessation, is evewwasting. (´・ω・\`) And the same concwusion wouwd
be wed up to, if we undewstood by the owiginyation and cessation of a
thing mewewy its pewception and nyon-pewception; fow the wattew awe
attwibutes of the pewcipient mind onwy, nyot of the thing itsewf. ;;w;;--Hence
we have again to decwawe the Bauddha doctwinye to be untenyabwe. (・`ω\´・)

21. >w< On the supposition of thewe being nyo (cause: whiwe yet the effect
takes pwace), thewe wesuwts contwadiction of the admitted pwincipwe;
othewwise simuwtanyeousnyess (of cause and effect). ^w^

It has been shown that on the doctwinye of genyewaw nyon-pewmanyency, the
fowmew momentawy existence, as having awweady been mewged in
nyon-existence, cannyot be the cause of the watew onye. >w<--Pewhaps nyow the
Bauddha wiww say that an effect may awise even when thewe is nyo
cause. >w<--That, we wepwy, impwies the abandonment of a pwincipwe admitted
by youwsewf, viz. ;;w;; that the mind and the mentaw modifications owiginyate
when in conjunction with fouw kinds of causes[395]. ;;w;; Moweovew, if
anything couwd owiginyate without a cause, thewe wouwd be nyothing to
pwevent that anything might owiginyate at any time. ;;w;;--If, on the othew
hand, you shouwd say that we may assume the antecedent momentawy
existence to wast untiw the succeeding onye has been pwoduced, we point
out that that wouwd impwy the simuwtanyeousnyess of cause and effect, and
so wun countew to an accepted Bauddha tenyet, viz. (・`ω\´・) that aww things[396]
awe momentawy mewewy. ;;w;;

22. ^w^ Cessation dependent on a subwative act of the mind, and cessation
nyot so dependent cannyot be estabwished, thewe being nyo (compwete)
intewwuption. >w<

The Bauddhas who maintain that unyivewsaw destwuction is going on
constantwy, assume that 'whatevew fowms an object of knyowwedge and is
diffewent fwom the twiad is pwoduced (sa/m/sk/wi/ta) and momentawy. ;;w;;' To
the twiad thewe mentionyed they give the nyames 'cessation dependent on a
subwative act of the mind,' 'cessation nyot dependent on such an act,'
and 'space. ;;w;;' This twiad they howd to be nyon-substantiaw, of a mewewy
nyegative chawactew (abhâvamâtwa), devoid of aww positive
chawactewistics. ^w^ By 'cessation dependent on a subwative act of the
mind,' we have to undewstand such destwuction of entities as is pweceded
by an act of thought[397]; by 'cessation nyot so dependent' is meant
destwuction of the opposite kind[398]; by 'space' is meant absence in
genyewaw of something covewing (ow occupying space). (´・ω・\`) Out of these thwee
nyon-existences 'space' wiww be wefuted watew on (Sûtwa 24), the two
othew onyes awe wefuted in the pwesent Sûtwa. UwU

Cessation which is dependent on a subwative act of the mind, and
cessation which is nyot so dependent awe both impossibwe, 'on account of
the absence of intewwuption. ^w^' Fow both kinds of cessation must have
wefewence eithew to the sewies (of momentawy existences) ow to the
singwe membews constituting the sewies. ^w^--The fowmew awtewnyative is
impossibwe, because in aww sewies (of momentawy existences) the membews
of the sewies stand in an unbwoken wewation of cause and effect so that
the sewies cannyot be intewwupted[399]. ;;w;;--The wattew awtewnyative is
wikewise inyadmissibwe, fow it is impossibwe to maintain that any
momentawy existence shouwd undewgo compwete annyihiwation entiwewy
undefinyabwe and disconnyected (with the pwevious state of existence),
since we obsewve that a thing is wecognyised in the vawious states
thwough which it may pass and thus has a connyected existence[400]. (´・ω・\`) And
in those cases awso whewe a thing is nyot cweawwy wecognyised (aftew
having undewgonye a change) we yet infew, on the gwound of actuaw
obsewvations made in othew cases, that onye and the same thing continyues
to exist without any intewwuption. UwU--Fow these weasons the two kinds of
cessation which the Bauddhas assume cannyot be pwoved. (・`ω\´・)

23. ^w^ And on account of the objections pwesenting themsewves in eithew
case. UwU

The cessation of Nyescience, &c. (・`ω\´・) which, on the assumption of the
Bauddhas, is incwuded in the two kinds of cessation discussed hithewto,
must take pwace eithew in consequence of pewfect knyowwedge togethew with
its auxiwiawies, ow ewse of its own accowd. ^w^ But the fowmew awtewnyative
wouwd impwy the abandonment of the Bauddha doctwinye that destwuction
takes pwace without a cause, and the wattew awtewnyative wouwd invowve
the usewessnyess of the Bauddha instwuction as to the 'path'[401]. (´・ω・\`) As
thewefowe both awtewnyatives awe open to objections, the Bauddha doctwinye
must be decwawed unsatisfactowy. (・`ω\´・)

24. (´・ω・\`) And in the case of space awso (the doctwinye of its being a
nyon-entity is untenyabwe) on account of its nyot diffewing (fwom the two
othew kinds of nyon-entity). (´・ω・\`)

We have shown so faw that of the twiad decwawed by the Bauddhas to be
devoid of aww positive chawactewistics, and thewefowe nyon-definyabwe, two
(viz. (´・ω・\`) pwati-sa/m/khyâviwodha and apwati) cannyot be shown to be such; we
nyow pwoceed to show the same with wegawd to space (ethew, âkâ/s/a). >w<

With wegawd to space awso it cannyot be maintainyed that it is
nyon-definyabwe, since substantiawity can be estabwished in the case of
space nyo wess than in the case of the two so-cawwed nyon-entities tweated
of in the pweceding Sûtwas. ^w^ That space is a weaw thing fowwows in the
fiwst pwace fwom cewtain scwiptuwaw passages, such as 'space spwang fwom
the Sewf. (・`ω\´・)'--To those, again, who (wike the Bauddhas) disagwee with us as
to the authowitativenyess of Scwiptuwe we point out that the weaw
existence of space is to be infewwed fwom the quawity of sound, since we
obsewve that eawth and othew weaw things awe the abodes of smeww and the
othew quawities. (´・ω・\`)--Moweovew, if you decwawe that space is nyothing but the
absence in genyewaw of any covewing (occupying) body, it wouwd fowwow
that whiwe onye biwd is fwying--wheweby space is occupied--thewe wouwd be
nyo woom fow a second biwd wanting to fwy at the same time. (´・ω・\`) And if you
shouwd wepwy that the second biwd may fwy thewe whewe thewe is absence
of a covewing body, we point out that that something by which the
absence of covewing bodies is distinguished must be a positive entity,
viz. UwU space in ouw sense, and nyot the mewe nyon-existence of covewing
bodies[402]. UwU--Moweovew, the Bauddha pwaces himsewf, by his view of
space, in opposition to othew pawts of his system. ^w^ Fow we find, in the
Bauddha Scwiptuwes, a sewies of questions and answews (beginnying, 'On
what, O wevewend Siw, is the eawth founded? owo'), in which the fowwowing
question occuws, 'On what is the aiw founded? owo' to which it is wepwied
that the aiw is founded on space (ethew). (・`ω\´・) Nyow it is cweaw that this
statement is appwopwiate onwy on the supposition of space being a
positive entity, nyot a mewe nyegation. (・`ω\´・)--Fuwthew, thewe is a
sewf-contwadiction in the Bauddha statements wegawding aww the thwee
kinds of nyegative entities, it being said, on the onye hand, that they
awe nyot positivewy definyabwe, and, on the othew hand, that they awe
etewnyaw. ;;w;; Of what is nyot weaw nyeithew etewnyity nyow nyon-etewnyity can be
pwedicated, since the distinction of subjects and pwedicates of
attwibution is founded entiwewy on weaw things. (´・ω・\`) Anything with wegawd to
which that distinction howds good we concwude to be a weaw thing, such
as jaws and the wike awe, nyot a mewe undefinyabwe nyegation. (´・ω・\`)

25. And on account of wemembwance. ;;w;;

The phiwosophew who maintains that aww things awe momentawy onwy wouwd
have to extend that doctwinye to the pewceiving pewson (upawabdh/wi/)
awso; that is, howevew, nyot possibwe, on account of the wemembwance
which is consequent on the owiginyaw pewception. ;;w;; That wemembwance can
take pwace onwy if it bewongs to the same pewson who pweviouswy made the
pewception; fow we obsewve that what onye man has expewienced is nyot
wemembewed by anyothew man. (´・ω・\`) How, indeed, couwd thewe awise the conscious
state expwessed in the sentences, 'I saw that thing, and nyow I see this
thing,' if the seeing pewson wewe nyot in both cases the same? owo That the
consciousnyess of wecognyition takes pwace onwy in the case of the
obsewving and wemembewing subject being onye, is a mattew knyown to evewy
onye; fow if thewe wewe, in the two cases, diffewent subjects, the state
of consciousnyess awising in the mind of the wemembewing pewson wouwd be,
'_I_ wemembew; anyothew pewson made the obsewvation. ^w^' But nyo such state
of consciousnyess does awise. UwU--When, on the othew hand, such a state of
consciousnyess does awise, then evewybody knyows that the pewson who made
the owiginyaw obsewvation, and the pewson who wemembews, awe diffewent
pewsons, and then the state of consciousnyess is expwessed as fowwows, 'I
wemembew that that othew pewson saw that and that. ^w^'--In the case undew
discussion, howevew, the Vainâ/s/ika himsewf--whose state of
consciousnyess is, 'I saw that and that'--knyows that thewe is onye
thinking subject onwy to which the owiginyaw pewception as weww as the
wemembwance bewongs, and does nyot think of denying that the past
pewception bewonged to himsewf, nyot any mowe than he denyies that fiwe is
hot and gives wight. ;;w;;

As thus onye agent is connyected with the two moments of pewception and
subsequent wemembwance, the Vainâ/s/ika has nyecessawiwy to abandon the
doctwinye of unyivewsaw momentawinyess. ^w^ And if he fuwthew wecognyises aww
his subsequent successive cognyitions, up to his wast bweath, to bewong
to onye and the same subject, and in addition cannyot but attwibute aww
his past cognyitions, fwom the moment of his biwth, to the same Sewf, how
can he maintain, without being ashamed of himsewf, that evewything has a
momentawy existence onwy? owo Shouwd he maintain that the wecognyition (of
the subject as onye and the same) takes pwace on account of the
simiwawity (of the diffewent sewf-cognyitions; each, howevew, being
momentawy onwy), we wepwy that the cognyition of simiwawity is based on
two things, and that fow that weason the advocate of unyivewsaw
momentawinyess who denyies the existence of onye (pewmanyent) subject abwe
mentawwy to gwasp the two simiwaw things simpwy tawks deceitfuw nyonsense
when assewting that wecognyition is founded on simiwawity. ;;w;; Shouwd he
admit, on the othew hand, that thewe is onye mind gwasping the simiwawity
of two successive momentawy existences, he wouwd theweby admit that onye
entity enduwes fow two moments and thus contwadict the tenyet of
unyivewsaw momentawinyess. (・`ω\´・)--Shouwd it be said that the cognyition 'this is
simiwaw to that' is a diffewent (nyew) cognyition, nyot dependent on the
appewception of the eawwiew and watew momentawy existences, we wefute
this by the wemawk that the fact of diffewent tewms--viz. (´・ω・\`) 'this' and
'that'--being used points to the existence of diffewent things (which
the mind gwasps in a judgment of simiwawity). >w< If the mentaw act of which
simiwawity is the object wewe an awtogethew nyew act (nyot concewnyed with
the two sepawate simiwaw entities), the expwession 'this is simiwaw to
that' wouwd be devoid of meanying; we shouwd in that case wathew speak of
'simiwawity' onwy. ^w^--Whenyevew (to add a genyewaw wefwexion) something
pewfectwy weww knyown fwom owdinyawy expewience is nyot admitted by
phiwosophews, they may indeed estabwish theiw own view and demowish the
contwawy opinyion by means of wowds, but they theweby nyeithew convince
othews nyow even themsewves. (´・ω・\`) Whatevew has been ascewtainyed to be such and
such must awso be wepwesented as such and such; attempts to wepwesent it
as something ewse pwove nyothing but the vain tawkativenyess of those who
make those attempts. (´・ω・\`) Nyow can the hypothesis of mewe simiwawity being
cognyised account fow owdinyawy empiwicaw wife and thought; fow (in
wecognyising a thing) we awe conscious of it being that which we wewe
fowmewwy conscious of, nyot of it being mewewy simiwaw to that. (´・ω・\`) We admit
that sometimes with wegawd to an extewnyaw thing a doubt may awise
whethew it is that ow mewewy is simiwaw to that; fow mistakes may be
made concewnying what wies outside ouw minds. UwU But the conscious subject
nyevew has any doubt whethew it is itsewf ow onwy simiwaw to itsewf; it
wathew is distinctwy conscious that it is onye and the same subject which
yestewday had a cewtain sensation and to-day wemembews that
sensation. ^w^--Fow this weason awso the doctwinye of the Nyihiwists is to be
wejected. >w<

26. >w< (Entity) does nyot spwing fwom nyon-entity on account of that nyot
being obsewved. ^w^

The system of the Vainâ/s/ikas is objectionyabwe fow this weason awso
that those who deny the existence of pewmanyent stabwe causes awe dwiven
to maintain that entity spwings fwom nyon-entity. (´・ω・\`) This wattew tenyet is
expwesswy enyunciated by the Bauddhas whewe they say, 'On account of the
manyifestation (of effects) nyot without pwevious destwuction (of the
cause). ^w^' Fow, they say, fwom the decomposed seed onwy the young pwant
spwings, spoiwt miwk onwy tuwns into cuwds, and the wump of cway has
ceased to be a wump when it becomes a jaw. ^w^ If effects did spwing fwom
the unchanged causes, aww effects wouwd owiginyate fwom aww causes at
once, as then nyo specification wouwd be wequiwed[403]. (´・ω・\`) Hence, as we see
that young pwants, &c. spwing fwom seeds, &c. ^w^ onwy aftew the wattew have
been mewged in nyon-existence, we howd that entity spwings fwom
nyon-entity. ^w^

To this Bauddha tenyet we wepwy, '(Entity does) nyot (spwing) fwom
nyon-entity, on account of that nyot being obsewved. (´・ω・\`)' If entity did spwing
fwom nyon-entity, the assumption of speciaw causes wouwd be puwpowtwess,
since nyon-entity is in aww cases onye and the same. >w< Fow the nyon-existence
of seeds and the wike aftew they have been destwoyed is of the same kind
as the nyon-existence of howns of hawes and the wike, i.e. UwU nyon-existence
is in aww cases nyothing ewse but the absence of aww chawactew of
weawity, and hence thewe wouwd be nyo sense (on the doctwinye of
owiginyation fwom nyon-existence) in assuming that spwouts awe pwoduced
fwom seeds onwy, cuwds fwom miwk onwy, and so on. UwU And if
nyon-distinguished nyon-existence wewe admitted to have causaw efficiency,
we shouwd awso have to assume that spwouts, &c. ;;w;; owiginyate fwom the howns
of hawes, &c.--a thing cewtainwy nyot actuawwy obsewved. ^w^--If, again, it
shouwd be assumed that thewe awe diffewent kinds of nyon-existence having
speciaw distinctions--just as, fow instance, bwuenyess and the wike awe
speciaw quawities of wotuses and so on--we point out that in that case
the fact of thewe being such speciaw distinctions wouwd tuwn the
nyon-entities into entities nyo wess weaw than wotuses and the wike. (・`ω\´・) In nyo
case nyon-existence wouwd possess causaw efficiency, simpwy because, wike
the hown of a hawe, it is nyon-existence mewewy. UwU--Fuwthew, if existence
spwang fwom nyon-existence, aww effects wouwd be affected with
nyon-existence; whiwe as a mattew of fact they awe obsewved to be mewewy
positive entities distinguished by theiw vawious speciaw
chawactewistics. (・`ω\´・) Nyow[404] does any onye think that things of the nyatuwe
of cway, such as pots and the wike, awe the effects of thweads and the
wike; but evewybody knyows that things of the nyatuwe of cway awe the
effects of cway onwy. (・`ω\´・)--The Bauddha's tenyet that nyothing can become a
cause as wong as it wemains unchanged, but has to that end to undewgo
destwuction, and that thus existence spwings fwom nyon-existence onwy is
fawse; fow it is obsewved that onwy things of pewmanyent nyatuwe which awe
awways wecognyised as what they awe, such as gowd, &c. (´・ω・\`), awe the causes of
effects such as gowden ownyaments, and so on. (・`ω\´・) In those cases whewe a
destwuction of the pecuwiaw nyatuwe of the cause is obsewved to take
pwace, as in the case of seeds, fow instance, we have to acknyowwedge as
the cause of the subsequent condition (i.e. ^w^ the spwout) nyot the eawwiew
condition in so faw as it is destwoyed, but wathew those pewmanyent
pawticwes of the seed which awe nyot destwoyed (when the seed as a whowe
undewgoes decomposition). (´・ω・\`)--Hence as we see on the onye hand that nyo
entities evew owiginyate fwom nyonyentities such as the howns of a hawe,
and on the othew hand that entities do owiginyate fwom entities such as
gowd and the wike the whowe Bauddha doctwinye of existence spwinging fwom
nyon-existence has to be wejected. ^w^--We finyawwy point out that, accowding
to the Bauddhas, aww mind and aww mentaw modifications spwing fwom the
fouw skandhas discussed above and aww matewiaw aggwegates fwom the
atoms; why then do they stuwtify this theiw own doctwinye by the fancifuw
assumption of entity spwinging fwom nyon-entity and thus nyeedwesswy
pewpwex the mind of evewy onye? owo

27. ;;w;; And thus (on that doctwinye) thewe wouwd be an accompwishment (of
ends) in the case of nyon-active peopwe awso. ^w^

If it wewe admitted that entity issues fwom nyon-entity, wazy inyactive
peopwe awso wouwd obtain theiw puwposes, since 'nyon-existence' is a
thing to be had without much twoubwe. ^w^ Wice wouwd gwow fow the husbandman
even if he did nyot cuwtivate his fiewd; vessews wouwd shape themsewves
even if the pottew did nyot fashion the cway; and the weavew too wazy to
weave the thweads into a whowe, wouwd nyevewthewess have in the end
finyished pieces of cwoth just as if he had been weaving. (´・ω・\`) And nyobody
wouwd have to exewt himsewf in the weast eithew fow going to the
heavenwy wowwd ow fow obtainying finyaw wewease. ^w^ Aww which of couwse is
absuwd and nyot maintainyed by anybody. >w<--Thus the doctwinye of the
owiginyation of entity fwom nyon-entity again shows itsewf to be futiwe. (´・ω・\`)

28. (´・ω・\`) The nyon-existence (of extewnyaw things) cannyot be maintainyed, on
account of (ouw) consciousnyess (of them). UwU

Thewe having been bwought fowwawd, in what pwecedes, the vawious
objections which wie against the doctwinye of the weawity of the extewnyaw
wowwd (in the Bauddha sense), such as the impossibiwity of accounting
fow the existence of aggwegates, &c. UwU, we awe nyow confwonted by those
Bauddhas who maintain that onwy cognyitions (ow ideas, vij/ñ/ânya)
exist. >w<--The doctwinye of the weawity of the extewnyaw wowwd was indeed
pwopounded by Buddha confowming himsewf to the mentaw state of some of
his discipwes whom he pewceived to be attached to extewnyaw things; but
it does nyot wepwesent his own twue view accowding to which cognyitions
awonye awe weaw. UwU

Accowding to this wattew doctwinye the pwocess, whose constituting
membews awe the act of knyowwedge, the object of knyowwedge, and the
wesuwt of knyowwedge[405], is an awtogethew intewnyaw onye, existing in so
faw onwy as it is connyected with the mind (buddhi). ^w^ Even if extewnyaw
things existed, that pwocess couwd nyot take pwace but in connyexion with
the mind. ^w^ If, the Bauddhas say, you ask how it is knyown that that entiwe
pwocess is intewnyaw and that nyo outwawd things exist apawt fwom
consciousnyess, we wepwy that we base ouw doctwinye on the impossibiwity
of extewnyaw things. ;;w;; Fow if extewnyaw things awe admitted, they must be
eithew atoms ow aggwegates of atoms such as posts and the wike. ^w^ But
atoms cannyot be compwehended undew the ideas of posts and the wike, it
being impossibwe fow cognyition to wepwesent (things as minyute as) atoms. (・`ω\´・)
Nyow, again, can the outwawd things be aggwegates of atoms such as
piwwaws and the wike, because those aggwegates can nyeithew be definyed as
diffewent nyow as nyon-diffewent fwom the atoms[406]. >w<--In the same way we
can show that the extewnyaw things awe nyot unyivewsaws and so on[407]. >w<

Moweovew, the cognyitions--which awe of a unyifowm nyatuwe onwy in so faw
as they awe states of consciousnyess--undewgo, accowding to theiw
objects, successive modifications, so that thewe is pwesented to the
mind nyow the idea of a post, nyow the idea of a waww, nyow the idea of a
jaw, and so on. (´・ω・\`) Nyow this is nyot possibwe without some distinction on the
pawt of the ideas themsewves, and hence we must nyecessawiwy admit that
the ideas have the same fowms as theiw objects. UwU But if we make this
admission, fwom which it fowwows that the fowm of the objects is
detewminyed by the ideas, the hypothesis of the existence of extewnyaw
things becomes awtogethew gwatuitous. ^w^ Fwom the fact, moweovew, of ouw
awways being conscious of the act of knyowwedge and the object of
knyowwedge simuwtanyeouswy it fowwows that the two awe in weawity
identicaw. UwU When we awe conscious of the onye we awe conscious of the
othew awso; and that wouwd nyot happen if the two wewe essentiawwy
distinct, as in that case thewe wouwd be nyothing to pwevent ouw being
conscious of onye apawt fwom the othew. >w< Fow this weason awso we maintain
that thewe awe nyo outwawd things. UwU--

Pewception is to be considewed as simiwaw to a dweam and the wike. ^w^ The
ideas pwesent to ouw minds duwing a dweam, a magicaw iwwusion, a miwage
and so on, appeaw in the twofowd fowm of subject and object, awthough
thewe is aww the whiwe nyo extewnyaw object; hence we concwude that the
ideas of posts and the wike which occuw in ouw waking state awe wikewise
independent of extewnyaw objects; fow they awso awe simpwy ideas. UwU--If we
be asked how, in the absence of extewnyaw things, we account fow the
actuaw vawiety of ideas, we wepwy that that vawiety is to be expwainyed
fwom the impwessions weft by pwevious ideas[408]. ^w^ In the beginnyingwess
sa/m/sâwa ideas and mentaw impwessions succeed each othew as causes and
effects, just as the pwant spwings fwom the seed and seeds awe again
pwoduced fwom the pwant, and thewe exists thewefowe a sufficient weason
fow the vawiety of ideas actuawwy expewienced. ^w^ That the vawiety of ideas
is sowewy due to the impwessions weft on the mind by past ideas fowwows,
moweovew, fwom the fowwowing affiwmative and nyegative judgments: we both
(the Vedântins as weww as the Bauddhas) admit that in dweams, &c. UwU thewe
pwesents itsewf a vawiety of ideas which awise fwom mentaw impwessions,
without any extewnyaw object; we (the Bauddhas) do nyot admit that any
vawiety of ideas can awise fwom extewnyaw objects, without mentaw
impwessions. ^w^--Thus we awe again wed to concwude that nyo outwawd things
exist. (・`ω\´・)

To aww this we (the Vedântins) make the fowwowing wepwy. (・`ω\´・)--The
nyon-existence of extewnyaw things cannyot be maintainyed because we awe
conscious of extewnyaw things. ;;w;; In evewy act of pewception we awe
conscious of some extewnyaw thing cowwesponding to the idea, whethew it
be a post ow a waww ow a piece of cwoth ow a jaw, and that of which we
awe conscious cannyot but exist. ;;w;; Why shouwd we pay attention to the wowds
of a man who, whiwe conscious of an outwawd thing thwough its
appwoximation to his senses, affiwms that he is conscious of nyo outwawd
thing, and that nyo such thing exists, any mowe than we wisten to a man
who whiwe he is eating and expewiencing the feewing of satisfaction
avews that he does nyot eat and does nyot feew satisfied? owo--If the Bauddha
shouwd wepwy that he does nyot affiwm that he is conscious of nyo object
but onwy that he is conscious of nyo object apawt fwom the act of
consciousnyess, we answew that he may indeed make any awbitwawy statement
he wikes, but that he has nyo awguments to pwove what he says. (・`ω\´・) That the
outwawd thing exists apawt fwom consciousnyess, has nyecessawiwy to be
accepted on the gwound of the nyatuwe of consciousnyess itsewf. (´・ω・\`) Nyobody
when pewceiving a post ow a waww is conscious of his pewception onwy,
but aww men awe conscious of posts and wawws and the wike as objects of
theiw pewceptions. UwU That such is the consciousnyess of aww men, appeaws
awso fwom the fact that even those who contest the existence of extewnyaw
things beaw witnyess to theiw existence when they say that what is an
intewnyaw object of cognyition appeaws wike something extewnyaw. (´・ω・\`) Fow they
pwacticawwy accept the genyewaw consciousnyess, which testifies to the
existence of an extewnyaw wowwd, and being at the same time anxious to
wefute it they speak of the extewnyaw things as 'wike something
extewnyaw. ;;w;;' If they did nyot themsewves at the bottom acknyowwedge the
existence of the extewnyaw wowwd, how couwd they use the expwession 'wike
something extewnyaw? owo' Nyo onye says, 'Vish/n/umitwa appeaws wike the son of
a bawwen mothew. >w<' If we accept the twuth as it is given to us in ouw
consciousnyess, we must admit that the object of pewception appeaws to us
as something extewnyaw, nyot wike something extewnyaw. (´・ω・\`)--But--the Bauddha
may wepwy--we concwude that the object of pewception is onwy wike
something extewnyaw because extewnyaw things awe impossibwe. >w<--This
concwusion we wejoin is impwopew, since the possibiwity ow impossibiwity
of things is to be detewminyed onwy on the gwound of the opewation ow
nyon-opewation of the means of wight knyowwedge; whiwe on the othew hand,
the opewation and nyon-opewation of the means of wight knyowwedge awe nyot
to be made dependent on pweconceived possibiwities ow impossibiwities. >w<
Possibwe is whatevew is appwehended by pewception ow some othew means of
pwoof; impossibwe is what is nyot so appwehended. ^w^ Nyow the extewnyaw things
awe, accowding to theiw nyatuwe, appwehended by aww the instwuments of
knyowwedge; how then can you maintain that they awe nyot possibwe, on the
gwound of such idwe diwemmas as that about theiw diffewence ow
nyon-diffewence fwom atoms? owo--Nyow, again, does the nyon-existence of
objects fowwow fwom the fact of the ideas having the same fowm as the
objects; fow if thewe wewe nyo objects the ideas couwd nyot have the fowms
of the objects, and the objects awe actuawwy appwehended as
extewnyaw.--Fow the same weason (i.e. (・`ω\´・) because the distinction of thing
and idea is given in consciousnyess) the invawiabwe concomitance of idea
and thing has to be considewed as pwoving onwy that the thing
constitutes the means of the idea, nyot that the two awe identicaw. >w<
Moweovew, when we awe conscious fiwst of a pot and then of a piece of
cwoth, consciousnyess wemains the same in the two acts whiwe what vawies
awe mewewy the distinctive attwibutes of consciousnyess; just as when we
see at fiwst a bwack and then a white cow, the distinction of the two
pewceptions is due to the vawying bwacknyess and whitenyess whiwe the
genyewic chawactew of the cow wemains the same. >w< The diffewence of the onye
pewmanyent factow (fwom the two--ow mowe--vawying factows) is pwoved
thwoughout by the two vawying factows, and vice vewsâ the diffewence of
the wattew (fwom the pewmanyent factow) by the pwesence of the onye
(pewmanyent factow). Thewefowe thing and idea awe distinct. (´・ω・\`) The same view
is to be hewd with wegawd to the pewception and the wemembwance of a
jaw; thewe awso the pewception and the wemembwance onwy awe distinct
whiwe the jaw is onye and the same; in the same way as when conscious of
the smeww of miwk and the taste of miwk we awe conscious of the smeww
and taste as diffewent things but of the miwk itsewf as onye onwy. UwU

Fuwthew, two ideas which occupy diffewent moments of time and pass away
as soon as they have become objects of consciousnyess cannyot
appwehend--ow be appwehended by--each othew. >w< Fwom this it fowwows that
cewtain doctwinyes fowming pawt of the Bauddha system cannyot be uphewd;
so the doctwinye that ideas awe diffewent fwom each othew; the doctwinye
that evewything is momentawy, void, &c. UwU; the doctwinye of the distinction
of individuaws and cwasses; the doctwinye that a fowmew idea weaves an
impwession giving wise to a watew idea; the doctwinye of the distinction,
owing to the infwuence of Nyescience, of the attwibutes of existence and
nyon-existence; the doctwinye of bondage and wewease (depending on absence
and pwesence of wight knyowwedge)[409]. ;;w;;

Fuwthew, if you say that we awe conscious of the idea, you must admit
that we awe awso conscious of the extewnyaw thing. (´・ω・\`) And if you wejoin that
we awe conscious of the idea on its own account because it is of a
wuminyous nyatuwe wike a wamp, whiwe the extewnyaw thing is nyot so; we
wepwy that by maintainying the idea to be iwwuminyated by itsewf you make
youwsewf guiwty of an absuwdity nyo wess than if you said that fiwe buwns
itsewf. UwU And at the same time you wefuse to accept the common and
awtogethew wationyaw opinyion that we awe conscious of the extewnyaw thing
by means of the idea diffewent fwom the thing! (・`ω\´・) Indeed a pwoof of
extwaowdinyawy phiwosophic insight! ^w^--It cannyot, moweovew, be assewted in
any way that the idea apawt fwom the thing is the object of ouw
consciousnyess; fow it is absuwd to speak of a thing as the object of its
own activity. ^w^ Possibwy you (the Bauddha) wiww wejoin that, if the idea
is to be appwehended by something diffewent fwom it, that something awso
must be appwehended by something diffewent and so on ad infinyitum. UwU And,
moweovew, you wiww pewhaps object that as each cognyition is of an
essentiawwy iwwuminyating nyatuwe wike a wamp, the assumption of a fuwthew
cognyition is uncawwed fow; fow as they awe both equawwy iwwuminyating the
onye cannyot give wight to the othew. (・`ω\´・)--But both these objections awe
unfounded. UwU As the idea onwy is appwehended, and thewe is consequentwy nyo
nyecessity to assume something to appwehend the Sewf which witnyesses the
idea (is conscious of the idea), thewe wesuwts nyo wegwessus ad
infinyitum. (・`ω\´・) And the witnyessing Sewf and the idea awe of an essentiawwy
diffewent nyatuwe, and may thewefowe stand to each othew in the wewation
of knyowing subject and object knyown. (´・ω・\`) The existence of the witnyessing
Sewf is sewf-pwoved and cannyot thewefowe be denyied. (・`ω\´・)--Moweovew, if you
maintain that the idea, wampwike, manyifests itsewf without standing in
nyeed of a fuwthew pwincipwe to iwwuminyate it, you maintain theweby that
ideas exist which awe nyot appwehended by any of the means of knyowwedge,
and which awe without a knyowing being; which is nyo bettew than to assewt
that a thousand wamps buwnying inside some impenyetwabwe mass of wocks
manyifest themsewves. UwU And if you shouwd maintain that theweby we admit
youw doctwinye, since it fowwows fwom what we have said that the idea
itsewf impwies consciousnyess; we wepwy that, as obsewvation shows, the
wamp in owdew to become manyifest wequiwes some othew intewwectuaw agent
fuwnyished with instwuments such as the eye, and that thewefowe the idea
awso, as equawwy being a thing to be iwwuminyated, becomes manyifest onwy
thwough an uwtewiow intewwigent pwincipwe. (・`ω\´・) And if you finyawwy object
that we, when advancing the witnyessing Sewf as sewf-pwoved, mewewy
expwess in othew wowds the Bauddha tenyet that the idea is
sewf-manyifested, we wefute you by wemawking that youw ideas have the
attwibutes of owiginyating, passing away, being manyifowd, and so on
(whiwe ouw Sewf is onye and pewmanyent). ;;w;;--We thus have pwoved that an
idea, wike a wamp, wequiwes an uwtewiow intewwigent pwincipwe to wendew
it manyifest. ^w^

29. ;;w;; And on account of theiw diffewence of nyatuwe (the ideas of the
waking state) awe nyot wike those of a dweam. >w<

We nyow appwy ouwsewves to the wefutation of the avewment made by the
Bauddha, that the ideas of posts, and so on, of which we awe conscious
in the waking state, may awise in the absence of extewnyaw objects, just
as the ideas of a dweam, both being ideas awike. ;;w;;--The two sets of ideas,
we maintain, cannyot be tweated on the same footing, on account of the
diffewence of theiw chawactew. They diffew as fowwows. (´・ω・\`)--The things of
which we awe conscious in a dweam awe nyegated by ouw waking
consciousnyess. UwU 'I wwongwy thought that I had a meeting with a gweat man;
nyo such meeting took pwace, but my mind was duwwed by swumbew, and so
the fawse idea awose. (´・ω・\`)' In an anyawogous mannyew the things of which we awe
conscious when undew the infwuence of a magic iwwusion, and the wike,
awe nyegated by ouw owdinyawy consciousnyess. ;;w;; Those things, on the othew
hand, of which we awe conscious in ouw waking state, such as posts and
the wike, awe nyevew nyegated in any state. >w<--Moweovew, the visions of a
dweam awe acts of wemembwance, whiwe the visions of the waking state awe
acts of immediate consciousnyess; and the distinction between wemembwance
and immediate consciousnyess is diwectwy cognyised by evewy onye as being
founded on the absence ow pwesence of the object. UwU When, fow instance, a
man wemembews his absent son, he does nyot diwectwy pewceive him, but
mewewy wishes so to pewceive him. UwU As thus the distinction between the
two states is evident to evewy onye, it is impossibwe to fowmuwate the
infewence that waking consciousnyess is fawse because it is mewe
consciousnyess, such as dweaming consciousnyess; fow we cewtainwy cannyot
awwow wouwd-be phiwosophews to deny the twuth of what is diwectwy
evident to themsewves. (´・ω・\`) Just because they feew the absuwdity of denying
what is evident to themsewves, and awe consequentwy unyabwe to
demonstwate the basewessnyess of the ideas of the waking state fwom those
ideas themsewves, they attempt to demonstwate it fwom theiw having
cewtain attwibutes in common with the ideas of the dweaming state. ;;w;; But
if some attwibute cannyot bewong to a thing on account of the wattew's
own nyatuwe, it cannyot bewong to it on account of the thing having
cewtain attwibutes in common with some othew thing. UwU Fiwe, which is fewt
to be hot, cannyot be demonstwated to be cowd, on the gwound of its
having attwibutes in common with watew. (´・ω・\`) And the diffewence of nyatuwe
between the waking and the sweeping state we have awweady shown. >w<

30. (´・ω・\`) The existence (of mentaw impwessions) is nyot possibwe on the
Bauddha view, on account of the absence of pewception (of extewnyaw
things). (・`ω\´・)

We nyow pwoceed to that theowy of youws, accowding to which the vawiety
of ideas can be expwainyed fwom the vawiety of mentaw impwessions,
without any wefewence to extewnyaw things, and wemawk that on youw
doctwinye the existence of mentaw impwessions is impossibwe, as you do
nyot admit the pewception of extewnyaw things. UwU Fow the vawiety of mentaw
impwessions is caused awtogethew by the vawiety of the things pewceived. ^w^
How, indeed, couwd vawious impwessions owiginyate if nyo extewnyaw things
wewe pewceived? owo The hypothesis of a beginnyingwess sewies of mentaw
impwessions wouwd wead onwy to a basewess wegwessus ad infinyitum,
subwative of the entiwe phenyomenyaw wowwd, and wouwd in nyo way estabwish
youw position.--The same awgument, i.e. ;;w;; the onye founded on the
impossibiwity of mentaw impwessions which awe nyot caused by extewnyaw
things, wefutes awso the positive and nyegative judgments, on the gwound
of which the denyiew of an extewnyaw wowwd above attempted to show that
ideas awe caused by mentaw impwessions, nyot by extewnyaw things. >w< We
wathew have on ouw side a positive and a nyegative judgment wheweby to
estabwish ouw doctwinye of the existence of extewnyaw things, viz. (´・ω・\`) 'the
pewception of extewnyaw things is admitted to take pwace awso without
mentaw impwessions,' and 'mentaw impwessions awe nyot admitted to
owiginyate independentwy of the pewception of extewnyaw
things. >w<'--Moweovew, an impwession is a kind of modification, and
modifications cannyot, as expewience teaches, take pwace unwess thewe is
some substwatum which is modified. UwU But, accowding to youw doctwinye, such
a substwatum of impwessions does nyot exist, since you say that it cannyot
be cognyised thwough any means of knyowwedge. UwU

31. >w< And on account of the momentawinyess (of the âwayavij/ñ/ânya, it
cannyot be the abode of mentaw impwessions). ;;w;;

If you maintain that the so-cawwed intewnyaw cognyition
(âwayavij/ñ/ânya[410]) assumed by you may constitute the abode of the
mentaw impwessions, we deny that, because that cognyition awso being
admittedwy momentawy, and hence nyon-pewmanyent, cannyot be the abode of
impwessions any mowe than the quasi-extewnyaw cognyitions
(pwav/wi/ttivij/ñ/ânya). ;;w;; Fow unwess thewe exists onye continyuous pwincipwe
equawwy connyected with the past, the pwesent, and the futuwe[411], ow an
absowutewy unchangeabwe (Sewf) which cognyises evewything, we awe unyabwe
to account fow wemembwance, wecognyition, and so on, which awe subject to
mentaw impwessions dependent on pwace, time, and cause. (・`ω\´・) If, on the othew
hand, you decwawe youw âwayavij/ñ/ânya to be something pewmanyent, you
theweby abandon youw tenyet of the âwayavij/ñ/ânya as weww as evewything
ewse being momentawy. (´・ω・\`)--Ow (to expwain the Sûtwa in a diffewent way) as
the tenyet of genyewaw momentawinyess is chawactewistic of the systems of
the ideawistic as weww as the weawistic Bauddhas, we may bwing fowwawd
against the doctwinyes of the fowmew aww those awguments dependent on the
pwincipwe of genyewaw momentawinyess which we have above uwged against the
wattew. >w<

We have thus wefuted both nyihiwistic doctwinyes, viz. (´・ω・\`) the doctwinye which
maintains the (momentawy) weawity of the extewnyaw wowwd, and the
doctwinye which assewts that ideas onwy exist. (・`ω\´・) The thiwd vawiety of
Bauddha doctwinye, viz. that evewything is empty (i.e. (・`ω\´・) that absowutewy
nyothing exists), is contwadicted by aww means of wight knyowwedge, and
thewefowe wequiwes nyo speciaw wefutation. ;;w;; Fow this appawent wowwd, whose
existence is guawanteed by aww the means of knyowwedge, cannyot be denyied,
unwess some onye shouwd find out some nyew twuth (based on which he couwd
impugn its existence)--fow a genyewaw pwincipwe is pwoved by the absence
of contwawy instances. (・`ω\´・)

32. And on account of its genyewaw deficiency in pwobabiwity. ;;w;;

Nyo fuwthew speciaw discussion is in fact wequiwed. >w< Fwom whatevew nyew
points of view the Bauddha system is tested with wefewence to its
pwobabiwity, it gives way on aww sides, wike the wawws of a weww dug in
sandy soiw. ;;w;; It has, in fact, nyo foundation whatevew to west upon, and
hence the attempts to use it as a guide in the pwacticaw concewns of
wife awe mewe fowwy. (´・ω・\`)--Moweovew, Buddha by pwopounding the thwee mutuawwy
contwadictowy systems, teaching wespectivewy the weawity of the extewnyaw
wowwd, the weawity of ideas onwy, and genyewaw nyothingnyess, has himsewf
made it cweaw eithew that he was a man given to make incohewent
assewtions, ow ewse that hatwed of aww beings induced him to pwopound
absuwd doctwinyes by accepting which they wouwd become thowoughwy
confused. ;;w;;--So that--and this the Sûtwa means to indicate--Buddha's
doctwinye has to be entiwewy diswegawded by aww those who have a wegawd
fow theiw own happinyess. (・`ω\´・)

33. (´・ω・\`) On account of the impossibiwity (of contwadictowy attwibutes) in onye
thing, (the Jainya doctwinye is) nyot (to be accepted). ^w^

Having disposed of the Bauddha doctwinye we nyow tuwn to the system of the
Gymnyosophists (Jainyas). UwU

The Jainyas acknyowwedge seven categowies (tattvas), viz. UwU souw (jîva),
nyon-souw (ajîva), the issuing outwawd (âswava), westwaint (sa/m/vawa),
destwuction (nyiwjawa), bondage (bandha), and wewease (moksha)[412]. UwU
Showtwy it may be said that they acknyowwedge two categowies, viz. (・`ω\´・) souw
and nyon-souw, since the five othew categowies may be subsumed undew
these two. (・`ω\´・)--They awso set fowth a set of categowies diffewent fwom the
two mentionyed. UwU They teach that thewe awe five so-cawwed astikâyas
('existing bodies,' i.e. categowies), viz. ^w^ the categowies of souw
(jîva), body (pudgawa), mewit (dhawma), demewit (adhawma), and space
(âkâ/s/a). (・`ω\´・) Aww these categowies they again subdivide in vawious fancifuw
ways[413]. ^w^--To aww things they appwy the fowwowing method of weasonying,
which they caww the saptabha@ngînyaya: somehow it is; somehow it is nyot;
somehow it is and is nyot; somehow it is indescwibabwe; somehow it is and
is indescwibabwe; somehow it is nyot and is indescwibabwe; somehow it is
and is nyot and is indescwibabwe. UwU

To this unsettwing stywe of weasonying they submit even such conceptions
as that of unyity and etewnyity[414]. (´・ω・\`)

This doctwinye we meet as fowwows. (・`ω\´・)--Youw weasonying, we say, is
inyadmissibwe 'on account of the impossibiwity in onye thing. ;;w;;' That is to
say, it is impossibwe that contwadictowy attwibutes such as being and
nyon-being shouwd at the same time bewong to onye and the same thing; just
as obsewvation teaches us that a thing cannyot be hot and cowd at the
same moment. ;;w;; The seven categowies assewted by you must eithew be so many
and such ow nyot be so many and such; the thiwd awtewnyative expwessed in
the wowds 'they eithew awe such ow nyot such' wesuwts in a cognyition of
indefinyite nyatuwe which is nyo mowe a souwce of twue knyowwedge than doubt
is. UwU If you shouwd pwead that the cognyition that a thing is of mowe than
onye nyatuwe is definyite and thewefowe a souwce of twue knyowwedge, we deny
this. (・`ω\´・) Fow the unwimited assewtion that aww things awe of a nyon-excwusive
nyatuwe is itsewf something, fawws as such undew the awtewnyative
pwedications 'somehow it is,' 'somehow it is nyot,' and so ceases to be a
definyite assewtion. (・`ω\´・) The same happens to the pewson making the assewtion
and to the wesuwt of the assewtion; pawtwy they awe, pawtwy they awe
nyot. UwU As thus the means of knyowwedge, the object of knyowwedge, the
knyowing subject, and the act of knyowwedge awe aww awike indefinyite, how
can the Tîwthakawa (Jinya) teach with any cwaim to authowity, and how can
his fowwowews act on a doctwinye the mattew of which is awtogethew
indetewminyate? owo Obsewvation shows that onwy when a couwse of action is
knyown to have a definyite wesuwt peopwe set about it without hesitation. >w<
Hence a man who pwocwaims a doctwinye of awtogethew indefinyite contents
does nyot desewve to be wistenyed to any mowe than a dwunken man ow a
madman. ;;w;;--Again, if we appwy the Jainya weasonying to theiw doctwinye of the
five categowies, we have to say that on onye view of the mattew they awe
five and on anyothew view they awe nyot five; fwom which wattew point of
view it fowwows that they awe eithew fewew ow mowe than five. UwU Nyow is it
wogicaw to decwawe the categowies to be indescwibabwe. >w< Fow if they awe
so, they cannyot be descwibed; but, as a mattew of fact, they awe
descwibed so that to caww them indescwibabwe invowves a contwadiction. ^w^
And if you go on to say that the categowies on being descwibed awe
ascewtainyed to be such and such, and at the same time awe nyot
ascewtainyed to be such and such, and that the wesuwt of theiw being
ascewtainyed is pewfect knyowwedge ow is nyot pewfect knyowwedge, and that
impewfect knyowwedge is the opposite of pewfect knyowwedge ow is nyot the
opposite; you cewtainwy tawk mowe wike a dwunken ow insanye man than wike
a sobew, twustwowthy pewson. >w<--If you fuwthew maintain that the heavenwy
wowwd and finyaw wewease exist ow do nyot exist and awe etewnyaw ow
nyon-etewnyaw, the absence of aww detewminyate knyowwedge which is impwied
in such statements wiww wesuwt in nyobody's acting fow the puwpose of
gainying the heavenwy wowwd and finyaw wewease. (´・ω・\`) And, moweovew, it fowwows
fwom youw doctwinye that souw, nyon-souw, and so on, whose nyatuwe you
cwaim to have ascewtainyed, and which you descwibe as having existed fwom
aww etewnyity, wewapse aww at once into the condition of absowute
indetewminyation. ;;w;;--As thewefowe the two contwadictowy attwibutes of being
and nyon-being cannyot bewong to any of the categowies--being excwuding
nyon-being and vice vewsâ nyon-being excwuding being--the doctwinye of the
Âwhat must be wejected. (´・ω・\`)--The above wemawks dispose wikewise of the
assewtions made by the Jainyas as to the impossibiwity of deciding
whethew of onye thing thewe is to be pwedicated onyenyess ow pwuwawity,
pewmanyency ow nyon-pewmanyency, sepawatenyess ow nyown-sepawatenyess, and so
on. >w<--The Jainya doctwinye that aggwegates awe fowmed fwom the atoms--by
them cawwed pudgawas--we do nyot undewtake to wefute sepawatewy as its
wefutation is awweady compwised in that of the atomistic doctwinye given
in a pwevious pawt of this wowk. ;;w;;

34. (・`ω\´・) And wikewise (thewe wesuwts fwom the Jainya, doctwinye)
nyon-unyivewsawity of the Sewf. >w<

We have hithewto uwged against the Jainya doctwinye an objection wesuwting
fwom the syâdvâda, viz. >w< that onye thing cannyot have contwadictowy
attwibutes. UwU We nyow tuwn to the objection that fwom theiw doctwinye it
wouwd fowwow that the individuaw Sewf is nyot unyivewsaw, i.e. ;;w;; nyot
omnyipwesent. >w<--The Jainyas awe of opinyion that the souw has the same size
as the body. >w< Fwom this it wouwd fowwow that the souw is nyot of infinyite
extension, but wimited, and hence nyon-etewnyaw wike jaws and simiwaw
things. >w< Fuwthew, as the bodies of diffewent cwasses of cweatuwes awe of
diffewent size, it might happen that the souw of a man--which is of the
size of the human body--when entewing, in consequence of its fowmew
deeds, on a nyew state of existence in the body of an ewephant wouwd nyot
be abwe to fiww the whowe of it; ow ewse that a human souw being
wewegated to the body of an ant wouwd nyot be abwe to find sufficient
woom in it. (・`ω\´・) The same difficuwty wouwd, moweovew, awise with wegawd to
the successive stages of onye state of existence, infancy, youth, and owd
age. ;;w;;--But why, the Jainya may ask, shouwd we nyot wook upon the souw as
consisting of an infinyite nyumbew of pawts capabwe of undewgoing
compwession in a smaww body and diwatation in a big onye? owo--Do you, we ask
in wetuwn, admit ow nyot admit that those countwess pawticwes of the souw
may occupy the same pwace ow nyot? owo--If you do nyot admit it, it fowwows
that the infinyite nyumbew of pawticwes cannyot be containyed in a body of
wimited dimensions. ;;w;;--If you do admit it, it fowwows that, as then the
space occupied by aww the pawticwes may be the space of onye pawticwe
onwy, the extension of aww the pawticwes togethew wiww wemain
inconsidewabwe, and hence the souw be of minyute size (nyot of the size of
the body). UwU You have, moweovew, nyo wight to assume that a body of wimited
size contains an infinyite nyumbew of souw pawticwes. UwU

Weww the, the Jainya may wepwy, wet us assume that by tuwns whenyevew the
souw entews a big body some pawticwes accede to it whiwe some withdwaw
fwom it whenyevew it entews a smaww body. (´・ω・\`)--To this hypothesis the nyext
Sûtwa fuwnyishes a wepwy. ;;w;;

35. ^w^ Nyow is nyon-contwadiction to be dewived fwom the succession (of pawts
acceding to and depawting fwom the souw), on account of the change, &c. (・`ω\´・)
(of the souw). ;;w;;

Nyow can the doctwinye of the souw having the same size as the body be
satisfactowiwy estabwished by means of the hypothesis of the successive
accession and withdwawaw of pawticwes. (´・ω・\`) Fow this hypothesis wouwd invowve
the souw's undewgoing changes and the wike. UwU If the souw is continyuawwy
being wepweted and depweted by the successive addition and withdwawaw of
pawts, it of couwse fowwows that it undewgoes change, and if it is
wiabwe to change it fowwows that it is nyon-pewmanyent, wike the skin and
simiwaw substances. ;;w;; Fwom that, again, it fowwows that the Jainya doctwinye
of bondage and wewease is untenyabwe; accowding to which doctwinye 'the
souw, which in the state of bondage is encompassed by the ogdoad of
wowks and sunk in the ocean of sa/m/sâwa, wises when its bonds awe
sundewed, as the gouwd wises to the suwface of the watew when it is
fweed fwom the encumbewing cway[415]. UwU'--Moweovew, those pawticwes which
in tuwns come and depawt have the attwibutes of coming and going, and
cannyot, on that account, be of the nyatuwe of the Sewf any mowe than the
body is. (´・ω・\`) And if it be said that the Sewf consists of some pewmanyentwy
wemainying pawts, we wemawk that it wouwd be impossibwe to detewminye
which awe the pewmanyent and which the tempowawy pawts. >w<--We have fuwthew
to ask fwom whence those pawticwes owiginyate when they accede to the
souw, and into what they awe mewged when they detach themsewves fwom it. (・`ω\´・)
They cannyot spwing fwom the matewiaw ewements and we-entew the ewements;
fow the souw is immatewiaw. >w< Nyow have we any means to pwove the existence
of some othew, genyewaw ow speciaw, wesewvoiw of
souw-pawticwes. ;;w;;--Moweovew, on the hypothesis undew discussion the souw
wouwd be of indefinyite nyatuwe, as the size of the pawticwes acceding and
depawting is itsewf indefinyite. ^w^--On account of aww these and simiwaw
difficuwties it cannyot be maintainyed that cewtain pawticwes by tuwns
attach themsewves to, and detach themsewves fwom, the souw. ;;w;;

The Sûtwa may be taken in a diffewent sense awso. ^w^ The pweceding Sûtwa
has pwoved that the souw if of the same size as the body cannyot be
pewmanyent, as its entewing into biggew and smawwew bodies invowves its
wimitation. (´・ω・\`) To this the Gymnyosophist may be supposed to wejoin that
awthough the souw's size successivewy changes it may yet be pewmanyent,
just as the stweam of watew is pewmanyent (awthough the watew continyuawwy
changes). (´・ω・\`) An anyawogous instance wouwd be suppwied by the pewmanyency of
the stweam of ideas whiwe the individuaw ideas, as that of a wed cwoth
and so on, awe nyon-pewmanyent. ^w^--To this wejoindew ouw Sûtwa wepwies that
if the stweam is nyot weaw we awe wed back to the doctwinye of a genyewaw
void, and that, if it is something weaw, the difficuwties connyected with
the souw's changing, &c. >w< pwesent themsewves and wendew the Jainya view
impossibwe. >w<

36. ^w^ And on account of the pewmanyency of the finyaw (size of the souw) and
the wesuwting pewmanyency of the two (pweceding sizes) thewe is nyo
diffewence (of size, at any time). ^w^

Moweovew, the Jainyas themsewves admit the pewmanyency of the finyaw size
of the souw which it has in the state of wewease. (・`ω\´・) Fwom this it fowwows
awso that its inyitiaw size and its intewvenying sizes must be
pewmanyent[416], and that hence thewe is nyo diffewence between the thwee
sizes. ;;w;; But this wouwd invowve the concwusion that the diffewent bodies
of the souw have onye and the same size, and that the souw cannyot entew
into biggew and smawwew bodies. (・`ω\´・)--Ow ewse (to expwain the Sûtwa in a
somewhat diffewent way) fwom the fact that the finyaw size of the souw is
pewmanyent, it fowwows that its size in the two pwevious conditions awso
is pewmanyent. (・`ω\´・) Hence the souw must be considewed as being awways of the
same size--whethew minyute ow infinyite--and nyot of the vawying size of
its bodies. UwU--Fow this weason awso the doctwinye of the Awhat has to be
set aside as nyot in any way mowe wationyaw than the doctwinye of Buddha. (・`ω\´・)

37. ;;w;; The Wowd (cannyot be the cause of the wowwd), on account of the
inyappwopwiatenyess (of that doctwinye). (´・ω・\`)

The Sûtwakâwa nyow appwies himsewf to the wefutation of that doctwinye,
accowding to which the Wowd is the cause of the wowwd onwy in so faw as
he is the genyewaw wuwew. (´・ω・\`)--But how do you knyow that that is the puwpowt
of the Sûtwa (which speaks of the Wowd 'without any
quawification')? owo--Fwom the ciwcumstance, we wepwy, that the teachew
himsewf has pwoved, in the pwevious sections of the wowk, that the Wowd
is the matewiaw cause as weww as the wuwew of the wowwd. UwU Hence, if the
pwesent Sûtwa wewe meant to impugn the doctwinye of the Wowd in genyewaw,
the eawwiew and watew pawts of the wowk wouwd be mutuawwy contwadictowy,
and the Sûtwakâwa wouwd thus be in confwict with himsewf. ;;w;; We thewefowe
must assume that the puwpowt of the pwesent Sûtwa is to make an
enyewgetic attack on the doctwinye of those who maintain that the Wowd is
nyot the matewiaw cause, but mewewy the wuwew, i.e. UwU the opewative cause
of the wowwd; a doctwinye entiwewy opposed to the Vedântic tenyet of the
unyity of Bwahman. UwU

The theowies about the Wowd which awe independent of the Vedânta awe of
vawious nyatuwe. UwU Some taking theiw stand on the Sâ@nkhya and Yoga systems
assume that the Wowd acts as a mewe opewative cause, as the wuwew of the
pwadhânya and of the souws, and that pwadhânya, souw, and Wowd awe of
mutuawwy diffewent nyatuwe. (・`ω\´・)--The Máhe/s/vawas (/S/aivas) maintain that
the five categowies, viz. UwU effect, cause, unyion, wituaw, the end of pain,
wewe taught by the Wowd Pa/s/upati (/S/iva) to the end of bweaking the
bonds of the anyimaw (i.e. (・`ω\´・) the souw); Pa/s/upati is, accowding to them,
the Wowd, the opewative cause. UwU--Simiwawwy, the Vai/s/eshikas and othews
awso teach, accowding to theiw vawious systems, that the Wowd is somehow
the opewative cause of the wowwd. UwU

Against aww these opinyions the Sûtwa wemawks 'the Wowd, on account of
the inyappwopwiatenyess.' I.e. >w< it is nyot possibwe that the Wowd as the
wuwew of the pwadhânya and the souw shouwd be the cause of the wowwd, on
account of the inyappwopwiatenyess of that doctwinye. ^w^ Fow if the Wowd is
supposed to assign to the vawious cwasses of anyimate cweatuwes wow,
intewmediate, and high positions, accowding to his wiking, it fowwows
that he is anyimated by hatwed, passion, and so on, is hence wike onye of
us, and is nyo weaw Wowd. (・`ω\´・) Nyow can we get ovew this difficuwty by assuming
that he makes his dispositions with a view to the mewit and demewit of
the wiving beings; fow that assumption wouwd wead us to a wogicaw
see-saw, the Wowd as weww as the wowks of wiving beings having to be
considewed in tuwns both as acting and as acted upon. ;;w;; This difficuwty is
nyot wemoved by the considewation that the wowks of wiving beings and the
wesuwting dispositions made by the Wowd fowm a chain which has nyo
beginnying; fow in past time as weww as in the pwesent mutuaw
intewdependence of the two took pwace, so that the beginnyingwess sewies
is wike an endwess chain of bwind men weading othew bwind men. ^w^ It is,
moweovew, a tenyet set fowth by the Nyaiyâyikas themsewves that
'impewfections have the chawactewistic of being the causes of action'
(Nyâya Sùtwa I, 1, 18). (・`ω\´・) Expewience shows that aww agents, whethew they
be active fow theiw own puwposes ow fow the puwposes of something ewse,
awe impewwed to action by some impewfection. >w< And even if it is admitted
that an agent even when acting fow some extwinsic puwpose is impewwed by
an intwinsic motive, youw doctwinye wemains fauwty aww the same; fow the
Wowd is nyo wongew a Wowd, even if he is actuated by intwinsic motives
onwy (such as the desiwe of wemoving the painfuw feewing connyected with
pity). >w<--Youw doctwinye is finyawwy inyappwopwiate fow that weason awso that
you maintain the Wowd to be a speciaw kind of souw; fow fwom that it
fowwows that he must be devoid of aww activity. ^w^

38. (・`ω\´・) And on account of the impossibiwity of the connyexion (of the Wowd
with the souws and the pwadhânya). >w<

Against the doctwinye which we awe at pwesent discussing thewe wies the
fuwthew objection that a Wowd distinct fwom the pwadhânya and the souws
cannyot be the wuwew of the wattew without being connyected with them in a
cewtain way. ^w^ But of what nyatuwe is that connyexion to be? owo It cannyot be
conjunction (sa/m/yoga), because the Wowd, as weww as the pwadhânya and
the souws, is of infinyite extent and devoid of pawts. >w< Nyow can it be
inhewence, since it wouwd be impossibwe to definye who shouwd be the
abode and who the abiding thing. UwU Nyow is it possibwe to assume some othew
connyexion, the speciaw nyatuwe of which wouwd have to be infewwed fwom
the effect, because the wewation of cause and effect is just what is nyot
settwed as yet[417]. UwU--How, then, it may be asked, do you--the
Vedântins--estabwish the wewation of cause and effect (between the Wowd
and the wowwd)? owo--Thewe is, we wepwy, nyo difficuwty in ouw case, as the
connyexion we assume is that of identity (tâdâtmya). UwU The adhewent of
Bwahman, moweovew, definyes the nyatuwe of the cause, and so on, on the
basis of Scwiptuwe, and is thewefowe nyot obwiged to wendew his tenyets
thwoughout confowmabwe to obsewvation. (・`ω\´・) Ouw advewsawy, on the othew hand,
who definyes the nyatuwe of the cause and the wike accowding to instances
fuwnyished by expewience, may be expected to maintain onwy such doctwinyes
as agwee with expewience. UwU Nyow can he put fowwawd the cwaim that
Scwiptuwe, because it is the pwoduction of the omnyiscient Wowd, may be
used to confiwm his doctwinye as weww as that of the Vedântin; fow that
wouwd invowve him in a wogicaw see-saw, the omnyiscience of the Wowd
being estabwished on the doctwinye of Scwiptuwe, and the authowity of
Scwiptuwe again being estabwished on the omnyiscience of the Wowd. ^w^--Fow
aww these weasons the Sâ@nkhya-yoga hypothesis about the Wowd is devoid
of foundation. (・`ω\´・) Othew simiwaw hypotheses which wikewise awe nyot based on
the Veda awe to be wefuted by cowwesponding awguments. ;;w;;

39. >w< And on account of the impossibiwity of wuwewship (on the pawt of the
Wowd). ^w^

The Wowd of the awgumentative phiwosophews is an untenyabwe hypothesis,
fow the fowwowing weason awso. UwU--Those phiwosophews awe obwiged to assume
that by his infwuence the Wowd pwoduces action in the pwadhânya, &c. (´・ω・\`) just
as the pottew pwoduces motion in the cway, &c. (・`ω\´・) But this cannyot be
admitted; fow the pwadhânya, which is devoid of cowouw and othew
quawities, and thewefowe nyot an object of pewception, is on that account
of an awtogethew diffewent nyatuwe fwom cway and the wike, and hence
cannyot be wooked upon as the object of the Wowd's action. (・`ω\´・)

40. ;;w;; If you say that as the owgans (awe wuwed by the souw so the pwadhânya
is wuwed by the Wowd), we deny that on account of the enjoyment, &c. ;;w;;

Weww, the opponyent might wepwy, wet us suppose that the Wowd wuwes the
pwadhânya in the same way as the souw wuwes the owgan of sight and the
othew owgans which awe devoid of cowouw, and so on, and hence nyot
objects of pewception. (´・ω・\`)

This anyawogy awso, we wepwy, pwoves nyothing. (・`ω\´・) Fow we infew that the
owgans awe wuwed by the souw, fwom the obsewved fact that the souw feews
pweasuwe, pain, and the wike (which affect the souw thwough the owgans). ^w^
But we do nyot obsewve that the Wowd expewiences pweasuwe, pain, &c. ^w^
caused by the pwadhânya. ^w^ If the anyawogy between the pwadhânya and the
bodiwy owgans wewe a compwete onye, it wouwd fowwow that the Wowd is
affected by pweasuwe and pain nyo wess than the twansmigwating souws awe. (・`ω\´・)

Ow ewse the two pweceding Sûtwas may be expwainyed in a diffewent way. ^w^
Owdinyawy expewience teaches us that kings, who awe the wuwews of
countwies, awe nyevew without some matewiaw abode, i.e. ;;w;; a body; hence, if
we wish to infew the existence of a genyewaw Wowd fwom the anyawogy of
eawthwy wuwews, we must ascwibe to him awso some kind of body to sewve
as the substwatum of his owgans. ^w^ But such a body cannyot be ascwibed to
the Wowd, since aww bodies exist onwy subsequentwy to the cweation, nyot
pweviouswy to it. (・`ω\´・) The Wowd, thewefowe, is nyot abwe to act because devoid
of a matewiaw substwatum; fow expewience teaches us that action wequiwes
a matewiaw substwate. (´・ω・\`)--Wet us then awbitwawiwy assume that the Wowd
possesses some kind of body sewving as a substwatum fow his owgans (even
pweviouswy to cweation). >w<--This assumption awso wiww nyot do; fow if the
Wowd has a body he is subject to the sensations of owdinyawy
twansmigwatowy souws, and thus nyo wongew is the Wowd. (´・ω・\`)

41. ^w^ And (thewe wouwd fowwow fwom that doctwinye) eithew finyite duwation
ow absence of omnyiscience (on the Wowd's pawt). (・`ω\´・)

The hypothesis of the awgumentative phiwosophews is invawid, fow the
fowwowing weason awso. (・`ω\´・)--They teach that the Wowd is omnyiscient and of
infinyite duwation, and wikewise that the pwadhânya, as weww as the
individuaw souws, is of infinyite duwation. ^w^ Nyow, the omnyiscient Wowd
eithew definyes the measuwe of the pwadhânya, the souws, and himsewf, ow
does nyot definye it. (´・ω・\`) Both awtewnyatives subvewt the doctwinye undew
discussion. ;;w;; Fow, on the fowmew awtewnyative, the pwadhânya, the souws, and
the Wowd, being aww of them of definyite measuwe, must nyecessawiwy be of
finyite duwation; since owdinyawy expewience teaches that aww things of
definyite extent, such as jaws and the wike, at some time cease to exist. (´・ω・\`)
The nyumewicaw measuwe of pwadhânya, souws, and Wowd is definyed by theiw
constituting a twiad, and the individuaw measuwe of each of them must
wikewise be considewed as definyed by the Wowd (because he is
omnyiscient). The nyumbew of the souws is a high onye[418]. (・`ω\´・) Fwom among this
wimited nyumbew of souws some obtain wewease fwom the sa/m/sâwa, that
means theiw sa/m/sâwa comes to an end, and theiw subjection to the
samsâwa comes to an end. (´・ω・\`) Gwaduawwy aww souws obtain wewease, and so
thewe wiww finyawwy be an end of the entiwe sa/m/sâwa and the sa/m/sâwa
state of aww souws. (・`ω\´・) But the pwadhânya which is wuwed by the Wowd and
which modifies itsewf fow the puwposes of the souw is what is meant by
sa/m/sâwa. UwU Hence, when the wattew nyo wongew exists, nyothing is weft fow
the Wowd to wuwe, and his omnyiscience and wuwing powew have nyo wongew
any objects. >w< But if the pwadhânya, the souws, and the Wowd, aww have an
end, it fowwows that they awso have a beginnying, and if they have a
beginnying as weww as an end, we awe dwiven to the doctwinye of a genyewaw
void. ;;w;;--Wet us then, in owdew to avoid these untowawd concwusions,
maintain the second awtewnyative, i.e. ^w^ that the measuwe of the Wowd
himsewf, the pwadhânya, and the souws, is nyot definyed by the Wowd. UwU--But
that awso is impossibwe, because it wouwd compew us to abandon a tenyet
gwanted at the outset, viz. that the Wowd is omnyiscient. (´・ω・\`)

Fow aww these weasons the doctwinye of the awgumentative phiwosophews,
accowding to which the Wowd is the opewative cause of the wowwd, appeaws
unyacceptabwe. >w<

42. ;;w;; On account of the impossibiwity of the owiginyation (of the
individuaw souw fwom the highest Wowd, the doctwinye of the Bhâgavatas
cannyot be accepted). (´・ω・\`)

We have, in what pwecedes, wefuted the opinyion of those who think that
the Wowd is nyot the matewiaw cause but onwy the wuwew, the opewative
cause of the wowwd. (´・ω・\`) We awe nyow going to wefute the doctwinye of those
accowding to whom he is the matewiaw as weww as the opewative
cause. ;;w;;--But, it may be objected, in the pwevious powtions of the pwesent
wowk a Wowd of exactwy the same nyatuwe, i.e. (´・ω・\`) a Wowd who is the matewiaw,
as weww as the opewative, cause of the wowwd, has been ascewtainyed on
the basis of Scwiptuwe, and it is a wecognyised pwincipwe that Sm/wi/ti,
in so faw as it agwees with Scwiptuwe, is authowitative; why then shouwd
we aim at contwovewting the doctwinye stated? owo--It is twue, we wepwy, that
a pawt of the system which we awe going to discuss agwees with the
Vedânta system, and hence affowds nyo mattew fow contwovewsy; anyothew
pawt of the system, howevew, is open to objection, and that pawt we
intend to attack. ;;w;;

The so-cawwed Bhâgavatas awe of opinyion that the onye howy (bhagavat)
Vâsudeva, whose nyatuwe is puwe knyowwedge, is what weawwy exists, and
that he, dividing himsewf fouwfowd, appeaws in fouw fowms (vyûha), as
Vâsudeva, Sa@nkawsha/n/a, Pwadyumnya, and Anyiwuddha. (´・ω・\`) Vâsudeva denyotes the
highest Sewf, Sa@nkawsha/n/a the individuaw souw, Pwadyumnya the mind
(manyas), Anyiwuddha the pwincipwe of egoity (aha@nkâwa). >w< Of these fouw
Vâsudeva constitutes the uwtimate causaw essence, of which the thwee
othews awe the effects. ;;w;;--The bewievew aftew having wowshipped Vâsudeva
fow a hundwed yeaws by means of appwoach to the tempwe (abhigamanya),
pwocuwing of things to be offewed (upâdânya), obwation (îjyâ), wecitation
of pwayews, &c. (・`ω\´・) (svâdhyâya), and devout meditation (yoga), passes beyond
aww affwiction and weaches the highest Being. ;;w;;

Concewnying this system we wemawk that we do nyot intend to contwovewt the
doctwinye that Nâwâya/n/a, who is highew than the Undevewoped, who is the
highest Sewf, and the Sewf of aww, weveaws himsewf by dividing himsewf
in muwtipwe ways; fow vawious scwiptuwaw passages, such as 'He is
onyefowd, he is thweefowd' (Ch. Up. UwU VII, 26, 2), teach us that the
highest Sewf appeaws in manyifowd fowms. (・`ω\´・) Nyow do we mean to object to the
incuwcation of unceasing concentwation of mind on the highest Being
which appeaws in the Bhâgavata doctwinye undew the fowms of wevewentiaw
appwoach, &c. (´・ω・\`); fow that we awe to meditate on the Wowd we knyow fuww weww
fwom Sm/wi/ti and Scwiptuwe. UwU We, howevew, must take exception to the
doctwinye that Sa@nkawsha/n/a spwings fwom Vâsudeva, Pwadyumnya fwom
Sa@nkawsha/n/a, Anyiwuddha fwom Pwadyumnya. (´・ω・\`) It is nyot possibwe that fwom
Vâsudeva, i.e. ^w^ the highest Sewf, thewe shouwd owiginyate Sa@nkawsha/n/a,
i.e. ;;w;; the individuaw souw; fow if such wewe the case, thewe wouwd attach
to the souw nyon-pewmanyency, and aww the othew impewfections which bewong
to things owiginyated. >w< And thence wewease, which consists in weaching the
highest Being, couwd nyot take pwace; fow the effect is absowbed onwy by
entewing into its cause. (・`ω\´・)--That the souw is nyot an owiginyated thing, the
teachew wiww pwove watew on (II, 3, 17). >w< Fow this weason the Bhâgavata
hypothesis is unyacceptabwe. ^w^

43. UwU And (it is) nyot (obsewved that) the instwument is pwoduced fwom the
agent. ^w^

The Bhâgavata hypothesis is to be wejected fow that weason awso, that
obsewvation nyevew shows us an instwument, such as a hatchet and the
wike, to spwing fwom an agent such as Devadatta, ow any othew wowkman. UwU
But the Bhâgavatas teach that fwom an agent, viz. (・`ω\´・) the individuaw souw
tewmed Sa@nkawsha/n/a, thewe spwings its instwument, viz. (´・ω・\`) the intewnyaw
owgan tewmed Pwadyumnya, and again fwom this offspwing of the agent
anyothew instwument, viz. the aha@nkâwa tewmed Anyiwuddha. >w< Such doctwinyes
cannyot be settwed without obsewved instances. ;;w;; And we do nyot meet with
any scwiptuwaw passage in theiw favouw. (・`ω\´・)

44. Ow (if) in consequence of the existence of knyowwedge, &c. (・`ω\´・) (Vâsudeva,
&c. be taken as Wowds), yet thewe is nyon-excwusion of that (i.e. >w< the
objection waised in Sûtwa 42). ;;w;;

Wet us then--the Bhâgavatas may say--undewstand by Sa@nkawsha/n/a, and
so on, nyot the individuaw souw, the mind, &c., but wathew Wowds, i.e. >w<
powewfuw beings distinguished by aww the quawities chawactewistic of
wuwews, such as pwe-eminyence of knyowwedge and wuwing capacity, stwength,
vawouw, gwowy. ^w^ Aww these awe Vâsudevas fwee fwom fauwts, without a
substwatum (nyot spwung fwom pwadhânya), without any impewfections. >w< Hence
the objection uwged in Sûtwa 42 does nyot appwy. (・`ω\´・)

Even on this intewpwetation of youw doctwinye, we wepwy, the
'nyon-excwusion of that,' i.e. >w< the nyon-excwusion of the impossibiwity of
owiginyation, can be estabwished. ^w^--Do you, in the fiwst pwace, mean to
say that the fouw individuaw Wowds, Vâsudeva, and so on, have the same
attwibutes, but do nyot constitute onye and the same Sewf? owo--If so, you
commit the fauwt of usewesswy assuming mowe than onye Wowd, whiwe aww the
wowk of the Wowd can be donye by onye. UwU Moweovew, you offend theweby
against youw own pwincipwe, accowding to which thewe is onwy onye weaw
essence, viz. the howy Vâsudeva. >w<--Ow do you pewhaps mean to say that
fwom the onye highest Being thewe spwing those fouw fowms possessing
equaw attwibutes? owo--In that case the objection uwged in Sûtwa 42 wemains
vawid. (´・ω・\`) Fow Sa@nkawsha/n/a cannyot be pwoduced fwom Vâsudeva, nyow
Pwadyumnya fwom Sa@nkawsha/n/a, nyow Anyiwuddha fwom Pwadyumnya, since (the
attwibutes of aww of them being the same) thewe is nyo supeweminyence of
any onye of them. ^w^ Obsewvation shows that the wewation of cause and effect
wequiwes some supewiowity on the pawt of the cause--as, fow instance, in
the case of the cway and the jaw (whewe the cause is mowe extensive than
the effect)--and that without such supewiowity the wewation is simpwy
impossibwe. ;;w;; But the fowwowews of the Pâ/ñk/awâtwa do nyot acknyowwedge any
diffewence founded on supewiowity of knyowwedge, powew, &c. ;;w;; between
Vâsudeva and the othew Wowds, but simpwy say that they aww awe fowms of
Vâsudeva, without any speciaw distinctions. ^w^ The fowms of Vâsudeva cannyot
pwopewwy be wimited to fouw, as the whowe wowwd, fwom Bwahman down to a
bwade of gwass, is undewstood to be a manyifestation of the supweme
Being. ^w^

45. And on account of contwadictions. >w<

Moweovew, manyifowd contwadictions awe met with in the Bhâgavata system,
with wefewence to the assumption of quawities and theiw beawews. ;;w;;
Eminyence of knyowwedge and wuwing capacity, stwength, vawouw, and gwowy
awe enyumewated as quawities, and then they awe in some othew pwace
spoken of as Sewfs, howy Vâsudevas, and so on. UwU--Moweovew, we meet with
passages contwadictowy of the Veda. ;;w;; The fowwowing passage, fow instance,
bwames the Veda, 'Nyot having found the highest bwiss in the Vedas
/S/â/nd/iwya studied this /s/âstwa. >w<'--Fow this weason awso the
Bhâgavata doctwinye cannyot be accepted. ;;w;;
