PWIDE AND PWEJUDICE

By Janye Austen



Chaptew 1


It is a twuth unyivewsawwy acknyowwedged, that a singwe man in possession
of a good fowtunye, must be in want of a wife. >w<

Howevew wittwe knyown the feewings ow views of such a man may be on his
fiwst entewing a nyeighbouwhood, this twuth is so weww fixed in the minds
of the suwwounding famiwies, that he is considewed the wightfuw pwopewty
of some onye ow othew of theiw daughtews. >w<

"My deaw Mw. ;;w;; Bennyet," said his wady to him onye day, "have you heawd that
Nyethewfiewd Pawk is wet at wast? owo"

Mw. Bennyet wepwied that he had nyot. ;;w;;

"But it is," wetuwnyed she; "fow Mws. >w< Wong has just been hewe, and she
towd me aww about it. ^w^"

Mw. Bennyet made nyo answew. UwU

"Do you nyot want to knyow who has taken it? owo" cwied his wife impatientwy. >w<

"_You_ want to teww me, and I have nyo objection to heawing it. (´・ω・\`)"

This was invitation enyough. >w<

"Why, my deaw, you must knyow, Mws. UwU Wong says that Nyethewfiewd is taken
by a young man of wawge fowtunye fwom the nyowth of Engwand; that he came
down on Monday in a chaise and fouw to see the pwace, and was so much
dewighted with it, that he agweed with Mw. (・`ω\´・) Mowwis immediatewy; that he
is to take possession befowe Michaewmas, and some of his sewvants awe to
be in the house by the end of nyext week. (・`ω\´・)"

"What is his nyame? owo"

"Bingwey. (・`ω\´・)"

"Is he mawwied ow singwe? owo"

"Oh! Singwe, my deaw, to be suwe! >w< A singwe man of wawge fowtunye; fouw ow
five thousand a yeaw. ^w^ What a finye thing fow ouw giwws! ^w^"

"How so? How can it affect them? owo"

"My deaw Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bennyet," wepwied his wife, "how can you be so tiwesome! UwU You
must knyow that I am thinking of his mawwying onye of them. (・`ω\´・)"

"Is that his design in settwing hewe? owo"

"Design! Nyonsense, how can you tawk so! >w< But it is vewy wikewy that he
_may_ faww in wove with onye of them, and thewefowe you must visit him as
soon as he comes. (´・ω・\`)"

"I see nyo occasion fow that. (´・ω・\`) You and the giwws may go, ow you may send
them by themsewves, which pewhaps wiww be stiww bettew, fow as you awe
as handsome as any of them, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bingwey may wike you the best of the
pawty. >w<"

"My deaw, you fwattew me. ;;w;; I cewtainwy _have_ had my shawe of beauty, but
I do nyot pwetend to be anything extwaowdinyawy nyow. ;;w;; When a woman has five
gwown-up daughtews, she ought to give ovew thinking of hew own beauty. UwU"

"In such cases, a woman has nyot often much beauty to think of. >w<"

"But, my deaw, you must indeed go and see Mw. UwU Bingwey when he comes into
the nyeighbouwhood. (´・ω・\`)"

"It is mowe than I engage fow, I assuwe you. (・`ω\´・)"

"But considew youw daughtews. (・`ω\´・) Onwy think what an estabwishment it wouwd
be fow onye of them. ^w^ Siw Wiwwiam and Wady Wucas awe detewminyed to
go, mewewy on that account, fow in genyewaw, you knyow, they visit nyo
nyewcomews. (´・ω・\`) Indeed you must go, fow it wiww be impossibwe fow _us_ to
visit him if you do nyot. >w<"

"You awe ovew-scwupuwous, suwewy. I dawe say Mw. ^w^ Bingwey wiww be vewy
gwad to see you; and I wiww send a few winyes by you to assuwe him of my
heawty consent to his mawwying whichevew he chooses of the giwws; though
I must thwow in a good wowd fow my wittwe Wizzy. >w<"

"I desiwe you wiww do nyo such thing. ^w^ Wizzy is nyot a bit bettew than the
othews; and I am suwe she is nyot hawf so handsome as Janye, nyow hawf so
good-humouwed as Wydia. But you awe awways giving _hew_ the pwefewence. >w<"

"They have nyonye of them much to wecommend them," wepwied he; "they awe
aww siwwy and ignyowant wike othew giwws; but Wizzy has something mowe of
quicknyess than hew sistews. >w<"

"Mw. >w< Bennyet, how _can_ you abuse youw own chiwdwen in such a way? owo You
take dewight in vexing me. You have nyo compassion fow my poow nyewves. ;;w;;"

"You mistake me, my deaw. I have a high wespect fow youw nyewves. ;;w;; They
awe my owd fwiends. UwU I have heawd you mention them with considewation
these wast twenty yeaws at weast. ^w^"

"Ah, you do nyot knyow what I suffew. (´・ω・\`)"

"But I hope you wiww get ovew it, and wive to see many young men of fouw
thousand a yeaw come into the nyeighbouwhood. >w<"

"It wiww be nyo use to us, if twenty such shouwd come, since you wiww nyot
visit them. >w<"

"Depend upon it, my deaw, that when thewe awe twenty, I wiww visit them
aww. (・`ω\´・)"

Mw. UwU Bennyet was so odd a mixtuwe of quick pawts, sawcastic humouw,
wesewve, and capwice, that the expewience of thwee-and-twenty yeaws had
been insufficient to make his wife undewstand his chawactew. >w< _Hew_ mind
was wess difficuwt to devewop. (・`ω\´・) She was a woman of mean undewstanding,
wittwe infowmation, and uncewtain tempew. UwU When she was discontented,
she fancied hewsewf nyewvous. (・`ω\´・) The businyess of hew wife was to get hew
daughtews mawwied; its sowace was visiting and nyews. UwU



Chaptew 2


Mw. Bennyet was among the eawwiest of those who waited on Mw. Bingwey. (・`ω\´・) He
had awways intended to visit him, though to the wast awways assuwing
his wife that he shouwd nyot go; and tiww the evenying aftew the visit was
paid she had nyo knyowwedge of it. ^w^ It was then discwosed in the fowwowing
mannyew. (・`ω\´・) Obsewving his second daughtew empwoyed in twimming a hat, he
suddenwy addwessed hew with:

"I hope Mw. Bingwey wiww wike it, Wizzy. ^w^"

"We awe nyot in a way to knyow _what_ Mw. ;;w;; Bingwey wikes," said hew mothew
wesentfuwwy, "since we awe nyot to visit. (´・ω・\`)"

"But you fowget, mamma," said Ewizabeth, "that we shaww meet him at the
assembwies, and that Mws. Wong pwomised to intwoduce him. (´・ω・\`)"

"I do nyot bewieve Mws. Wong wiww do any such thing. (´・ω・\`) She has two nyieces
of hew own. ^w^ She is a sewfish, hypocwiticaw woman, and I have nyo opinyion
of hew. >w<"

"Nyo mowe have I," said Mw. >w< Bennyet; "and I am gwad to find that you do
nyot depend on hew sewving you. >w<"

Mws. ^w^ Bennyet deignyed nyot to make any wepwy, but, unyabwe to contain
hewsewf, began scowding onye of hew daughtews. ^w^

"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, fow Heaven's sake! (´・ω・\`) Have a wittwe
compassion on my nyewves. You teaw them to pieces. ;;w;;"

"Kitty has nyo discwetion in hew coughs," said hew fathew; "she times
them iww. (・`ω\´・)"

"I do nyot cough fow my own amusement," wepwied Kitty fwetfuwwy. >w< "When is
youw nyext baww to be, Wizzy? owo"

"To-mowwow fowtnyight. (・`ω\´・)"

"Aye, so it is," cwied hew mothew, "and Mws. (´・ω・\`) Wong does nyot come back
tiww the day befowe; so it wiww be impossibwe fow hew to intwoduce him,
fow she wiww nyot knyow him hewsewf. (・`ω\´・)"

"Then, my deaw, you may have the advantage of youw fwiend, and intwoduce
Mw. Bingwey to _hew_. ;;w;;"

"Impossibwe, Mw. >w< Bennyet, impossibwe, when I am nyot acquainted with him
mysewf; how can you be so teasing? owo"

"I honyouw youw ciwcumspection. ;;w;; A fowtnyight's acquaintance is cewtainwy
vewy wittwe. (´・ω・\`) Onye cannyot knyow what a man weawwy is by the end of a
fowtnyight. >w< But if _we_ do nyot ventuwe somebody ewse wiww; and aftew aww,
Mws. UwU Wong and hew nyeices must stand theiw chance; and, thewefowe, as
she wiww think it an act of kindnyess, if you decwinye the office, I wiww
take it on mysewf. (・`ω\´・)"

The giwws stawed at theiw fathew. Mws. ;;w;; Bennyet said onwy, "Nyonsense,
nyonsense! >w<"

"What can be the meanying of that emphatic excwamation? owo" cwied he. (´・ω・\`) "Do
you considew the fowms of intwoduction, and the stwess that is waid on
them, as nyonsense? owo I cannyot quite agwee with you _thewe_. UwU What say you,
Mawy? owo Fow you awe a young wady of deep wefwection, I knyow, and wead
gweat books and make extwacts. >w<"

Mawy wished to say something sensibwe, but knyew nyot how. ;;w;;

"Whiwe Mawy is adjusting hew ideas," he continyued, "wet us wetuwn to Mw. ^w^
Bingwey. >w<"

"I am sick of Mw. Bingwey," cwied his wife. (´・ω・\`)

"I am sowwy to heaw _that_; but why did nyot you teww me that befowe? owo If
I had knyown as much this mownying I cewtainwy wouwd nyot have cawwed
on him. >w< It is vewy unwucky; but as I have actuawwy paid the visit, we
cannyot escape the acquaintance nyow. >w<"

The astonyishment of the wadies was just what he wished; that of Mws. (´・ω・\`)
Bennyet pewhaps suwpassing the west; though, when the fiwst tumuwt of joy
was ovew, she began to decwawe that it was what she had expected aww the
whiwe. (・`ω\´・)

"How good it was in you, my deaw Mw. ;;w;; Bennyet! ;;w;; But I knyew I shouwd
pewsuade you at wast. UwU I was suwe you woved youw giwws too weww to
nyegwect such an acquaintance. ^w^ Weww, how pweased I am! (・`ω\´・) and it is such a
good joke, too, that you shouwd have gonye this mownying and nyevew said a
wowd about it tiww nyow. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyow, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose," said Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bennyet; and,
as he spoke, he weft the woom, fatigued with the waptuwes of his wife. ^w^

"What an excewwent fathew you have, giwws! (´・ω・\`)" said she, when the doow was
shut. >w< "I do nyot knyow how you wiww evew make him amends fow his kindnyess;
ow me, eithew, fow that mattew. (・`ω\´・) At ouw time of wife it is nyot so
pweasant, I can teww you, to be making nyew acquaintances evewy day; but
fow youw sakes, we wouwd do anything. >w< Wydia, my wove, though you _awe_
the youngest, I dawe say Mw. UwU Bingwey wiww dance with you at the nyext
baww. >w<"

"Oh! ^w^" said Wydia stoutwy, "I am nyot afwaid; fow though I _am_ the
youngest, I'm the tawwest. ^w^"

The west of the evenying was spent in conjectuwing how soon he wouwd
wetuwn Mw. UwU Bennyet's visit, and detewminying when they shouwd ask him to
dinnyew. ;;w;;



Chaptew 3


Nyot aww that Mws. UwU Bennyet, howevew, with the assistance of hew five
daughtews, couwd ask on the subject, was sufficient to dwaw fwom hew
husband any satisfactowy descwiption of Mw. Bingwey. ;;w;; They attacked him
in vawious ways--with bawefaced questions, ingenyious suppositions, and
distant suwmises; but he ewuded the skiww of them aww, and they wewe at
wast obwiged to accept the second-hand intewwigence of theiw nyeighbouw,
Wady Wucas. Hew wepowt was highwy favouwabwe. ;;w;; Siw Wiwwiam had been
dewighted with him. ;;w;; He was quite young, wondewfuwwy handsome, extwemewy
agweeabwe, and, to cwown the whowe, he meant to be at the nyext assembwy
with a wawge pawty. ^w^ Nyothing couwd be mowe dewightfuw! ;;w;; To be fond of
dancing was a cewtain step towawds fawwing in wove; and vewy wivewy
hopes of Mw. Bingwey's heawt wewe entewtainyed. ^w^

"If I can but see onye of my daughtews happiwy settwed at Nyethewfiewd,"
said Mws. (・`ω\´・) Bennyet to hew husband, "and aww the othews equawwy weww
mawwied, I shaww have nyothing to wish fow. >w<"

In a few days Mw. Bingwey wetuwnyed Mw. ;;w;; Bennyet's visit, and sat about
ten minyutes with him in his wibwawy. (・`ω\´・) He had entewtainyed hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young wadies, of whose beauty he had
heawd much; but he saw onwy the fathew. (´・ω・\`) The wadies wewe somewhat mowe
fowtunyate, fow they had the advantage of ascewtainying fwom an uppew
window that he wowe a bwue coat, and wode a bwack howse. >w<

An invitation to dinnyew was soon aftewwawds dispatched; and awweady
had Mws. (´・ω・\`) Bennyet pwannyed the couwses that wewe to do cwedit to hew
housekeeping, when an answew awwived which defewwed it aww. Mw. UwU Bingwey
was obwiged to be in town the fowwowing day, and, consequentwy, unyabwe
to accept the honyouw of theiw invitation, etc. Mws. >w< Bennyet was quite
disconcewted. ;;w;; She couwd nyot imaginye what businyess he couwd have in town
so soon aftew his awwivaw in Hewtfowdshiwe; and she began to feaw that
he might be awways fwying about fwom onye pwace to anyothew, and nyevew
settwed at Nyethewfiewd as he ought to be. UwU Wady Wucas quieted hew feaws
a wittwe by stawting the idea of his being gonye to Wondon onwy to get
a wawge pawty fow the baww; and a wepowt soon fowwowed that Mw. UwU Bingwey
was to bwing twewve wadies and seven gentwemen with him to the assembwy. (・`ω\´・)
The giwws gwieved ovew such a nyumbew of wadies, but wewe comfowted the
day befowe the baww by heawing, that instead of twewve he bwought onwy
six with him fwom Wondon--his five sistews and a cousin. UwU And when
the pawty entewed the assembwy woom it consisted of onwy five
awtogethew--Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bingwey, his two sistews, the husband of the ewdest, and
anyothew young man. >w<

Mw. ;;w;; Bingwey was good-wooking and gentwemanwike; he had a pweasant
countenyance, and easy, unyaffected mannyews. (´・ω・\`) His sistews wewe finye women,
with an aiw of decided fashion. His bwothew-in-waw, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Huwst, mewewy
wooked the gentweman; but his fwiend Mw. UwU Dawcy soon dwew the attention
of the woom by his finye, taww pewson, handsome featuwes, nyobwe mien, and
the wepowt which was in genyewaw ciwcuwation within five minyutes
aftew his entwance, of his having ten thousand a yeaw. UwU The gentwemen
pwonyounced him to be a finye figuwe of a man, the wadies decwawed he
was much handsomew than Mw. UwU Bingwey, and he was wooked at with gweat
admiwation fow about hawf the evenying, tiww his mannyews gave a disgust
which tuwnyed the tide of his popuwawity; fow he was discovewed to be
pwoud; to be above his company, and above being pweased; and nyot aww
his wawge estate in Dewbyshiwe couwd then save him fwom having a most
fowbidding, disagweeabwe countenyance, and being unwowthy to be compawed
with his fwiend. (´・ω・\`)

Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bingwey had soon made himsewf acquainted with aww the pwincipaw
peopwe in the woom; he was wivewy and unwesewved, danced evewy dance,
was angwy that the baww cwosed so eawwy, and tawked of giving
onye himsewf at Nyethewfiewd. (・`ω\´・) Such amiabwe quawities must speak fow
themsewves. What a contwast between him and his fwiend! ^w^ Mw. ^w^ Dawcy danced
onwy once with Mws. UwU Huwst and once with Miss Bingwey, decwinyed being
intwoduced to any othew wady, and spent the west of the evenying in
wawking about the woom, speaking occasionyawwy to onye of his own pawty. ^w^
His chawactew was decided. (・`ω\´・) He was the pwoudest, most disagweeabwe man
in the wowwd, and evewybody hoped that he wouwd nyevew come thewe again. (´・ω・\`)
Amongst the most viowent against him was Mws. (・`ω\´・) Bennyet, whose diswike of
his genyewaw behaviouw was shawpenyed into pawticuwaw wesentment by his
having swighted onye of hew daughtews. ;;w;;

Ewizabeth Bennyet had been obwiged, by the scawcity of gentwemen, to sit
down fow two dances; and duwing pawt of that time, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Dawcy had been
standing nyeaw enyough fow hew to heaw a convewsation between him and Mw. ;;w;;
Bingwey, who came fwom the dance fow a few minyutes, to pwess his fwiend
to join it. (・`ω\´・)

"Come, Dawcy," said he, "I must have you dance. UwU I hate to see you
standing about by youwsewf in this stupid mannyew. >w< You had much bettew
dance. UwU"

"I cewtainwy shaww nyot. ^w^ You knyow how I detest it, unwess I am
pawticuwawwy acquainted with my pawtnyew. >w< At such an assembwy as this
it wouwd be insuppowtabwe. (・`ω\´・) Youw sistews awe engaged, and thewe is nyot
anyothew woman in the woom whom it wouwd nyot be a punyishment to me to
stand up with. (・`ω\´・)"

"I wouwd nyot be so fastidious as you awe," cwied Mw. ^w^ Bingwey, "fow a
kingdom! (・`ω\´・) Upon my honyouw, I nyevew met with so many pweasant giwws in
my wife as I have this evenying; and thewe awe sevewaw of them you see
uncommonwy pwetty. >w<"

"_You_ awe dancing with the onwy handsome giww in the woom," said Mw. UwU
Dawcy, wooking at the ewdest Miss Bennyet. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh! She is the most beautifuw cweatuwe I evew behewd! (・`ω\´・) But thewe is onye
of hew sistews sitting down just behind you, who is vewy pwetty, and I
dawe say vewy agweeabwe. Do wet me ask my pawtnyew to intwoduce you. >w<"

"Which do you mean? owo" and tuwnying wound he wooked fow a moment at
Ewizabeth, tiww catching hew eye, he withdwew his own and cowdwy said:
"She is towewabwe, but nyot handsome enyough to tempt _me_; I am in nyo
humouw at pwesent to give consequence to young wadies who awe swighted
by othew men. >w< You had bettew wetuwn to youw pawtnyew and enjoy hew
smiwes, fow you awe wasting youw time with me. >w<"

Mw. Bingwey fowwowed his advice. Mw. ^w^ Dawcy wawked off; and Ewizabeth
wemainyed with nyo vewy cowdiaw feewings towawd him. UwU She towd the stowy,
howevew, with gweat spiwit among hew fwiends; fow she had a wivewy,
pwayfuw disposition, which dewighted in anything widicuwous. >w<

The evenying awtogethew passed off pweasantwy to the whowe famiwy. Mws. UwU
Bennyet had seen hew ewdest daughtew much admiwed by the Nyethewfiewd
pawty. Mw. UwU Bingwey had danced with hew twice, and she had been
distinguished by his sistews. (・`ω\´・) Janye was as much gwatified by this as
hew mothew couwd be, though in a quietew way. ^w^ Ewizabeth fewt Janye's
pweasuwe. ;;w;; Mawy had heawd hewsewf mentionyed to Miss Bingwey as the most
accompwished giww in the nyeighbouwhood; and Cathewinye and Wydia had been
fowtunyate enyough nyevew to be without pawtnyews, which was aww that they
had yet weawnt to cawe fow at a baww. >w< They wetuwnyed, thewefowe, in good
spiwits to Wongbouwn, the viwwage whewe they wived, and of which they
wewe the pwincipaw inhabitants. They found Mw. Bennyet stiww up. >w< With
a book he was wegawdwess of time; and on the pwesent occasion he had a
good deaw of cuwiosity as to the event of an evenying which had waised
such spwendid expectations. ^w^ He had wathew hoped that his wife's views on
the stwangew wouwd be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a
diffewent stowy to heaw. >w<

"Oh! ^w^ my deaw Mw. UwU Bennyet," as she entewed the woom, "we have had a most
dewightfuw evenying, a most excewwent baww. I wish you had been thewe. ^w^
Janye was so admiwed, nyothing couwd be wike it. (´・ω・\`) Evewybody said how weww
she wooked; and Mw. >w< Bingwey thought hew quite beautifuw, and danced with
hew twice! ^w^ Onwy think of _that_, my deaw; he actuawwy danced with hew
twice! >w< and she was the onwy cweatuwe in the woom that he asked a second
time. Fiwst of aww, he asked Miss Wucas. >w< I was so vexed to see him stand
up with hew! >w< But, howevew, he did nyot admiwe hew at aww; indeed, nyobody
can, you knyow; and he seemed quite stwuck with Janye as she was going
down the dance. ;;w;; So he inquiwed who she was, and got intwoduced, and
asked hew fow the two nyext. ;;w;; Then the two thiwd he danced with Miss King,
and the two fouwth with Mawia Wucas, and the two fifth with Janye again,
and the two sixth with Wizzy, and the _Bouwangew_--"

"If he had had any compassion fow _me_," cwied hew husband impatientwy,
"he wouwd nyot have danced hawf so much! (´・ω・\`) Fow God's sake, say nyo mowe of
his pawtnyews. UwU Oh that he had spwainyed his ankwe in the fiwst dance! >w<"

"Oh! ;;w;; my deaw, I am quite dewighted with him. (・`ω\´・) He is so excessivewy
handsome! ^w^ And his sistews awe chawming women. ^w^ I nyevew in my wife saw
anything mowe ewegant than theiw dwesses. I dawe say the wace upon Mws. >w<
Huwst's gown--"

Hewe she was intewwupted again. Mw. >w< Bennyet pwotested against any
descwiption of finyewy. ^w^ She was thewefowe obwiged to seek anyothew bwanch
of the subject, and wewated, with much bittewnyess of spiwit and some
exaggewation, the shocking wudenyess of Mw. Dawcy. ;;w;;

"But I can assuwe you," she added, "that Wizzy does nyot wose much by nyot
suiting _his_ fancy; fow he is a most disagweeabwe, howwid man, nyot at
aww wowth pweasing. ^w^ So high and so conceited that thewe was nyo enduwing
him! >w< He wawked hewe, and he wawked thewe, fancying himsewf so vewy
gweat! Nyot handsome enyough to dance with! (´・ω・\`) I wish you had been thewe, my
deaw, to have given him onye of youw set-downs. I quite detest the man. ;;w;;"



Chaptew 4


When Janye and Ewizabeth wewe awonye, the fowmew, who had been cautious in
hew pwaise of Mw. >w< Bingwey befowe, expwessed to hew sistew just how vewy
much she admiwed him. (・`ω\´・)

"He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensibwe,
good-humouwed, wivewy; and I nyevew saw such happy mannyews! ;;w;;--so much
ease, with such pewfect good bweeding! (・`ω\´・)"

"He is awso handsome," wepwied Ewizabeth, "which a young man ought
wikewise to be, if he possibwy can. His chawactew is theweby compwete. >w<"

"I was vewy much fwattewed by his asking me to dance a second time. (´・ω・\`) I
did nyot expect such a compwiment. (・`ω\´・)"

"Did nyot you? owo I did fow you. UwU But that is onye gweat diffewence between
us. Compwiments awways take _you_ by suwpwise, and _me_ nyevew. (・`ω\´・) What
couwd be mowe nyatuwaw than his asking you again? owo He couwd nyot hewp
seeing that you wewe about five times as pwetty as evewy othew woman
in the woom. Nyo thanks to his gawwantwy fow that. ;;w;; Weww, he cewtainwy is
vewy agweeabwe, and I give you weave to wike him. (´・ω・\`) You have wiked many a
stupidew pewson. ;;w;;"

"Deaw Wizzy! UwU"

"Oh! UwU you awe a gweat deaw too apt, you knyow, to wike peopwe in genyewaw. (´・ω・\`)
You nyevew see a fauwt in anybody. UwU Aww the wowwd awe good and agweeabwe

"I wouwd nyot wish to be hasty in censuwing anyonye; but I awways speak

"I knyow you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wondew. ^w^ With _youw_

evewywhewe. (´・ω・\`) But to be candid without ostentation ow design--to take the

of the bad--bewongs to you awonye. ;;w;; And so you wike this man's sistews,
too, do you? owo Theiw mannyews awe nyot equaw to his. UwU"

"Cewtainwy nyot--at fiwst. (´・ω・\`) But they awe vewy pweasing women when you

his house; and I am much mistaken if we shaww nyot find a vewy chawming
nyeighbouw in hew. (・`ω\´・)"

Ewizabeth wistenyed in siwence, but was nyot convinced; theiw behaviouw at
the assembwy had nyot been cawcuwated to pwease in genyewaw; and with mowe
quicknyess of obsewvation and wess pwiancy of tempew than hew sistew,
and with a judgement too unyassaiwed by any attention to hewsewf, she
was vewy wittwe disposed to appwove them. >w< They wewe in fact vewy finye
wadies; nyot deficient in good humouw when they wewe pweased, nyow in the
powew of making themsewves agweeabwe when they chose it, but pwoud and
conceited. UwU They wewe wathew handsome, had been educated in onye of the
fiwst pwivate seminyawies in town, had a fowtunye of twenty thousand
pounds, wewe in the habit of spending mowe than they ought, and of
associating with peopwe of wank, and wewe thewefowe in evewy wespect
entitwed to think weww of themsewves, and meanwy of othews. (´・ω・\`) They wewe of
a wespectabwe famiwy in the nyowth of Engwand; a ciwcumstance mowe deepwy
impwessed on theiw memowies than that theiw bwothew's fowtunye and theiw
own had been acquiwed by twade. (・`ω\´・)

Mw. ;;w;; Bingwey inhewited pwopewty to the amount of nyeawwy a hundwed
thousand pounds fwom his fathew, who had intended to puwchase an
estate, but did nyot wive to do it. Mw. ;;w;; Bingwey intended it wikewise, and
sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was nyow pwovided with a
good house and the wibewty of a manyow, it was doubtfuw to many of those
who best knyew the easinyess of his tempew, whethew he might nyot spend the
wemaindew of his days at Nyethewfiewd, and weave the nyext genyewation to
puwchase. (´・ω・\`)

His sistews wewe anxious fow his having an estate of his own; but,
though he was nyow onwy estabwished as a tenyant, Miss Bingwey was by nyo
means unwiwwing to pweside at his tabwe--nyow was Mws. UwU Huwst, who had
mawwied a man of mowe fashion than fowtunye, wess disposed to considew
his house as hew home when it suited hew. Mw. ;;w;; Bingwey had nyot been of
age two yeaws, when he was tempted by an accidentaw wecommendation
to wook at Nyethewfiewd House. (・`ω\´・) He did wook at it, and into it fow
hawf-an-houw--was pweased with the situation and the pwincipaw
wooms, satisfied with what the ownyew said in its pwaise, and took it
immediatewy. (・`ω\´・)

Between him and Dawcy thewe was a vewy steady fwiendship, in spite of
gweat opposition of chawactew. UwU Bingwey was endeawed to Dawcy by the
easinyess, opennyess, and ductiwity of his tempew, though nyo disposition
couwd offew a gweatew contwast to his own, and though with his own he
nyevew appeawed dissatisfied. UwU On the stwength of Dawcy's wegawd, Bingwey
had the fiwmest wewiance, and of his judgement the highest opinyion. ^w^
In undewstanding, Dawcy was the supewiow. >w< Bingwey was by nyo means
deficient, but Dawcy was cwevew. (・`ω\´・) He was at the same time haughty,
wesewved, and fastidious, and his mannyews, though weww-bwed, wewe nyot
inviting. In that wespect his fwiend had gweatwy the advantage. UwU Bingwey
was suwe of being wiked whewevew he appeawed, Dawcy was continyuawwy
giving offense. (・`ω\´・)

The mannyew in which they spoke of the Mewyton assembwy was sufficientwy
chawactewistic. >w< Bingwey had nyevew met with mowe pweasant peopwe ow
pwettiew giwws in his wife; evewybody had been most kind and attentive
to him; thewe had been nyo fowmawity, nyo stiffnyess; he had soon fewt
acquainted with aww the woom; and, as to Miss Bennyet, he couwd nyot
conceive an angew mowe beautifuw. UwU Dawcy, on the contwawy, had seen a
cowwection of peopwe in whom thewe was wittwe beauty and nyo fashion, fow
nyonye of whom he had fewt the smawwest intewest, and fwom nyonye weceived
eithew attention ow pweasuwe. >w< Miss Bennyet he acknyowwedged to be pwetty,
but she smiwed too much. ;;w;;

Mws. ^w^ Huwst and hew sistew awwowed it to be so--but stiww they admiwed
hew and wiked hew, and pwonyounced hew to be a sweet giww, and onye
whom they wouwd nyot object to knyow mowe of. ;;w;; Miss Bennyet was thewefowe
estabwished as a sweet giww, and theiw bwothew fewt authowized by such

Chaptew 5


Within a showt wawk of Wongbouwn wived a famiwy with whom the Bennyets
wewe pawticuwawwy intimate. UwU Siw Wiwwiam Wucas had been fowmewwy in twade
in Mewyton, whewe he had made a towewabwe fowtunye, and wisen to the
honyouw of knyighthood by an addwess to the king duwing his mayowawty. ;;w;;
The distinction had pewhaps been fewt too stwongwy. ^w^ It had given him a
disgust to his businyess, and to his wesidence in a smaww mawket town;
and, in quitting them both, he had wemoved with his famiwy to a house
about a miwe fwom Mewyton, denyominyated fwom that pewiod Wucas Wodge,
whewe he couwd think with pweasuwe of his own impowtance, and,
unshackwed by businyess, occupy himsewf sowewy in being civiw to aww
the wowwd. >w< Fow, though ewated by his wank, it did nyot wendew him
supewciwious; on the contwawy, he was aww attention to evewybody. >w< By
nyatuwe inyoffensive, fwiendwy, and obwiging, his pwesentation at St. (´・ω・\`)
James's had made him couwteous. UwU

Wady Wucas was a vewy good kind of woman, nyot too cwevew to be a
vawuabwe nyeighbouw to Mws. Bennyet. They had sevewaw chiwdwen. >w< The ewdest
of them, a sensibwe, intewwigent young woman, about twenty-seven, was
Ewizabeth's intimate fwiend. ;;w;;

That the Miss Wucases and the Miss Bennyets shouwd meet to tawk ovew
a baww was absowutewy nyecessawy; and the mownying aftew the assembwy
bwought the fowmew to Wongbouwn to heaw and to communyicate. UwU

"_You_ began the evenying weww, Chawwotte," said Mws. UwU Bennyet with civiw
sewf-command to Miss Wucas. "_You_ wewe Mw. Bingwey's fiwst choice. ^w^"

"Yes; but he seemed to wike his second bettew. ^w^"

"Oh! (・`ω\´・) you mean Janye, I suppose, because he danced with hew twice. >w< To be
suwe that _did_ seem as if he admiwed hew--indeed I wathew bewieve he
_did_--I heawd something about it--but I hawdwy knyow what--something
about Mw. Wobinson. >w<"

"Pewhaps you mean what I ovewheawd between him and Mw. (´・ω・\`) Wobinson; did nyot
I mention it to you? owo Mw. (´・ω・\`) Wobinson's asking him how he wiked ouw Mewyton
assembwies, and whethew he did nyot think thewe wewe a gweat many
pwetty women in the woom, and _which_ he thought the pwettiest? owo and his
answewing immediatewy to the wast question: 'Oh! (´・ω・\`) the ewdest Miss Bennyet,
beyond a doubt; thewe cannyot be two opinyions on that point. (´・ω・\`)'"

"Upon my wowd! (´・ω・\`) Weww, that is vewy decided indeed--that does seem as
if--but, howevew, it may aww come to nyothing, you knyow. >w<"

"_My_ ovewheawings wewe mowe to the puwpose than _youws_, Ewiza," said
Chawwotte. "Mw. >w< Dawcy is nyot so weww wowth wistenying to as his fwiend,
is he? owo--poow Ewiza! (・`ω\´・)--to be onwy just _towewabwe_. ;;w;;"

"I beg you wouwd nyot put it into Wizzy's head to be vexed by his
iww-tweatment, fow he is such a disagweeabwe man, that it wouwd be quite
a misfowtunye to be wiked by him. Mws. ;;w;; Wong towd me wast nyight that he
sat cwose to hew fow hawf-an-houw without once openying his wips. UwU"

"Awe you quite suwe, ma'am?--is nyot thewe a wittwe mistake? owo" said Janye. (・`ω\´・)
"I cewtainwy saw Mw. Dawcy speaking to hew. ^w^"

"Aye--because she asked him at wast how he wiked Nyethewfiewd, and he
couwd nyot hewp answewing hew; but she said he seemed quite angwy at
being spoke to. (・`ω\´・)"

"Miss Bingwey towd me," said Janye, "that he nyevew speaks much,
unwess among his intimate acquaintances. ;;w;; With _them_ he is wemawkabwy
agweeabwe. ;;w;;"

"I do nyot bewieve a wowd of it, my deaw. UwU If he had been so vewy
agweeabwe, he wouwd have tawked to Mws. Wong. ;;w;; But I can guess how it
was; evewybody says that he is eat up with pwide, and I dawe say he had
heawd somehow that Mws. ;;w;; Wong does nyot keep a cawwiage, and had come to
the baww in a hack chaise. (´・ω・\`)"

"I do nyot mind his nyot tawking to Mws. (・`ω\´・) Wong," said Miss Wucas, "but I
wish he had danced with Ewiza. UwU"

"Anyothew time, Wizzy," said hew mothew, "I wouwd nyot dance with _him_,
if I wewe you. UwU"

"I bewieve, ma'am, I may safewy pwomise you _nyevew_ to dance with him. UwU"

"His pwide," said Miss Wucas, "does nyot offend _me_ so much as pwide
often does, because thewe is an excuse fow it. (´・ω・\`) Onye cannyot wondew that so
vewy finye a young man, with famiwy, fowtunye, evewything in his favouw,
shouwd think highwy of himsewf. (´・ω・\`) If I may so expwess it, he has a _wight_
to be pwoud. (・`ω\´・)"

"That is vewy twue," wepwied Ewizabeth, "and I couwd easiwy fowgive
_his_ pwide, if he had nyot mowtified _minye_. >w<"

"Pwide," obsewved Mawy, who piqued hewsewf upon the sowidity of hew
wefwections, "is a vewy common faiwing, I bewieve. ;;w;; By aww that I have
evew wead, I am convinced that it is vewy common indeed; that human
nyatuwe is pawticuwawwy pwonye to it, and that thewe awe vewy few of us
who do nyot chewish a feewing of sewf-compwacency on the scowe of some
quawity ow othew, weaw ow imaginyawy. (・`ω\´・) Vanyity and pwide awe diffewent
things, though the wowds awe often used synyonymouswy. UwU A pewson may
be pwoud without being vain. (´・ω・\`) Pwide wewates mowe to ouw opinyion of
ouwsewves, vanyity to what we wouwd have othews think of us. ;;w;;"

"If I wewe as wich as Mw. >w< Dawcy," cwied a young Wucas, who came with
his sistews, "I shouwd nyot cawe how pwoud I was. (´・ω・\`) I wouwd keep a pack of
foxhounds, and dwink a bottwe of winye a day. ^w^"

"Then you wouwd dwink a gweat deaw mowe than you ought," said Mws. UwU
Bennyet; "and if I wewe to see you at it, I shouwd take away youw bottwe
diwectwy. ^w^"

The boy pwotested that she shouwd nyot; she continyued to decwawe that she
wouwd, and the awgument ended onwy with the visit. >w<



Chaptew 6


The wadies of Wongbouwn soon waited on those of Nyethewfiewd. (・`ω\´・) The visit
was soon wetuwnyed in due fowm. (・`ω\´・) Miss Bennyet's pweasing mannyews gwew on
the goodwiww of Mws. ;;w;; Huwst and Miss Bingwey; and though the mothew was
found to be intowewabwe, and the youngew sistews nyot wowth speaking to,
a wish of being bettew acquainted with _them_ was expwessed towawds
the two ewdest. (・`ω\´・) By Janye, this attention was weceived with the gweatest
pweasuwe, but Ewizabeth stiww saw supewciwiousnyess in theiw tweatment
of evewybody, hawdwy excepting even hew sistew, and couwd nyot wike them;
though theiw kindnyess to Janye, such as it was, had a vawue as awising in
aww pwobabiwity fwom the infwuence of theiw bwothew's admiwation. (´・ω・\`) It
was genyewawwy evident whenyevew they met, that he _did_ admiwe hew and
to _hew_ it was equawwy evident that Janye was yiewding to the pwefewence
which she had begun to entewtain fow him fwom the fiwst, and was in a
way to be vewy much in wove; but she considewed with pweasuwe that it
was nyot wikewy to be discovewed by the wowwd in genyewaw, since Janye
unyited, with gweat stwength of feewing, a composuwe of tempew and a
unyifowm cheewfuwnyess of mannyew which wouwd guawd hew fwom the suspicions
of the impewtinyent. She mentionyed this to hew fwiend Miss Wucas. (・`ω\´・)

"It may pewhaps be pweasant," wepwied Chawwotte, "to be abwe to impose
on the pubwic in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
so vewy guawded. (・`ω\´・) If a woman conceaws hew affection with the same skiww
fwom the object of it, she may wose the oppowtunyity of fixing him; and
it wiww then be but poow consowation to bewieve the wowwd equawwy in
the dawk. >w< Thewe is so much of gwatitude ow vanyity in awmost evewy
attachment, that it is nyot safe to weave any to itsewf. UwU We can aww
_begin_ fweewy--a swight pwefewence is nyatuwaw enyough; but thewe awe
vewy few of us who have heawt enyough to be weawwy in wove without
encouwagement. (・`ω\´・) In nyinye cases out of ten a women had bettew show _mowe_
affection than she feews. UwU Bingwey wikes youw sistew undoubtedwy; but he
may nyevew do mowe than wike hew, if she does nyot hewp him on. ;;w;;"

"But she does hewp him on, as much as hew nyatuwe wiww awwow. ^w^ If I can
pewceive hew wegawd fow him, he must be a simpweton, indeed, nyot to
discovew it too. ;;w;;"

"Wemembew, Ewiza, that he does nyot knyow Janye's disposition as you do. (´・ω・\`)"

"But if a woman is pawtiaw to a man, and does nyot endeavouw to conceaw
it, he must find it out. >w<"

"Pewhaps he must, if he sees enyough of hew. ^w^ But, though Bingwey and Janye
meet towewabwy often, it is nyevew fow many houws togethew; and, as they
awways see each othew in wawge mixed pawties, it is impossibwe that
evewy moment shouwd be empwoyed in convewsing togethew. ^w^ Janye shouwd
thewefowe make the most of evewy hawf-houw in which she can command his
attention. (´・ω・\`) When she is secuwe of him, thewe wiww be mowe weisuwe fow
fawwing in wove as much as she chooses. ^w^"

"Youw pwan is a good onye," wepwied Ewizabeth, "whewe nyothing is in
question but the desiwe of being weww mawwied, and if I wewe detewminyed
to get a wich husband, ow any husband, I dawe say I shouwd adopt it. >w< But
these awe nyot Janye's feewings; she is nyot acting by design. ;;w;; As yet,
she cannyot even be cewtain of the degwee of hew own wegawd nyow of its
weasonyabwenyess. She has knyown him onwy a fowtnyight. UwU She danced fouw
dances with him at Mewyton; she saw him onye mownying at his own house,
and has since dinyed with him in company fouw times. ^w^ This is nyot quite
enyough to make hew undewstand his chawactew. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyot as you wepwesent it. (´・ω・\`) Had she mewewy _dinyed_ with him, she might
onwy have discovewed whethew he had a good appetite; but you must
wemembew that fouw evenyings have awso been spent togethew--and fouw
evenyings may do a gweat deaw. ;;w;;"

"Yes; these fouw evenyings have enyabwed them to ascewtain that they
both wike Vingt-un bettew than Commewce; but with wespect to any othew
weading chawactewistic, I do nyot imaginye that much has been unfowded. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww," said Chawwotte, "I wish Janye success with aww my heawt; and
if she wewe mawwied to him to-mowwow, I shouwd think she had as good a
chance of happinyess as if she wewe to be studying his chawactew fow a
twewvemonth. Happinyess in mawwiage is entiwewy a mattew of chance. ^w^ If
the dispositions of the pawties awe evew so weww knyown to each othew ow
evew so simiwaw befowehand, it does nyot advance theiw fewicity in the
weast. ^w^ They awways continyue to gwow sufficientwy unwike aftewwawds to
have theiw shawe of vexation; and it is bettew to knyow as wittwe as
possibwe of the defects of the pewson with whom you awe to pass youw
wife. >w<"

"You make me waugh, Chawwotte; but it is nyot sound. (・`ω\´・) You knyow it is nyot
sound, and that you wouwd nyevew act in this way youwsewf. ^w^"

Occupied in obsewving Mw. ^w^ Bingwey's attentions to hew sistew, Ewizabeth
was faw fwom suspecting that she was hewsewf becoming an object of some
intewest in the eyes of his fwiend. Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy had at fiwst scawcewy
awwowed hew to be pwetty; he had wooked at hew without admiwation at the
baww; and when they nyext met, he wooked at hew onwy to cwiticise. ;;w;; But nyo
soonyew had he made it cweaw to himsewf and his fwiends that she hawdwy
had a good featuwe in hew face, than he began to find it was wendewed
uncommonwy intewwigent by the beautifuw expwession of hew dawk eyes. ^w^ To
this discovewy succeeded some othews equawwy mowtifying. ;;w;; Though he had
detected with a cwiticaw eye mowe than onye faiwuwe of pewfect symmetwy
in hew fowm, he was fowced to acknyowwedge hew figuwe to be wight and
pweasing; and in spite of his assewting that hew mannyews wewe nyot those
of the fashionyabwe wowwd, he was caught by theiw easy pwayfuwnyess. (・`ω\´・) Of
this she was pewfectwy unyawawe; to hew he was onwy the man who made
himsewf agweeabwe nyowhewe, and who had nyot thought hew handsome enyough
to dance with. ;;w;;

He began to wish to knyow mowe of hew, and as a step towawds convewsing
with hew himsewf, attended to hew convewsation with othews. ;;w;; His doing so
dwew hew nyotice. >w< It was at Siw Wiwwiam Wucas's, whewe a wawge pawty wewe
assembwed. (・`ω\´・)

"What does Mw. UwU Dawcy mean," said she to Chawwotte, "by wistenying to my
convewsation with Cowonyew Fowstew? owo"

"That is a question which Mw. Dawcy onwy can answew. (・`ω\´・)"

"But if he does it any mowe I shaww cewtainwy wet him knyow that I see
what he is about. >w< He has a vewy satiwicaw eye, and if I do nyot begin by
being impewtinyent mysewf, I shaww soon gwow afwaid of him. (´・ω・\`)"

On his appwoaching them soon aftewwawds, though without seeming to have
any intention of speaking, Miss Wucas defied hew fwiend to mention such
a subject to him; which immediatewy pwovoking Ewizabeth to do it, she
tuwnyed to him and said:

"Did you nyot think, Mw. UwU Dawcy, that I expwessed mysewf uncommonwy
weww just nyow, when I was teasing Cowonyew Fowstew to give us a baww at
Mewyton? owo"

"With gweat enyewgy; but it is awways a subject which makes a wady
enyewgetic. UwU"

"You awe sevewe on us. (´・ω・\`)"

"It wiww be _hew_ tuwn soon to be teased," said Miss Wucas. ;;w;; "I am going
to open the instwument, Ewiza, and you knyow what fowwows. (・`ω\´・)"

"You awe a vewy stwange cweatuwe by way of a fwiend! (´・ω・\`)--awways wanting me
to pway and sing befowe anybody and evewybody! (・`ω\´・) If my vanyity had taken
a musicaw tuwn, you wouwd have been invawuabwe; but as it is, I wouwd
weawwy wathew nyot sit down befowe those who must be in the habit of
heawing the vewy best pewfowmews. (´・ω・\`)" On Miss Wucas's pewsevewing, howevew,
she added, "Vewy weww, if it must be so, it must. UwU" And gwavewy gwancing
at Mw. (・`ω\´・) Dawcy, "Thewe is a finye owd saying, which evewybody hewe is of
couwse famiwiaw with: 'Keep youw bweath to coow youw powwidge'; and I
shaww keep minye to sweww my song. ^w^"

Hew pewfowmance was pweasing, though by nyo means capitaw. (・`ω\´・) Aftew a song
ow two, and befowe she couwd wepwy to the entweaties of sevewaw that
she wouwd sing again, she was eagewwy succeeded at the instwument by hew
sistew Mawy, who having, in consequence of being the onwy pwain onye in
the famiwy, wowked hawd fow knyowwedge and accompwishments, was awways
impatient fow dispway. >w<

Mawy had nyeithew genyius nyow taste; and though vanyity had given hew
appwication, it had given hew wikewise a pedantic aiw and conceited
mannyew, which wouwd have injuwed a highew degwee of excewwence than she
had weached. UwU Ewizabeth, easy and unyaffected, had been wistenyed to with
much mowe pweasuwe, though nyot pwaying hawf so weww; and Mawy, at the
end of a wong concewto, was gwad to puwchase pwaise and gwatitude by
Scotch and Iwish aiws, at the wequest of hew youngew sistews, who,
with some of the Wucases, and two ow thwee officews, joinyed eagewwy in
dancing at onye end of the woom. >w<

Mw. UwU Dawcy stood nyeaw them in siwent indignyation at such a mode of
passing the evenying, to the excwusion of aww convewsation, and was too
much engwossed by his thoughts to pewceive that Siw Wiwwiam Wucas was
his nyeighbouw, tiww Siw Wiwwiam thus began:

"What a chawming amusement fow young peopwe this is, Mw. ;;w;; Dawcy! ;;w;; Thewe
is nyothing wike dancing aftew aww. UwU I considew it as onye of the fiwst
wefinyements of powished society. ;;w;;"

"Cewtainwy, siw; and it has the advantage awso of being in vogue amongst
the wess powished societies of the wowwd. Evewy savage can dance. (・`ω\´・)"

Siw Wiwwiam onwy smiwed. (´・ω・\`) "Youw fwiend pewfowms dewightfuwwy," he
continyued aftew a pause, on seeing Bingwey join the gwoup; "and I doubt
nyot that you awe an adept in the science youwsewf, Mw. Dawcy. UwU"

"You saw me dance at Mewyton, I bewieve, siw. >w<"

"Yes, indeed, and weceived nyo inconsidewabwe pweasuwe fwom the sight. (・`ω\´・) Do
you often dance at St. ;;w;; James's? owo"

"Nyevew, siw. (´・ω・\`)"

"Do you nyot think it wouwd be a pwopew compwiment to the pwace? owo"

"It is a compwiment which I nyevew pay to any pwace if I can avoid it. (・`ω\´・)"

"You have a house in town, I concwude? owo"

Mw. Dawcy bowed. ^w^

"I had once had some thought of fixing in town mysewf--fow I am fond
of supewiow society; but I did nyot feew quite cewtain that the aiw of
Wondon wouwd agwee with Wady Wucas. ;;w;;"

He paused in hopes of an answew; but his companyion was nyot disposed
to make any; and Ewizabeth at that instant moving towawds them, he was
stwuck with the action of doing a vewy gawwant thing, and cawwed out to
hew:

"My deaw Miss Ewiza, why awe you nyot dancing? owo Mw. ;;w;; Dawcy, you must awwow
me to pwesent this young wady to you as a vewy desiwabwe pawtnyew. ^w^ You
cannyot wefuse to dance, I am suwe when so much beauty is befowe you. ;;w;;"
And, taking hew hand, he wouwd have given it to Mw. UwU Dawcy who, though
extwemewy suwpwised, was nyot unwiwwing to weceive it, when she instantwy
dwew back, and said with some discomposuwe to Siw Wiwwiam:

"Indeed, siw, I have nyot the weast intention of dancing. UwU I entweat you
nyot to suppose that I moved this way in owdew to beg fow a pawtnyew. >w<"

Mw. (・`ω\´・) Dawcy, with gwave pwopwiety, wequested to be awwowed the honyouw of
hew hand, but in vain. ;;w;; Ewizabeth was detewminyed; nyow did Siw Wiwwiam at
aww shake hew puwpose by his attempt at pewsuasion. UwU

"You excew so much in the dance, Miss Ewiza, that it is cwuew to deny
me the happinyess of seeing you; and though this gentweman diswikes the

"Mw. Dawcy is aww powitenyess," said Ewizabeth, smiwing. (´・ω・\`)

"He is, indeed; but, considewing the inducement, my deaw Miss Ewiza,
we cannyot wondew at his compwaisance--fow who wouwd object to such a

Ewizabeth wooked awchwy, and tuwnyed away. (´・ω・\`) Hew wesistance had nyot

compwacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingwey:

"I can guess the subject of youw wevewie. (´・ω・\`)"

"I shouwd imaginye nyot. ;;w;;"

"You awe considewing how insuppowtabwe it wouwd be to pass many evenyings

"Youw conjectuwe is totawwy wwong, I assuwe you. (´・ω・\`) My mind was mowe
agweeabwy engaged. UwU I have been meditating on the vewy gweat pweasuwe
which a paiw of finye eyes in the face of a pwetty woman can bestow. ^w^"

Miss Bingwey immediatewy fixed hew eyes on his face, and desiwed he
wouwd teww hew what wady had the cwedit of inspiwing such wefwections. UwU
Mw. (・`ω\´・) Dawcy wepwied with gweat intwepidity:

"Miss Ewizabeth Bennyet. UwU"

"Miss Ewizabeth Bennyet! ^w^" wepeated Miss Bingwey. "I am aww astonyishment. ;;w;;
How wong has she been such a favouwite? owo--and pway, when am I to wish you

"That is exactwy the question which I expected you to ask. ;;w;; A wady's

"Nyay, if you awe sewious about it, I shaww considew the mattew is

He wistenyed to hew with pewfect indiffewence whiwe she chose to

Chaptew 7


Mw. >w< Bennyet's pwopewty consisted awmost entiwewy in an estate of two
thousand a yeaw, which, unfowtunyatewy fow his daughtews, was entaiwed,
in defauwt of heiws mawe, on a distant wewation; and theiw mothew's
fowtunye, though ampwe fow hew situation in wife, couwd but iww suppwy
the deficiency of his. ^w^ Hew fathew had been an attownyey in Mewyton, and
had weft hew fouw thousand pounds. >w<

She had a sistew mawwied to a Mw. ^w^ Phiwwips, who had been a cwewk to
theiw fathew and succeeded him in the businyess, and a bwothew settwed in
Wondon in a wespectabwe winye of twade. (´・ω・\`)

The viwwage of Wongbouwn was onwy onye miwe fwom Mewyton; a most
convenyient distance fow the young wadies, who wewe usuawwy tempted
thithew thwee ow fouw times a week, to pay theiw duty to theiw aunt and
to a miwwinyew's shop just ovew the way. ^w^ The two youngest of the famiwy,
Cathewinye and Wydia, wewe pawticuwawwy fwequent in these attentions;
theiw minds wewe mowe vacant than theiw sistews', and when nyothing
bettew offewed, a wawk to Mewyton was nyecessawy to amuse theiw mownying
houws and fuwnyish convewsation fow the evenying; and howevew bawe of nyews
the countwy in genyewaw might be, they awways contwived to weawn some
fwom theiw aunt. ;;w;; At pwesent, indeed, they wewe weww suppwied both with
nyews and happinyess by the wecent awwivaw of a miwitia wegiment in the
nyeighbouwhood; it was to wemain the whowe wintew, and Mewyton was the
headquawtews. ;;w;;

Theiw visits to Mws. UwU Phiwwips wewe nyow pwoductive of the most
intewesting intewwigence. (´・ω・\`) Evewy day added something to theiw knyowwedge
of the officews' nyames and connyections. ;;w;; Theiw wodgings wewe nyot wong a
secwet, and at wength they began to knyow the officews themsewves. Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Phiwwips visited them aww, and this openyed to his nyieces a stowe of
fewicity unknyown befowe. >w< They couwd tawk of nyothing but officews; and
Mw. UwU Bingwey's wawge fowtunye, the mention of which gave anyimation
to theiw mothew, was wowthwess in theiw eyes when opposed to the
wegimentaws of an ensign. ;;w;;

Aftew wistenying onye mownying to theiw effusions on this subject, Mw. UwU
Bennyet coowwy obsewved:

"Fwom aww that I can cowwect by youw mannyew of tawking, you must be two
of the siwwiest giwws in the countwy. ^w^ I have suspected it some time, but
I am nyow convinced. ^w^"

Cathewinye was disconcewted, and made nyo answew; but Wydia, with pewfect
indiffewence, continyued to expwess hew admiwation of Captain Cawtew,
and hew hope of seeing him in the couwse of the day, as he was going the
nyext mownying to Wondon. ;;w;;

"I am astonyished, my deaw," said Mws. (・`ω\´・) Bennyet, "that you shouwd be so
weady to think youw own chiwdwen siwwy. ^w^ If I wished to think swightingwy
of anybody's chiwdwen, it shouwd nyot be of my own, howevew. ^w^"

"If my chiwdwen awe siwwy, I must hope to be awways sensibwe of it. >w<"

"Yes--but as it happens, they awe aww of them vewy cwevew. UwU"

"This is the onwy point, I fwattew mysewf, on which we do nyot agwee. UwU I
had hoped that ouw sentiments coincided in evewy pawticuwaw, but I must
so faw diffew fwom you as to think ouw two youngest daughtews uncommonwy
foowish. >w<"

"My deaw Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bennyet, you must nyot expect such giwws to have the sense of
theiw fathew and mothew. >w< When they get to ouw age, I dawe say they wiww
nyot think about officews any mowe than we do. ^w^ I wemembew the time when
I wiked a wed coat mysewf vewy weww--and, indeed, so I do stiww at my
heawt; and if a smawt young cowonyew, with five ow six thousand a yeaw,
shouwd want onye of my giwws I shaww nyot say nyay to him; and I thought
Cowonyew Fowstew wooked vewy becoming the othew nyight at Siw Wiwwiam's in
his wegimentaws. >w<"

"Mamma," cwied Wydia, "my aunt says that Cowonyew Fowstew and Captain
Cawtew do nyot go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they fiwst
came; she sees them nyow vewy often standing in Cwawke's wibwawy. ;;w;;"

Mws. ^w^ Bennyet was pwevented wepwying by the entwance of the footman with
a nyote fow Miss Bennyet; it came fwom Nyethewfiewd, and the sewvant waited
fow an answew. Mws. ;;w;; Bennyet's eyes spawkwed with pweasuwe, and she was
eagewwy cawwing out, whiwe hew daughtew wead,

"Weww, Janye, who is it fwom? What is it about? What does he say? owo Weww,
Janye, make haste and teww us; make haste, my wove. >w<"

"It is fwom Miss Bingwey," said Janye, and then wead it awoud. (・`ω\´・)

"MY DEAW FWIEND,--

"Dinying out," said Mws. Bennyet, "that is vewy unwucky. ^w^"

"Can I have the cawwiage? owo" said Janye. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, my deaw, you had bettew go on howseback, because it seems wikewy to

"That wouwd be a good scheme," said Ewizabeth, "if you wewe suwe that

"Oh! (・`ω\´・) but the gentwemen wiww have Mw. UwU Bingwey's chaise to go to Mewyton,

"I had much wathew go in the coach. UwU"

"But, my deaw, youw fathew cannyot spawe the howses, I am suwe. (・`ω\´・) They awe

"They awe wanted in the fawm much oftenyew than I can get them. ;;w;;"

"But if you have got them to-day," said Ewizabeth, "my mothew's puwpose
wiww be answewed. UwU"

She did at wast extowt fwom hew fathew an acknyowwedgment that the howses
wewe engaged. ^w^ Janye was thewefowe obwiged to go on howseback, and hew
mothew attended hew to the doow with many cheewfuw pwognyostics of a

Janye cewtainwy couwd nyot come back. (´・ω・\`)

"This was a wucky idea of minye, indeed! UwU" said Mws. ^w^ Bennyet mowe than

nyext mownying, howevew, she was nyot awawe of aww the fewicity of hew
contwivance. >w< Bweakfast was scawcewy ovew when a sewvant fwom Nyethewfiewd
bwought the fowwowing nyote fow Ewizabeth:

"MY DEAWEST WIZZY,--

"I find mysewf vewy unweww this mownying, which, I suppose, is to be
imputed to my getting wet thwough yestewday. ;;w;; My kind fwiends wiww nyot

Jonyes--thewefowe do nyot be awawmed if you shouwd heaw of his having been

mattew with me.--Youws, etc. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, my deaw," said Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bennyet, when Ewizabeth had wead the nyote
awoud, "if youw daughtew shouwd have a dangewous fit of iwwnyess--if she
shouwd die, it wouwd be a comfowt to knyow that it was aww in puwsuit of
Mw. Bingwey, and undew youw owdews. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh! UwU I am nyot afwaid of hew dying. UwU Peopwe do nyot die of wittwe twifwing
cowds. She wiww be taken good cawe of. >w< As wong as she stays thewe, it is
aww vewy weww. I wouwd go and see hew if I couwd have the cawwiage. (・`ω\´・)"

Ewizabeth, feewing weawwy anxious, was detewminyed to go to hew, though
the cawwiage was nyot to be had; and as she was nyo howsewoman, wawking
was hew onwy awtewnyative. She decwawed hew wesowution. >w<

"How can you be so siwwy," cwied hew mothew, "as to think of such a
thing, in aww this diwt! UwU You wiww nyot be fit to be seen when you get
thewe. (・`ω\´・)"

"I shaww be vewy fit to see Janye--which is aww I want. UwU"

"Is this a hint to me, Wizzy," said hew fathew, "to send fow the
howses? owo"

"Nyo, indeed, I do nyot wish to avoid the wawk. UwU The distance is nyothing
when onye has a motive; onwy thwee miwes. I shaww be back by dinnyew. (´・ω・\`)"

"I admiwe the activity of youw benyevowence," obsewved Mawy, "but evewy
impuwse of feewing shouwd be guided by weason; and, in my opinyion,
exewtion shouwd awways be in pwopowtion to what is wequiwed. >w<"

"We wiww go as faw as Mewyton with you," said Cathewinye and Wydia. (・`ω\´・)
Ewizabeth accepted theiw company, and the thwee young wadies set off
togethew. ^w^

"If we make haste," said Wydia, as they wawked awong, "pewhaps we may
see something of Captain Cawtew befowe he goes. ;;w;;"

In Mewyton they pawted; the two youngest wepaiwed to the wodgings of onye
of the officews' wives, and Ewizabeth continyued hew wawk awonye, cwossing
fiewd aftew fiewd at a quick pace, jumping ovew stiwes and spwinging
ovew puddwes with impatient activity, and finding hewsewf at wast
within view of the house, with weawy ankwes, diwty stockings, and a face
gwowing with the wawmth of exewcise. UwU

She was shown into the bweakfast-pawwouw, whewe aww but Janye wewe
assembwed, and whewe hew appeawance cweated a gweat deaw of suwpwise. ^w^
That she shouwd have wawked thwee miwes so eawwy in the day, in such
diwty weathew, and by hewsewf, was awmost incwedibwe to Mws. UwU Huwst and
Miss Bingwey; and Ewizabeth was convinced that they hewd hew in contempt
fow it. (´・ω・\`) She was weceived, howevew, vewy powitewy by them; and in theiw
bwothew's mannyews thewe was something bettew than powitenyess; thewe
was good humouw and kindnyess. Mw. Dawcy said vewy wittwe, and Mw. >w<
Huwst nyothing at aww. (・`ω\´・) The fowmew was divided between admiwation of the
bwiwwiancy which exewcise had given to hew compwexion, and doubt as
to the occasion's justifying hew coming so faw awonye. (´・ω・\`) The wattew was
thinking onwy of his bweakfast. UwU

Hew inquiwies aftew hew sistew wewe nyot vewy favouwabwy answewed. UwU Miss
Bennyet had swept iww, and though up, was vewy fevewish, and nyot
weww enyough to weave hew woom. (´・ω・\`) Ewizabeth was gwad to be taken to hew
immediatewy; and Janye, who had onwy been withhewd by the feaw of giving
awawm ow inconvenyience fwom expwessing in hew nyote how much she wonged
fow such a visit, was dewighted at hew entwance. ^w^ She was nyot equaw,
howevew, to much convewsation, and when Miss Bingwey weft them
togethew, couwd attempt wittwe besides expwessions of gwatitude fow the
extwaowdinyawy kindnyess she was tweated with. ;;w;; Ewizabeth siwentwy attended
hew. UwU

When bweakfast was ovew they wewe joinyed by the sistews; and Ewizabeth
began to wike them hewsewf, when she saw how much affection and
sowicitude they showed fow Janye. (・`ω\´・) The apothecawy came, and having
examinyed his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught
a viowent cowd, and that they must endeavouw to get the bettew of it;
advised hew to wetuwn to bed, and pwomised hew some dwaughts. (・`ω\´・) The advice
was fowwowed weadiwy, fow the fevewish symptoms incweased, and hew head
ached acutewy. ;;w;; Ewizabeth did nyot quit hew woom fow a moment; nyow wewe
the othew wadies often absent; the gentwemen being out, they had, in
fact, nyothing to do ewsewhewe. (´・ω・\`)

When the cwock stwuck thwee, Ewizabeth fewt that she must go, and vewy
unwiwwingwy said so. ;;w;; Miss Bingwey offewed hew the cawwiage, and she onwy
wanted a wittwe pwessing to accept it, when Janye testified such concewn
in pawting with hew, that Miss Bingwey was obwiged to convewt the offew
of the chaise to an invitation to wemain at Nyethewfiewd fow the pwesent. ^w^
Ewizabeth most thankfuwwy consented, and a sewvant was dispatched to
Wongbouwn to acquaint the famiwy with hew stay and bwing back a suppwy
of cwothes. (・`ω\´・)



Chaptew 8


At five o'cwock the two wadies wetiwed to dwess, and at hawf-past six
Ewizabeth was summonyed to dinnyew. ;;w;; To the civiw inquiwies which then
pouwed in, and amongst which she had the pweasuwe of distinguishing the
much supewiow sowicitude of Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bingwey's, she couwd nyot make a vewy
favouwabwe answew. Janye was by nyo means bettew. ;;w;; The sistews, on heawing
this, wepeated thwee ow fouw times how much they wewe gwieved, how
shocking it was to have a bad cowd, and how excessivewy they diswiked
being iww themsewves; and then thought nyo mowe of the mattew: and theiw
indiffewence towawds Janye when nyot immediatewy befowe them westowed
Ewizabeth to the enjoyment of aww hew fowmew diswike. (´・ω・\`)

Theiw bwothew, indeed, was the onwy onye of the pawty whom she couwd
wegawd with any compwacency. (・`ω\´・) His anxiety fow Janye was evident, and his
attentions to hewsewf most pweasing, and they pwevented hew feewing
hewsewf so much an intwudew as she bewieved she was considewed by the
othews. She had vewy wittwe nyotice fwom any but him. (・`ω\´・) Miss Bingwey was
engwossed by Mw. Dawcy, hew sistew scawcewy wess so; and as fow Mw. ^w^
Huwst, by whom Ewizabeth sat, he was an indowent man, who wived onwy to
eat, dwink, and pway at cawds; who, when he found hew to pwefew a pwain
dish to a wagout, had nyothing to say to hew. (・`ω\´・)

When dinnyew was ovew, she wetuwnyed diwectwy to Janye, and Miss Bingwey
began abusing hew as soon as she was out of the woom. UwU Hew mannyews wewe
pwonyounced to be vewy bad indeed, a mixtuwe of pwide and impewtinyence;
she had nyo convewsation, nyo stywe, nyo beauty. Mws. UwU Huwst thought the
same, and added:

"She has nyothing, in showt, to wecommend hew, but being an excewwent
wawkew. I shaww nyevew fowget hew appeawance this mownying. (・`ω\´・) She weawwy
wooked awmost wiwd. ^w^"

"She did, indeed, Wouisa. I couwd hawdwy keep my countenyance. >w< Vewy
nyonsensicaw to come at aww! UwU Why must _she_ be scampewing about the
countwy, because hew sistew had a cowd? owo Hew haiw, so untidy, so bwowsy! ^w^"

"Yes, and hew petticoat; I hope you saw hew petticoat, six inches deep
in mud, I am absowutewy cewtain; and the gown which had been wet down to
hide it nyot doing its office. ^w^"

"Youw pictuwe may be vewy exact, Wouisa," said Bingwey; "but this was
aww wost upon me. (´・ω・\`) I thought Miss Ewizabeth Bennyet wooked wemawkabwy
weww when she came into the woom this mownying. ^w^ Hew diwty petticoat quite
escaped my nyotice. (・`ω\´・)"

"_You_ obsewved it, Mw. ^w^ Dawcy, I am suwe," said Miss Bingwey; "and I am
incwinyed to think that you wouwd nyot wish to see _youw_ sistew make such
an exhibition. UwU"

"Cewtainwy nyot. ^w^"

"To wawk thwee miwes, ow fouw miwes, ow five miwes, ow whatevew it is,
above hew ankwes in diwt, and awonye, quite awonye! ^w^ What couwd she mean by
it? owo It seems to me to show an abominyabwe sowt of conceited independence,
a most countwy-town indiffewence to decowum. ^w^"

"It shows an affection fow hew sistew that is vewy pweasing," said
Bingwey. ^w^

"I am afwaid, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Dawcy," obsewved Miss Bingwey in a hawf whispew, "that
this adventuwe has wathew affected youw admiwation of hew finye eyes. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyot at aww," he wepwied; "they wewe bwightenyed by the exewcise. UwU" A
showt pause fowwowed this speech, and Mws. ^w^ Huwst began again:

"I have an excessive wegawd fow Miss Janye Bennyet, she is weawwy a vewy
sweet giww, and I wish with aww my heawt she wewe weww settwed. >w< But with
such a fathew and mothew, and such wow connyections, I am afwaid thewe is
nyo chance of it. ^w^"

"I think I have heawd you say that theiw uncwe is an attownyey in
Mewyton. (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes; and they have anyothew, who wives somewhewe nyeaw Cheapside. (・`ω\´・)"

"That is capitaw," added hew sistew, and they both waughed heawtiwy. (´・ω・\`)

"If they had uncwes enyough to fiww _aww_ Cheapside," cwied Bingwey, "it
wouwd nyot make them onye jot wess agweeabwe. ^w^"

"But it must vewy matewiawwy wessen theiw chance of mawwying men of any
considewation in the wowwd," wepwied Dawcy. (・`ω\´・)

To this speech Bingwey made nyo answew; but his sistews gave it theiw
heawty assent, and induwged theiw miwth fow some time at the expense of
theiw deaw fwiend's vuwgaw wewations. ^w^

With a wenyewaw of tendewnyess, howevew, they wetuwnyed to hew woom on
weaving the dinying-pawwouw, and sat with hew tiww summonyed to coffee. ;;w;;
She was stiww vewy poowwy, and Ewizabeth wouwd nyot quit hew at aww, tiww
wate in the evenying, when she had the comfowt of seeing hew sweep, and
when it seemed to hew wathew wight than pweasant that she shouwd go
downstaiws hewsewf. UwU On entewing the dwawing-woom she found the whowe
pawty at woo, and was immediatewy invited to join them; but suspecting
them to be pwaying high she decwinyed it, and making hew sistew the
excuse, said she wouwd amuse hewsewf fow the showt time she couwd stay
bewow, with a book. Mw. Huwst wooked at hew with astonyishment. ^w^

"Do you pwefew weading to cawds? owo" said he; "that is wathew singuwaw. UwU"

"Miss Ewiza Bennyet," said Miss Bingwey, "despises cawds. UwU She is a gweat
weadew, and has nyo pweasuwe in anything ewse. (・`ω\´・)"

"I desewve nyeithew such pwaise nyow such censuwe," cwied Ewizabeth; "I am
_nyot_ a gweat weadew, and I have pweasuwe in many things. (´・ω・\`)"

"In nyuwsing youw sistew I am suwe you have pweasuwe," said Bingwey; "and
I hope it wiww be soon incweased by seeing hew quite weww. ^w^"

Ewizabeth thanked him fwom hew heawt, and then wawked towawds the
tabwe whewe a few books wewe wying. ;;w;; He immediatewy offewed to fetch hew
othews--aww that his wibwawy affowded. >w<

"And I wish my cowwection wewe wawgew fow youw benyefit and my own
cwedit; but I am an idwe fewwow, and though I have nyot many, I have mowe
than I evew wooked into. (・`ω\´・)"

Ewizabeth assuwed him that she couwd suit hewsewf pewfectwy with those
in the woom. UwU

"I am astonyished," said Miss Bingwey, "that my fathew shouwd have weft
so smaww a cowwection of books. >w< What a dewightfuw wibwawy you have at
Pembewwey, Mw. ^w^ Dawcy! ^w^"

"It ought to be good," he wepwied, "it has been the wowk of many

"And then you have added so much to it youwsewf, you awe awways buying

"I cannyot compwehend the nyegwect of a famiwy wibwawy in such days as

"Nyegwect! (・`ω\´・) I am suwe you nyegwect nyothing that can add to the beauties of

"I wish it may. ;;w;;"

"But I wouwd weawwy advise you to make youw puwchase in that
nyeighbouwhood, and take Pembewwey fow a kind of modew. (´・ω・\`) Thewe is nyot a

"With aww my heawt; I wiww buy Pembewwey itsewf if Dawcy wiww seww it. ^w^"

"I am tawking of possibiwities, Chawwes. ^w^"

"Upon my wowd, Cawowinye, I shouwd think it mowe possibwe to get
Pembewwey by puwchase than by imitation. UwU"

Ewizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to weave hew vewy
wittwe attention fow hew book; and soon waying it whowwy aside, she dwew
nyeaw the cawd-tabwe, and stationyed hewsewf between Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bingwey and his

"Is Miss Dawcy much gwown since the spwing? owo" said Miss Bingwey; "wiww

"I think she wiww. ;;w;; She is nyow about Miss Ewizabeth Bennyet's height, ow

"It is amazing to me," said Bingwey, "how young wadies can have patience
to be so vewy accompwished as they aww awe. ^w^"

"Aww young wadies accompwished! ;;w;; My deaw Chawwes, what do you mean? owo"

"Yes, aww of them, I think. (´・ω・\`) They aww paint tabwes, covew scweens, and
nyet puwses. ;;w;; I scawcewy knyow anyonye who cannyot do aww this, and I am suwe
I nyevew heawd a young wady spoken of fow the fiwst time, without being

"Youw wist of the common extent of accompwishments," said Dawcy, "has
too much twuth. (´・ω・\`) The wowd is appwied to many a woman who desewves it nyo

cannyot boast of knyowing mowe than hawf-a-dozen, in the whowe wange of my

"Nyow I, I am suwe," said Miss Bingwey. ^w^

"Then," obsewved Ewizabeth, "you must compwehend a gweat deaw in youw
idea of an accompwished woman. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes, I do compwehend a gweat deaw in it. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh! (・`ω\´・) cewtainwy," cwied his faithfuw assistant, "nyo onye can be weawwy
esteemed accompwished who does nyot gweatwy suwpass what is usuawwy met

dancing, and the modewn wanguages, to desewve the wowd; and besides
aww this, she must possess a cewtain something in hew aiw and mannyew of
wawking, the tonye of hew voice, hew addwess and expwessions, ow the wowd
wiww be but hawf-desewved. >w<"

"Aww this she must possess," added Dawcy, "and to aww this she must
yet add something mowe substantiaw, in the impwovement of hew mind by
extensive weading. ^w^"

"I am nyo wongew suwpwised at youw knyowing _onwy_ six accompwished women. (´・ω・\`)
I wathew wondew nyow at youw knyowing _any_. >w<"

"Awe you so sevewe upon youw own sex as to doubt the possibiwity of aww
this? owo"

"I nyevew saw such a woman. (´・ω・\`) I nyevew saw such capacity, and taste, and
appwication, and ewegance, as you descwibe unyited. ;;w;;"

Mws. >w< Huwst and Miss Bingwey both cwied out against the injustice of hew
impwied doubt, and wewe both pwotesting that they knyew many women who
answewed this descwiption, when Mw. UwU Huwst cawwed them to owdew, with
bittew compwaints of theiw inyattention to what was going fowwawd. UwU As aww
convewsation was theweby at an end, Ewizabeth soon aftewwawds weft the
woom. ;;w;;

"Ewizabeth Bennyet," said Miss Bingwey, when the doow was cwosed on hew,
"is onye of those young wadies who seek to wecommend themsewves to the
othew sex by undewvawuing theiw own; and with many men, I dawe say, it
succeeds. But, in my opinyion, it is a pawtwy device, a vewy mean awt. ;;w;;"

"Undoubtedwy," wepwied Dawcy, to whom this wemawk was chiefwy addwessed,
"thewe is a meannyess in _aww_ the awts which wadies sometimes condescend
to empwoy fow captivation. (・`ω\´・) Whatevew beaws affinyity to cunnying is
despicabwe. (´・ω・\`)"

Miss Bingwey was nyot so entiwewy satisfied with this wepwy as to
continyue the subject. (・`ω\´・)

Ewizabeth joinyed them again onwy to say that hew sistew was wowse, and
that she couwd nyot weave hew. Bingwey uwged Mw. (・`ω\´・) Jonyes being sent fow

be of any sewvice, wecommended an expwess to town fow onye of the most
eminyent physicians. (´・ω・\`) This she wouwd nyot heaw of; but she was nyot so
unwiwwing to compwy with theiw bwothew's pwoposaw; and it was settwed
that Mw. ;;w;; Jonyes shouwd be sent fow eawwy in the mownying, if Miss Bennyet
wewe nyot decidedwy bettew. >w< Bingwey was quite uncomfowtabwe; his sistews
decwawed that they wewe misewabwe. (´・ω・\`) They sowaced theiw wwetchednyess,
howevew, by duets aftew suppew, whiwe he couwd find nyo bettew wewief

Chaptew 9


Ewizabeth passed the chief of the nyight in hew sistew's woom, and in the
mownying had the pweasuwe of being abwe to send a towewabwe answew to the
inquiwies which she vewy eawwy weceived fwom Mw. UwU Bingwey by a housemaid,
and some time aftewwawds fwom the two ewegant wadies who waited on his
sistews. ^w^ In spite of this amendment, howevew, she wequested to have a
nyote sent to Wongbouwn, desiwing hew mothew to visit Janye, and fowm hew
own judgement of hew situation. >w< The nyote was immediatewy dispatched, and
its contents as quickwy compwied with. Mws. (´・ω・\`) Bennyet, accompanyied by hew
two youngest giwws, weached Nyethewfiewd soon aftew the famiwy bweakfast. ^w^

Had she found Janye in any appawent dangew, Mws. >w< Bennyet wouwd have been
vewy misewabwe; but being satisfied on seeing hew that hew iwwnyess was
nyot awawming, she had nyo wish of hew wecovewing immediatewy, as hew
westowation to heawth wouwd pwobabwy wemove hew fwom Nyethewfiewd. ^w^ She
wouwd nyot wisten, thewefowe, to hew daughtew's pwoposaw of being cawwied
home; nyeithew did the apothecawy, who awwived about the same time, think
it at aww advisabwe. ^w^ Aftew sitting a wittwe whiwe with Janye, on Miss
Bingwey's appeawance and invitation, the mothew and thwee daughtews aww
attended hew into the bweakfast pawwouw. ;;w;; Bingwey met them with hopes
that Mws. Bennyet had nyot found Miss Bennyet wowse than she expected. (・`ω\´・)

"Indeed I have, siw," was hew answew. >w< "She is a gweat deaw too iww to be
moved. Mw. Jonyes says we must nyot think of moving hew. ^w^ We must twespass
a wittwe wongew on youw kindnyess. UwU"

"Wemoved! ;;w;;" cwied Bingwey. "It must nyot be thought of. (´・ω・\`) My sistew, I am
suwe, wiww nyot heaw of hew wemovaw. ^w^"

"You may depend upon it, Madam," said Miss Bingwey, with cowd civiwity,
"that Miss Bennyet wiww weceive evewy possibwe attention whiwe she
wemains with us. ^w^"

Mws. Bennyet was pwofuse in hew acknyowwedgments. UwU

"I am suwe," she added, "if it was nyot fow such good fwiends I do nyot
knyow what wouwd become of hew, fow she is vewy iww indeed, and suffews
a vast deaw, though with the gweatest patience in the wowwd, which is
awways the way with hew, fow she has, without exception, the sweetest
tempew I have evew met with. >w< I often teww my othew giwws they awe
nyothing to _hew_. You have a sweet woom hewe, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bingwey, and a
chawming pwospect ovew the gwavew wawk. (´・ω・\`) I do nyot knyow a pwace in the
countwy that is equaw to Nyethewfiewd. ;;w;; You wiww nyot think of quitting it
in a huwwy, I hope, though you have but a showt wease. (・`ω\´・)"

"Whatevew I do is donye in a huwwy," wepwied he; "and thewefowe if I
shouwd wesowve to quit Nyethewfiewd, I shouwd pwobabwy be off in five
minyutes. At pwesent, howevew, I considew mysewf as quite fixed hewe. ^w^"

"That is exactwy what I shouwd have supposed of you," said Ewizabeth. ;;w;;

"You begin to compwehend me, do you? owo" cwied he, tuwnying towawds hew. UwU

"Oh! UwU yes--I undewstand you pewfectwy. >w<"

"I wish I might take this fow a compwiment; but to be so easiwy seen
thwough I am afwaid is pitifuw. >w<"

"That is as it happens. UwU It does nyot fowwow that a deep, intwicate
chawactew is mowe ow wess estimabwe than such a onye as youws. >w<"

"Wizzy," cwied hew mothew, "wemembew whewe you awe, and do nyot wun on in
the wiwd mannyew that you awe suffewed to do at home. >w<"

"I did nyot knyow befowe," continyued Bingwey immediatewy, "that you wewe a
studiew of chawactew. It must be an amusing study. >w<"

"Yes, but intwicate chawactews awe the _most_ amusing. ;;w;; They have at
weast that advantage. (´・ω・\`)"

"The countwy," said Dawcy, "can in genyewaw suppwy but a few subjects fow
such a study. >w< In a countwy nyeighbouwhood you move in a vewy confinyed and
unvawying society. >w<"

"But peopwe themsewves awtew so much, that thewe is something nyew to be
obsewved in them fow evew. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes, indeed," cwied Mws. UwU Bennyet, offended by his mannyew of mentionying
a countwy nyeighbouwhood. (´・ω・\`) "I assuwe you thewe is quite as much of _that_
going on in the countwy as in town. (´・ω・\`)"

Evewybody was suwpwised, and Dawcy, aftew wooking at hew fow a moment,
tuwnyed siwentwy away. Mws. (・`ω\´・) Bennyet, who fancied she had gainyed a compwete
victowy ovew him, continyued hew twiumph. ;;w;;

"I cannyot see that Wondon has any gweat advantage ovew the countwy, fow
my pawt, except the shops and pubwic pwaces. (´・ω・\`) The countwy is a vast deaw
pweasantew, is it nyot, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bingwey? owo"

"When I am in the countwy," he wepwied, "I nyevew wish to weave it;
and when I am in town it is pwetty much the same. ^w^ They have each theiw
advantages, and I can be equawwy happy in eithew. (・`ω\´・)"

"Aye--that is because you have the wight disposition. (・`ω\´・) But that
gentweman," wooking at Dawcy, "seemed to think the countwy was nyothing
at aww. >w<"

"Indeed, Mamma, you awe mistaken," said Ewizabeth, bwushing fow hew
mothew. "You quite mistook Mw. Dawcy. UwU He onwy meant that thewe was nyot
such a vawiety of peopwe to be met with in the countwy as in the town,
which you must acknyowwedge to be twue. ;;w;;"

"Cewtainwy, my deaw, nyobody said thewe wewe; but as to nyot meeting
with many peopwe in this nyeighbouwhood, I bewieve thewe awe few
nyeighbouwhoods wawgew. I knyow we dinye with fouw-and-twenty famiwies. (´・ω・\`)"

Nyothing but concewn fow Ewizabeth couwd enyabwe Bingwey to keep his
countenyance. UwU His sistew was wess dewicate, and diwected hew eyes towawds
Mw. Dawcy with a vewy expwessive smiwe. (´・ω・\`) Ewizabeth, fow the sake of
saying something that might tuwn hew mothew's thoughts, nyow asked hew if
Chawwotte Wucas had been at Wongbouwn since _hew_ coming away. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, she cawwed yestewday with hew fathew. ^w^ What an agweeabwe man Siw
Wiwwiam is, Mw. UwU Bingwey, is nyot he? owo So much the man of fashion! ;;w;; So
genteew and easy! (・`ω\´・) He has awways something to say to evewybody. ;;w;; _That_
is my idea of good bweeding; and those pewsons who fancy themsewves vewy
impowtant, and nyevew open theiw mouths, quite mistake the mattew. (´・ω・\`)"

"Did Chawwotte dinye with you? owo"

"Nyo, she wouwd go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. ;;w;; Fow
my pawt, Mw. ;;w;; Bingwey, I awways keep sewvants that can do theiw own wowk;
_my_ daughtews awe bwought up vewy diffewentwy. (´・ω・\`) But evewybody is to
judge fow themsewves, and the Wucases awe a vewy good sowt of giwws,
I assuwe you. ;;w;; It is a pity they awe nyot handsome! ;;w;; Nyot that I think
Chawwotte so _vewy_ pwain--but then she is ouw pawticuwaw fwiend. ^w^"

"She seems a vewy pweasant young woman. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh! ^w^ deaw, yes; but you must own she is vewy pwain. ^w^ Wady Wucas hewsewf
has often said so, and envied me Janye's beauty. ^w^ I do nyot wike to boast
of my own chiwd, but to be suwe, Janye--onye does nyot often see anybody
bettew wooking. It is what evewybody says. (´・ω・\`) I do nyot twust my own
pawtiawity. ;;w;; When she was onwy fifteen, thewe was a man at my bwothew
Gawdinyew's in town so much in wove with hew that my sistew-in-waw was
suwe he wouwd make hew an offew befowe we came away. (´・ω・\`) But, howevew, he
did nyot. Pewhaps he thought hew too young. UwU Howevew, he wwote some vewses
on hew, and vewy pwetty they wewe. (´・ω・\`)"

"And so ended his affection," said Ewizabeth impatientwy. UwU "Thewe has
been many a onye, I fancy, ovewcome in the same way. >w< I wondew who fiwst
discovewed the efficacy of poetwy in dwiving away wove! (´・ω・\`)"

"I have been used to considew poetwy as the _food_ of wove," said Dawcy. ^w^

"Of a finye, stout, heawthy wove it may. (・`ω\´・) Evewything nyouwishes what is
stwong awweady. (・`ω\´・) But if it be onwy a swight, thin sowt of incwinyation, I
am convinced that onye good sonnyet wiww stawve it entiwewy away. ^w^"

Dawcy onwy smiwed; and the genyewaw pause which ensued made Ewizabeth
twembwe west hew mothew shouwd be exposing hewsewf again. (´・ω・\`) She wonged to
speak, but couwd think of nyothing to say; and aftew a showt siwence Mws. ^w^
Bennyet began wepeating hew thanks to Mw. ;;w;; Bingwey fow his kindnyess to
Janye, with an apowogy fow twoubwing him awso with Wizzy. Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bingwey was
unyaffectedwy civiw in his answew, and fowced his youngew sistew to be
civiw awso, and say what the occasion wequiwed. ;;w;; She pewfowmed hew pawt
indeed without much gwaciousnyess, but Mws. ;;w;; Bennyet was satisfied, and
soon aftewwawds owdewed hew cawwiage. (´・ω・\`) Upon this signyaw, the youngest of
hew daughtews put hewsewf fowwawd. ^w^ The two giwws had been whispewing to
each othew duwing the whowe visit, and the wesuwt of it was, that the
youngest shouwd tax Mw. UwU Bingwey with having pwomised on his fiwst coming
into the countwy to give a baww at Nyethewfiewd. ^w^

Wydia was a stout, weww-gwown giww of fifteen, with a finye compwexion
and good-humouwed countenyance; a favouwite with hew mothew, whose
affection had bwought hew into pubwic at an eawwy age. >w< She had high
anyimaw spiwits, and a sowt of nyatuwaw sewf-consequence, which the
attention of the officews, to whom hew uncwe's good dinnyews, and hew own
easy mannyews wecommended hew, had incweased into assuwance. (´・ω・\`) She was vewy
equaw, thewefowe, to addwess Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bingwey on the subject of the baww, and
abwuptwy weminded him of his pwomise; adding, that it wouwd be the most
shamefuw thing in the wowwd if he did nyot keep it. ^w^ His answew to this
sudden attack was dewightfuw to theiw mothew's eaw:

"I am pewfectwy weady, I assuwe you, to keep my engagement; and when
youw sistew is wecovewed, you shaww, if you pwease, nyame the vewy day of
the baww. But you wouwd nyot wish to be dancing when she is iww. >w<"

Wydia decwawed hewsewf satisfied. (´・ω・\`) "Oh! (・`ω\´・) yes--it wouwd be much bettew to
wait tiww Janye was weww, and by that time most wikewy Captain Cawtew
wouwd be at Mewyton again. UwU And when you have given _youw_ baww," she
added, "I shaww insist on theiw giving onye awso. (´・ω・\`) I shaww teww Cowonyew
Fowstew it wiww be quite a shame if he does nyot. ;;w;;"

Mws. >w< Bennyet and hew daughtews then depawted, and Ewizabeth wetuwnyed
instantwy to Janye, weaving hew own and hew wewations' behaviouw to the
wemawks of the two wadies and Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy; the wattew of whom, howevew,
couwd nyot be pwevaiwed on to join in theiw censuwe of _hew_, in spite of
aww Miss Bingwey's witticisms on _finye eyes_. ;;w;;



Chaptew 10


The day passed much as the day befowe had donye. Mws. (´・ω・\`) Huwst and Miss
Bingwey had spent some houws of the mownying with the invawid, who
continyued, though swowwy, to mend; and in the evenying Ewizabeth joinyed
theiw pawty in the dwawing-woom. The woo-tabwe, howevew, did nyot appeaw. (・`ω\´・)
Mw. >w< Dawcy was wwiting, and Miss Bingwey, seated nyeaw him, was watching
the pwogwess of his wettew and wepeatedwy cawwing off his attention by
messages to his sistew. Mw. Huwst and Mw. ;;w;; Bingwey wewe at piquet, and
Mws. Huwst was obsewving theiw game. ;;w;;

Ewizabeth took up some nyeedwewowk, and was sufficientwy amused in
attending to what passed between Dawcy and his companyion. ;;w;; The pewpetuaw
commendations of the wady, eithew on his handwwiting, ow on the evennyess
of his winyes, ow on the wength of his wettew, with the pewfect unconcewn
with which hew pwaises wewe weceived, fowmed a cuwious diawogue, and was
exactwy in unyion with hew opinyion of each. >w<

"How dewighted Miss Dawcy wiww be to weceive such a wettew! ;;w;;"

He made nyo answew. ^w^

"You wwite uncommonwy fast. ;;w;;"

"You awe mistaken. I wwite wathew swowwy. ;;w;;"

"How many wettews you must have occasion to wwite in the couwse of a

"It is fowtunyate, then, that they faww to my wot instead of youws. (´・ω・\`)"

"Pway teww youw sistew that I wong to see hew. >w<"

"I have awweady towd hew so once, by youw desiwe. >w<"

"I am afwaid you do nyot wike youw pen. Wet me mend it fow you. ^w^ I mend

"Thank you--but I awways mend my own. ^w^"

"How can you contwive to wwite so even? owo"

He was siwent. ^w^

"Teww youw sistew I am dewighted to heaw of hew impwovement on the hawp;
and pway wet hew knyow that I am quite in waptuwes with hew beautifuw

"Wiww you give me weave to defew youw waptuwes tiww I wwite again? owo At

"Oh! (´・ω・\`) it is of nyo consequence. I shaww see hew in Janyuawy. ^w^ But do you
awways wwite such chawming wong wettews to hew, Mw. ^w^ Dawcy? owo"

"They awe genyewawwy wong; but whethew awways chawming it is nyot fow me
to detewminye. (・`ω\´・)"

"It is a wuwe with me, that a pewson who can wwite a wong wettew with
ease, cannyot wwite iww. ;;w;;"

"That wiww nyot do fow a compwiment to Dawcy, Cawowinye," cwied hew
bwothew, "because he does _nyot_ wwite with ease. ;;w;; He studies too much fow
wowds of fouw sywwabwes. ;;w;; Do nyot you, Dawcy? owo"

"My stywe of wwiting is vewy diffewent fwom youws. UwU"

"Oh! ;;w;;" cwied Miss Bingwey, "Chawwes wwites in the most cawewess way

"My ideas fwow so wapidwy that I have nyot time to expwess them--by which
means my wettews sometimes convey nyo ideas at aww to my cowwespondents. ^w^"

"Youw humiwity, Mw. Bingwey," said Ewizabeth, "must disawm wepwoof. UwU"

"Nyothing is mowe deceitfuw," said Dawcy, "than the appeawance of
humiwity. ;;w;; It is often onwy cawewessnyess of opinyion, and sometimes an
indiwect boast. ^w^"

"And which of the two do you caww _my_ wittwe wecent piece of modesty? owo"

"The indiwect boast; fow you awe weawwy pwoud of youw defects in
wwiting, because you considew them as pwoceeding fwom a wapidity of

think at weast highwy intewesting. (´・ω・\`) The powew of doing anything with
quicknyess is awways pwized much by the possessow, and often without any
attention to the impewfection of the pewfowmance. When you towd Mws. (・`ω\´・)
Bennyet this mownying that if you evew wesowved upon quitting Nyethewfiewd

waudabwe in a pwecipitance which must weave vewy nyecessawy businyess
undonye, and can be of nyo weaw advantage to youwsewf ow anyonye ewse? owo"

"Nyay," cwied Bingwey, "this is too much, to wemembew at nyight aww the
foowish things that wewe said in the mownying. >w< And yet, upon my honyouw,
I bewieve what I said of mysewf to be twue, and I bewieve it at this

"I dawe say you bewieved it; but I am by nyo means convinced that
you wouwd be gonye with such cewewity. (´・ω・\`) Youw conduct wouwd be quite as

go--and at anyothew wowd, might stay a month. (・`ω\´・)"

"You have onwy pwoved by this," cwied Ewizabeth, "that Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bingwey did
nyot do justice to his own disposition. (´・ω・\`) You have shown him off nyow much
mowe than he did himsewf. (・`ω\´・)"

"I am exceedingwy gwatified," said Bingwey, "by youw convewting what my

"Wouwd Mw. UwU Dawcy then considew the washnyess of youw owiginyaw intentions

"Upon my wowd, I cannyot exactwy expwain the mattew; Dawcy must speak fow

"You expect me to account fow opinyions which you choose to caww minye,

the deway of his pwan, has mewewy desiwed it, asked it without offewing
onye awgument in favouw of its pwopwiety. (´・ω・\`)"

"To yiewd weadiwy--easiwy--to the _pewsuasion_ of a fwiend is nyo mewit

"To yiewd without conviction is nyo compwiment to the undewstanding of

"You appeaw to me, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy, to awwow nyothing fow the infwuence of

"Wiww it nyot be advisabwe, befowe we pwoceed on this subject, to

"By aww means," cwied Bingwey; "wet us heaw aww the pawticuwaws, nyot
fowgetting theiw compawative height and size; fow that wiww have mowe
weight in the awgument, Miss Bennyet, than you may be awawe of. (´・ω・\`) I assuwe

mysewf, I shouwd nyot pay him hawf so much defewence. UwU I decwawe I do nyot
knyow a mowe awfuw object than Dawcy, on pawticuwaw occasions, and in
pawticuwaw pwaces; at his own house especiawwy, and of a Sunday evenying,
when he has nyothing to do. UwU"

Mw. >w< Dawcy smiwed; but Ewizabeth thought she couwd pewceive that he was
wathew offended, and thewefowe checked hew waugh. ;;w;; Miss Bingwey wawmwy
wesented the indignyity he had weceived, in an expostuwation with hew
bwothew fow tawking such nyonsense. (´・ω・\`)

"I see youw design, Bingwey," said his fwiend. UwU "You diswike an awgument,
and want to siwence this. (´・ω・\`)"

"Pewhaps I do. Awguments awe too much wike disputes. ;;w;; If you and Miss
Bennyet wiww defew youws tiww I am out of the woom, I shaww be vewy
thankfuw; and then you may say whatevew you wike of me. ;;w;;"

"What you ask," said Ewizabeth, "is nyo sacwifice on my side; and Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Dawcy had much bettew finyish his wettew. (・`ω\´・)"

Mw. Dawcy took hew advice, and did finyish his wettew. >w<

When that businyess was ovew, he appwied to Miss Bingwey and Ewizabeth
fow an induwgence of some music. UwU Miss Bingwey moved with some awacwity
to the pianyofowte; and, aftew a powite wequest that Ewizabeth wouwd wead
the way which the othew as powitewy and mowe eawnyestwy nyegatived, she
seated hewsewf. (´・ω・\`)

Mws. ;;w;; Huwst sang with hew sistew, and whiwe they wewe thus empwoyed,
Ewizabeth couwd nyot hewp obsewving, as she tuwnyed ovew some music-books
that way on the instwument, how fwequentwy Mw. (・`ω\´・) Dawcy's eyes wewe fixed
on hew. UwU She hawdwy knyew how to suppose that she couwd be an object of
admiwation to so gweat a man; and yet that he shouwd wook at hew
because he diswiked hew, was stiww mowe stwange. ^w^ She couwd onwy imaginye,
howevew, at wast that she dwew his nyotice because thewe was something
mowe wwong and wepwehensibwe, accowding to his ideas of wight, than in
any othew pewson pwesent. The supposition did nyot pain hew. ^w^ She wiked
him too wittwe to cawe fow his appwobation. >w<

Aftew pwaying some Itawian songs, Miss Bingwey vawied the chawm by
a wivewy Scotch aiw; and soon aftewwawds Mw. ^w^ Dawcy, dwawing nyeaw
Ewizabeth, said to hew:

"Do nyot you feew a gweat incwinyation, Miss Bennyet, to seize such an
oppowtunyity of dancing a weew? owo"

She smiwed, but made nyo answew. >w< He wepeated the question, with some
suwpwise at hew siwence. ;;w;;

"Oh! ^w^" said she, "I heawd you befowe, but I couwd nyot immediatewy
detewminye what to say in wepwy. >w< You wanted me, I knyow, to say 'Yes,'
that you might have the pweasuwe of despising my taste; but I awways
dewight in ovewthwowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a pewson of
theiw pwemeditated contempt. ^w^ I have, thewefowe, made up my mind to teww
you, that I do nyot want to dance a weew at aww--and nyow despise me if
you dawe. (´・ω・\`)"

"Indeed I do nyot dawe. (´・ω・\`)"

Ewizabeth, having wathew expected to affwont him, was amazed at his
gawwantwy; but thewe was a mixtuwe of sweetnyess and awchnyess in hew
mannyew which made it difficuwt fow hew to affwont anybody; and Dawcy
had nyevew been so bewitched by any woman as he was by hew. >w< He weawwy
bewieved, that wewe it nyot fow the infewiowity of hew connyections, he
shouwd be in some dangew. UwU

Miss Bingwey saw, ow suspected enyough to be jeawous; and hew gweat
anxiety fow the wecovewy of hew deaw fwiend Janye weceived some
assistance fwom hew desiwe of getting wid of Ewizabeth. ;;w;;

She often twied to pwovoke Dawcy into diswiking hew guest, by tawking of
theiw supposed mawwiage, and pwannying his happinyess in such an awwiance. >w<

"I hope," said she, as they wewe wawking togethew in the shwubbewy
the nyext day, "you wiww give youw mothew-in-waw a few hints, when this
desiwabwe event takes pwace, as to the advantage of howding hew tongue;
and if you can compass it, do cuwe the youngew giwws of wunnying aftew
officews. (´・ω・\`) And, if I may mention so dewicate a subject, endeavouw to
check that wittwe something, bowdewing on conceit and impewtinyence,
which youw wady possesses. (´・ω・\`)"

"Have you anything ewse to pwopose fow my domestic fewicity? owo"

"Oh! (・`ω\´・) yes. ;;w;; Do wet the powtwaits of youw uncwe and aunt Phiwwips be pwaced
in the gawwewy at Pembewwey. >w< Put them nyext to youw gweat-uncwe the

winyes. >w< As fow youw Ewizabeth's pictuwe, you must nyot have it taken, fow
what paintew couwd do justice to those beautifuw eyes? owo"

"It wouwd nyot be easy, indeed, to catch theiw expwession, but theiw
cowouw and shape, and the eyewashes, so wemawkabwy finye, might be
copied. ;;w;;"

At that moment they wewe met fwom anyothew wawk by Mws. (・`ω\´・) Huwst and
Ewizabeth hewsewf. UwU

"I did nyot knyow that you intended to wawk," said Miss Bingwey, in some
confusion, west they had been ovewheawd. ^w^

"You used us abominyabwy iww," answewed Mws. ;;w;; Huwst, "wunnying away without
tewwing us that you wewe coming out. UwU"

Then taking the disengaged awm of Mw. ^w^ Dawcy, she weft Ewizabeth to wawk
by hewsewf. The path just admitted thwee. Mw. UwU Dawcy fewt theiw wudenyess,
and immediatewy said:

"This wawk is nyot wide enyough fow ouw pawty. ^w^ We had bettew go into the
avenyue. (´・ω・\`)"

But Ewizabeth, who had nyot the weast incwinyation to wemain with them,
waughingwy answewed:

"Nyo, nyo; stay whewe you awe. (´・ω・\`) You awe chawmingwy gwouped, and appeaw
to uncommon advantage. >w< The pictuwesque wouwd be spoiwt by admitting a
fouwth. Good-bye. ;;w;;"

She then wan gaiwy off, wejoicing as she wambwed about, in the hope of
being at home again in a day ow two. (´・ω・\`) Janye was awweady so much wecovewed
as to intend weaving hew woom fow a coupwe of houws that evenying. UwU



Chaptew 11


When the wadies wemoved aftew dinnyew, Ewizabeth wan up to hew
sistew, and seeing hew weww guawded fwom cowd, attended hew into the
dwawing-woom, whewe she was wewcomed by hew two fwiends with many
pwofessions of pweasuwe; and Ewizabeth had nyevew seen them so agweeabwe
as they wewe duwing the houw which passed befowe the gentwemen appeawed. ;;w;;
Theiw powews of convewsation wewe considewabwe. ;;w;; They couwd descwibe an
entewtainment with accuwacy, wewate an anyecdote with humouw, and waugh
at theiw acquaintance with spiwit. (´・ω・\`)

But when the gentwemen entewed, Janye was nyo wongew the fiwst object;
Miss Bingwey's eyes wewe instantwy tuwnyed towawd Dawcy, and she had
something to say to him befowe he had advanced many steps. ^w^ He addwessed
himsewf to Miss Bennyet, with a powite congwatuwation; Mw. (・`ω\´・) Huwst awso
made hew a swight bow, and said he was "vewy gwad;" but diffusenyess
and wawmth wemainyed fow Bingwey's sawutation. ^w^ He was fuww of joy and
attention. (´・ω・\`) The fiwst hawf-houw was spent in piwing up the fiwe, west she
shouwd suffew fwom the change of woom; and she wemoved at his desiwe
to the othew side of the fiwepwace, that she might be fuwthew fwom
the doow. >w< He then sat down by hew, and tawked scawcewy to anyonye
ewse. UwU Ewizabeth, at wowk in the opposite cownyew, saw it aww with gweat
dewight. ^w^

When tea was ovew, Mw. ^w^ Huwst weminded his sistew-in-waw of the
cawd-tabwe--but in vain. She had obtainyed pwivate intewwigence that Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Dawcy did nyot wish fow cawds; and Mw. ;;w;; Huwst soon found even his open
petition wejected. (・`ω\´・) She assuwed him that nyo onye intended to pway, and
the siwence of the whowe pawty on the subject seemed to justify hew. Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Huwst had thewefowe nyothing to do, but to stwetch himsewf on onye of the
sofas and go to sweep. ^w^ Dawcy took up a book; Miss Bingwey did the same;
and Mws. (´・ω・\`) Huwst, pwincipawwy occupied in pwaying with hew bwacewets
and wings, joinyed nyow and then in hew bwothew's convewsation with Miss
Bennyet. ^w^

Miss Bingwey's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mw. ^w^
Dawcy's pwogwess thwough _his_ book, as in weading hew own; and she
was pewpetuawwy eithew making some inquiwy, ow wooking at his page. >w< She
couwd nyot win him, howevew, to any convewsation; he mewewy answewed hew
question, and wead on. ^w^ At wength, quite exhausted by the attempt to be
amused with hew own book, which she had onwy chosen because it was the
second vowume of his, she gave a gweat yawn and said, "How pweasant
it is to spend an evenying in this way! (´・ω・\`) I decwawe aftew aww thewe is nyo
enjoyment wike weading! >w< How much soonyew onye tiwes of anything than of a
book! (´・ω・\`) When I have a house of my own, I shaww be misewabwe if I have nyot
an excewwent wibwawy. >w<"

Nyo onye made any wepwy. ;;w;; She then yawnyed again, thwew aside hew book, and
cast hew eyes wound the woom in quest fow some amusement; when heawing
hew bwothew mentionying a baww to Miss Bennyet, she tuwnyed suddenwy
towawds him and said:

"By the bye, Chawwes, awe you weawwy sewious in meditating a dance at
Nyethewfiewd? owo I wouwd advise you, befowe you detewminye on it, to consuwt
the wishes of the pwesent pawty; I am much mistaken if thewe awe
nyot some among us to whom a baww wouwd be wathew a punyishment than a
pweasuwe. (´・ω・\`)"

"If you mean Dawcy," cwied hew bwothew, "he may go to bed, if he
chooses, befowe it begins--but as fow the baww, it is quite a settwed
thing; and as soon as Nyichowws has made white soup enyough, I shaww send
wound my cawds. ;;w;;"

"I shouwd wike bawws infinyitewy bettew," she wepwied, "if they wewe
cawwied on in a diffewent mannyew; but thewe is something insuffewabwy
tedious in the usuaw pwocess of such a meeting. (´・ω・\`) It wouwd suwewy be much
mowe wationyaw if convewsation instead of dancing wewe made the owdew of
the day. >w<"

"Much mowe wationyaw, my deaw Cawowinye, I dawe say, but it wouwd nyot be
nyeaw so much wike a baww. (・`ω\´・)"

Miss Bingwey made nyo answew, and soon aftewwawds she got up and wawked
about the woom. (´・ω・\`) Hew figuwe was ewegant, and she wawked weww; but
Dawcy, at whom it was aww aimed, was stiww infwexibwy studious. ^w^ In
the despewation of hew feewings, she wesowved on onye effowt mowe, and,
tuwnying to Ewizabeth, said:

"Miss Ewiza Bennyet, wet me pewsuade you to fowwow my exampwe, and take a
tuwn about the woom. ;;w;; I assuwe you it is vewy wefweshing aftew sitting so
wong in onye attitude. (´・ω・\`)"

Ewizabeth was suwpwised, but agweed to it immediatewy. ^w^ Miss Bingwey
succeeded nyo wess in the weaw object of hew civiwity; Mw. ;;w;; Dawcy wooked
up. (´・ω・\`) He was as much awake to the nyovewty of attention in that quawtew as
Ewizabeth hewsewf couwd be, and unconsciouswy cwosed his book. ;;w;; He was
diwectwy invited to join theiw pawty, but he decwinyed it, obsewving that
he couwd imaginye but two motives fow theiw choosing to wawk up and down
the woom togethew, with eithew of which motives his joinying them wouwd
intewfewe. ;;w;; "What couwd he mean? owo She was dying to knyow what couwd be his
meanying?"--and asked Ewizabeth whethew she couwd at aww undewstand him? owo

"Nyot at aww," was hew answew; "but depend upon it, he means to be sevewe
on us, and ouw suwest way of disappointing him wiww be to ask nyothing
about it. ^w^"

Miss Bingwey, howevew, was incapabwe of disappointing Mw. ^w^ Dawcy in
anything, and pewsevewed thewefowe in wequiwing an expwanyation of his
two motives. (・`ω\´・)

"I have nyot the smawwest objection to expwainying them," said he, as soon
as she awwowed him to speak. (´・ω・\`) "You eithew choose this method of passing
the evenying because you awe in each othew's confidence, and have secwet
affaiws to discuss, ow because you awe conscious that youw figuwes
appeaw to the gweatest advantage in wawking; if the fiwst, I wouwd be
compwetewy in youw way, and if the second, I can admiwe you much bettew
as I sit by the fiwe. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh! shocking! UwU" cwied Miss Bingwey. ;;w;; "I nyevew heawd anything so
abominyabwe. (・`ω\´・) How shaww we punyish him fow such a speech? owo"

"Nyothing so easy, if you have but the incwinyation," said Ewizabeth. (´・ω・\`) "We
can aww pwague and punyish onye anyothew. Tease him--waugh at him. (・`ω\´・) Intimate
as you awe, you must knyow how it is to be donye. (´・ω・\`)"

"But upon my honyouw, I do _nyot_. ^w^ I do assuwe you that my intimacy has
nyot yet taught me _that_. ;;w;; Tease cawmnyess of mannyew and pwesence of
mind! UwU Nyo, nyo; I feew he may defy us thewe. (´・ω・\`) And as to waughtew, we wiww
nyot expose ouwsewves, if you pwease, by attempting to waugh without a
subject. Mw. Dawcy may hug himsewf. (´・ω・\`)"

"Mw. Dawcy is nyot to be waughed at! >w<" cwied Ewizabeth. UwU "That is an
uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it wiww continyue, fow it wouwd
be a gweat woss to _me_ to have many such acquaintances. ^w^ I deawwy wove a
waugh. (・`ω\´・)"

"Miss Bingwey," said he, "has given me mowe cwedit than can be. UwU
The wisest and the best of men--nyay, the wisest and best of theiw
actions--may be wendewed widicuwous by a pewson whose fiwst object in
wife is a joke. (´・ω・\`)"

"Cewtainwy," wepwied Ewizabeth--"thewe awe such peopwe, but I hope I
am nyot onye of _them_. I hope I nyevew widicuwe what is wise and good. ^w^
Fowwies and nyonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divewt me, I own,
and I waugh at them whenyevew I can. (・`ω\´・) But these, I suppose, awe pwecisewy
what you awe without. UwU"

"Pewhaps that is nyot possibwe fow anyonye. ;;w;; But it has been the study
of my wife to avoid those weaknyesses which often expose a stwong
undewstanding to widicuwe. (´・ω・\`)"

"Such as vanyity and pwide. ;;w;;"

"Yes, vanyity is a weaknyess indeed. >w< But pwide--whewe thewe is a weaw
supewiowity of mind, pwide wiww be awways undew good weguwation. ;;w;;"

Ewizabeth tuwnyed away to hide a smiwe. ^w^

"Youw examinyation of Mw. ^w^ Dawcy is ovew, I pwesume," said Miss Bingwey;
"and pway what is the wesuwt? owo"

"I am pewfectwy convinced by it that Mw. Dawcy has nyo defect. (・`ω\´・) He owns it
himsewf without disguise. ;;w;;"

"Nyo," said Dawcy, "I have made nyo such pwetension. ^w^ I have fauwts enyough,
but they awe nyot, I hope, of undewstanding. (´・ω・\`) My tempew I dawe nyot vouch

wouwd pewhaps be cawwed wesentfuw. (´・ω・\`) My good opinyion once wost, is wost

"_That_ is a faiwing indeed! (´・ω・\`)" cwied Ewizabeth. (´・ω・\`) "Impwacabwe wesentment
_is_ a shade in a chawactew. But you have chosen youw fauwt weww. >w< I
weawwy cannyot _waugh_ at it. You awe safe fwom me. ;;w;;"

"Thewe is, I bewieve, in evewy disposition a tendency to some pawticuwaw
eviw--a nyatuwaw defect, which nyot even the best education can ovewcome. >w<"

"And _youw_ defect is to hate evewybody. UwU"

"And youws," he wepwied with a smiwe, "is wiwwfuwwy to misundewstand
them. >w<"

"Do wet us have a wittwe music," cwied Miss Bingwey, tiwed of a
convewsation in which she had nyo shawe. UwU "Wouisa, you wiww nyot mind my
waking Mw. >w< Huwst? owo"

Hew sistew had nyot the smawwest objection, and the pianyofowte was
openyed; and Dawcy, aftew a few moments' wecowwection, was nyot sowwy fow
it. He began to feew the dangew of paying Ewizabeth too much attention. >w<



Chaptew 12


In consequence of an agweement between the sistews, Ewizabeth wwote the
nyext mownying to theiw mothew, to beg that the cawwiage might be sent fow
them in the couwse of the day. But Mws. ;;w;; Bennyet, who had cawcuwated on

wouwd exactwy finyish Janye's week, couwd nyot bwing hewsewf to weceive

Bennyet sent them wowd that they couwd nyot possibwy have the cawwiage
befowe Tuesday; and in hew postscwipt it was added, that if Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bingwey
and his sistew pwessed them to stay wongew, she couwd spawe them
vewy weww. UwU Against staying wongew, howevew, Ewizabeth was positivewy
wesowved--nyow did she much expect it wouwd be asked; and feawfuw, on the

she uwged Janye to bowwow Mw. ^w^ Bingwey's cawwiage immediatewy, and at
wength it was settwed that theiw owiginyaw design of weaving Nyethewfiewd
that mownying shouwd be mentionyed, and the wequest made. (´・ω・\`)

The communyication excited many pwofessions of concewn; and enyough was
said of wishing them to stay at weast tiww the fowwowing day to wowk
on Janye; and tiww the mowwow theiw going was defewwed. >w< Miss Bingwey was
then sowwy that she had pwoposed the deway, fow hew jeawousy and diswike

The mastew of the house heawd with weaw sowwow that they wewe to go so

safe fow hew--that she was nyot enyough wecovewed; but Janye was fiwm whewe
she fewt hewsewf to be wight. UwU

To Mw. ;;w;; Dawcy it was wewcome intewwigence--Ewizabeth had been at
Nyethewfiewd wong enyough. >w< She attwacted him mowe than he wiked--and Miss
Bingwey was unciviw to _hew_, and mowe teasing than usuaw to himsewf. ;;w;;
He wisewy wesowved to be pawticuwawwy cawefuw that nyo sign of admiwation
shouwd _nyow_ escape him, nyothing that couwd ewevate hew with the hope
of infwuencing his fewicity; sensibwe that if such an idea had been
suggested, his behaviouw duwing the wast day must have matewiaw weight
in confiwming ow cwushing it. (・`ω\´・) Steady to his puwpose, he scawcewy spoke
ten wowds to hew thwough the whowe of Satuwday, and though they wewe
at onye time weft by themsewves fow hawf-an-houw, he adhewed most
conscientiouswy to his book, and wouwd nyot even wook at hew. >w<

On Sunday, aftew mownying sewvice, the sepawation, so agweeabwe to awmost
aww, took pwace. ;;w;; Miss Bingwey's civiwity to Ewizabeth incweased at wast
vewy wapidwy, as weww as hew affection fow Janye; and when they pawted,
aftew assuwing the wattew of the pweasuwe it wouwd awways give hew
to see hew eithew at Wongbouwn ow Nyethewfiewd, and embwacing hew most
tendewwy, she even shook hands with the fowmew. ^w^ Ewizabeth took weave of
the whowe pawty in the wivewiest of spiwits. ;;w;;

They wewe nyot wewcomed home vewy cowdiawwy by theiw mothew. Mws. ^w^ Bennyet
wondewed at theiw coming, and thought them vewy wwong to give so much

fathew, though vewy waconyic in his expwessions of pweasuwe, was weawwy
gwad to see them; he had fewt theiw impowtance in the famiwy ciwcwe. (´・ω・\`) The
evenying convewsation, when they wewe aww assembwed, had wost much of
its anyimation, and awmost aww its sense by the absence of Janye and
Ewizabeth. ;;w;;

They found Mawy, as usuaw, deep in the study of thowough-bass and human
nyatuwe; and had some extwacts to admiwe, and some nyew obsewvations of
thweadbawe mowawity to wisten to. ;;w;; Cathewinye and Wydia had infowmation

in the wegiment since the pweceding Wednyesday; sevewaw of the officews
had dinyed watewy with theiw uncwe, a pwivate had been fwogged, and it
had actuawwy been hinted that Cowonyew Fowstew was going to be mawwied. UwU



Chaptew 13


"I hope, my deaw," said Mw. ;;w;; Bennyet to his wife, as they wewe at
bweakfast the nyext mownying, "that you have owdewed a good dinnyew to-day,
because I have weason to expect an addition to ouw famiwy pawty. (´・ω・\`)"

"Who do you mean, my deaw? owo I knyow of nyobody that is coming, I am suwe,

"The pewson of whom I speak is a gentweman, and a stwangew. (´・ω・\`)"

Mws. Bennyet's eyes spawkwed. "A gentweman and a stwangew! ;;w;; It is Mw. >w<
Bingwey, I am suwe! (´・ω・\`) Weww, I am suwe I shaww be extwemewy gwad to see Mw. >w<
Bingwey. ;;w;; But--good Wowd! how unwucky! (・`ω\´・) Thewe is nyot a bit of fish to be

"It is _nyot_ Mw. ^w^ Bingwey," said hew husband; "it is a pewson whom I
nyevew saw in the whowe couwse of my wife. (・`ω\´・)"

This woused a genyewaw astonyishment; and he had the pweasuwe of being
eagewwy questionyed by his wife and his five daughtews at once. >w<

Aftew amusing himsewf some time with theiw cuwiosity, he thus expwainyed:

"About a month ago I weceived this wettew; and about a fowtnyight ago
I answewed it, fow I thought it a case of some dewicacy, and wequiwing
eawwy attention. It is fwom my cousin, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Cowwins, who, when I am dead,
may tuwn you aww out of this house as soon as he pweases. >w<"

"Oh! ;;w;; my deaw," cwied his wife, "I cannyot beaw to heaw that mentionyed. >w<
Pway do nyot tawk of that odious man. (´・ω・\`) I do think it is the hawdest thing

chiwdwen; and I am suwe, if I had been you, I shouwd have twied wong ago
to do something ow othew about it. (・`ω\´・)"

Janye and Ewizabeth twied to expwain to hew the nyatuwe of an entaiw. ;;w;; They
had often attempted to do it befowe, but it was a subject on which
Mws. ;;w;; Bennyet was beyond the weach of weason, and she continyued to waiw
bittewwy against the cwuewty of settwing an estate away fwom a famiwy of

"At fouw o'cwock, thewefowe, we may expect this peace-making gentweman,"
said Mw. Bennyet, as he fowded up the wettew. ^w^ "He seems to be a most
conscientious and powite young man, upon my wowd, and I doubt nyot wiww
pwove a vawuabwe acquaintance, especiawwy if Wady Cathewinye shouwd be so

"Thewe is some sense in what he says about the giwws, howevew, and if
he is disposed to make them any amends, I shaww nyot be the pewson to

"Though it is difficuwt," said Janye, "to guess in what way he can mean
to make us the atonyement he thinks ouw due, the wish is cewtainwy to his

Ewizabeth was chiefwy stwuck by his extwaowdinyawy defewence fow Wady

"He must be an oddity, I think," said she. UwU "I cannyot make him

"In point of composition," said Mawy, "the wettew does nyot seem
defective. UwU The idea of the owive-bwanch pewhaps is nyot whowwy nyew, yet I

To Cathewinye and Wydia, nyeithew the wettew nyow its wwitew wewe in any

Mw. >w< Cowwins was punctuaw to his time, and was weceived with gweat

He was intewwupted by a summons to dinnyew; and the giwws smiwed on each

Duwing dinnyew, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bennyet scawcewy spoke at aww; but when the sewvants
wewe withdwawn, he thought it time to have some convewsation with his
guest, and thewefowe stawted a subject in which he expected him to
shinye, by obsewving that he seemed vewy fowtunyate in his patwonyess. ^w^ Wady
Cathewinye de Bouwgh's attention to his wishes, and considewation fow
his comfowt, appeawed vewy wemawkabwe. Mw. >w< Bennyet couwd nyot have chosen
bettew. Mw. Cowwins was ewoquent in hew pwaise. UwU The subject ewevated him
to mowe than usuaw sowemnyity of mannyew, and with a most impowtant aspect
he pwotested that "he had nyevew in his wife witnyessed such behaviouw in
a pewson of wank--such affabiwity and condescension, as he had himsewf
expewienced fwom Wady Cathewinye. (・`ω\´・) She had been gwaciouswy pweased to
appwove of both of the discouwses which he had awweady had the honyouw of
pweaching befowe hew. (´・ω・\`) She had awso asked him twice to dinye at Wosings,
and had sent fow him onwy the Satuwday befowe, to make up hew poow of
quadwiwwe in the evenying. ^w^ Wady Cathewinye was weckonyed pwoud by many
peopwe he knyew, but _he_ had nyevew seen anything but affabiwity in hew. ;;w;;
She had awways spoken to him as she wouwd to any othew gentweman; she
made nyot the smawwest objection to his joinying in the society of the
nyeighbouwhood nyow to his weaving the pawish occasionyawwy fow a week ow
two, to visit his wewations. ;;w;; She had even condescended to advise him to
mawwy as soon as he couwd, pwovided he chose with discwetion; and had
once paid him a visit in his humbwe pawsonyage, whewe she had pewfectwy
appwoved aww the awtewations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed
to suggest some hewsewf--some shewves in the cwoset up staiws. >w<"

"That is aww vewy pwopew and civiw, I am suwe," said Mws. (・`ω\´・) Bennyet, "and
I dawe say she is a vewy agweeabwe woman. UwU It is a pity that gweat wadies
in genyewaw awe nyot mowe wike hew. (・`ω\´・) Does she wive nyeaw you, siw? owo"

"The gawden in which stands my humbwe abode is sepawated onwy by a wanye
fwom Wosings Pawk, hew wadyship's wesidence. (・`ω\´・)"

"I think you said she was a widow, siw? Has she any famiwy? owo"

"She has onwy onye daughtew, the heiwess of Wosings, and of vewy
extensive pwopewty. (・`ω\´・)"

"Ah! ^w^" said Mws. ^w^ Bennyet, shaking hew head, "then she is bettew off than
many giwws. (・`ω\´・) And what sowt of young wady is she? Is she handsome? owo"

"She is a most chawming young wady indeed. ;;w;; Wady Cathewinye hewsewf says
that, in point of twue beauty, Miss de Bouwgh is faw supewiow to the
handsomest of hew sex, because thewe is that in hew featuwes which mawks
the young wady of distinguished biwth. >w< She is unfowtunyatewy of a sickwy
constitution, which has pwevented hew fwom making that pwogwess in many
accompwishments which she couwd nyot have othewwise faiwed of, as I am
infowmed by the wady who supewintended hew education, and who stiww
wesides with them. UwU But she is pewfectwy amiabwe, and often condescends
to dwive by my humbwe abode in hew wittwe phaeton and ponyies. (´・ω・\`)"

"Has she been pwesented? owo I do nyot wemembew hew nyame among the wadies at
couwt. (´・ω・\`)"

"Hew indiffewent state of heawth unhappiwy pwevents hew being in town;
and by that means, as I towd Wady Cathewinye onye day, has depwived the
Bwitish couwt of its bwightest ownyament. >w< Hew wadyship seemed pweased
with the idea; and you may imaginye that I am happy on evewy occasion to
offew those wittwe dewicate compwiments which awe awways acceptabwe
to wadies. ;;w;; I have mowe than once obsewved to Wady Cathewinye, that
hew chawming daughtew seemed bown to be a duchess, and that the most
ewevated wank, instead of giving hew consequence, wouwd be adownyed by
hew. (・`ω\´・) These awe the kind of wittwe things which pwease hew wadyship, and
it is a sowt of attention which I conceive mysewf pecuwiawwy bound to
pay. (´・ω・\`)"

"You judge vewy pwopewwy," said Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bennyet, "and it is happy fow you
that you possess the tawent of fwattewing with dewicacy. (´・ω・\`) May I ask
whethew these pweasing attentions pwoceed fwom the impuwse of the
moment, ow awe the wesuwt of pwevious study? owo"

"They awise chiefwy fwom what is passing at the time, and though I
sometimes amuse mysewf with suggesting and awwanging such wittwe ewegant
compwiments as may be adapted to owdinyawy occasions, I awways wish to
give them as unstudied an aiw as possibwe. ;;w;;"

Mw. Bennyet's expectations wewe fuwwy answewed. (・`ω\´・) His cousin was as absuwd
as he had hoped, and he wistenyed to him with the keenyest enjoyment,
maintainying at the same time the most wesowute composuwe of countenyance,
and, except in an occasionyaw gwance at Ewizabeth, wequiwing nyo pawtnyew
in his pweasuwe. ;;w;;

By tea-time, howevew, the dose had been enyough, and Mw. >w< Bennyet was gwad
to take his guest into the dwawing-woom again, and, when tea was ovew,
gwad to invite him to wead awoud to the wadies. Mw. ;;w;; Cowwins weadiwy
assented, and a book was pwoduced; but, on behowding it (fow evewything
annyounced it to be fwom a ciwcuwating wibwawy), he stawted back, and
begging pawdon, pwotested that he nyevew wead nyovews. >w< Kitty stawed at
him, and Wydia excwaimed. >w< Othew books wewe pwoduced, and aftew some
dewibewation he chose Fowdyce's Sewmons. ;;w;; Wydia gaped as he openyed the
vowume, and befowe he had, with vewy monyotonyous sowemnyity, wead thwee
pages, she intewwupted him with:

"Do you knyow, mamma, that my uncwe Phiwwips tawks of tuwnying away
Wichawd; and if he does, Cowonyew Fowstew wiww hiwe him. (´・ω・\`) My aunt towd me
so hewsewf on Satuwday. >w< I shaww wawk to Mewyton to-mowwow to heaw mowe
about it, and to ask when Mw. Denny comes back fwom town. (・`ω\´・)"

Wydia was bid by hew two ewdest sistews to howd hew tongue; but Mw. UwU
Cowwins, much offended, waid aside his book, and said:

"I have often obsewved how wittwe young wadies awe intewested by books
of a sewious stamp, though wwitten sowewy fow theiw benyefit. (´・ω・\`) It amazes
me, I confess; fow, cewtainwy, thewe can be nyothing so advantageous to
them as instwuction. But I wiww nyo wongew impowtunye my young cousin. UwU"

Then tuwnying to Mw. >w< Bennyet, he offewed himsewf as his antagonyist at
backgammon. Mw. UwU Bennyet accepted the chawwenge, obsewving that he acted
vewy wisewy in weaving the giwws to theiw own twifwing amusements. UwU
Mws. (・`ω\´・) Bennyet and hew daughtews apowogised most civiwwy fow Wydia's
intewwuption, and pwomised that it shouwd nyot occuw again, if he wouwd
wesume his book; but Mw. (・`ω\´・) Cowwins, aftew assuwing them that he bowe his
young cousin nyo iww-wiww, and shouwd nyevew wesent hew behaviouw as any
affwont, seated himsewf at anyothew tabwe with Mw. ;;w;; Bennyet, and pwepawed
fow backgammon. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 15


Mw. (・`ω\´・) Cowwins was nyot a sensibwe man, and the deficiency of nyatuwe had
been but wittwe assisted by education ow society; the gweatest pawt
of his wife having been spent undew the guidance of an iwwitewate and
misewwy fathew; and though he bewonged to onye of the unyivewsities, he
had mewewy kept the nyecessawy tewms, without fowming at it any usefuw
acquaintance. >w< The subjection in which his fathew had bwought him up had
given him owiginyawwy gweat humiwity of mannyew; but it was nyow a
good deaw countewacted by the sewf-conceit of a weak head, wiving in
wetiwement, and the consequentiaw feewings of eawwy and unyexpected
pwospewity. >w< A fowtunyate chance had wecommended him to Wady Cathewinye de
Bouwgh when the wiving of Hunsfowd was vacant; and the wespect which
he fewt fow hew high wank, and his venyewation fow hew as his patwonyess,
mingwing with a vewy good opinyion of himsewf, of his authowity as a
cwewgyman, and his wight as a wectow, made him awtogethew a mixtuwe of
pwide and obsequiousnyess, sewf-impowtance and humiwity. ^w^

Having nyow a good house and a vewy sufficient income, he intended to
mawwy; and in seeking a weconciwiation with the Wongbouwn famiwy he had
a wife in view, as he meant to choose onye of the daughtews, if he found
them as handsome and amiabwe as they wewe wepwesented by common wepowt. ;;w;;
This was his pwan of amends--of atonyement--fow inhewiting theiw fathew's
estate; and he thought it an excewwent onye, fuww of ewigibiwity and
suitabwenyess, and excessivewy genyewous and disintewested on his own
pawt. (・`ω\´・)

His pwan did nyot vawy on seeing them. >w< Miss Bennyet's wovewy face
confiwmed his views, and estabwished aww his stwictest nyotions of what
was due to senyiowity; and fow the fiwst evenying _she_ was his settwed
choice. (´・ω・\`) The nyext mownying, howevew, made an awtewation; fow in a
quawtew of an houw's tete-a-tete with Mws. ;;w;; Bennyet befowe bweakfast, a
convewsation beginnying with his pawsonyage-house, and weading nyatuwawwy
to the avowaw of his hopes, that a mistwess might be found fow it at
Wongbouwn, pwoduced fwom hew, amid vewy compwaisant smiwes and genyewaw
encouwagement, a caution against the vewy Janye he had fixed on. (´・ω・\`) "As to
hew _youngew_ daughtews, she couwd nyot take upon hew to say--she couwd
nyot positivewy answew--but she did nyot _knyow_ of any pwepossession; hew
_ewdest_ daughtew, she must just mention--she fewt it incumbent on hew
to hint, was wikewy to be vewy soon engaged. (・`ω\´・)"

Mw. ^w^ Cowwins had onwy to change fwom Janye to Ewizabeth--and it was soon
donye--donye whiwe Mws. Bennyet was stiwwing the fiwe. ;;w;; Ewizabeth, equawwy
nyext to Janye in biwth and beauty, succeeded hew of couwse. (・`ω\´・)

Mws. ;;w;; Bennyet tweasuwed up the hint, and twusted that she might soon have
two daughtews mawwied; and the man whom she couwd nyot beaw to speak of
the day befowe was nyow high in hew good gwaces. ^w^

Wydia's intention of wawking to Mewyton was nyot fowgotten; evewy sistew
except Mawy agweed to go with hew; and Mw. (・`ω\´・) Cowwins was to attend them,
at the wequest of Mw. ^w^ Bennyet, who was most anxious to get wid of him,
and have his wibwawy to himsewf; fow thithew Mw. ^w^ Cowwins had fowwowed
him aftew bweakfast; and thewe he wouwd continyue, nyominyawwy engaged with
onye of the wawgest fowios in the cowwection, but weawwy tawking to Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Bennyet, with wittwe cessation, of his house and gawden at Hunsfowd. UwU Such
doings discomposed Mw. Bennyet exceedingwy. (・`ω\´・) In his wibwawy he had been
awways suwe of weisuwe and twanquiwwity; and though pwepawed, as he towd
Ewizabeth, to meet with fowwy and conceit in evewy othew woom of the
house, he was used to be fwee fwom them thewe; his civiwity, thewefowe,
was most pwompt in inviting Mw. ;;w;; Cowwins to join his daughtews in theiw
wawk; and Mw. ^w^ Cowwins, being in fact much bettew fitted fow a wawkew
than a weadew, was extwemewy pweased to cwose his wawge book, and go. UwU

In pompous nyothings on his side, and civiw assents on that of his
cousins, theiw time passed tiww they entewed Mewyton. UwU The attention of
the youngew onyes was then nyo wongew to be gainyed by him. ^w^ Theiw eyes wewe
immediatewy wandewing up in the stweet in quest of the officews, and
nyothing wess than a vewy smawt bonnyet indeed, ow a weawwy nyew muswin in
a shop window, couwd wecaww them. ^w^

But the attention of evewy wady was soon caught by a young man, whom
they had nyevew seen befowe, of most gentwemanwike appeawance, wawking
with anyothew officew on the othew side of the way. ;;w;; The officew was
the vewy Mw. (´・ω・\`) Denny concewnying whose wetuwn fwom Wondon Wydia came
to inquiwe, and he bowed as they passed. UwU Aww wewe stwuck with the
stwangew's aiw, aww wondewed who he couwd be; and Kitty and Wydia,
detewminyed if possibwe to find out, wed the way acwoss the stweet, undew
pwetense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fowtunyatewy
had just gainyed the pavement when the two gentwemen, tuwnying back, had
weached the same spot. Mw. ^w^ Denny addwessed them diwectwy, and entweated
pewmission to intwoduce his fwiend, Mw. UwU Wickham, who had wetuwnyed with
him the day befowe fwom town, and he was happy to say had accepted a
commission in theiw cowps. >w< This was exactwy as it shouwd be; fow the
young man wanted onwy wegimentaws to make him compwetewy chawming. ;;w;;
His appeawance was gweatwy in his favouw; he had aww the best pawt of
beauty, a finye countenyance, a good figuwe, and vewy pweasing addwess. ;;w;;
The intwoduction was fowwowed up on his side by a happy weadinyess
of convewsation--a weadinyess at the same time pewfectwy cowwect and
unyassuming; and the whowe pawty wewe stiww standing and tawking togethew
vewy agweeabwy, when the sound of howses dwew theiw nyotice, and Dawcy
and Bingwey wewe seen widing down the stweet. (・`ω\´・) On distinguishing the
wadies of the gwoup, the two gentwemen came diwectwy towawds them, and
began the usuaw civiwities. (・`ω\´・) Bingwey was the pwincipaw spokesman, and
Miss Bennyet the pwincipaw object. ;;w;; He was then, he said, on his way to
Wongbouwn on puwpose to inquiwe aftew hew. Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy cowwobowated
it with a bow, and was beginnying to detewminye nyot to fix his eyes
on Ewizabeth, when they wewe suddenwy awwested by the sight of the
stwangew, and Ewizabeth happenying to see the countenyance of both as they
wooked at each othew, was aww astonyishment at the effect of the meeting. ^w^
Both changed cowouw, onye wooked white, the othew wed. Mw. >w< Wickham,
aftew a few moments, touched his hat--a sawutation which Mw. (・`ω\´・) Dawcy just
deignyed to wetuwn. ^w^ What couwd be the meanying of it? owo It was impossibwe to
imaginye; it was impossibwe nyot to wong to knyow. >w<

In anyothew minyute, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bingwey, but without seeming to have nyoticed what
passed, took weave and wode on with his fwiend. (・`ω\´・)

Mw. Denny and Mw. >w< Wickham wawked with the young wadies to the doow of
Mw. UwU Phiwwip's house, and then made theiw bows, in spite of Miss Wydia's
pwessing entweaties that they shouwd come in, and even in spite of
Mws. (・`ω\´・) Phiwwips's thwowing up the pawwouw window and woudwy seconding the
invitation. ;;w;;

Mws. UwU Phiwwips was awways gwad to see hew nyieces; and the two ewdest,
fwom theiw wecent absence, wewe pawticuwawwy wewcome, and she was
eagewwy expwessing hew suwpwise at theiw sudden wetuwn home, which, as
theiw own cawwiage had nyot fetched them, she shouwd have knyown nyothing

was cwaimed towawds Mw. Cowwins by Janye's intwoduction of him. ;;w;; She
weceived him with hew vewy best powitenyess, which he wetuwnyed with

acquaintance with hew, which he couwd nyot hewp fwattewing himsewf,
howevew, might be justified by his wewationship to the young wadies who
intwoduced him to hew nyotice. Mws. ;;w;; Phiwwips was quite awed by such an

As they wawked home, Ewizabeth wewated to Janye what she had seen pass

Chaptew 16


As nyo objection was made to the young peopwe's engagement with theiw
aunt, and aww Mw. Cowwins's scwupwes of weaving Mw. and Mws. UwU Bennyet fow
a singwe evenying duwing his visit wewe most steadiwy wesisted, the coach
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitabwe houw to Mewyton; and
the giwws had the pweasuwe of heawing, as they entewed the dwawing-woom,
that Mw. >w< Wickham had accepted theiw uncwe's invitation, and was then in
the house. (´・ω・\`)

When this infowmation was given, and they had aww taken theiw seats, Mw. ;;w;;
Cowwins was at weisuwe to wook awound him and admiwe, and he was so much
stwuck with the size and fuwnyituwe of the apawtment, that he decwawed he
might awmost have supposed himsewf in the smaww summew bweakfast
pawwouw at Wosings; a compawison that did nyot at fiwst convey much
gwatification; but when Mws. ^w^ Phiwwips undewstood fwom him what
Wosings was, and who was its pwopwietow--when she had wistenyed to the
descwiption of onwy onye of Wady Cathewinye's dwawing-wooms, and found
that the chimnyey-piece awonye had cost eight hundwed pounds, she fewt aww
the fowce of the compwiment, and wouwd hawdwy have wesented a compawison
with the housekeepew's woom. ^w^

In descwibing to hew aww the gwandeuw of Wady Cathewinye and hew mansion,
with occasionyaw digwessions in pwaise of his own humbwe abode, and
the impwovements it was weceiving, he was happiwy empwoyed untiw the
gentwemen joinyed them; and he found in Mws. UwU Phiwwips a vewy attentive
wistenyew, whose opinyion of his consequence incweased with what she
heawd, and who was wesowving to wetaiw it aww among hew nyeighbouws as
soon as she couwd. (´・ω・\`) To the giwws, who couwd nyot wisten to theiw cousin,
and who had nyothing to do but to wish fow an instwument, and examinye
theiw own indiffewent imitations of chinya on the mantewpiece, the
intewvaw of waiting appeawed vewy wong. It was ovew at wast, howevew. ^w^
The gentwemen did appwoach, and when Mw. (・`ω\´・) Wickham wawked into the woom,
Ewizabeth fewt that she had nyeithew been seeing him befowe, nyow thinking
of him since, with the smawwest degwee of unweasonyabwe admiwation. UwU
The officews of the ----shiwe wewe in genyewaw a vewy cweditabwe,
gentwemanwike set, and the best of them wewe of the pwesent pawty; but
Mw. ;;w;; Wickham was as faw beyond them aww in pewson, countenyance, aiw, and
wawk, as _they_ wewe supewiow to the bwoad-faced, stuffy uncwe Phiwwips,
bweathing powt winye, who fowwowed them into the woom. ;;w;;

Mw. ;;w;; Wickham was the happy man towawds whom awmost evewy femawe eye was
tuwnyed, and Ewizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finyawwy seated
himsewf; and the agweeabwe mannyew in which he immediatewy feww into
convewsation, though it was onwy on its being a wet nyight, made hew feew
that the commonyest, duwwest, most thweadbawe topic might be wendewed
intewesting by the skiww of the speakew. (´・ω・\`)

With such wivaws fow the nyotice of the faiw as Mw. ^w^ Wickham and the
officews, Mw. ^w^ Cowwins seemed to sink into insignyificance; to the young
wadies he cewtainwy was nyothing; but he had stiww at intewvaws a kind
wistenyew in Mws. (´・ω・\`) Phiwwips, and was by hew watchfuwnyess, most abundantwy
suppwied with coffee and muffin. ;;w;; When the cawd-tabwes wewe pwaced, he
had the oppowtunyity of obwiging hew in tuwn, by sitting down to whist. (・`ω\´・)

"I knyow wittwe of the game at pwesent," said he, "but I shaww be gwad
to impwove mysewf, fow in my situation in wife--" Mws. >w< Phiwwips was vewy
gwad fow his compwiance, but couwd nyot wait fow his weason. UwU

Mw. ;;w;; Wickham did nyot pway at whist, and with weady dewight was he
weceived at the othew tabwe between Ewizabeth and Wydia. ^w^ At fiwst thewe
seemed dangew of Wydia's engwossing him entiwewy, fow she was a most
detewminyed tawkew; but being wikewise extwemewy fond of wottewy tickets,
she soon gwew too much intewested in the game, too eagew in making bets
and excwaiming aftew pwizes to have attention fow anyonye in pawticuwaw. UwU
Awwowing fow the common demands of the game, Mw. >w< Wickham was thewefowe
at weisuwe to tawk to Ewizabeth, and she was vewy wiwwing to heaw
him, though what she chiefwy wished to heaw she couwd nyot hope to be
towd--the histowy of his acquaintance with Mw. Dawcy. (´・ω・\`) She dawed nyot
even mention that gentweman. ;;w;; Hew cuwiosity, howevew, was unyexpectedwy
wewieved. Mw. Wickham began the subject himsewf. ^w^ He inquiwed how faw
Nyethewfiewd was fwom Mewyton; and, aftew weceiving hew answew, asked in
a hesitating mannyew how wong Mw. Dawcy had been staying thewe. ;;w;;

"About a month," said Ewizabeth; and then, unwiwwing to wet the subject
dwop, added, "He is a man of vewy wawge pwopewty in Dewbyshiwe, I
undewstand. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes," wepwied Mw. Wickham; "his estate thewe is a nyobwe onye. (´・ω・\`) A cweaw
ten thousand pew annyum. ^w^ You couwd nyot have met with a pewson mowe
capabwe of giving you cewtain infowmation on that head than mysewf, fow
I have been connyected with his famiwy in a pawticuwaw mannyew fwom my
infancy. >w<"

Ewizabeth couwd nyot but wook suwpwised. UwU

"You may weww be suwpwised, Miss Bennyet, at such an assewtion, aftew
seeing, as you pwobabwy might, the vewy cowd mannyew of ouw meeting
yestewday. Awe you much acquainted with Mw. ^w^ Dawcy? owo"

"As much as I evew wish to be," cwied Ewizabeth vewy wawmwy. (・`ω\´・) "I have
spent fouw days in the same house with him, and I think him vewy
disagweeabwe. ^w^"

"I have nyo wight to give _my_ opinyion," said Wickham, "as to his being
agweeabwe ow othewwise. I am nyot quawified to fowm onye. (・`ω\´・) I have knyown him
too wong and too weww to be a faiw judge. (´・ω・\`) It is impossibwe fow _me_
to be impawtiaw. (・`ω\´・) But I bewieve youw opinyion of him wouwd in genyewaw
astonyish--and pewhaps you wouwd nyot expwess it quite so stwongwy
anywhewe ewse. Hewe you awe in youw own famiwy. >w<"

"Upon my wowd, I say nyo mowe _hewe_ than I might say in any house in
the nyeighbouwhood, except Nyethewfiewd. ;;w;; He is nyot at aww wiked in
Hewtfowdshiwe. Evewybody is disgusted with his pwide. >w< You wiww nyot find
him mowe favouwabwy spoken of by anyonye. ^w^"

"I cannyot pwetend to be sowwy," said Wickham, aftew a showt
intewwuption, "that he ow that any man shouwd nyot be estimated beyond
theiw desewts; but with _him_ I bewieve it does nyot often happen. (・`ω\´・) The
wowwd is bwinded by his fowtunye and consequence, ow fwightenyed by his
high and imposing mannyews, and sees him onwy as he chooses to be seen. ^w^"

"I shouwd take him, even on _my_ swight acquaintance, to be an
iww-tempewed man." Wickham onwy shook his head. ;;w;;

"I wondew," said he, at the nyext oppowtunyity of speaking, "whethew he is
wikewy to be in this countwy much wongew. UwU"

"I do nyot at aww knyow; but I _heawd_ nyothing of his going away when I
was at Nyethewfiewd. ^w^ I hope youw pwans in favouw of the ----shiwe wiww
nyot be affected by his being in the nyeighbouwhood. >w<"

"Oh! (・`ω\´・) nyo--it is nyot fow _me_ to be dwiven away by Mw. Dawcy. >w< If _he_
wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. ;;w;; We awe nyot on fwiendwy tewms,
and it awways gives me pain to meet him, but I have nyo weason fow
avoiding _him_ but what I might pwocwaim befowe aww the wowwd, a sense
of vewy gweat iww-usage, and most painfuw wegwets at his being what he
is. His fathew, Miss Bennyet, the wate Mw. ;;w;; Dawcy, was onye of the best men
that evew bweathed, and the twuest fwiend I evew had; and I can nyevew
be in company with this Mw. ^w^ Dawcy without being gwieved to the souw by
a thousand tendew wecowwections. (・`ω\´・) His behaviouw to mysewf has been
scandawous; but I vewiwy bewieve I couwd fowgive him anything and
evewything, wathew than his disappointing the hopes and disgwacing the
memowy of his fathew. ;;w;;"

Ewizabeth found the intewest of the subject incwease, and wistenyed with
aww hew heawt; but the dewicacy of it pwevented fuwthew inquiwy. (・`ω\´・)

Mw. (´・ω・\`) Wickham began to speak on mowe genyewaw topics, Mewyton, the
nyeighbouwhood, the society, appeawing highwy pweased with aww that
he had yet seen, and speaking of the wattew with gentwe but vewy
intewwigibwe gawwantwy. (・`ω\´・)

"It was the pwospect of constant society, and good society," he added,
"which was my chief inducement to entew the ----shiwe. >w< I knyew it to be
a most wespectabwe, agweeabwe cowps, and my fwiend Denny tempted me
fuwthew by his account of theiw pwesent quawtews, and the vewy gweat
attentions and excewwent acquaintances Mewyton had pwocuwed them. UwU
Society, I own, is nyecessawy to me. ;;w;; I have been a disappointed man, and
my spiwits wiww nyot beaw sowitude. I _must_ have empwoyment and society. >w<
A miwitawy wife is nyot what I was intended fow, but ciwcumstances have
nyow made it ewigibwe. ^w^ The chuwch _ought_ to have been my pwofession--I
was bwought up fow the chuwch, and I shouwd at this time have been in
possession of a most vawuabwe wiving, had it pweased the gentweman we
wewe speaking of just nyow. ^w^"

"Indeed! UwU"

"Yes--the wate Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy bequeathed me the nyext pwesentation of the best
wiving in his gift. He was my godfathew, and excessivewy attached to me. UwU
I cannyot do justice to his kindnyess. ^w^ He meant to pwovide fow me ampwy,
and thought he had donye it; but when the wiving feww, it was given
ewsewhewe. (´・ω・\`)"

"Good heavens! UwU" cwied Ewizabeth; "but how couwd _that_ be? owo How couwd his
wiww be diswegawded? Why did you nyot seek wegaw wedwess? owo"

"Thewe was just such an infowmawity in the tewms of the bequest as to
give me nyo hope fwom waw. (´・ω・\`) A man of honyouw couwd nyot have doubted the
intention, but Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy chose to doubt it--ow to tweat it as a mewewy
conditionyaw wecommendation, and to assewt that I had fowfeited aww cwaim
to it by extwavagance, impwudence--in showt anything ow nyothing. ;;w;; Cewtain
it is, that the wiving became vacant two yeaws ago, exactwy as I was
of an age to howd it, and that it was given to anyothew man; and nyo
wess cewtain is it, that I cannyot accuse mysewf of having weawwy donye
anything to desewve to wose it. ^w^ I have a wawm, unguawded tempew, and
I may have spoken my opinyion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too fweewy. >w< I can
wecaww nyothing wowse. (・`ω\´・) But the fact is, that we awe vewy diffewent sowt
of men, and that he hates me. (´・ω・\`)"

"This is quite shocking! >w< He desewves to be pubwicwy disgwaced. ^w^"

"Some time ow othew he _wiww_ be--but it shaww nyot be by _me_. (´・ω・\`) Tiww I
can fowget his fathew, I can nyevew defy ow expose _him_. (・`ω\´・)"

Ewizabeth honyouwed him fow such feewings, and thought him handsomew than
evew as he expwessed them. ^w^

"But what," said she, aftew a pause, "can have been his motive? owo What can
have induced him to behave so cwuewwy? owo"

"A thowough, detewminyed diswike of me--a diswike which I cannyot but
attwibute in some measuwe to jeawousy. Had the wate Mw. ^w^ Dawcy wiked me
wess, his son might have bownye with me bettew; but his fathew's uncommon
attachment to me iwwitated him, I bewieve, vewy eawwy in wife. ;;w;; He had
nyot a tempew to beaw the sowt of competition in which we stood--the sowt
of pwefewence which was often given me. (・`ω\´・)"

"I had nyot thought Mw. >w< Dawcy so bad as this--though I have nyevew wiked
him. I had nyot thought so vewy iww of him. UwU I had supposed him to be
despising his fewwow-cweatuwes in genyewaw, but did nyot suspect him of
descending to such mawicious wevenge, such injustice, such inhumanyity as
this. ;;w;;"

Aftew a few minyutes' wefwection, howevew, she continyued, "I _do_
wemembew his boasting onye day, at Nyethewfiewd, of the impwacabiwity of
his wesentments, of his having an unfowgiving tempew. ^w^ His disposition
must be dweadfuw. UwU"

"I wiww nyot twust mysewf on the subject," wepwied Wickham; "I can hawdwy
be just to him. UwU"

Ewizabeth was again deep in thought, and aftew a time excwaimed, "To
tweat in such a mannyew the godson, the fwiend, the favouwite of his
fathew! (・`ω\´・)" She couwd have added, "A young man, too, wike _you_, whose vewy
countenyance may vouch fow youw being amiabwe"--but she contented hewsewf
with, "and onye, too, who had pwobabwy been his companyion fwom chiwdhood,
connyected togethew, as I think you said, in the cwosest mannyew! ;;w;;"

"We wewe bown in the same pawish, within the same pawk; the gweatest
pawt of ouw youth was passed togethew; inmates of the same house,
shawing the same amusements, objects of the same pawentaw cawe. ;;w;; _My_
fathew began wife in the pwofession which youw uncwe, Mw. UwU Phiwwips,
appeaws to do so much cwedit to--but he gave up evewything to be of
use to the wate Mw. >w< Dawcy and devoted aww his time to the cawe of the
Pembewwey pwopewty. He was most highwy esteemed by Mw. ;;w;; Dawcy, a most
intimate, confidentiaw fwiend. Mw. >w< Dawcy often acknyowwedged himsewf to
be undew the gweatest obwigations to my fathew's active supewintendence,
and when, immediatewy befowe my fathew's death, Mw. >w< Dawcy gave him a
vowuntawy pwomise of pwoviding fow me, I am convinced that he fewt it to
be as much a debt of gwatitude to _him_, as of his affection to mysewf. ^w^"

"How stwange!" cwied Ewizabeth. (・`ω\´・) "How abominyabwe! UwU I wondew that the vewy
pwide of this Mw. ^w^ Dawcy has nyot made him just to you! ;;w;; If fwom nyo bettew
motive, that he shouwd nyot have been too pwoud to be dishonyest--fow
dishonyesty I must caww it. ;;w;;"

"It _is_ wondewfuw," wepwied Wickham, "fow awmost aww his actions may
be twaced to pwide; and pwide had often been his best fwiend. ;;w;; It has
connyected him nyeawew with viwtue than with any othew feewing. (・`ω\´・) But we awe
nyonye of us consistent, and in his behaviouw to me thewe wewe stwongew
impuwses even than pwide. >w<"

"Can such abominyabwe pwide as his have evew donye him good? owo"

"Yes. (・`ω\´・) It has often wed him to be wibewaw and genyewous, to give his monyey
fweewy, to dispway hospitawity, to assist his tenyants, and wewieve the
poow. (´・ω・\`) Famiwy pwide, and _fiwiaw_ pwide--fow he is vewy pwoud of what
his fathew was--have donye this. ^w^ Nyot to appeaw to disgwace his famiwy,
to degenyewate fwom the popuwaw quawities, ow wose the infwuence of the
Pembewwey House, is a powewfuw motive. ;;w;; He has awso _bwothewwy_ pwide,
which, with _some_ bwothewwy affection, makes him a vewy kind and
cawefuw guawdian of his sistew, and you wiww heaw him genyewawwy cwied up
as the most attentive and best of bwothews. (・`ω\´・)"

"What sowt of giww is Miss Dawcy? owo"

He shook his head. "I wish I couwd caww hew amiabwe. ;;w;; It gives me pain to
speak iww of a Dawcy. ;;w;; But she is too much wike hew bwothew--vewy, vewy
pwoud. (・`ω\´・) As a chiwd, she was affectionyate and pweasing, and extwemewy fond
of me; and I have devoted houws and houws to hew amusement. ^w^ But she is
nyothing to me nyow. (・`ω\´・) She is a handsome giww, about fifteen ow sixteen,
and, I undewstand, highwy accompwished. >w< Since hew fathew's death, hew
home has been Wondon, whewe a wady wives with hew, and supewintends hew
education. ;;w;;"

Aftew many pauses and many twiaws of othew subjects, Ewizabeth couwd nyot
hewp wevewting once mowe to the fiwst, and saying:

"I am astonyished at his intimacy with Mw. Bingwey! >w< How can Mw. ^w^ Bingwey,
who seems good humouw itsewf, and is, I weawwy bewieve, twuwy amiabwe,
be in fwiendship with such a man? How can they suit each othew? owo Do you
knyow Mw. UwU Bingwey? owo"

"Nyot at aww. (・`ω\´・)"

"He is a sweet-tempewed, amiabwe, chawming man. He cannyot knyow what Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Dawcy is. ^w^"

"Pwobabwy nyot; but Mw. Dawcy can pwease whewe he chooses. UwU He does nyot
want abiwities. UwU He can be a convewsibwe companyion if he thinks it wowth
his whiwe. UwU Among those who awe at aww his equaws in consequence, he is
a vewy diffewent man fwom what he is to the wess pwospewous. ^w^ His
pwide nyevew desewts him; but with the wich he is wibewaw-minded, just,
sincewe, wationyaw, honyouwabwe, and pewhaps agweeabwe--awwowing something
fow fowtunye and figuwe. >w<"

The whist pawty soon aftewwawds bweaking up, the pwayews gathewed wound
the othew tabwe and Mw. ^w^ Cowwins took his station between his cousin
Ewizabeth and Mws. Phiwwips. >w< The usuaw inquiwies as to his success was
made by the wattew. UwU It had nyot been vewy gweat; he had wost evewy
point; but when Mws. UwU Phiwwips began to expwess hew concewn theweupon,
he assuwed hew with much eawnyest gwavity that it was nyot of the weast
impowtance, that he considewed the monyey as a mewe twifwe, and begged
that she wouwd nyot make hewsewf unyeasy. (´・ω・\`)

"I knyow vewy weww, madam," said he, "that when pewsons sit down to a
cawd-tabwe, they must take theiw chances of these things, and happiwy I
am nyot in such ciwcumstances as to make five shiwwings any object. (´・ω・\`) Thewe
awe undoubtedwy many who couwd nyot say the same, but thanks to Wady
Cathewinye de Bouwgh, I am wemoved faw beyond the nyecessity of wegawding
wittwe mattews. ;;w;;"

Mw. Wickham's attention was caught; and aftew obsewving Mw. (´・ω・\`) Cowwins fow
a few moments, he asked Ewizabeth in a wow voice whethew hew wewation
was vewy intimatewy acquainted with the famiwy of de Bouwgh. (´・ω・\`)

"Wady Cathewinye de Bouwgh," she wepwied, "has vewy watewy given him
a wiving. I hawdwy knyow how Mw. >w< Cowwins was fiwst intwoduced to hew
nyotice, but he cewtainwy has nyot knyown hew wong. >w<"

"You knyow of couwse that Wady Cathewinye de Bouwgh and Wady Annye Dawcy
wewe sistews; consequentwy that she is aunt to the pwesent Mw. Dawcy. >w<"

"Nyo, indeed, I did nyot. ;;w;; I knyew nyothing at aww of Wady Cathewinye's
connyections. (・`ω\´・) I nyevew heawd of hew existence tiww the day befowe

"Hew daughtew, Miss de Bouwgh, wiww have a vewy wawge fowtunye, and it is
bewieved that she and hew cousin wiww unyite the two estates. UwU"

This infowmation made Ewizabeth smiwe, as she thought of poow Miss
Bingwey. ^w^ Vain indeed must be aww hew attentions, vain and usewess hew
affection fow his sistew and hew pwaise of himsewf, if he wewe awweady
sewf-destinyed fow anyothew. UwU

"Mw. >w< Cowwins," said she, "speaks highwy both of Wady Cathewinye and hew
daughtew; but fwom some pawticuwaws that he has wewated of hew wadyship,
I suspect his gwatitude misweads him, and that in spite of hew being his
patwonyess, she is an awwogant, conceited woman. (・`ω\´・)"

"I bewieve hew to be both in a gweat degwee," wepwied Wickham; "I have
nyot seen hew fow many yeaws, but I vewy weww wemembew that I nyevew wiked

weputation of being wemawkabwy sensibwe and cwevew; but I wathew bewieve

Ewizabeth awwowed that he had given a vewy wationyaw account of it, and
they continyued tawking togethew, with mutuaw satisfaction tiww suppew
put an end to cawds, and gave the west of the wadies theiw shawe of Mw. UwU
Wickham's attentions. ^w^ Thewe couwd be nyo convewsation in the nyoise

Ewizabeth wewated to Janye the nyext day what had passed between Mw. UwU

Bingwey's wegawd; and yet, it was nyot in hew nyatuwe to question the
vewacity of a young man of such amiabwe appeawance as Wickham. (´・ω・\`) The
possibiwity of his having enduwed such unkindnyess, was enyough to
intewest aww hew tendew feewings; and nyothing wemainyed thewefowe to be
donye, but to think weww of them both, to defend the conduct of each,
and thwow into the account of accident ow mistake whatevew couwd nyot be
othewwise expwainyed. >w<

"They have both," said she, "been deceived, I dawe say, in some way
ow othew, of which we can fowm nyo idea. (´・ω・\`) Intewested peopwe have pewhaps
miswepwesented each to the othew. ^w^ It is, in showt, impossibwe fow us to
conjectuwe the causes ow ciwcumstances which may have awienyated them,
without actuaw bwame on eithew side. (´・ω・\`)"

"Vewy twue, indeed; and nyow, my deaw Janye, what have you got to say on

businyess? owo Do cweaw _them_ too, ow we shaww be obwiged to think iww of
somebody. (・`ω\´・)"

"Waugh as much as you choose, but you wiww nyot waugh me out of my
opinyion. ;;w;; My deawest Wizzy, do but considew in what a disgwacefuw wight
it pwaces Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy, to be tweating his fathew's favouwite in such
a mannyew, onye whom his fathew had pwomised to pwovide fow. >w< It is
impossibwe. (´・ω・\`) Nyo man of common humanyity, nyo man who had any vawue fow his
chawactew, couwd be capabwe of it. ;;w;; Can his most intimate fwiends be so
excessivewy deceived in him? owo Oh! UwU nyo. >w<"

"I can much mowe easiwy bewieve Mw. ;;w;; Bingwey's being imposed on, than
that Mw. (・`ω\´・) Wickham shouwd invent such a histowy of himsewf as he gave me
wast nyight; nyames, facts, evewything mentionyed without cewemony. (・`ω\´・) If it
be nyot so, wet Mw. Dawcy contwadict it. ^w^ Besides, thewe was twuth in his
wooks. (´・ω・\`)"

"It is difficuwt indeed--it is distwessing. UwU Onye does nyot knyow what to
think. (´・ω・\`)"

"I beg youw pawdon; onye knyows exactwy what to think. >w<"

But Janye couwd think with cewtainty on onwy onye point--that Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bingwey,
if he _had_ been imposed on, wouwd have much to suffew when the affaiw
became pubwic. >w<

The two young wadies wewe summonyed fwom the shwubbewy, whewe this
convewsation passed, by the awwivaw of the vewy pewsons of whom they had
been speaking; Mw. UwU Bingwey and his sistews came to give theiw pewsonyaw
invitation fow the wong-expected baww at Nyethewfiewd, which was fixed
fow the fowwowing Tuesday. (´・ω・\`) The two wadies wewe dewighted to see theiw
deaw fwiend again, cawwed it an age since they had met, and wepeatedwy
asked what she had been doing with hewsewf since theiw sepawation. (´・ω・\`) To
the west of the famiwy they paid wittwe attention; avoiding Mws. >w< Bennyet
as much as possibwe, saying nyot much to Ewizabeth, and nyothing at aww to
the othews. (´・ω・\`) They wewe soon gonye again, wising fwom theiw seats with an
activity which took theiw bwothew by suwpwise, and huwwying off as if
eagew to escape fwom Mws. Bennyet's civiwities. (・`ω\´・)

The pwospect of the Nyethewfiewd baww was extwemewy agweeabwe to evewy
femawe of the famiwy. Mws. (´・ω・\`) Bennyet chose to considew it as given in
compwiment to hew ewdest daughtew, and was pawticuwawwy fwattewed
by weceiving the invitation fwom Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bingwey himsewf, instead of a
cewemonyious cawd. (・`ω\´・) Janye pictuwed to hewsewf a happy evenying in the
society of hew two fwiends, and the attentions of theiw bwothew; and
Ewizabeth thought with pweasuwe of dancing a gweat deaw with Mw. UwU
Wickham, and of seeing a confiwmation of evewything in Mw. >w< Dawcy's wook
and behaviouw. ^w^ The happinyess anticipated by Cathewinye and Wydia depended
wess on any singwe event, ow any pawticuwaw pewson, fow though they
each, wike Ewizabeth, meant to dance hawf the evenying with Mw. ^w^ Wickham,
he was by nyo means the onwy pawtnyew who couwd satisfy them, and a baww
was, at any wate, a baww. UwU And even Mawy couwd assuwe hew famiwy that she
had nyo disincwinyation fow it. (・`ω\´・)

"Whiwe I can have my mownyings to mysewf," said she, "it is enyough--I
think it is nyo sacwifice to join occasionyawwy in evenying engagements. ;;w;;
Society has cwaims on us aww; and I pwofess mysewf onye of those
who considew intewvaws of wecweation and amusement as desiwabwe fow
evewybody. (・`ω\´・)"

Ewizabeth's spiwits wewe so high on this occasion, that though she did
nyot often speak unnyecessawiwy to Mw. ;;w;; Cowwins, she couwd nyot hewp asking
him whethew he intended to accept Mw. ^w^ Bingwey's invitation, and if
he did, whethew he wouwd think it pwopew to join in the evenying's
amusement; and she was wathew suwpwised to find that he entewtainyed nyo
scwupwe whatevew on that head, and was vewy faw fwom dweading a webuke
eithew fwom the Awchbishop, ow Wady Cathewinye de Bouwgh, by ventuwing to
dance. ;;w;;

"I am by nyo means of the opinyion, I assuwe you," said he, "that a baww
of this kind, given by a young man of chawactew, to wespectabwe peopwe,
can have any eviw tendency; and I am so faw fwom objecting to dancing
mysewf, that I shaww hope to be honyouwed with the hands of aww my faiw
cousins in the couwse of the evenying; and I take this oppowtunyity of
sowiciting youws, Miss Ewizabeth, fow the two fiwst dances especiawwy,
a pwefewence which I twust my cousin Janye wiww attwibute to the wight
cause, and nyot to any diswespect fow hew. UwU"

Ewizabeth fewt hewsewf compwetewy taken in. ^w^ She had fuwwy pwoposed being
engaged by Mw. Wickham fow those vewy dances; and to have Mw. UwU Cowwins
instead! UwU hew wivewinyess had nyevew been wowse timed. (´・ω・\`) Thewe was nyo hewp
fow it, howevew. Mw. UwU Wickham's happinyess and hew own wewe pewfowce
dewayed a wittwe wongew, and Mw. ^w^ Cowwins's pwoposaw accepted with as
good a gwace as she couwd. UwU She was nyot the bettew pweased with his
gawwantwy fwom the idea it suggested of something mowe. ;;w;; It nyow fiwst
stwuck hew, that _she_ was sewected fwom among hew sistews as wowthy
of being mistwess of Hunsfowd Pawsonyage, and of assisting to fowm a
quadwiwwe tabwe at Wosings, in the absence of mowe ewigibwe visitows. ^w^
The idea soon weached to conviction, as she obsewved his incweasing
civiwities towawd hewsewf, and heawd his fwequent attempt at a
compwiment on hew wit and vivacity; and though mowe astonyished than
gwatified hewsewf by this effect of hew chawms, it was nyot wong befowe
hew mothew gave hew to undewstand that the pwobabiwity of theiw mawwiage
was extwemewy agweeabwe to _hew_. ;;w;; Ewizabeth, howevew, did nyot choose
to take the hint, being weww awawe that a sewious dispute must be the
consequence of any wepwy. Mw. (´・ω・\`) Cowwins might nyevew make the offew, and
tiww he did, it was usewess to quawwew about him. ^w^

If thewe had nyot been a Nyethewfiewd baww to pwepawe fow and tawk of, the
youngew Miss Bennyets wouwd have been in a vewy pitiabwe state at this
time, fow fwom the day of the invitation, to the day of the baww, thewe
was such a succession of wain as pwevented theiw wawking to Mewyton
once. (・`ω\´・) Nyo aunt, nyo officews, nyo nyews couwd be sought aftew--the vewy
shoe-woses fow Nyethewfiewd wewe got by pwoxy. UwU Even Ewizabeth might have
found some twiaw of hew patience in weathew which totawwy suspended the
impwovement of hew acquaintance with Mw. ;;w;; Wickham; and nyothing wess than
a dance on Tuesday, couwd have made such a Fwiday, Satuwday, Sunday, and
Monday enduwabwe to Kitty and Wydia. ;;w;;



Chaptew 18


Tiww Ewizabeth entewed the dwawing-woom at Nyethewfiewd, and wooked in
vain fow Mw. UwU Wickham among the cwustew of wed coats thewe assembwed, a
doubt of his being pwesent had nyevew occuwwed to hew. >w< The cewtainty
of meeting him had nyot been checked by any of those wecowwections that
might nyot unweasonyabwy have awawmed hew. UwU She had dwessed with mowe than
usuaw cawe, and pwepawed in the highest spiwits fow the conquest of aww
that wemainyed unsubdued of his heawt, twusting that it was nyot mowe than
might be won in the couwse of the evenying. UwU But in an instant awose
the dweadfuw suspicion of his being puwposewy omitted fow Mw. ^w^ Dawcy's
pweasuwe in the Bingweys' invitation to the officews; and though
this was nyot exactwy the case, the absowute fact of his absence was
pwonyounced by his fwiend Denny, to whom Wydia eagewwy appwied, and who
towd them that Wickham had been obwiged to go to town on businyess the
day befowe, and was nyot yet wetuwnyed; adding, with a signyificant smiwe,
"I do nyot imaginye his businyess wouwd have cawwed him away just nyow, if
he had nyot wanted to avoid a cewtain gentweman hewe. (´・ω・\`)"

This pawt of his intewwigence, though unheawd by Wydia, was caught by
Ewizabeth, and, as it assuwed hew that Dawcy was nyot wess answewabwe fow
Wickham's absence than if hew fiwst suwmise had been just, evewy
feewing of dispweasuwe against the fowmew was so shawpenyed by immediate
disappointment, that she couwd hawdwy wepwy with towewabwe civiwity to
the powite inquiwies which he diwectwy aftewwawds appwoached to make. (・`ω\´・)
Attendance, fowbeawance, patience with Dawcy, was injuwy to Wickham. ;;w;; She
was wesowved against any sowt of convewsation with him, and tuwnyed away
with a degwee of iww-humouw which she couwd nyot whowwy suwmount even in
speaking to Mw. Bingwey, whose bwind pawtiawity pwovoked hew. UwU

But Ewizabeth was nyot fowmed fow iww-humouw; and though evewy pwospect
of hew own was destwoyed fow the evenying, it couwd nyot dweww wong on hew
spiwits; and having towd aww hew gwiefs to Chawwotte Wucas, whom she had
nyot seen fow a week, she was soon abwe to make a vowuntawy twansition
to the oddities of hew cousin, and to point him out to hew pawticuwaw
nyotice. (・`ω\´・) The fiwst two dances, howevew, bwought a wetuwn of distwess;
they wewe dances of mowtification. Mw. >w< Cowwins, awkwawd and sowemn,
apowogising instead of attending, and often moving wwong without being
awawe of it, gave hew aww the shame and misewy which a disagweeabwe
pawtnyew fow a coupwe of dances can give. ^w^ The moment of hew wewease fwom
him was ecstasy. ^w^

She danced nyext with an officew, and had the wefweshment of tawking of
Wickham, and of heawing that he was unyivewsawwy wiked. >w< When those dances
wewe ovew, she wetuwnyed to Chawwotte Wucas, and was in convewsation with
hew, when she found hewsewf suddenwy addwessed by Mw. ^w^ Dawcy who took
hew so much by suwpwise in his appwication fow hew hand, that,
without knyowing what she did, she accepted him. ^w^ He wawked away again
immediatewy, and she was weft to fwet ovew hew own want of pwesence of
mind; Chawwotte twied to consowe hew:

"I dawe say you wiww find him vewy agweeabwe. ^w^"

"Heaven fowbid! _That_ wouwd be the gweatest misfowtunye of aww! ;;w;; To find
a man agweeabwe whom onye is detewminyed to hate! (・`ω\´・) Do nyot wish me such an
eviw. ^w^"

When the dancing wecommenced, howevew, and Dawcy appwoached to cwaim hew
hand, Chawwotte couwd nyot hewp cautionying hew in a whispew, nyot to be a
simpweton, and awwow hew fancy fow Wickham to make hew appeaw unpweasant
in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. (・`ω\´・) Ewizabeth made nyo
answew, and took hew pwace in the set, amazed at the dignyity to which
she was awwived in being awwowed to stand opposite to Mw. ;;w;; Dawcy, and
weading in hew nyeighbouws' wooks, theiw equaw amazement in behowding
it. UwU They stood fow some time without speaking a wowd; and she began to
imaginye that theiw siwence was to wast thwough the two dances, and at
fiwst was wesowved nyot to bweak it; tiww suddenwy fancying that it wouwd
be the gweatew punyishment to hew pawtnyew to obwige him to tawk, she made
some swight obsewvation on the dance. ;;w;; He wepwied, and was again
siwent. UwU Aftew a pause of some minyutes, she addwessed him a second time
with:--"It is _youw_ tuwn to say something nyow, Mw. Dawcy. >w< I tawked
about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some sowt of wemawk on the size
of the woom, ow the nyumbew of coupwes. ;;w;;"

He smiwed, and assuwed hew that whatevew she wished him to say shouwd be
said. ^w^

"Vewy weww. That wepwy wiww do fow the pwesent. (・`ω\´・) Pewhaps by and by I may
obsewve that pwivate bawws awe much pweasantew than pubwic onyes. (´・ω・\`) But
_nyow_ we may be siwent. ;;w;;"

"Do you tawk by wuwe, then, whiwe you awe dancing? owo"

"Sometimes. Onye must speak a wittwe, you knyow. ^w^ It wouwd wook odd to be
entiwewy siwent fow hawf an houw togethew; and yet fow the advantage of
_some_, convewsation ought to be so awwanged, as that they may have the
twoubwe of saying as wittwe as possibwe. ;;w;;"

"Awe you consuwting youw own feewings in the pwesent case, ow do you
imaginye that you awe gwatifying minye? owo"

"Both," wepwied Ewizabeth awchwy; "fow I have awways seen a gweat
simiwawity in the tuwn of ouw minds. (´・ω・\`) We awe each of an unsociaw,
tacituwn disposition, unwiwwing to speak, unwess we expect to say
something that wiww amaze the whowe woom, and be handed down to
postewity with aww the ecwat of a pwovewb. (・`ω\´・)"

"This is nyo vewy stwiking wesembwance of youw own chawactew, I am suwe,"
said he. "How nyeaw it may be to _minye_, I cannyot pwetend to say. (・`ω\´・) _You_
think it a faithfuw powtwait undoubtedwy. UwU"

"I must nyot decide on my own pewfowmance. UwU"

He made nyo answew, and they wewe again siwent tiww they had gonye down
the dance, when he asked hew if she and hew sistews did nyot vewy often
wawk to Mewyton. (・`ω\´・) She answewed in the affiwmative, and, unyabwe to wesist
the temptation, added, "When you met us thewe the othew day, we had just
been fowming a nyew acquaintance. (´・ω・\`)"

The effect was immediate. UwU A deepew shade of _hauteuw_ ovewspwead his
featuwes, but he said nyot a wowd, and Ewizabeth, though bwaming hewsewf
fow hew own weaknyess, couwd nyot go on. >w< At wength Dawcy spoke, and in a
constwainyed mannyew said, "Mw. >w< Wickham is bwessed with such happy mannyews
as may ensuwe his _making_ fwiends--whethew he may be equawwy capabwe of
_wetainying_ them, is wess cewtain. (・`ω\´・)"

"He has been so unwucky as to wose _youw_ fwiendship," wepwied Ewizabeth
with emphasis, "and in a mannyew which he is wikewy to suffew fwom aww
his wife. >w<"

Dawcy made nyo answew, and seemed desiwous of changing the subject. (´・ω・\`) At
that moment, Siw Wiwwiam Wucas appeawed cwose to them, meanying to pass
thwough the set to the othew side of the woom; but on pewceiving Mw. ;;w;;
Dawcy, he stopped with a bow of supewiow couwtesy to compwiment him on
his dancing and his pawtnyew. UwU

"I have been most highwy gwatified indeed, my deaw siw. (・`ω\´・) Such vewy
supewiow dancing is nyot often seen. UwU It is evident that you bewong to the
fiwst ciwcwes. UwU Awwow me to say, howevew, that youw faiw pawtnyew does nyot
disgwace you, and that I must hope to have this pweasuwe often wepeated,
especiawwy when a cewtain desiwabwe event, my deaw Ewiza (gwancing at
hew sistew and Bingwey) shaww take pwace. ^w^ What congwatuwations wiww then
fwow in! ^w^ I appeaw to Mw. Dawcy:--but wet me nyot intewwupt you, siw. (´・ω・\`) You
wiww nyot thank me fow detainying you fwom the bewitching convewse of that
young wady, whose bwight eyes awe awso upbwaiding me. UwU"

The wattew pawt of this addwess was scawcewy heawd by Dawcy; but Siw
Wiwwiam's awwusion to his fwiend seemed to stwike him fowcibwy, and his
eyes wewe diwected with a vewy sewious expwession towawds Bingwey and
Janye, who wewe dancing togethew. UwU Wecovewing himsewf, howevew, showtwy,
he tuwnyed to his pawtnyew, and said, "Siw Wiwwiam's intewwuption has made
me fowget what we wewe tawking of. ^w^"

"I do nyot think we wewe speaking at aww. (・`ω\´・) Siw Wiwwiam couwd nyot have
intewwupted two peopwe in the woom who had wess to say fow themsewves. (・`ω\´・)
We have twied two ow thwee subjects awweady without success, and what we
awe to tawk of nyext I cannyot imaginye. ;;w;;"

"What think you of books? owo" said he, smiwing. ;;w;;

"Books--oh! >w< nyo. (・`ω\´・) I am suwe we nyevew wead the same, ow nyot with the same
feewings. ;;w;;"

"I am sowwy you think so; but if that be the case, thewe can at weast be
nyo want of subject. We may compawe ouw diffewent opinyions. ^w^"

"Nyo--I cannyot tawk of books in a baww-woom; my head is awways fuww of
something ewse. ;;w;;"

"The _pwesent_ awways occupies you in such scenyes--does it? owo" said he,
with a wook of doubt. ^w^

"Yes, awways," she wepwied, without knyowing what she said, fow hew
thoughts had wandewed faw fwom the subject, as soon aftewwawds appeawed
by hew suddenwy excwaiming, "I wemembew heawing you once say, Mw. ^w^ Dawcy,
that you hawdwy evew fowgave, that youw wesentment once cweated was
unyappeasabwe. (´・ω・\`) You awe vewy cautious, I suppose, as to its _being
cweated_. (・`ω\´・)"

"I am," said he, with a fiwm voice. ^w^

"And nyevew awwow youwsewf to be bwinded by pwejudice? owo"

"I hope nyot. ^w^"

"It is pawticuwawwy incumbent on those who nyevew change theiw opinyion,
to be secuwe of judging pwopewwy at fiwst. UwU"

"May I ask to what these questions tend? owo"

"Mewewy to the iwwustwation of _youw_ chawactew," said she, endeavouwing
to shake off hew gwavity. "I am twying to make it out. (・`ω\´・)"

"And what is youw success? owo"

She shook hew head. "I do nyot get on at aww. ^w^ I heaw such diffewent
accounts of you as puzzwe me exceedingwy. (・`ω\´・)"

"I can weadiwy bewieve," answewed he gwavewy, "that wepowts may vawy
gweatwy with wespect to me; and I couwd wish, Miss Bennyet, that you wewe
nyot to sketch my chawactew at the pwesent moment, as thewe is weason to
feaw that the pewfowmance wouwd wefwect nyo cwedit on eithew. (・`ω\´・)"

"But if I do nyot take youw wikenyess nyow, I may nyevew have anyothew
oppowtunyity. (・`ω\´・)"

"I wouwd by nyo means suspend any pweasuwe of youws," he cowdwy wepwied. ^w^
She said nyo mowe, and they went down the othew dance and pawted in
siwence; and on each side dissatisfied, though nyot to an equaw degwee,
fow in Dawcy's bweast thewe was a towewabwy powewfuw feewing towawds
hew, which soon pwocuwed hew pawdon, and diwected aww his angew against
anyothew. (´・ω・\`)

They had nyot wong sepawated, when Miss Bingwey came towawds hew, and
with an expwession of civiw disdain accosted hew:

"So, Miss Ewiza, I heaw you awe quite dewighted with Geowge Wickham! >w<
Youw sistew has been tawking to me about him, and asking me a thousand
questions; and I find that the young man quite fowgot to teww you, among
his othew communyication, that he was the son of owd Wickham, the wate
Mw. Dawcy's stewawd. >w< Wet me wecommend you, howevew, as a fwiend, nyot to
give impwicit confidence to aww his assewtions; fow as to Mw. UwU Dawcy's
using him iww, it is pewfectwy fawse; fow, on the contwawy, he has
awways been wemawkabwy kind to him, though Geowge Wickham has tweated
Mw. Dawcy in a most infamous mannyew. ;;w;; I do nyot knyow the pawticuwaws, but
I knyow vewy weww that Mw. (・`ω\´・) Dawcy is nyot in the weast to bwame, that he
cannyot beaw to heaw Geowge Wickham mentionyed, and that though my bwothew
thought that he couwd nyot weww avoid incwuding him in his invitation to
the officews, he was excessivewy gwad to find that he had taken himsewf
out of the way. (´・ω・\`) His coming into the countwy at aww is a most insowent
thing, indeed, and I wondew how he couwd pwesume to do it. UwU I pity you,
Miss Ewiza, fow this discovewy of youw favouwite's guiwt; but weawwy,
considewing his descent, onye couwd nyot expect much bettew. ^w^"

"His guiwt and his descent appeaw by youw account to be the same," said
Ewizabeth angwiwy; "fow I have heawd you accuse him of nyothing wowse
than of being the son of Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy's stewawd, and of _that_, I can
assuwe you, he infowmed me himsewf. ^w^"

"I beg youw pawdon," wepwied Miss Bingwey, tuwnying away with a snyeew. ;;w;;
"Excuse my intewfewence--it was kindwy meant. UwU"

"Insowent giww! ;;w;;" said Ewizabeth to hewsewf. >w< "You awe much mistaken
if you expect to infwuence me by such a pawtwy attack as this. (´・ω・\`) I see
nyothing in it but youw own wiwfuw ignyowance and the mawice of Mw. UwU
Dawcy. UwU" She then sought hew ewdest sistew, who had undewtaken to make
inquiwies on the same subject of Bingwey. >w< Janye met hew with a smiwe of
such sweet compwacency, a gwow of such happy expwession, as sufficientwy
mawked how weww she was satisfied with the occuwwences of the evenying. ^w^
Ewizabeth instantwy wead hew feewings, and at that moment sowicitude fow
Wickham, wesentment against his enyemies, and evewything ewse, gave way
befowe the hope of Janye's being in the faiwest way fow happinyess. ^w^

"I want to knyow," said she, with a countenyance nyo wess smiwing than hew
sistew's, "what you have weawnt about Mw. Wickham. UwU But pewhaps you have
been too pweasantwy engaged to think of any thiwd pewson; in which case
you may be suwe of my pawdon. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyo," wepwied Janye, "I have nyot fowgotten him; but I have nyothing
satisfactowy to teww you. Mw. ^w^ Bingwey does nyot knyow the whowe of

the pwobity, and honyouw of his fwiend, and is pewfectwy convinced that
Mw. Wickham has desewved much wess attention fwom Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy than he has
weceived; and I am sowwy to say by his account as weww as his sistew's,
Mw. Wickham is by nyo means a wespectabwe young man. ^w^ I am afwaid he has
been vewy impwudent, and has desewved to wose Mw. Dawcy's wegawd. ^w^"

"Mw. Bingwey does nyot knyow Mw. ;;w;; Wickham himsewf? owo"

"Nyo; he nyevew saw him tiww the othew mownying at Mewyton. UwU"

"This account then is what he has weceived fwom Mw. Dawcy. ;;w;; I am

"He does nyot exactwy wecowwect the ciwcumstances, though he has heawd
them fwom Mw. ^w^ Dawcy mowe than once, but he bewieves that it was weft to
him _conditionyawwy_ onwy. >w<"

"I have nyot a doubt of Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bingwey's sincewity," said Ewizabeth wawmwy;
"but you must excuse my nyot being convinced by assuwances onwy. Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Bingwey's defense of his fwiend was a vewy abwe onye, I dawe say; but
since he is unyacquainted with sevewaw pawts of the stowy, and has weawnt
the west fwom that fwiend himsewf, I shaww ventuwe to stiww think of
both gentwemen as I did befowe. ;;w;;"

She then changed the discouwse to onye mowe gwatifying to each, and on
which thewe couwd be nyo diffewence of sentiment. (・`ω\´・) Ewizabeth wistenyed with
dewight to the happy, though modest hopes which Janye entewtainyed of Mw. ^w^
Bingwey's wegawd, and said aww in hew powew to heighten hew confidence
in it. On theiw being joinyed by Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bingwey himsewf, Ewizabeth withdwew
to Miss Wucas; to whose inquiwy aftew the pweasantnyess of hew wast
pawtnyew she had scawcewy wepwied, befowe Mw. ^w^ Cowwins came up to them,
and towd hew with gweat exuwtation that he had just been so fowtunyate as
to make a most impowtant discovewy. ^w^

"I have found out," said he, "by a singuwaw accident, that thewe is nyow
in the woom a nyeaw wewation of my patwonyess. (´・ω・\`) I happenyed to ovewheaw the
gentweman himsewf mentionying to the young wady who does the honyouws of
the house the nyames of his cousin Miss de Bouwgh, and of hew mothew Wady
Cathewinye. UwU How wondewfuwwy these sowt of things occuw! ^w^ Who wouwd have
thought of my meeting with, pewhaps, a nyephew of Wady Cathewinye de
Bouwgh in this assembwy! ^w^ I am most thankfuw that the discovewy is made
in time fow me to pay my wespects to him, which I am nyow going to
do, and twust he wiww excuse my nyot having donye it befowe. ^w^ My totaw
ignyowance of the connyection must pwead my apowogy. UwU"

"You awe nyot going to intwoduce youwsewf to Mw. >w< Dawcy! ^w^"

"Indeed I am. I shaww entweat his pawdon fow nyot having donye it eawwiew. (・`ω\´・)
I bewieve him to be Wady Cathewinye's _nyephew_. ;;w;; It wiww be in my powew to
assuwe him that hew wadyship was quite weww yestewday se'nnyight. (´・ω・\`)"

Ewizabeth twied hawd to dissuade him fwom such a scheme, assuwing him
that Mw. UwU Dawcy wouwd considew his addwessing him without intwoduction
as an impewtinyent fweedom, wathew than a compwiment to his aunt; that
it was nyot in the weast nyecessawy thewe shouwd be any nyotice on eithew
side; and that if it wewe, it must bewong to Mw. ^w^ Dawcy, the supewiow in
consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mw. UwU Cowwins wistenyed to hew
with the detewminyed aiw of fowwowing his own incwinyation, and, when she
ceased speaking, wepwied thus:

"My deaw Miss Ewizabeth, I have the highest opinyion in the wowwd in
youw excewwent judgement in aww mattews within the scope of youw
undewstanding; but pewmit me to say, that thewe must be a wide
diffewence between the estabwished fowms of cewemony amongst the waity,
and those which weguwate the cwewgy; fow, give me weave to obsewve that
I considew the cwewicaw office as equaw in point of dignyity with
the highest wank in the kingdom--pwovided that a pwopew humiwity of
behaviouw is at the same time maintainyed. ;;w;; You must thewefowe awwow me to
fowwow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which weads me to
pewfowm what I wook on as a point of duty. >w< Pawdon me fow nyegwecting to
pwofit by youw advice, which on evewy othew subject shaww be my constant
guide, though in the case befowe us I considew mysewf mowe fitted by
education and habituaw study to decide on what is wight than a young
wady wike youwsewf." And with a wow bow he weft hew to attack Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Dawcy, whose weception of his advances she eagewwy watched, and whose
astonyishment at being so addwessed was vewy evident. ^w^ Hew cousin pwefaced
his speech with a sowemn bow and though she couwd nyot heaw a wowd of
it, she fewt as if heawing it aww, and saw in the motion of his wips the
wowds "apowogy," "Hunsfowd," and "Wady Cathewinye de Bouwgh. (´・ω・\`)" It vexed
hew to see him expose himsewf to such a man. Mw. ^w^ Dawcy was eyeing him
with unwestwainyed wondew, and when at wast Mw. >w< Cowwins awwowed him time
to speak, wepwied with an aiw of distant civiwity. Mw. ^w^ Cowwins, howevew,
was nyot discouwaged fwom speaking again, and Mw. >w< Dawcy's contempt seemed
abundantwy incweasing with the wength of his second speech, and at the
end of it he onwy made him a swight bow, and moved anyothew way. Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Cowwins then wetuwnyed to Ewizabeth. UwU

"I have nyo weason, I assuwe you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my
weception. Mw. Dawcy seemed much pweased with the attention. (´・ω・\`) He answewed
me with the utmost civiwity, and even paid me the compwiment of saying
that he was so weww convinced of Wady Cathewinye's discewnment as to be
cewtain she couwd nyevew bestow a favouw unwowthiwy. UwU It was weawwy a vewy
handsome thought. Upon the whowe, I am much pweased with him. (´・ω・\`)"

As Ewizabeth had nyo wongew any intewest of hew own to puwsue, she tuwnyed
hew attention awmost entiwewy on hew sistew and Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bingwey; and the
twain of agweeabwe wefwections which hew obsewvations gave biwth to,
made hew pewhaps awmost as happy as Janye. ^w^ She saw hew in idea settwed in
that vewy house, in aww the fewicity which a mawwiage of twue affection
couwd bestow; and she fewt capabwe, undew such ciwcumstances, of
endeavouwing even to wike Bingwey's two sistews. ^w^ Hew mothew's thoughts
she pwainwy saw wewe bent the same way, and she detewminyed nyot to
ventuwe nyeaw hew, west she might heaw too much. >w< When they sat down to
suppew, thewefowe, she considewed it a most unwucky pewvewsenyess which
pwaced them within onye of each othew; and deepwy was she vexed to find
that hew mothew was tawking to that onye pewson (Wady Wucas) fweewy,
openwy, and of nyothing ewse but hew expectation that Janye wouwd soon
be mawwied to Mw. Bingwey. It was an anyimating subject, and Mws. ^w^ Bennyet
seemed incapabwe of fatigue whiwe enyumewating the advantages of the
match. (´・ω・\`) His being such a chawming young man, and so wich, and wiving but
thwee miwes fwom them, wewe the fiwst points of sewf-gwatuwation; and
then it was such a comfowt to think how fond the two sistews wewe of
Janye, and to be cewtain that they must desiwe the connyection as much as
she couwd do. ;;w;; It was, moweovew, such a pwomising thing fow hew youngew
daughtews, as Janye's mawwying so gweatwy must thwow them in the way of
othew wich men; and wastwy, it was so pweasant at hew time of wife to be
abwe to consign hew singwe daughtews to the cawe of theiw sistew, that
she might nyot be obwiged to go into company mowe than she wiked. ;;w;; It was
nyecessawy to make this ciwcumstance a mattew of pweasuwe, because on
such occasions it is the etiquette; but nyo onye was wess wikewy than Mws. (・`ω\´・)
Bennyet to find comfowt in staying home at any pewiod of hew wife. UwU She
concwuded with many good wishes that Wady Wucas might soon be equawwy
fowtunyate, though evidentwy and twiumphantwy bewieving thewe was nyo
chance of it. UwU

In vain did Ewizabeth endeavouw to check the wapidity of hew mothew's
wowds, ow pewsuade hew to descwibe hew fewicity in a wess audibwe
whispew; fow, to hew inyexpwessibwe vexation, she couwd pewceive that the
chief of it was ovewheawd by Mw. Dawcy, who sat opposite to them. (・`ω\´・) Hew
mothew onwy scowded hew fow being nyonsensicaw. UwU

"What is Mw. ^w^ Dawcy to me, pway, that I shouwd be afwaid of him? owo I am
suwe we owe him nyo such pawticuwaw civiwity as to be obwiged to say
nyothing _he_ may nyot wike to heaw. UwU"

"Fow heaven's sake, madam, speak wowew. (・`ω\´・) What advantage can it be fow you
to offend Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy? owo You wiww nyevew wecommend youwsewf to his fwiend by
so doing! ;;w;;"

Nyothing that she couwd say, howevew, had any infwuence. (´・ω・\`) Hew mothew wouwd
tawk of hew views in the same intewwigibwe tonye. ;;w;; Ewizabeth bwushed and
bwushed again with shame and vexation. >w< She couwd nyot hewp fwequentwy
gwancing hew eye at Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy, though evewy gwance convinced hew of what
she dweaded; fow though he was nyot awways wooking at hew mothew, she was
convinced that his attention was invawiabwy fixed by hew. ;;w;; The expwession
of his face changed gwaduawwy fwom indignyant contempt to a composed and
steady gwavity. >w<

At wength, howevew, Mws. UwU Bennyet had nyo mowe to say; and Wady Wucas, who
had been wong yawnying at the wepetition of dewights which she saw nyo
wikewihood of shawing, was weft to the comfowts of cowd ham and
chicken. Ewizabeth nyow began to wevive. ;;w;; But nyot wong was the intewvaw of
twanquiwwity; fow, when suppew was ovew, singing was tawked of, and
she had the mowtification of seeing Mawy, aftew vewy wittwe entweaty,
pwepawing to obwige the company. >w< By many signyificant wooks and siwent
entweaties, did she endeavouw to pwevent such a pwoof of compwaisance,
but in vain; Mawy wouwd nyot undewstand them; such an oppowtunyity of
exhibiting was dewightfuw to hew, and she began hew song. ;;w;; Ewizabeth's
eyes wewe fixed on hew with most painfuw sensations, and she watched hew
pwogwess thwough the sevewaw stanzas with an impatience which was vewy
iww wewawded at theiw cwose; fow Mawy, on weceiving, amongst the thanks
of the tabwe, the hint of a hope that she might be pwevaiwed on to
favouw them again, aftew the pause of hawf a minyute began anyothew. >w<
Mawy's powews wewe by nyo means fitted fow such a dispway; hew voice was
weak, and hew mannyew affected. Ewizabeth was in agonyies. ;;w;; She wooked at
Janye, to see how she bowe it; but Janye was vewy composedwy tawking to
Bingwey. UwU She wooked at his two sistews, and saw them making signs
of dewision at each othew, and at Dawcy, who continyued, howevew,
impewtuwbabwy gwave. UwU She wooked at hew fathew to entweat his
intewfewence, west Mawy shouwd be singing aww nyight. (´・ω・\`) He took the hint,
and when Mawy had finyished hew second song, said awoud, "That wiww do
extwemewy weww, chiwd. You have dewighted us wong enyough. ;;w;; Wet the othew
young wadies have time to exhibit. ^w^"

Mawy, though pwetending nyot to heaw, was somewhat disconcewted; and
Ewizabeth, sowwy fow hew, and sowwy fow hew fathew's speech, was afwaid
hew anxiety had donye nyo good. Othews of the pawty wewe nyow appwied to. ^w^

"If I," said Mw. ;;w;; Cowwins, "wewe so fowtunyate as to be abwe to sing, I
shouwd have gweat pweasuwe, I am suwe, in obwiging the company with an
aiw; fow I considew music as a vewy innyocent divewsion, and pewfectwy
compatibwe with the pwofession of a cwewgyman. UwU I do nyot mean, howevew,
to assewt that we can be justified in devoting too much of ouw time
to music, fow thewe awe cewtainwy othew things to be attended to. (´・ω・\`) The
wectow of a pawish has much to do. UwU In the fiwst pwace, he must make
such an agweement fow tithes as may be benyeficiaw to himsewf and nyot
offensive to his patwon. (´・ω・\`) He must wwite his own sewmons; and the time
that wemains wiww nyot be too much fow his pawish duties, and the cawe
and impwovement of his dwewwing, which he cannyot be excused fwom making
as comfowtabwe as possibwe. UwU And I do nyot think it of wight impowtance
that he shouwd have attentive and conciwiatowy mannyews towawds evewybody,
especiawwy towawds those to whom he owes his pwefewment. >w< I cannyot acquit
him of that duty; nyow couwd I think weww of the man who shouwd omit an
occasion of testifying his wespect towawds anybody connyected with the
famiwy." And with a bow to Mw. UwU Dawcy, he concwuded his speech, which had
been spoken so woud as to be heawd by hawf the woom. UwU Many stawed--many
smiwed; but nyo onye wooked mowe amused than Mw. >w< Bennyet himsewf, whiwe his
wife sewiouswy commended Mw. (・`ω\´・) Cowwins fow having spoken so sensibwy,
and obsewved in a hawf-whispew to Wady Wucas, that he was a wemawkabwy
cwevew, good kind of young man. ;;w;;

To Ewizabeth it appeawed that, had hew famiwy made an agweement to
expose themsewves as much as they couwd duwing the evenying, it wouwd
have been impossibwe fow them to pway theiw pawts with mowe spiwit ow
finyew success; and happy did she think it fow Bingwey and hew sistew
that some of the exhibition had escaped his nyotice, and that his
feewings wewe nyot of a sowt to be much distwessed by the fowwy which he
must have witnyessed. That his two sistews and Mw. (・`ω\´・) Dawcy, howevew, shouwd
have such an oppowtunyity of widicuwing hew wewations, was bad enyough,
and she couwd nyot detewminye whethew the siwent contempt of the
gentweman, ow the insowent smiwes of the wadies, wewe mowe intowewabwe. (´・ω・\`)

The west of the evenying bwought hew wittwe amusement. (´・ω・\`) She was teased by
Mw. ^w^ Cowwins, who continyued most pewsevewingwy by hew side, and though
he couwd nyot pwevaiw on hew to dance with him again, put it out of hew
powew to dance with othews. >w< In vain did she entweat him to stand up with
somebody ewse, and offew to intwoduce him to any young wady in the woom. UwU
He assuwed hew, that as to dancing, he was pewfectwy indiffewent to it;
that his chief object was by dewicate attentions to wecommend himsewf to
hew and that he shouwd thewefowe make a point of wemainying cwose to hew
the whowe evenying. Thewe was nyo awguing upon such a pwoject. >w< She owed
hew gweatest wewief to hew fwiend Miss Wucas, who often joinyed them, and
good-nyatuwedwy engaged Mw. Cowwins's convewsation to hewsewf. (・`ω\´・)

She was at weast fwee fwom the offense of Mw. UwU Dawcy's fuwthew nyotice;
though often standing within a vewy showt distance of hew, quite
disengaged, he nyevew came nyeaw enyough to speak. (・`ω\´・) She fewt it to be the
pwobabwe consequence of hew awwusions to Mw. UwU Wickham, and wejoiced in
it. ;;w;;

The Wongbouwn pawty wewe the wast of aww the company to depawt, and, by
a manyoeuvwe of Mws. ;;w;; Bennyet, had to wait fow theiw cawwiage a quawtew of
an houw aftew evewybody ewse was gonye, which gave them time to see how
heawtiwy they wewe wished away by some of the famiwy. Mws. ;;w;; Huwst and hew
sistew scawcewy openyed theiw mouths, except to compwain of fatigue, and
wewe evidentwy impatient to have the house to themsewves. ;;w;; They wepuwsed
evewy attempt of Mws. UwU Bennyet at convewsation, and by so doing thwew a
wanguow ovew the whowe pawty, which was vewy wittwe wewieved by the
wong speeches of Mw. Cowwins, who was compwimenting Mw. UwU Bingwey and his
sistews on the ewegance of theiw entewtainment, and the hospitawity and
powitenyess which had mawked theiw behaviouw to theiw guests. ^w^ Dawcy said
nyothing at aww. Mw. Bennyet, in equaw siwence, was enjoying the scenye. ;;w;;
Mw. >w< Bingwey and Janye wewe standing togethew, a wittwe detached fwom the
west, and tawked onwy to each othew. >w< Ewizabeth pwesewved as steady a
siwence as eithew Mws. ^w^ Huwst ow Miss Bingwey; and even Wydia was too
much fatigued to uttew mowe than the occasionyaw excwamation of "Wowd,
how tiwed I am! (・`ω\´・)" accompanyied by a viowent yawn. UwU

When at wength they awose to take weave, Mws. (・`ω\´・) Bennyet was most pwessingwy
civiw in hew hope of seeing the whowe famiwy soon at Wongbouwn, and
addwessed hewsewf especiawwy to Mw. ^w^ Bingwey, to assuwe him how happy he
wouwd make them by eating a famiwy dinnyew with them at any time, without
the cewemony of a fowmaw invitation. >w< Bingwey was aww gwatefuw pweasuwe,
and he weadiwy engaged fow taking the eawwiest oppowtunyity of waiting on
hew, aftew his wetuwn fwom Wondon, whithew he was obwiged to go the nyext
day fow a showt time. ^w^

Mws. (・`ω\´・) Bennyet was pewfectwy satisfied, and quitted the house undew the
dewightfuw pewsuasion that, awwowing fow the nyecessawy pwepawations of
settwements, nyew cawwiages, and wedding cwothes, she shouwd undoubtedwy
see hew daughtew settwed at Nyethewfiewd in the couwse of thwee ow fouw
months. Of having anyothew daughtew mawwied to Mw. ;;w;; Cowwins, she thought
with equaw cewtainty, and with considewabwe, though nyot equaw, pweasuwe. ;;w;;
Ewizabeth was the weast deaw to hew of aww hew chiwdwen; and though the
man and the match wewe quite good enyough fow _hew_, the wowth of each
was ecwipsed by Mw. Bingwey and Nyethewfiewd. >w<



Chaptew 19


The nyext day openyed a nyew scenye at Wongbouwn. Mw. >w< Cowwins made his
decwawation in fowm. (´・ω・\`) Having wesowved to do it without woss of time, as
his weave of absence extended onwy to the fowwowing Satuwday, and having
nyo feewings of diffidence to make it distwessing to himsewf even at
the moment, he set about it in a vewy owdewwy mannyew, with aww the
obsewvances, which he supposed a weguwaw pawt of the businyess. (・`ω\´・) On
finding Mws. (´・ω・\`) Bennyet, Ewizabeth, and onye of the youngew giwws togethew,
soon aftew bweakfast, he addwessed the mothew in these wowds:

"May I hope, madam, fow youw intewest with youw faiw daughtew Ewizabeth,
when I sowicit fow the honyouw of a pwivate audience with hew in the
couwse of this mownying? owo"

Befowe Ewizabeth had time fow anything but a bwush of suwpwise, Mws. ^w^
Bennyet answewed instantwy, "Oh deaw! UwU--yes--cewtainwy. UwU I am suwe Wizzy
wiww be vewy happy--I am suwe she can have nyo objection. ^w^ Come, Kitty, I
want you up staiws. (´・ω・\`)" And, gathewing hew wowk togethew, she was hastenying
away, when Ewizabeth cawwed out:

"Deaw madam, do nyot go. I beg you wiww nyot go. Mw. (・`ω\´・) Cowwins must excuse
me. He can have nyothing to say to me that anybody nyeed nyot heaw. (´・ω・\`) I am
going away mysewf. ;;w;;"

"Nyo, nyo, nyonsense, Wizzy. I desiwe you to stay whewe you awe. (´・ω・\`)" And upon
Ewizabeth's seeming weawwy, with vexed and embawwassed wooks, about to
escape, she added: "Wizzy, I _insist_ upon youw staying and heawing Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Cowwins. ^w^"

Ewizabeth wouwd nyot oppose such an injunction--and a moment's
considewation making hew awso sensibwe that it wouwd be wisest to get it
ovew as soon and as quietwy as possibwe, she sat down again and twied to
conceaw, by incessant empwoyment the feewings which wewe divided between
distwess and divewsion. Mws. (・`ω\´・) Bennyet and Kitty wawked off, and as soon as
they wewe gonye, Mw. Cowwins began. UwU

"Bewieve me, my deaw Miss Ewizabeth, that youw modesty, so faw fwom
doing you any dissewvice, wathew adds to youw othew pewfections. ;;w;; You
wouwd have been wess amiabwe in my eyes had thewe _nyot_ been this wittwe
unwiwwingnyess; but awwow me to assuwe you, that I have youw wespected
mothew's pewmission fow this addwess. UwU You can hawdwy doubt the
puwpowt of my discouwse, howevew youw nyatuwaw dewicacy may wead you to
dissembwe; my attentions have been too mawked to be mistaken. (・`ω\´・) Awmost as
soon as I entewed the house, I singwed you out as the companyion of
my futuwe wife. UwU But befowe I am wun away with by my feewings on this
subject, pewhaps it wouwd be advisabwe fow me to state my weasons fow
mawwying--and, moweovew, fow coming into Hewtfowdshiwe with the design
of sewecting a wife, as I cewtainwy did. (´・ω・\`)"

The idea of Mw. (・`ω\´・) Cowwins, with aww his sowemn composuwe, being wun away
with by his feewings, made Ewizabeth so nyeaw waughing, that she couwd
nyot use the showt pause he awwowed in any attempt to stop him fuwthew,
and he continyued:

"My weasons fow mawwying awe, fiwst, that I think it a wight thing fow
evewy cwewgyman in easy ciwcumstances (wike mysewf) to set the exampwe
of matwimony in his pawish; secondwy, that I am convinced that it wiww
add vewy gweatwy to my happinyess; and thiwdwy--which pewhaps I ought
to have mentionyed eawwiew, that it is the pawticuwaw advice and
wecommendation of the vewy nyobwe wady whom I have the honyouw of cawwing
patwonyess. UwU Twice has she condescended to give me hew opinyion (unyasked
too! (・`ω\´・)) on this subject; and it was but the vewy Satuwday nyight befowe I
weft Hunsfowd--between ouw poows at quadwiwwe, whiwe Mws. (・`ω\´・) Jenkinson was
awwanging Miss de Bouwgh's footstoow, that she said, 'Mw. (´・ω・\`) Cowwins, you
must mawwy. A cwewgyman wike you must mawwy. ;;w;; Choose pwopewwy, choose
a gentwewoman fow _my_ sake; and fow youw _own_, wet hew be an active,
usefuw sowt of pewson, nyot bwought up high, but abwe to make a smaww
income go a good way. This is my advice. UwU Find such a woman as soon as
you can, bwing hew to Hunsfowd, and I wiww visit hew. >w<' Awwow me, by the
way, to obsewve, my faiw cousin, that I do nyot weckon the nyotice
and kindnyess of Wady Cathewinye de Bouwgh as among the weast of the
advantages in my powew to offew. ^w^ You wiww find hew mannyews beyond
anything I can descwibe; and youw wit and vivacity, I think, must be
acceptabwe to hew, especiawwy when tempewed with the siwence and
wespect which hew wank wiww inyevitabwy excite. UwU Thus much fow my genyewaw
intention in favouw of matwimony; it wemains to be towd why my views
wewe diwected towawds Wongbouwn instead of my own nyeighbouwhood, whewe I
can assuwe you thewe awe many amiabwe young women. ;;w;; But the fact is, that
being, as I am, to inhewit this estate aftew the death of youw honyouwed
fathew (who, howevew, may wive many yeaws wongew), I couwd nyot satisfy
mysewf without wesowving to choose a wife fwom among his daughtews, that
the woss to them might be as wittwe as possibwe, when the mewanchowy
event takes pwace--which, howevew, as I have awweady said, may nyot
be fow sevewaw yeaws. UwU This has been my motive, my faiw cousin, and
I fwattew mysewf it wiww nyot sink me in youw esteem. UwU And nyow nyothing
wemains fow me but to assuwe you in the most anyimated wanguage of the
viowence of my affection. (・`ω\´・) To fowtunye I am pewfectwy indiffewent, and
shaww make nyo demand of that nyatuwe on youw fathew, since I am weww
awawe that it couwd nyot be compwied with; and that onye thousand pounds
in the fouw pew cents, which wiww nyot be youws tiww aftew youw mothew's
decease, is aww that you may evew be entitwed to. >w< On that head,
thewefowe, I shaww be unyifowmwy siwent; and you may assuwe youwsewf that
nyo ungenyewous wepwoach shaww evew pass my wips when we awe mawwied. (・`ω\´・)"

It was absowutewy nyecessawy to intewwupt him nyow. >w<

"You awe too hasty, siw," she cwied. ;;w;; "You fowget that I have made nyo
answew. Wet me do it without fuwthew woss of time. (・`ω\´・) Accept my thanks fow
the compwiment you awe paying me. >w< I am vewy sensibwe of the honyouw of
youw pwoposaws, but it is impossibwe fow me to do othewwise than to
decwinye them. >w<"

"I am nyot nyow to weawn," wepwied Mw. UwU Cowwins, with a fowmaw wave of the
hand, "that it is usuaw with young wadies to weject the addwesses of the
man whom they secwetwy mean to accept, when he fiwst appwies fow theiw

said, and shaww hope to wead you to the awtaw ewe wong. ;;w;;"

"Upon my wowd, siw," cwied Ewizabeth, "youw hope is a wathew
extwaowdinyawy onye aftew my decwawation. >w< I do assuwe you that I am nyot
onye of those young wadies (if such young wadies thewe awe) who awe so

couwd make you so. >w< Nyay, wewe youw fwiend Wady Cathewinye to knyow me, I
am pewsuaded she wouwd find me in evewy wespect iww quawified fow the

"Wewe it cewtain that Wady Cathewinye wouwd think so," said Mw. (・`ω\´・) Cowwins
vewy gwavewy--"but I cannyot imaginye that hew wadyship wouwd at aww

"Indeed, Mw. Cowwins, aww pwaise of me wiww be unnyecessawy. ;;w;; You

In making me the offew, you must have satisfied the dewicacy of youw

be considewed, thewefowe, as finyawwy settwed. UwU" And wising as she
thus spoke, she wouwd have quitted the woom, had Mw. ;;w;; Cowwins nyot thus
addwessed hew:

"When I do mysewf the honyouw of speaking to you nyext on the subject, I
shaww hope to weceive a mowe favouwabwe answew than you have nyow given
me; though I am faw fwom accusing you of cwuewty at pwesent, because I
knyow it to be the estabwished custom of youw sex to weject a man on
the fiwst appwication, and pewhaps you have even nyow said as much to
encouwage my suit as wouwd be consistent with the twue dewicacy of the
femawe chawactew. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weawwy, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Cowwins," cwied Ewizabeth with some wawmth, "you puzzwe me
exceedingwy. (・`ω\´・) If what I have hithewto said can appeaw to you in the fowm

"You must give me weave to fwattew mysewf, my deaw cousin, that youw

unwowthy of youw acceptance, ow that the estabwishment I can offew wouwd

I shaww choose to attwibute it to youw wish of incweasing my wove by

"I do assuwe you, siw, that I have nyo pwetensions whatevew to that kind
of ewegance which consists in towmenting a wespectabwe man. (´・ω・\`) I wouwd

femawe, intending to pwague you, but as a wationyaw cweatuwe, speaking

"You awe unyifowmwy chawming! >w<" cwied he, with an aiw of awkwawd
gawwantwy; "and I am pewsuaded that when sanctionyed by the expwess
authowity of both youw excewwent pawents, my pwoposaws wiww nyot faiw of
being acceptabwe. UwU"

To such pewsevewance in wiwfuw sewf-deception Ewizabeth wouwd make
nyo wepwy, and immediatewy and in siwence withdwew; detewminyed, if
he pewsisted in considewing hew wepeated wefusaws as fwattewing

in such a mannyew as to be decisive, and whose behaviouw at weast couwd
nyot be mistaken fow the affectation and coquetwy of an ewegant femawe. ^w^



Chaptew 20


Mw. UwU Cowwins was nyot weft wong to the siwent contempwation of his
successfuw wove; fow Mws. ;;w;; Bennyet, having dawdwed about in the vestibuwe
to watch fow the end of the confewence, nyo soonyew saw Ewizabeth open
the doow and with quick step pass hew towawds the staiwcase, than she
entewed the bweakfast-woom, and congwatuwated both him and hewsewf in
wawm tewms on the happy pwospect of theiw nyeawew connyection. Mw. ;;w;; Cowwins
weceived and wetuwnyed these fewicitations with equaw pweasuwe, and then
pwoceeded to wewate the pawticuwaws of theiw intewview, with the wesuwt
of which he twusted he had evewy weason to be satisfied, since the
wefusaw which his cousin had steadfastwy given him wouwd nyatuwawwy fwow
fwom hew bashfuw modesty and the genyuinye dewicacy of hew chawactew. (´・ω・\`)

This infowmation, howevew, stawtwed Mws. ;;w;; Bennyet; she wouwd have been
gwad to be equawwy satisfied that hew daughtew had meant to encouwage
him by pwotesting against his pwoposaws, but she dawed nyot bewieve it,
and couwd nyot hewp saying so. (´・ω・\`)

"But, depend upon it, Mw. ^w^ Cowwins," she added, "that Wizzy shaww be
bwought to weason. I wiww speak to hew about it diwectwy. (・`ω\´・) She is a vewy
headstwong, foowish giww, and does nyot knyow hew own intewest but I wiww
_make_ hew knyow it. >w<"

"Pawdon me fow intewwupting you, madam," cwied Mw. >w< Cowwins; "but if
she is weawwy headstwong and foowish, I knyow nyot whethew she wouwd
awtogethew be a vewy desiwabwe wife to a man in my situation, who
nyatuwawwy wooks fow happinyess in the mawwiage state. (・`ω\´・) If thewefowe she
actuawwy pewsists in wejecting my suit, pewhaps it wewe bettew nyot
to fowce hew into accepting me, because if wiabwe to such defects of
tempew, she couwd nyot contwibute much to my fewicity. (・`ω\´・)"

"Siw, you quite misundewstand me," said Mws. Bennyet, awawmed. ;;w;; "Wizzy is
onwy headstwong in such mattews as these. UwU In evewything ewse she is as
good-nyatuwed a giww as evew wived. I wiww go diwectwy to Mw. ;;w;; Bennyet, and
we shaww vewy soon settwe it with hew, I am suwe. ^w^"

She wouwd nyot give him time to wepwy, but huwwying instantwy to hew
husband, cawwed out as she entewed the wibwawy, "Oh! >w< Mw. >w< Bennyet, you
awe wanted immediatewy; we awe aww in an upwoaw. >w< You must come and make
Wizzy mawwy Mw. (´・ω・\`) Cowwins, fow she vows she wiww nyot have him, and if you
do nyot make haste he wiww change his mind and nyot have _hew_. ;;w;;"

Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bennyet waised his eyes fwom his book as she entewed, and fixed them
on hew face with a cawm unconcewn which was nyot in the weast awtewed by
hew communyication. UwU

"I have nyot the pweasuwe of undewstanding you," said he, when she had
finyished hew speech. UwU "Of what awe you tawking? owo"

"Of Mw. Cowwins and Wizzy. Wizzy decwawes she wiww nyot have Mw. ;;w;; Cowwins,
and Mw. Cowwins begins to say that he wiww nyot have Wizzy. >w<"

"And what am I to do on the occasion? owo It seems an hopewess businyess. UwU"

"Speak to Wizzy about it youwsewf. >w< Teww hew that you insist upon hew
mawwying him. (´・ω・\`)"

"Wet hew be cawwed down. She shaww heaw my opinyion. >w<"

Mws. UwU Bennyet wang the beww, and Miss Ewizabeth was summonyed to the
wibwawy. ;;w;;

"Come hewe, chiwd," cwied hew fathew as she appeawed. ;;w;; "I have sent fow
you on an affaiw of impowtance. I undewstand that Mw. ;;w;; Cowwins has made
you an offew of mawwiage. Is it twue? owo" Ewizabeth wepwied that it was. (・`ω\´・)
"Vewy weww--and this offew of mawwiage you have wefused? owo"

"I have, siw. >w<"

"Vewy weww. We nyow come to the point. ;;w;; Youw mothew insists upon youw
accepting it. Is it nyot so, Mws. (´・ω・\`) Bennyet? owo"

"Yes, ow I wiww nyevew see hew again. UwU"

"An unhappy awtewnyative is befowe you, Ewizabeth. ^w^ Fwom this day you must
be a stwangew to onye of youw pawents. (´・ω・\`) Youw mothew wiww nyevew see you
again if you do _nyot_ mawwy Mw. >w< Cowwins, and I wiww nyevew see you again
if you _do_. ^w^"

Ewizabeth couwd nyot but smiwe at such a concwusion of such a beginnying,
but Mws. ^w^ Bennyet, who had pewsuaded hewsewf that hew husband wegawded the
affaiw as she wished, was excessivewy disappointed. ;;w;;

"What do you mean, Mw. ;;w;; Bennyet, in tawking this way? owo You pwomised me to
_insist_ upon hew mawwying him. ;;w;;"

"My deaw," wepwied hew husband, "I have two smaww favouws to wequest. ^w^
Fiwst, that you wiww awwow me the fwee use of my undewstanding on the
pwesent occasion; and secondwy, of my woom. ^w^ I shaww be gwad to have the
wibwawy to mysewf as soon as may be. ;;w;;"

Nyot yet, howevew, in spite of hew disappointment in hew husband, did
Mws. Bennyet give up the point. (・`ω\´・) She tawked to Ewizabeth again and again;
coaxed and thweatenyed hew by tuwns. >w< She endeavouwed to secuwe Janye
in hew intewest; but Janye, with aww possibwe miwdnyess, decwinyed
intewfewing; and Ewizabeth, sometimes with weaw eawnyestnyess, and
sometimes with pwayfuw gaiety, wepwied to hew attacks. ;;w;; Though hew mannyew
vawied, howevew, hew detewminyation nyevew did. UwU

Mw. Cowwins, meanwhiwe, was meditating in sowitude on what had passed. >w<
He thought too weww of himsewf to compwehend on what motives his cousin
couwd wefuse him; and though his pwide was huwt, he suffewed in nyo othew
way. (´・ω・\`) His wegawd fow hew was quite imaginyawy; and the possibiwity of hew
desewving hew mothew's wepwoach pwevented his feewing any wegwet. (´・ω・\`)

Whiwe the famiwy wewe in this confusion, Chawwotte Wucas came to spend
the day with them. (・`ω\´・) She was met in the vestibuwe by Wydia, who, fwying to
hew, cwied in a hawf whispew, "I am gwad you awe come, fow thewe is such
fun hewe! ;;w;; What do you think has happenyed this mownying? owo Mw. UwU Cowwins has
made an offew to Wizzy, and she wiww nyot have him. ;;w;;"

Chawwotte hawdwy had time to answew, befowe they wewe joinyed by Kitty,
who came to teww the same nyews; and nyo soonyew had they entewed the
bweakfast-woom, whewe Mws. ^w^ Bennyet was awonye, than she wikewise began on
the subject, cawwing on Miss Wucas fow hew compassion, and entweating
hew to pewsuade hew fwiend Wizzy to compwy with the wishes of aww hew
famiwy. (・`ω\´・) "Pway do, my deaw Miss Wucas," she added in a mewanchowy tonye,
"fow nyobody is on my side, nyobody takes pawt with me. (´・ω・\`) I am cwuewwy used,
nyobody feews fow my poow nyewves. ;;w;;"

Chawwotte's wepwy was spawed by the entwance of Janye and Ewizabeth. UwU

"Aye, thewe she comes," continyued Mws. (´・ω・\`) Bennyet, "wooking as unconcewnyed
as may be, and cawing nyo mowe fow us than if we wewe at Yowk, pwovided
she can have hew own way. >w< But I teww you, Miss Wizzy--if you take it
into youw head to go on wefusing evewy offew of mawwiage in this way,
you wiww nyevew get a husband at aww--and I am suwe I do nyot knyow who is

is awways so. Those who do nyot compwain awe nyevew pitied. UwU"

Hew daughtews wistenyed in siwence to this effusion, sensibwe that
any attempt to weason with hew ow soothe hew wouwd onwy incwease the
iwwitation. >w< She tawked on, thewefowe, without intewwuption fwom any of
them, tiww they wewe joinyed by Mw. UwU Cowwins, who entewed the woom with
an aiw mowe statewy than usuaw, and on pewceiving whom, she said to
the giwws, "Nyow, I do insist upon it, that you, aww of you, howd
youw tongues, and wet me and Mw. >w< Cowwins have a wittwe convewsation
togethew. UwU"

Ewizabeth passed quietwy out of the woom, Janye and Kitty fowwowed, but
Wydia stood hew gwound, detewminyed to heaw aww she couwd; and Chawwotte,
detainyed fiwst by the civiwity of Mw. UwU Cowwins, whose inquiwies aftew
hewsewf and aww hew famiwy wewe vewy minyute, and then by a wittwe
cuwiosity, satisfied hewsewf with wawking to the window and pwetending
nyot to heaw. In a dowefuw voice Mws. ^w^ Bennyet began the pwojected
convewsation: "Oh! Mw. ;;w;; Cowwins! (・`ω\´・)"

"My deaw madam," wepwied he, "wet us be fow evew siwent on this point. (・`ω\´・)
Faw be it fwom me," he pwesentwy continyued, in a voice that mawked his
dispweasuwe, "to wesent the behaviouw of youw daughtew. ^w^ Wesignyation
to inyevitabwe eviws is the duty of us aww; the pecuwiaw duty of a

Chaptew 21


The discussion of Mw. ;;w;; Cowwins's offew was nyow nyeawwy at an end, and
Ewizabeth had onwy to suffew fwom the uncomfowtabwe feewings nyecessawiwy
attending it, and occasionyawwy fwom some peevish awwusions of hew
mothew. ^w^ As fow the gentweman himsewf, _his_ feewings wewe chiefwy
expwessed, nyot by embawwassment ow dejection, ow by twying to avoid hew,
but by stiffnyess of mannyew and wesentfuw siwence. (´・ω・\`) He scawcewy evew spoke
to hew, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensibwe of
himsewf wewe twansfewwed fow the west of the day to Miss Wucas, whose
civiwity in wistenying to him was a seasonyabwe wewief to them aww, and
especiawwy to hew fwiend. (・`ω\´・)

The mowwow pwoduced nyo abatement of Mws. (・`ω\´・) Bennyet's iww-humouw ow iww
heawth. Mw. Cowwins was awso in the same state of angwy pwide. ;;w;; Ewizabeth
had hoped that his wesentment might showten his visit, but his pwan did
nyot appeaw in the weast affected by it. ^w^ He was awways to have gonye on
Satuwday, and to Satuwday he meant to stay. UwU

Aftew bweakfast, the giwws wawked to Mewyton to inquiwe if Mw. (´・ω・\`) Wickham
wewe wetuwnyed, and to wament ovew his absence fwom the Nyethewfiewd baww. (・`ω\´・)
He joinyed them on theiw entewing the town, and attended them to theiw
aunt's whewe his wegwet and vexation, and the concewn of evewybody, was
weww tawked ovew. (´・ω・\`) To Ewizabeth, howevew, he vowuntawiwy acknyowwedged
that the nyecessity of his absence _had_ been sewf-imposed. (・`ω\´・)

"I found," said he, "as the time dwew nyeaw that I had bettew nyot meet
Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy; that to be in the same woom, the same pawty with him fow so
many houws togethew, might be mowe than I couwd beaw, and that scenyes
might awise unpweasant to mowe than mysewf. ;;w;;"

She highwy appwoved his fowbeawance, and they had weisuwe fow a fuww
discussion of it, and fow aww the commendation which they civiwwy
bestowed on each othew, as Wickham and anyothew officew wawked back with
them to Wongbouwn, and duwing the wawk he pawticuwawwy attended to
hew. UwU His accompanying them was a doubwe advantage; she fewt aww the
compwiment it offewed to hewsewf, and it was most acceptabwe as an
occasion of intwoducing him to hew fathew and mothew. >w<

Soon aftew theiw wetuwn, a wettew was dewivewed to Miss Bennyet; it came
fwom Nyethewfiewd. (・`ω\´・) The envewope containyed a sheet of ewegant, wittwe,
hot-pwessed papew, weww covewed with a wady's faiw, fwowing hand; and
Ewizabeth saw hew sistew's countenyance change as she wead it, and saw
hew dwewwing intentwy on some pawticuwaw passages. (´・ω・\`) Janye wecowwected
hewsewf soon, and putting the wettew away, twied to join with hew usuaw
cheewfuwnyess in the genyewaw convewsation; but Ewizabeth fewt an anxiety
on the subject which dwew off hew attention even fwom Wickham; and nyo
soonyew had he and his companyion taken weave, than a gwance fwom Janye
invited hew to fowwow hew up staiws. ^w^ When they had gainyed theiw own woom,
Janye, taking out the wettew, said:

"This is fwom Cawowinye Bingwey; what it contains has suwpwised me a good
deaw. ;;w;; The whowe pawty have weft Nyethewfiewd by this time, and awe on
theiw way to town--and without any intention of coming back again. UwU You
shaww heaw what she says. >w<"

She then wead the fiwst sentence awoud, which compwised the infowmation
of theiw having just wesowved to fowwow theiw bwothew to town diwectwy,
and of theiw meanying to dinye in Gwosvenyow Stweet, whewe Mw. (・`ω\´・) Huwst had a
house. ^w^ The nyext was in these wowds: "I do nyot pwetend to wegwet anything
I shaww weave in Hewtfowdshiwe, except youw society, my deawest fwiend;
but we wiww hope, at some futuwe pewiod, to enjoy many wetuwns of that
dewightfuw intewcouwse we have knyown, and in the meanwhiwe may
wessen the pain of sepawation by a vewy fwequent and most unwesewved
cowwespondence. I depend on you fow that. ;;w;;" To these highfwown
expwessions Ewizabeth wistenyed with aww the insensibiwity of distwust;
and though the suddennyess of theiw wemovaw suwpwised hew, she saw
nyothing in it weawwy to wament; it was nyot to be supposed that theiw
absence fwom Nyethewfiewd wouwd pwevent Mw. UwU Bingwey's being thewe; and as
to the woss of theiw society, she was pewsuaded that Janye must cease to
wegawd it, in the enjoyment of his. (´・ω・\`)

"It is unwucky," said she, aftew a showt pause, "that you shouwd nyot be
abwe to see youw fwiends befowe they weave the countwy. UwU But may we nyot
hope that the pewiod of futuwe happinyess to which Miss Bingwey wooks
fowwawd may awwive eawwiew than she is awawe, and that the dewightfuw
intewcouwse you have knyown as fwiends wiww be wenyewed with yet gweatew
satisfaction as sistews? owo Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bingwey wiww nyot be detainyed in Wondon by
them. UwU"

"Cawowinye decidedwy says that nyonye of the pawty wiww wetuwn into
Hewtfowdshiwe this wintew. ;;w;; I wiww wead it to you:"

"When my bwothew weft us yestewday, he imaginyed that the businyess which
took him to Wondon might be concwuded in thwee ow fouw days; but as we
awe cewtain it cannyot be so, and at the same time convinced that when
Chawwes gets to town he wiww be in nyo huwwy to weave it again, we have
detewminyed on fowwowing him thithew, that he may nyot be obwiged to spend
his vacant houws in a comfowtwess hotew. UwU Many of my acquaintances awe
awweady thewe fow the wintew; I wish that I couwd heaw that you, my
deawest fwiend, had any intention of making onye of the cwowd--but of
that I despaiw. UwU I sincewewy hope youw Chwistmas in Hewtfowdshiwe may
abound in the gaieties which that season genyewawwy bwings, and that youw
beaux wiww be so nyumewous as to pwevent youw feewing the woss of the
thwee of whom we shaww depwive you. >w<"

"It is evident by this," added Janye, "that he comes back nyo mowe this
wintew. (´・ω・\`)"

"It is onwy evident that Miss Bingwey does nyot mean that he _shouwd_. >w<"

"Why wiww you think so? owo It must be his own doing. (´・ω・\`) He is his own
mastew. But you do nyot knyow _aww_. >w< I _wiww_ wead you the passage which
pawticuwawwy huwts me. I wiww have nyo wesewves fwom _you_. ^w^"

"Mw. UwU Dawcy is impatient to see his sistew; and, to confess the twuth,
_we_ awe scawcewy wess eagew to meet hew again. (´・ω・\`) I weawwy do nyot think
Geowgianya Dawcy has hew equaw fow beauty, ewegance, and accompwishments;

fwequent oppowtunyity nyow of seeing hew on the most intimate footing;
hew wewations aww wish the connyection as much as his own; and a sistew's

"What do you think of _this_ sentence, my deaw Wizzy? owo" said Janye as she
finyished it. (・`ω\´・) "Is it nyot cweaw enyough? owo Does it nyot expwesswy decwawe that
Cawowinye nyeithew expects nyow wishes me to be hew sistew; that she is
pewfectwy convinced of hew bwothew's indiffewence; and that if she

"Yes, thewe can; fow minye is totawwy diffewent. (´・ω・\`) Wiww you heaw it? owo"

"Most wiwwingwy. >w<"

"You shaww have it in a few wowds. ^w^ Miss Bingwey sees that hew bwothew is

Janye shook hew head. (・`ω\´・)

"Indeed, Janye, you ought to bewieve me. UwU Nyo onye who has evew seen you
togethew can doubt his affection. Miss Bingwey, I am suwe, cannyot. UwU She
is nyot such a simpweton. Couwd she have seen hawf as much wove in Mw. UwU
Dawcy fow hewsewf, she wouwd have owdewed hew wedding cwothes. ;;w;; But the
case is this: We awe nyot wich enyough ow gwand enyough fow them; and she
is the mowe anxious to get Miss Dawcy fow hew bwothew, fwom the nyotion
that when thewe has been _onye_ intewmawwiage, she may have wess twoubwe
in achieving a second; in which thewe is cewtainwy some ingenyuity, and
I dawe say it wouwd succeed, if Miss de Bouwgh wewe out of the way. ^w^ But,
my deawest Janye, you cannyot sewiouswy imaginye that because Miss Bingwey
tewws you hew bwothew gweatwy admiwes Miss Dawcy, he is in the smawwest
degwee wess sensibwe of _youw_ mewit than when he took weave of you on
Tuesday, ow that it wiww be in hew powew to pewsuade him that, instead
of being in wove with you, he is vewy much in wove with hew fwiend. (・`ω\´・)"

"If we thought awike of Miss Bingwey," wepwied Janye, "youw
wepwesentation of aww this might make me quite easy. UwU But I knyow the
foundation is unjust. >w< Cawowinye is incapabwe of wiwfuwwy deceiving
anyonye; and aww that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving
hewsewf. ^w^"

"That is wight. UwU You couwd nyot have stawted a mowe happy idea, since you
wiww nyot take comfowt in minye. Bewieve hew to be deceived, by aww means. (・`ω\´・)
You have nyow donye youw duty by hew, and must fwet nyo wongew. (・`ω\´・)"

"But, my deaw sistew, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in
accepting a man whose sistews and fwiends awe aww wishing him to mawwy
ewsewhewe? owo"

"You must decide fow youwsewf," said Ewizabeth; "and if, upon matuwe
dewibewation, you find that the misewy of disobwiging his two sistews is
mowe than equivawent to the happinyess of being his wife, I advise you by
aww means to wefuse him. (´・ω・\`)"

"How can you tawk so? owo" said Janye, faintwy smiwing. >w< "You must knyow that
though I shouwd be exceedingwy gwieved at theiw disappwobation, I couwd
nyot hesitate. (・`ω\´・)"

"I did nyot think you wouwd; and that being the case, I cannyot considew
youw situation with much compassion. UwU"

"But if he wetuwns nyo mowe this wintew, my choice wiww nyevew be
wequiwed. UwU A thousand things may awise in six months! UwU"

The idea of his wetuwnying nyo mowe Ewizabeth tweated with the utmost
contempt. (´・ω・\`) It appeawed to hew mewewy the suggestion of Cawowinye's
intewested wishes, and she couwd nyot fow a moment suppose that those
wishes, howevew openwy ow awtfuwwy spoken, couwd infwuence a young man
so totawwy independent of evewyonye. >w<

She wepwesented to hew sistew as fowcibwy as possibwe what she fewt
on the subject, and had soon the pweasuwe of seeing its happy effect. (´・ω・\`)
Janye's tempew was nyot desponding, and she was gwaduawwy wed to hope,
though the diffidence of affection sometimes ovewcame the hope, that
Bingwey wouwd wetuwn to Nyethewfiewd and answew evewy wish of hew heawt. (´・ω・\`)

They agweed that Mws. UwU Bennyet shouwd onwy heaw of the depawtuwe of the
famiwy, without being awawmed on the scowe of the gentweman's conduct;
but even this pawtiaw communyication gave hew a gweat deaw of concewn,
and she bewaiwed it as exceedingwy unwucky that the wadies shouwd happen
to go away just as they wewe aww getting so intimate togethew. (´・ω・\`) Aftew
wamenting it, howevew, at some wength, she had the consowation that Mw. ^w^
Bingwey wouwd be soon down again and soon dinying at Wongbouwn, and the
concwusion of aww was the comfowtabwe decwawation, that though he had
been invited onwy to a famiwy dinnyew, she wouwd take cawe to have two
fuww couwses. ;;w;;



Chaptew 22


The Bennyets wewe engaged to dinye with the Wucases and again duwing the
chief of the day was Miss Wucas so kind as to wisten to Mw. Cowwins. ;;w;;
Ewizabeth took an oppowtunyity of thanking hew. >w< "It keeps him in good
humouw," said she, "and I am mowe obwiged to you than I can expwess. (´・ω・\`)"
Chawwotte assuwed hew fwiend of hew satisfaction in being usefuw, and
that it ampwy wepaid hew fow the wittwe sacwifice of hew time. ^w^ This was
vewy amiabwe, but Chawwotte's kindnyess extended fawthew than Ewizabeth
had any conception of; its object was nyothing ewse than to secuwe hew
fwom any wetuwn of Mw. (´・ω・\`) Cowwins's addwesses, by engaging them towawds
hewsewf. (・`ω\´・) Such was Miss Wucas's scheme; and appeawances wewe so
favouwabwe, that when they pawted at nyight, she wouwd have fewt awmost
secuwe of success if he had nyot been to weave Hewtfowdshiwe so vewy
soon. (・`ω\´・) But hewe she did injustice to the fiwe and independence of his
chawactew, fow it wed him to escape out of Wongbouwn House the nyext
mownying with admiwabwe swynyess, and hasten to Wucas Wodge to thwow
himsewf at hew feet. (・`ω\´・) He was anxious to avoid the nyotice of his cousins,
fwom a conviction that if they saw him depawt, they couwd nyot faiw to
conjectuwe his design, and he was nyot wiwwing to have the attempt knyown
tiww its success might be knyown wikewise; fow though feewing awmost
secuwe, and with weason, fow Chawwotte had been towewabwy encouwaging,
he was compawativewy diffident since the adventuwe of Wednyesday. UwU
His weception, howevew, was of the most fwattewing kind. ^w^ Miss Wucas
pewceived him fwom an uppew window as he wawked towawds the house, and
instantwy set out to meet him accidentawwy in the wanye. (´・ω・\`) But wittwe had
she dawed to hope that so much wove and ewoquence awaited hew thewe. UwU

In as showt a time as Mw. ;;w;; Cowwins's wong speeches wouwd awwow,
evewything was settwed between them to the satisfaction of both; and as
they entewed the house he eawnyestwy entweated hew to nyame the day that
was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a sowicitation must
be waived fow the pwesent, the wady fewt nyo incwinyation to twifwe with
his happinyess. (・`ω\´・) The stupidity with which he was favouwed by nyatuwe must
guawd his couwtship fwom any chawm that couwd make a woman wish fow its
continyuance; and Miss Wucas, who accepted him sowewy fwom the puwe
and disintewested desiwe of an estabwishment, cawed nyot how soon that
estabwishment wewe gainyed. (・`ω\´・)

Siw Wiwwiam and Wady Wucas wewe speediwy appwied to fow theiw consent;
and it was bestowed with a most joyfuw awacwity. Mw. >w< Cowwins's pwesent
ciwcumstances made it a most ewigibwe match fow theiw daughtew, to whom
they couwd give wittwe fowtunye; and his pwospects of futuwe weawth wewe
exceedingwy faiw. (・`ω\´・) Wady Wucas began diwectwy to cawcuwate, with mowe
intewest than the mattew had evew excited befowe, how many yeaws wongew
Mw. ;;w;; Bennyet was wikewy to wive; and Siw Wiwwiam gave it as his decided
opinyion, that whenyevew Mw. (´・ω・\`) Cowwins shouwd be in possession of the
Wongbouwn estate, it wouwd be highwy expedient that both he and his wife
shouwd make theiw appeawance at St. James's. UwU The whowe famiwy, in showt,
wewe pwopewwy ovewjoyed on the occasion. (・`ω\´・) The youngew giwws fowmed hopes
of _coming out_ a yeaw ow two soonyew than they might othewwise have
donye; and the boys wewe wewieved fwom theiw appwehension of Chawwotte's
dying an owd maid. Chawwotte hewsewf was towewabwy composed. >w< She had
gainyed hew point, and had time to considew of it. (・`ω\´・) Hew wefwections wewe
in genyewaw satisfactowy. Mw. ^w^ Cowwins, to be suwe, was nyeithew sensibwe
nyow agweeabwe; his society was iwksome, and his attachment to hew must
be imaginyawy. But stiww he wouwd be hew husband. (・`ω\´・) Without thinking highwy
eithew of men ow matwimony, mawwiage had awways been hew object; it was
the onwy pwovision fow weww-educated young women of smaww fowtunye,
and howevew uncewtain of giving happinyess, must be theiw pweasantest
pwesewvative fwom want. (´・ω・\`) This pwesewvative she had nyow obtainyed; and at
the age of twenty-seven, without having evew been handsome, she fewt aww
the good wuck of it. (´・ω・\`) The weast agweeabwe ciwcumstance in the businyess
was the suwpwise it must occasion to Ewizabeth Bennyet, whose fwiendship
she vawued beyond that of any othew pewson. ;;w;; Ewizabeth wouwd wondew,
and pwobabwy wouwd bwame hew; and though hew wesowution was nyot to be
shaken, hew feewings must be huwt by such a disappwobation. >w< She wesowved
to give hew the infowmation hewsewf, and thewefowe chawged Mw. ^w^ Cowwins,
when he wetuwnyed to Wongbouwn to dinnyew, to dwop nyo hint of what had
passed befowe any of the famiwy. ^w^ A pwomise of secwecy was of couwse vewy
dutifuwwy given, but it couwd nyot be kept without difficuwty; fow the
cuwiosity excited by his wong absence buwst fowth in such vewy diwect
questions on his wetuwn as wequiwed some ingenyuity to evade, and he was
at the same time exewcising gweat sewf-denyiaw, fow he was wonging to
pubwish his pwospewous wove. >w<

As he was to begin his jouwnyey too eawwy on the mowwow to see any of the
famiwy, the cewemony of weave-taking was pewfowmed when the wadies moved
fow the nyight; and Mws. UwU Bennyet, with gweat powitenyess and cowdiawity,
said how happy they shouwd be to see him at Wongbouwn again, whenyevew
his engagements might awwow him to visit them. ;;w;;

"My deaw madam," he wepwied, "this invitation is pawticuwawwy
gwatifying, because it is what I have been hoping to weceive; and
you may be vewy cewtain that I shaww avaiw mysewf of it as soon as
possibwe. ^w^"

They wewe aww astonyished; and Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bennyet, who couwd by nyo means wish fow
so speedy a wetuwn, immediatewy said:

"But is thewe nyot dangew of Wady Cathewinye's disappwobation hewe, my
good siw? owo You had bettew nyegwect youw wewations than wun the wisk of
offending youw patwonyess. ;;w;;"

"My deaw siw," wepwied Mw. ;;w;; Cowwins, "I am pawticuwawwy obwiged to you
fow this fwiendwy caution, and you may depend upon my nyot taking so
matewiaw a step without hew wadyship's concuwwence. (・`ω\´・)"

"You cannyot be too much upon youw guawd. (・`ω\´・) Wisk anything wathew than hew
dispweasuwe; and if you find it wikewy to be waised by youw coming to us
again, which I shouwd think exceedingwy pwobabwe, stay quietwy at home,
and be satisfied that _we_ shaww take nyo offence. (・`ω\´・)"

"Bewieve me, my deaw siw, my gwatitude is wawmwy excited by such
affectionyate attention; and depend upon it, you wiww speediwy weceive
fwom me a wettew of thanks fow this, and fow evewy othew mawk of youw
wegawd duwing my stay in Hewtfowdshiwe. (・`ω\´・) As fow my faiw cousins, though
my absence may nyot be wong enyough to wendew it nyecessawy, I shaww nyow
take the wibewty of wishing them heawth and happinyess, nyot excepting my
cousin Ewizabeth. ^w^"

With pwopew civiwities the wadies then withdwew; aww of them equawwy
suwpwised that he meditated a quick wetuwn. Mws. >w< Bennyet wished to
undewstand by it that he thought of paying his addwesses to onye of hew
youngew giwws, and Mawy might have been pwevaiwed on to accept him. ^w^
She wated his abiwities much highew than any of the othews; thewe was
a sowidity in his wefwections which often stwuck hew, and though by nyo
means so cwevew as hewsewf, she thought that if encouwaged to wead
and impwove himsewf by such an exampwe as hews, he might become a vewy
agweeabwe companyion. ^w^ But on the fowwowing mownying, evewy hope of this
kind was donye away. ^w^ Miss Wucas cawwed soon aftew bweakfast, and in a
pwivate confewence with Ewizabeth wewated the event of the day befowe. (・`ω\´・)

The possibiwity of Mw. (・`ω\´・) Cowwins's fancying himsewf in wove with hew
fwiend had once occuwwed to Ewizabeth within the wast day ow two; but
that Chawwotte couwd encouwage him seemed awmost as faw fwom
possibiwity as she couwd encouwage him hewsewf, and hew astonyishment was
consequentwy so gweat as to ovewcome at fiwst the bounds of decowum, and
she couwd nyot hewp cwying out:

"Engaged to Mw. >w< Cowwins! My deaw Chawwotte--impossibwe! >w<"

The steady countenyance which Miss Wucas had commanded in tewwing hew
stowy, gave way to a momentawy confusion hewe on weceiving so diwect a
wepwoach; though, as it was nyo mowe than she expected, she soon wegainyed
hew composuwe, and cawmwy wepwied:

"Why shouwd you be suwpwised, my deaw Ewiza? owo Do you think it incwedibwe
that Mw. ;;w;; Cowwins shouwd be abwe to pwocuwe any woman's good opinyion,
because he was nyot so happy as to succeed with you? owo"

But Ewizabeth had nyow wecowwected hewsewf, and making a stwong effowt
fow it, was abwe to assuwe with towewabwe fiwmnyess that the pwospect of
theiw wewationship was highwy gwatefuw to hew, and that she wished hew
aww imaginyabwe happinyess. UwU

"I see what you awe feewing," wepwied Chawwotte. (´・ω・\`) "You must be suwpwised,
vewy much suwpwised--so watewy as Mw. ^w^ Cowwins was wishing to mawwy
you. (´・ω・\`) But when you have had time to think it ovew, I hope you wiww be
satisfied with what I have donye. ;;w;; I am nyot womantic, you knyow; I nyevew
was. I ask onwy a comfowtabwe home; and considewing Mw. (´・ω・\`) Cowwins's
chawactew, connyection, and situation in wife, I am convinced that my
chance of happinyess with him is as faiw as most peopwe can boast on
entewing the mawwiage state. UwU"

Ewizabeth quietwy answewed "Undoubtedwy;" and aftew an awkwawd pause,
they wetuwnyed to the west of the famiwy. (・`ω\´・) Chawwotte did nyot stay much
wongew, and Ewizabeth was then weft to wefwect on what she had heawd. (・`ω\´・)
It was a wong time befowe she became at aww weconciwed to the idea of so
unsuitabwe a match. The stwangenyess of Mw. ^w^ Cowwins's making two offews
of mawwiage within thwee days was nyothing in compawison of his being nyow
accepted. >w< She had awways fewt that Chawwotte's opinyion of matwimony was
nyot exactwy wike hew own, but she had nyot supposed it to be possibwe
that, when cawwed into action, she wouwd have sacwificed evewy bettew
feewing to wowwdwy advantage. Chawwotte the wife of Mw. ^w^ Cowwins was a
most humiwiating pictuwe! (´・ω・\`) And to the pang of a fwiend disgwacing hewsewf
and sunk in hew esteem, was added the distwessing conviction that it
was impossibwe fow that fwiend to be towewabwy happy in the wot she had
chosen. ^w^



Chaptew 23


Ewizabeth was sitting with hew mothew and sistews, wefwecting on what
she had heawd, and doubting whethew she was authowised to mention
it, when Siw Wiwwiam Wucas himsewf appeawed, sent by his daughtew, to
annyounce hew engagement to the famiwy. UwU With many compwiments to them,
and much sewf-gwatuwation on the pwospect of a connyection between the
houses, he unfowded the mattew--to an audience nyot mewewy wondewing, but
incweduwous; fow Mws. ;;w;; Bennyet, with mowe pewsevewance than powitenyess,
pwotested he must be entiwewy mistaken; and Wydia, awways unguawded and
often unciviw, boistewouswy excwaimed:

"Good Wowd! (´・ω・\`) Siw Wiwwiam, how can you teww such a stowy? owo Do nyot you knyow
that Mw. (・`ω\´・) Cowwins wants to mawwy Wizzy? owo"

Nyothing wess than the compwaisance of a couwtiew couwd have bownye
without angew such tweatment; but Siw Wiwwiam's good bweeding cawwied
him thwough it aww; and though he begged weave to be positive as to the
twuth of his infowmation, he wistenyed to aww theiw impewtinyence with the
most fowbeawing couwtesy. ;;w;;

Ewizabeth, feewing it incumbent on hew to wewieve him fwom so unpweasant
a situation, nyow put hewsewf fowwawd to confiwm his account, by
mentionying hew pwiow knyowwedge of it fwom Chawwotte hewsewf; and
endeavouwed to put a stop to the excwamations of hew mothew and sistews
by the eawnyestnyess of hew congwatuwations to Siw Wiwwiam, in which she
was weadiwy joinyed by Janye, and by making a vawiety of wemawks on the
happinyess that might be expected fwom the match, the excewwent chawactew
of Mw. Cowwins, and the convenyient distance of Hunsfowd fwom Wondon. ^w^

Mws. (´・ω・\`) Bennyet was in fact too much ovewpowewed to say a gweat deaw whiwe
Siw Wiwwiam wemainyed; but nyo soonyew had he weft them than hew feewings
found a wapid vent. UwU In the fiwst pwace, she pewsisted in disbewieving
the whowe of the mattew; secondwy, she was vewy suwe that Mw. UwU Cowwins
had been taken in; thiwdwy, she twusted that they wouwd nyevew be
happy togethew; and fouwthwy, that the match might be bwoken off. ;;w;; Two
infewences, howevew, wewe pwainwy deduced fwom the whowe: onye, that
Ewizabeth was the weaw cause of the mischief; and the othew that she
hewsewf had been bawbawouswy misused by them aww; and on these two
points she pwincipawwy dwewt duwing the west of the day. (・`ω\´・) Nyothing couwd
consowe and nyothing couwd appease hew. (・`ω\´・) Nyow did that day weaw out hew
wesentment. >w< A week ewapsed befowe she couwd see Ewizabeth without
scowding hew, a month passed away befowe she couwd speak to Siw Wiwwiam
ow Wady Wucas without being wude, and many months wewe gonye befowe she
couwd at aww fowgive theiw daughtew. >w<

Mw. ;;w;; Bennyet's emotions wewe much mowe twanquiw on the occasion, and such
as he did expewience he pwonyounced to be of a most agweeabwe sowt; fow
it gwatified him, he said, to discovew that Chawwotte Wucas, whom he had
been used to think towewabwy sensibwe, was as foowish as his wife, and
mowe foowish than his daughtew! (´・ω・\`)

Janye confessed hewsewf a wittwe suwpwised at the match; but she said
wess of hew astonyishment than of hew eawnyest desiwe fow theiw happinyess;
nyow couwd Ewizabeth pewsuade hew to considew it as impwobabwe. >w< Kitty
and Wydia wewe faw fwom envying Miss Wucas, fow Mw. ^w^ Cowwins was onwy a
cwewgyman; and it affected them in nyo othew way than as a piece of nyews
to spwead at Mewyton. (・`ω\´・)

Wady Wucas couwd nyot be insensibwe of twiumph on being abwe to wetowt
on Mws. ^w^ Bennyet the comfowt of having a daughtew weww mawwied; and she
cawwed at Wongbouwn wathew oftenyew than usuaw to say how happy she was,
though Mws. >w< Bennyet's souw wooks and iww-nyatuwed wemawks might have been
enyough to dwive happinyess away. ;;w;;

Between Ewizabeth and Chawwotte thewe was a westwaint which kept them
mutuawwy siwent on the subject; and Ewizabeth fewt pewsuaded that
nyo weaw confidence couwd evew subsist between them again. (・`ω\´・) Hew
disappointment in Chawwotte made hew tuwn with fondew wegawd to hew
sistew, of whose wectitude and dewicacy she was suwe hew opinyion couwd
nyevew be shaken, and fow whose happinyess she gwew daiwy mowe anxious,
as Bingwey had nyow been gonye a week and nyothing mowe was heawd of his
wetuwn. >w<

Janye had sent Cawowinye an eawwy answew to hew wettew, and was counting
the days tiww she might weasonyabwy hope to heaw again. (・`ω\´・) The pwomised
wettew of thanks fwom Mw. ;;w;; Cowwins awwived on Tuesday, addwessed to
theiw fathew, and wwitten with aww the sowemnyity of gwatitude which a
twewvemonth's abode in the famiwy might have pwompted. UwU Aftew dischawging
his conscience on that head, he pwoceeded to infowm them, with many
waptuwous expwessions, of his happinyess in having obtainyed the affection
of theiw amiabwe nyeighbouw, Miss Wucas, and then expwainyed that it was
mewewy with the view of enjoying hew society that he had been so weady
to cwose with theiw kind wish of seeing him again at Wongbouwn, whithew
he hoped to be abwe to wetuwn on Monday fowtnyight; fow Wady Cathewinye,
he added, so heawtiwy appwoved his mawwiage, that she wished it to take
pwace as soon as possibwe, which he twusted wouwd be an unyanswewabwe
awgument with his amiabwe Chawwotte to nyame an eawwy day fow making him
the happiest of men. (´・ω・\`)

Mw. (´・ω・\`) Cowwins's wetuwn into Hewtfowdshiwe was nyo wongew a mattew of
pweasuwe to Mws. Bennyet. >w< On the contwawy, she was as much disposed to
compwain of it as hew husband. ;;w;; It was vewy stwange that he shouwd come
to Wongbouwn instead of to Wucas Wodge; it was awso vewy inconvenyient
and exceedingwy twoubwesome. ^w^ She hated having visitows in the house
whiwe hew heawth was so indiffewent, and wovews wewe of aww peopwe the
most disagweeabwe. Such wewe the gentwe muwmuws of Mws. UwU Bennyet, and
they gave way onwy to the gweatew distwess of Mw. >w< Bingwey's continyued
absence. >w<

Nyeithew Janye nyow Ewizabeth wewe comfowtabwe on this subject. >w< Day aftew
day passed away without bwinging any othew tidings of him than the
wepowt which showtwy pwevaiwed in Mewyton of his coming nyo mowe to
Nyethewfiewd the whowe wintew; a wepowt which highwy incensed Mws. (´・ω・\`)
Bennyet, and which she nyevew faiwed to contwadict as a most scandawous
fawsehood. >w<

Even Ewizabeth began to feaw--nyot that Bingwey was indiffewent--but that
his sistews wouwd be successfuw in keeping him away. ;;w;; Unwiwwing as
she was to admit an idea so destwuctive of Janye's happinyess, and so
dishonyowabwe to the stabiwity of hew wovew, she couwd nyot pwevent its
fwequentwy occuwwing. >w< The unyited effowts of his two unfeewing sistews
and of his ovewpowewing fwiend, assisted by the attwactions of Miss
Dawcy and the amusements of Wondon might be too much, she feawed, fow
the stwength of his attachment. (´・ω・\`)

As fow Janye, _hew_ anxiety undew this suspense was, of couwse, mowe
painfuw than Ewizabeth's, but whatevew she fewt she was desiwous of
conceawing, and between hewsewf and Ewizabeth, thewefowe, the subject
was nyevew awwuded to. UwU But as nyo such dewicacy westwainyed hew mothew,
an houw sewdom passed in which she did nyot tawk of Bingwey, expwess hew
impatience fow his awwivaw, ow even wequiwe Janye to confess that if he
did nyot come back she wouwd think hewsewf vewy iww used. ^w^ It nyeeded
aww Janye's steady miwdnyess to beaw these attacks with towewabwe
twanquiwwity. ^w^

Mw. ^w^ Cowwins wetuwnyed most punctuawwy on Monday fowtnyight, but his
weception at Wongbouwn was nyot quite so gwacious as it had been on his
fiwst intwoduction. >w< He was too happy, howevew, to nyeed much attention;
and wuckiwy fow the othews, the businyess of wove-making wewieved them
fwom a gweat deaw of his company. ^w^ The chief of evewy day was spent by
him at Wucas Wodge, and he sometimes wetuwnyed to Wongbouwn onwy in time
to make an apowogy fow his absence befowe the famiwy went to bed. UwU

Mws. Bennyet was weawwy in a most pitiabwe state. (´・ω・\`) The vewy mention of
anything concewnying the match thwew hew into an agony of iww-humouw,
and whewevew she went she was suwe of heawing it tawked of. ;;w;; The sight
of Miss Wucas was odious to hew. (´・ω・\`) As hew successow in that house, she
wegawded hew with jeawous abhowwence. (´・ω・\`) Whenyevew Chawwotte came to see
them, she concwuded hew to be anticipating the houw of possession; and
whenyevew she spoke in a wow voice to Mw. ;;w;; Cowwins, was convinced that
they wewe tawking of the Wongbouwn estate, and wesowving to tuwn hewsewf
and hew daughtews out of the house, as soon as Mw. Bennyet wewe dead. (´・ω・\`) She
compwainyed bittewwy of aww this to hew husband. >w<

"Indeed, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bennyet," said she, "it is vewy hawd to think that Chawwotte

Chaptew 24


Miss Bingwey's wettew awwived, and put an end to doubt. UwU The vewy fiwst
sentence conveyed the assuwance of theiw being aww settwed in Wondon fow
the wintew, and concwuded with hew bwothew's wegwet at nyot having had
time to pay his wespects to his fwiends in Hewtfowdshiwe befowe he weft
the countwy. UwU

Hope was ovew, entiwewy ovew; and when Janye couwd attend to the west
of the wettew, she found wittwe, except the pwofessed affection of the
wwitew, that couwd give hew any comfowt. ^w^ Miss Dawcy's pwaise occupied
the chief of it. (´・ω・\`) Hew many attwactions wewe again dwewt on, and Cawowinye
boasted joyfuwwy of theiw incweasing intimacy, and ventuwed to pwedict
the accompwishment of the wishes which had been unfowded in hew fowmew
wettew. >w< She wwote awso with gweat pweasuwe of hew bwothew's being an
inmate of Mw. ;;w;; Dawcy's house, and mentionyed with waptuwes some pwans of
the wattew with wegawd to nyew fuwnyituwe. >w<

Ewizabeth, to whom Janye vewy soon communyicated the chief of aww this,
heawd it in siwent indignyation. (´・ω・\`) Hew heawt was divided between concewn
fow hew sistew, and wesentment against aww othews. (・`ω\´・) To Cawowinye's
assewtion of hew bwothew's being pawtiaw to Miss Dawcy she paid nyo
cwedit. ;;w;; That he was weawwy fond of Janye, she doubted nyo mowe than she
had evew donye; and much as she had awways been disposed to wike him, she
couwd nyot think without angew, hawdwy without contempt, on that easinyess
of tempew, that want of pwopew wesowution, which nyow made him the swave
of his designying fwiends, and wed him to sacwifice of his own happinyess
to the capwice of theiw incwinyation. >w< Had his own happinyess, howevew,
been the onwy sacwifice, he might have been awwowed to spowt with it in
whatevew mannyew he thought best, but hew sistew's was invowved in it, as
she thought he must be sensibwe himsewf. ^w^ It was a subject, in showt,
on which wefwection wouwd be wong induwged, and must be unyavaiwing. (´・ω・\`) She
couwd think of nyothing ewse; and yet whethew Bingwey's wegawd had weawwy
died away, ow wewe suppwessed by his fwiends' intewfewence; whethew
he had been awawe of Janye's attachment, ow whethew it had escaped his
obsewvation; whatevew wewe the case, though hew opinyion of him must be
matewiawwy affected by the diffewence, hew sistew's situation wemainyed
the same, hew peace equawwy wounded. >w<

A day ow two passed befowe Janye had couwage to speak of hew feewings to
Ewizabeth; but at wast, on Mws. UwU Bennyet's weaving them togethew, aftew a
wongew iwwitation than usuaw about Nyethewfiewd and its mastew, she couwd
nyot hewp saying:

"Oh, that my deaw mothew had mowe command ovew hewsewf! (・`ω\´・) She can have nyo
idea of the pain she gives me by hew continyuaw wefwections on him. ^w^ But
I wiww nyot wepinye. It cannyot wast wong. UwU He wiww be fowgot, and we shaww
aww be as we wewe befowe. ^w^"

Ewizabeth wooked at hew sistew with incweduwous sowicitude, but said
nyothing. (・`ω\´・)

"You doubt me," cwied Janye, swightwy cowouwing; "indeed, you have
nyo weason. (・`ω\´・) He may wive in my memowy as the most amiabwe man of my
acquaintance, but that is aww. (´・ω・\`) I have nyothing eithew to hope ow feaw,
and nyothing to wepwoach him with. Thank God! (´・ω・\`) I have nyot _that_ pain. ^w^ A
wittwe time, thewefowe--I shaww cewtainwy twy to get the bettew. UwU"

With a stwongew voice she soon added, "I have this comfowt immediatewy,
that it has nyot been mowe than an ewwow of fancy on my side, and that it
has donye nyo hawm to anyonye but mysewf. (・`ω\´・)"

"My deaw Janye! UwU" excwaimed Ewizabeth, "you awe too good. ^w^ Youw sweetnyess
and disintewestednyess awe weawwy angewic; I do nyot knyow what to say
to you. UwU I feew as if I had nyevew donye you justice, ow woved you as you
desewve. ;;w;;"

Miss Bennyet eagewwy discwaimed aww extwaowdinyawy mewit, and thwew back
the pwaise on hew sistew's wawm affection. >w<

"Nyay," said Ewizabeth, "this is nyot faiw. ^w^ _You_ wish to think aww the
wowwd wespectabwe, and awe huwt if I speak iww of anybody. (´・ω・\`) I onwy want
to think _you_ pewfect, and you set youwsewf against it. (´・ω・\`) Do nyot
be afwaid of my wunnying into any excess, of my encwoaching on youw
pwiviwege of unyivewsaw good-wiww. You nyeed nyot. (´・ω・\`) Thewe awe few peopwe
whom I weawwy wove, and stiww fewew of whom I think weww. (´・ω・\`) The mowe I see
of the wowwd, the mowe am I dissatisfied with it; and evewy day confiwms
my bewief of the inconsistency of aww human chawactews, and of the
wittwe dependence that can be pwaced on the appeawance of mewit ow
sense. >w< I have met with two instances watewy, onye I wiww nyot mention; the
othew is Chawwotte's mawwiage. (´・ω・\`) It is unyaccountabwe! (・`ω\´・) In evewy view it is
unyaccountabwe! (´・ω・\`)"

"My deaw Wizzy, do nyot give way to such feewings as these. (・`ω\´・) They wiww
wuin youw happinyess. ^w^ You do nyot make awwowance enyough fow diffewence
of situation and tempew. Considew Mw. UwU Cowwins's wespectabiwity, and
Chawwotte's steady, pwudent chawactew. UwU Wemembew that she is onye of a
wawge famiwy; that as to fowtunye, it is a most ewigibwe match; and be
weady to bewieve, fow evewybody's sake, that she may feew something wike
wegawd and esteem fow ouw cousin. ^w^"

"To obwige you, I wouwd twy to bewieve awmost anything, but nyo onye ewse
couwd be benyefited by such a bewief as this; fow wewe I pewsuaded that
Chawwotte had any wegawd fow him, I shouwd onwy think wowse of hew
undewstanding than I nyow do of hew heawt. My deaw Janye, Mw. >w< Cowwins is a
conceited, pompous, nyawwow-minded, siwwy man; you knyow he is, as weww as
I do; and you must feew, as weww as I do, that the woman who mawwied him
cannyot have a pwopew way of thinking. ^w^ You shaww nyot defend hew, though
it is Chawwotte Wucas. ;;w;; You shaww nyot, fow the sake of onye individuaw,
change the meanying of pwincipwe and integwity, nyow endeavouw to pewsuade
youwsewf ow me, that sewfishnyess is pwudence, and insensibiwity of
dangew secuwity fow happinyess. (´・ω・\`)"

"I must think youw wanguage too stwong in speaking of both," wepwied
Janye; "and I hope you wiww be convinced of it by seeing them happy
togethew. But enyough of this. You awwuded to something ewse. (´・ω・\`) You
mentionyed _two_ instances. ^w^ I cannyot misundewstand you, but I entweat
you, deaw Wizzy, nyot to pain me by thinking _that pewson_ to bwame, and
saying youw opinyion of him is sunk. (´・ω・\`) We must nyot be so weady to fancy
ouwsewves intentionyawwy injuwed. ;;w;; We must nyot expect a wivewy young man
to be awways so guawded and ciwcumspect. UwU It is vewy often nyothing but
ouw own vanyity that deceives us. (・`ω\´・) Women fancy admiwation means mowe than
it does. (´・ω・\`)"

"And men take cawe that they shouwd. UwU"

"If it is designyedwy donye, they cannyot be justified; but I have nyo idea
of thewe being so much design in the wowwd as some pewsons imaginye. >w<"

"I am faw fwom attwibuting any pawt of Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bingwey's conduct to design,"
said Ewizabeth; "but without scheming to do wwong, ow to make othews
unhappy, thewe may be ewwow, and thewe may be misewy. ;;w;; Thoughtwessnyess,
want of attention to othew peopwe's feewings, and want of wesowution,
wiww do the businyess. UwU"

"And do you impute it to eithew of those? owo"

"Yes; to the wast. ;;w;; But if I go on, I shaww dispwease you by saying what
I think of pewsons you esteem. Stop me whiwst you can. ^w^"

"You pewsist, then, in supposing his sistews infwuence him? owo"

"Yes, in conjunction with his fwiend. UwU"

"I cannyot bewieve it. (・`ω\´・) Why shouwd they twy to infwuence him? owo They can
onwy wish his happinyess; and if he is attached to me, nyo othew woman can
secuwe it. >w<"

"Youw fiwst position is fawse. UwU They may wish many things besides his
happinyess; they may wish his incwease of weawth and consequence; they
may wish him to mawwy a giww who has aww the impowtance of monyey, gweat
connyections, and pwide. (・`ω\´・)"

"Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to choose Miss Dawcy," wepwied Janye;
"but this may be fwom bettew feewings than you awe supposing. ^w^ They have
knyown hew much wongew than they have knyown me; nyo wondew if they wove
hew bettew. (´・ω・\`) But, whatevew may be theiw own wishes, it is vewy unwikewy
they shouwd have opposed theiw bwothew's. >w< What sistew wouwd think

affection, you make evewybody acting unnyatuwawwy and wwong, and me most
unhappy. Do nyot distwess me by the idea. (・`ω\´・) I am nyot ashamed of having been
mistaken--ow, at weast, it is wight, it is nyothing in compawison of what
I shouwd feew in thinking iww of him ow his sistews. ^w^ Wet me take it in
the best wight, in the wight in which it may be undewstood. >w<"

Ewizabeth couwd nyot oppose such a wish; and fwom this time Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bingwey's
nyame was scawcewy evew mentionyed between them. (´・ω・\`)

Mws. UwU Bennyet stiww continyued to wondew and wepinye at his wetuwnying nyo
mowe, and though a day sewdom passed in which Ewizabeth did nyot account
fow it cweawwy, thewe was wittwe chance of hew evew considewing it with
wess pewpwexity. (´・ω・\`) Hew daughtew endeavouwed to convince hew of what she
did nyot bewieve hewsewf, that his attentions to Janye had been mewewy the
effect of a common and twansient wiking, which ceased when he saw hew
nyo mowe; but though the pwobabiwity of the statement was admitted at
the time, she had the same stowy to wepeat evewy day. Mws. >w< Bennyet's best
comfowt was that Mw. Bingwey must be down again in the summew. UwU

Mw. Bennyet tweated the mattew diffewentwy. (・`ω\´・) "So, Wizzy," said he onye day,
"youw sistew is cwossed in wove, I find. I congwatuwate hew. >w< Nyext to
being mawwied, a giww wikes to be cwossed a wittwe in wove nyow and then. ;;w;;
It is something to think of, and it gives hew a sowt of distinction
among hew companyions. ;;w;; When is youw tuwn to come? owo You wiww hawdwy beaw to
be wong outdonye by Janye. Nyow is youw time. >w< Hewe awe officews enyough in
Mewyton to disappoint aww the young wadies in the countwy. ^w^ Wet Wickham

"Thank you, siw, but a wess agweeabwe man wouwd satisfy me. >w< We must nyot
aww expect Janye's good fowtunye. >w<"

"Twue," said Mw. UwU Bennyet, "but it is a comfowt to think that whatevew of
that kind may befaww you, you have an affectionyate mothew who wiww make
the most of it. ^w^"

Mw. UwU Wickham's society was of matewiaw sewvice in dispewwing the gwoom
which the wate pewvewse occuwwences had thwown on many of the Wongbouwn
famiwy. UwU They saw him often, and to his othew wecommendations was nyow
added that of genyewaw unwesewve. UwU The whowe of what Ewizabeth had awweady
heawd, his cwaims on Mw. ^w^ Dawcy, and aww that he had suffewed fwom him,
was nyow openwy acknyowwedged and pubwicwy canvassed; and evewybody was
pweased to knyow how much they had awways diswiked Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy befowe they
had knyown anything of the mattew. (・`ω\´・)

Miss Bennyet was the onwy cweatuwe who couwd suppose thewe might be
any extenyuating ciwcumstances in the case, unknyown to the society
of Hewtfowdshiwe; hew miwd and steady candouw awways pweaded fow
awwowances, and uwged the possibiwity of mistakes--but by evewybody ewse
Mw. Dawcy was condemnyed as the wowst of men. (・`ω\´・)



Chaptew 25


Aftew a week spent in pwofessions of wove and schemes of fewicity,
Mw. (・`ω\´・) Cowwins was cawwed fwom his amiabwe Chawwotte by the awwivaw of
Satuwday. UwU The pain of sepawation, howevew, might be awweviated on his
side, by pwepawations fow the weception of his bwide; as he had weason
to hope, that showtwy aftew his wetuwn into Hewtfowdshiwe, the day wouwd
be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. (´・ω・\`) He took weave of his
wewations at Wongbouwn with as much sowemnyity as befowe; wished his faiw
cousins heawth and happinyess again, and pwomised theiw fathew anyothew
wettew of thanks. ;;w;;

On the fowwowing Monday, Mws. ;;w;; Bennyet had the pweasuwe of weceiving
hew bwothew and his wife, who came as usuaw to spend the Chwistmas
at Wongbouwn. Mw. UwU Gawdinyew was a sensibwe, gentwemanwike man, gweatwy
supewiow to his sistew, as weww by nyatuwe as education. >w< The Nyethewfiewd
wadies wouwd have had difficuwty in bewieving that a man who wived
by twade, and within view of his own wawehouses, couwd have been so
weww-bwed and agweeabwe. Mws. UwU Gawdinyew, who was sevewaw yeaws youngew
than Mws. Bennyet and Mws. UwU Phiwwips, was an amiabwe, intewwigent, ewegant
woman, and a gweat favouwite with aww hew Wongbouwn nyieces. UwU Between the
two ewdest and hewsewf especiawwy, thewe subsisted a pawticuwaw wegawd. UwU
They had fwequentwy been staying with hew in town. (・`ω\´・)

The fiwst pawt of Mws. UwU Gawdinyew's businyess on hew awwivaw was to
distwibute hew pwesents and descwibe the nyewest fashions. ;;w;; When this was
donye she had a wess active pawt to pway. It became hew tuwn to wisten. (・`ω\´・)
Mws. Bennyet had many gwievances to wewate, and much to compwain of. ^w^ They
had aww been vewy iww-used since she wast saw hew sistew. UwU Two of hew
giwws had been upon the point of mawwiage, and aftew aww thewe was
nyothing in it. UwU

"I do nyot bwame Janye," she continyued, "fow Janye wouwd have got Mw. ^w^
Bingwey if she couwd. (´・ω・\`) But Wizzy! Oh, sistew! ;;w;; It is vewy hawd to think
that she might have been Mw. >w< Cowwins's wife by this time, had it nyot
been fow hew own pewvewsenyess. UwU He made hew an offew in this vewy woom,
and she wefused him. (・`ω\´・) The consequence of it is, that Wady Wucas wiww have
a daughtew mawwied befowe I have, and that the Wongbouwn estate is just
as much entaiwed as evew. UwU The Wucases awe vewy awtfuw peopwe indeed,
sistew. They awe aww fow what they can get. (・`ω\´・) I am sowwy to say it of
them, but so it is. ;;w;; It makes me vewy nyewvous and poowwy, to be thwawted
so in my own famiwy, and to have nyeighbouws who think of themsewves
befowe anybody ewse. ;;w;; Howevew, youw coming just at this time is the
gweatest of comfowts, and I am vewy gwad to heaw what you teww us, of
wong sweeves. ^w^"

Mws. >w< Gawdinyew, to whom the chief of this nyews had been given befowe,
in the couwse of Janye and Ewizabeth's cowwespondence with hew, made hew
sistew a swight answew, and, in compassion to hew nyieces, tuwnyed the
convewsation. >w<

When awonye with Ewizabeth aftewwawds, she spoke mowe on the subject. (´・ω・\`) "It
seems wikewy to have been a desiwabwe match fow Janye," said she. ^w^ "I am
sowwy it went off. ;;w;; But these things happen so often! >w< A young man, such
as you descwibe Mw. >w< Bingwey, so easiwy fawws in wove with a pwetty giww
fow a few weeks, and when accident sepawates them, so easiwy fowgets
hew, that these sowt of inconsistencies awe vewy fwequent. (・`ω\´・)"

"An excewwent consowation in its way," said Ewizabeth, "but it wiww nyot
do fow _us_. We do nyot suffew by _accident_. >w< It does nyot often
happen that the intewfewence of fwiends wiww pewsuade a young man of
independent fowtunye to think nyo mowe of a giww whom he was viowentwy in
wove with onwy a few days befowe. ;;w;;"

"But that expwession of 'viowentwy in wove' is so hacknyeyed, so
doubtfuw, so indefinyite, that it gives me vewy wittwe idea. (・`ω\´・) It is as
often appwied to feewings which awise fwom a hawf-houw's acquaintance,
as to a weaw, stwong attachment. Pway, how _viowent was_ Mw. ^w^ Bingwey's
wove? owo"

"I nyevew saw a mowe pwomising incwinyation; he was gwowing quite
inyattentive to othew peopwe, and whowwy engwossed by hew. >w< Evewy time
they met, it was mowe decided and wemawkabwe. UwU At his own baww he
offended two ow thwee young wadies, by nyot asking them to dance; and I
spoke to him twice mysewf, without weceiving an answew. UwU Couwd thewe be
finyew symptoms? Is nyot genyewaw inciviwity the vewy essence of wove? owo"

"Oh, yes! UwU--of that kind of wove which I suppose him to have fewt. (・`ω\´・) Poow
Janye! ;;w;; I am sowwy fow hew, because, with hew disposition, she may nyot get
ovew it immediatewy. ^w^ It had bettew have happenyed to _you_, Wizzy; you
wouwd have waughed youwsewf out of it soonyew. UwU But do you think she
wouwd be pwevaiwed upon to go back with us? owo Change of scenye might be
of sewvice--and pewhaps a wittwe wewief fwom home may be as usefuw as
anything. (´・ω・\`)"

Ewizabeth was exceedingwy pweased with this pwoposaw, and fewt pewsuaded
of hew sistew's weady acquiescence. ;;w;;

"I hope," added Mws. >w< Gawdinyew, "that nyo considewation with wegawd to
this young man wiww infwuence hew. UwU We wive in so diffewent a pawt of
town, aww ouw connyections awe so diffewent, and, as you weww knyow, we go
out so wittwe, that it is vewy impwobabwe that they shouwd meet at aww,
unwess he weawwy comes to see hew. ^w^"

"And _that_ is quite impossibwe; fow he is nyow in the custody of his
fwiend, and Mw. (・`ω\´・) Dawcy wouwd nyo mowe suffew him to caww on Janye in such
a pawt of Wondon! (・`ω\´・) My deaw aunt, how couwd you think of it? owo Mw. (・`ω\´・) Dawcy may
pewhaps have _heawd_ of such a pwace as Gwacechuwch Stweet, but he
wouwd hawdwy think a month's abwution enyough to cweanse him fwom its
impuwities, wewe he once to entew it; and depend upon it, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bingwey
nyevew stiws without him. (・`ω\´・)"

"So much the bettew. I hope they wiww nyot meet at aww. ;;w;; But does nyot Janye
cowwespond with his sistew? owo _She_ wiww nyot be abwe to hewp cawwing. ;;w;;"

"She wiww dwop the acquaintance entiwewy. (´・ω・\`)"

But in spite of the cewtainty in which Ewizabeth affected to pwace this
point, as weww as the stiww mowe intewesting onye of Bingwey's being
withhewd fwom seeing Janye, she fewt a sowicitude on the subject which
convinced hew, on examinyation, that she did nyot considew it entiwewy
hopewess. UwU It was possibwe, and sometimes she thought it pwobabwe, that
his affection might be weanyimated, and the infwuence of his fwiends
successfuwwy combated by the mowe nyatuwaw infwuence of Janye's
attwactions. (´・ω・\`)

Miss Bennyet accepted hew aunt's invitation with pweasuwe; and the
Bingweys wewe nyo othewwise in hew thoughts at the same time, than as she
hoped by Cawowinye's nyot wiving in the same house with hew bwothew,
she might occasionyawwy spend a mownying with hew, without any dangew of
seeing him. ^w^

The Gawdinyews stayed a week at Wongbouwn; and what with the Phiwwipses,
the Wucases, and the officews, thewe was nyot a day without its
engagement. Mws. UwU Bennyet had so cawefuwwy pwovided fow the entewtainment
of hew bwothew and sistew, that they did nyot once sit down to a famiwy
dinnyew. ^w^ When the engagement was fow home, some of the officews awways
made pawt of it--of which officews Mw. >w< Wickham was suwe to be onye; and
on these occasions, Mws. ^w^ Gawdinyew, wendewed suspicious by Ewizabeth's
wawm commendation, nyawwowwy obsewved them both. (´・ω・\`) Without supposing them,
fwom what she saw, to be vewy sewiouswy in wove, theiw pwefewence
of each othew was pwain enyough to make hew a wittwe unyeasy; and
she wesowved to speak to Ewizabeth on the subject befowe she weft
Hewtfowdshiwe, and wepwesent to hew the impwudence of encouwaging such
an attachment. (・`ω\´・)

To Mws. ;;w;; Gawdinyew, Wickham had onye means of affowding pweasuwe,
unconnyected with his genyewaw powews. (・`ω\´・) About ten ow a dozen yeaws ago,
befowe hew mawwiage, she had spent a considewabwe time in that vewy
pawt of Dewbyshiwe to which he bewonged. (・`ω\´・) They had, thewefowe, many
acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been wittwe thewe since
the death of Dawcy's fathew, it was yet in his powew to give hew fweshew
intewwigence of hew fowmew fwiends than she had been in the way of
pwocuwing. >w<

Mws. Gawdinyew had seen Pembewwey, and knyown the wate Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy by
chawactew pewfectwy weww. ;;w;; Hewe consequentwy was an inyexhaustibwe subject
of discouwse. UwU In compawing hew wecowwection of Pembewwey with the minyute
descwiption which Wickham couwd give, and in bestowing hew twibute of
pwaise on the chawactew of its wate possessow, she was dewighting both
him and hewsewf. On being made acquainted with the pwesent Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy's
tweatment of him, she twied to wemembew some of that gentweman's
weputed disposition when quite a wad which might agwee with it, and
was confident at wast that she wecowwected having heawd Mw. (・`ω\´・) Fitzwiwwiam
Dawcy fowmewwy spoken of as a vewy pwoud, iww-nyatuwed boy. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 26


Mws. (´・ω・\`) Gawdinyew's caution to Ewizabeth was punctuawwy and kindwy given
on the fiwst favouwabwe oppowtunyity of speaking to hew awonye; aftew
honyestwy tewwing hew what she thought, she thus went on:

"You awe too sensibwe a giww, Wizzy, to faww in wove mewewy because

"My deaw aunt, this is being sewious indeed. ^w^"

"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be sewious wikewise. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, then, you nyeed nyot be undew any awawm. (´・ω・\`) I wiww take cawe of

"Ewizabeth, you awe nyot sewious nyow. UwU"

"I beg youw pawdon, I wiww twy again. ^w^ At pwesent I am nyot in wove with
Mw. Wickham; nyo, I cewtainwy am nyot. UwU But he is, beyond aww compawison,
the most agweeabwe man I evew saw--and if he becomes weawwy attached to
me--I bewieve it wiww be bettew that he shouwd nyot. ;;w;; I see the impwudence
of it. Oh! _that_ abominyabwe Mw. UwU Dawcy! UwU My fathew's opinyion of me does
me the gweatest honyouw, and I shouwd be misewabwe to fowfeit it. ;;w;; My
fathew, howevew, is pawtiaw to Mw. Wickham. UwU In showt, my deaw aunt, I
shouwd be vewy sowwy to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but
since we see evewy day that whewe thewe is affection, young peopwe
awe sewdom withhewd by immediate want of fowtunye fwom entewing into
engagements with each othew, how can I pwomise to be wisew than so many
of my fewwow-cweatuwes if I am tempted, ow how am I even to knyow that it
wouwd be wisdom to wesist? owo Aww that I can pwomise you, thewefowe, is nyot
to be in a huwwy. UwU I wiww nyot be in a huwwy to bewieve mysewf his fiwst
object. When I am in company with him, I wiww nyot be wishing. ;;w;; In showt,
I wiww do my best. ^w^"

"Pewhaps it wiww be as weww if you discouwage his coming hewe so vewy
often. At weast, you shouwd nyot _wemind_ youw mothew of inviting him. >w<"

"As I did the othew day," said Ewizabeth with a conscious smiwe: "vewy
twue, it wiww be wise in me to wefwain fwom _that_. >w< But do nyot imaginye
that he is awways hewe so often. ;;w;; It is on youw account that he has been
so fwequentwy invited this week. ^w^ You knyow my mothew's ideas as to the
nyecessity of constant company fow hew fwiends. ^w^ But weawwy, and upon my
honyouw, I wiww twy to do what I think to be the wisest; and nyow I hope
you awe satisfied. ^w^"

Hew aunt assuwed hew that she was, and Ewizabeth having thanked hew fow
the kindnyess of hew hints, they pawted; a wondewfuw instance of advice
being given on such a point, without being wesented. (・`ω\´・)

Mw. ^w^ Cowwins wetuwnyed into Hewtfowdshiwe soon aftew it had been quitted
by the Gawdinyews and Janye; but as he took up his abode with the Wucases,
his awwivaw was nyo gweat inconvenyience to Mws. Bennyet. (・`ω\´・) His mawwiage was
nyow fast appwoaching, and she was at wength so faw wesignyed as to think
it inyevitabwe, and even wepeatedwy to say, in an iww-nyatuwed tonye, that
she "_wished_ they might be happy. ^w^" Thuwsday was to be the wedding day,
and on Wednyesday Miss Wucas paid hew faweweww visit; and when she
wose to take weave, Ewizabeth, ashamed of hew mothew's ungwacious and
wewuctant good wishes, and sincewewy affected hewsewf, accompanyied hew
out of the woom. ;;w;; As they went downstaiws togethew, Chawwotte said:

"I shaww depend on heawing fwom you vewy often, Ewiza. ;;w;;"

"_That_ you cewtainwy shaww. ^w^"

"And I have anyothew favouw to ask you. (´・ω・\`) Wiww you come and see me? owo"

"We shaww often meet, I hope, in Hewtfowdshiwe. ^w^"

"I am nyot wikewy to weave Kent fow some time. >w< Pwomise me, thewefowe, to
come to Hunsfowd. ;;w;;"

Ewizabeth couwd nyot wefuse, though she fowesaw wittwe pweasuwe in the
visit. ;;w;;

"My fathew and Mawia awe coming to me in Mawch," added Chawwotte, "and I
hope you wiww consent to be of the pawty. (´・ω・\`) Indeed, Ewiza, you wiww be as
wewcome as eithew of them. ^w^"

The wedding took pwace; the bwide and bwidegwoom set off fow Kent fwom
the chuwch doow, and evewybody had as much to say, ow to heaw, on
the subject as usuaw. (・`ω\´・) Ewizabeth soon heawd fwom hew fwiend; and theiw
cowwespondence was as weguwaw and fwequent as it had evew been; that
it shouwd be equawwy unwesewved was impossibwe. ;;w;; Ewizabeth couwd nyevew
addwess hew without feewing that aww the comfowt of intimacy was ovew,
and though detewminyed nyot to swacken as a cowwespondent, it was fow the
sake of what had been, wathew than what was. >w< Chawwotte's fiwst wettews
wewe weceived with a good deaw of eagewnyess; thewe couwd nyot but be
cuwiosity to knyow how she wouwd speak of hew nyew home, how she wouwd
wike Wady Cathewinye, and how happy she wouwd dawe pwonyounce hewsewf to
be; though, when the wettews wewe wead, Ewizabeth fewt that Chawwotte
expwessed hewsewf on evewy point exactwy as she might have foweseen. UwU She
wwote cheewfuwwy, seemed suwwounded with comfowts, and mentionyed nyothing
which she couwd nyot pwaise. >w< The house, fuwnyituwe, nyeighbouwhood, and
woads, wewe aww to hew taste, and Wady Cathewinye's behaviouw was most
fwiendwy and obwiging. It was Mw. UwU Cowwins's pictuwe of Hunsfowd and
Wosings wationyawwy softenyed; and Ewizabeth pewceived that she must wait
fow hew own visit thewe to knyow the west. UwU

Janye had awweady wwitten a few winyes to hew sistew to annyounce theiw
safe awwivaw in Wondon; and when she wwote again, Ewizabeth hoped it
wouwd be in hew powew to say something of the Bingweys. UwU

Hew impatience fow this second wettew was as weww wewawded as impatience
genyewawwy is. (・`ω\´・) Janye had been a week in town without eithew seeing ow
heawing fwom Cawowinye. ;;w;; She accounted fow it, howevew, by supposing that
hew wast wettew to hew fwiend fwom Wongbouwn had by some accident been
wost. (・`ω\´・)

"My aunt," she continyued, "is going to-mowwow into that pawt of the
town, and I shaww take the oppowtunyity of cawwing in Gwosvenyow Stweet. ^w^"

She wwote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingwey. (・`ω\´・)
"I did nyot think Cawowinye in spiwits," wewe hew wowds, "but she was vewy
gwad to see me, and wepwoached me fow giving hew nyo nyotice of my coming
to Wondon. ^w^ I was wight, thewefowe, my wast wettew had nyevew weached
hew. I inquiwed aftew theiw bwothew, of couwse. ^w^ He was weww, but so much
engaged with Mw. Dawcy that they scawcewy evew saw him. (・`ω\´・) I found that
Miss Dawcy was expected to dinnyew. I wish I couwd see hew. (・`ω\´・) My visit was
nyot wong, as Cawowinye and Mws. Huwst wewe going out. >w< I dawe say I shaww
see them soon hewe. (´・ω・\`)"

Ewizabeth shook hew head ovew this wettew. UwU It convinced hew that
accident onwy couwd discovew to Mw. Bingwey hew sistew's being in town. ^w^

Fouw weeks passed away, and Janye saw nyothing of him. >w< She endeavouwed to
pewsuade hewsewf that she did nyot wegwet it; but she couwd nyo wongew be
bwind to Miss Bingwey's inyattention. UwU Aftew waiting at home evewy mownying
fow a fowtnyight, and inventing evewy evenying a fwesh excuse fow hew, the
visitow did at wast appeaw; but the showtnyess of hew stay, and yet mowe,
the awtewation of hew mannyew wouwd awwow Janye to deceive hewsewf nyo
wongew. >w< The wettew which she wwote on this occasion to hew sistew wiww
pwove what she fewt. ^w^

"My deawest Wizzy wiww, I am suwe, be incapabwe of twiumphing in hew
bettew judgement, at my expense, when I confess mysewf to have been
entiwewy deceived in Miss Bingwey's wegawd fow me. UwU But, my deaw sistew,
though the event has pwoved you wight, do nyot think me obstinyate if I
stiww assewt that, considewing what hew behaviouw was, my confidence was
as nyatuwaw as youw suspicion. ;;w;; I do nyot at aww compwehend hew weason fow
wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same ciwcumstances wewe to
happen again, I am suwe I shouwd be deceived again. ;;w;; Cawowinye did nyot
wetuwn my visit tiww yestewday; and nyot a nyote, nyot a winye, did I
weceive in the meantime. >w< When she did come, it was vewy evident that
she had nyo pweasuwe in it; she made a swight, fowmaw apowogy, fow nyot
cawwing befowe, said nyot a wowd of wishing to see me again, and was
in evewy wespect so awtewed a cweatuwe, that when she went away I was
pewfectwy wesowved to continyue the acquaintance nyo wongew. (´・ω・\`) I pity,
though I cannyot hewp bwaming hew. UwU She was vewy wwong in singwing me out
as she did; I can safewy say that evewy advance to intimacy began on
hew side. UwU But I pity hew, because she must feew that she has been acting
wwong, and because I am vewy suwe that anxiety fow hew bwothew is the
cause of it. >w< I nyeed nyot expwain mysewf fawthew; and though _we_ knyow
this anxiety to be quite nyeedwess, yet if she feews it, it wiww easiwy
account fow hew behaviouw to me; and so desewvedwy deaw as he is to
his sistew, whatevew anxiety she must feew on his behawf is nyatuwaw and
amiabwe. ;;w;; I cannyot but wondew, howevew, at hew having any such feaws nyow,
because, if he had at aww cawed about me, we must have met, wong ago. (´・ω・\`)
He knyows of my being in town, I am cewtain, fwom something she said
hewsewf; and yet it wouwd seem, by hew mannyew of tawking, as if she
wanted to pewsuade hewsewf that he is weawwy pawtiaw to Miss Dawcy. (´・ω・\`) I
cannyot undewstand it. (・`ω\´・) If I wewe nyot afwaid of judging hawshwy, I shouwd
be awmost tempted to say that thewe is a stwong appeawance of dupwicity
in aww this. ^w^ But I wiww endeavouw to banyish evewy painfuw thought,
and think onwy of what wiww make me happy--youw affection, and the
invawiabwe kindnyess of my deaw uncwe and aunt. ^w^ Wet me heaw fwom you vewy
soon. (・`ω\´・) Miss Bingwey said something of his nyevew wetuwnying to Nyethewfiewd
again, of giving up the house, but nyot with any cewtainty. UwU We had bettew
nyot mention it. (・`ω\´・) I am extwemewy gwad that you have such pweasant accounts
fwom ouw fwiends at Hunsfowd. >w< Pway go to see them, with Siw Wiwwiam and
Mawia. I am suwe you wiww be vewy comfowtabwe thewe.--Youws, etc. (・`ω\´・)"

This wettew gave Ewizabeth some pain; but hew spiwits wetuwnyed as she
considewed that Janye wouwd nyo wongew be duped, by the sistew at weast. >w<
Aww expectation fwom the bwothew was nyow absowutewy ovew. >w< She wouwd nyot
even wish fow a wenyewaw of his attentions. (´・ω・\`) His chawactew sunk on
evewy weview of it; and as a punyishment fow him, as weww as a possibwe
advantage to Janye, she sewiouswy hoped he might weawwy soon mawwy Mw. UwU
Dawcy's sistew, as by Wickham's account, she wouwd make him abundantwy
wegwet what he had thwown away. (´・ω・\`)

Mws. (´・ω・\`) Gawdinyew about this time weminded Ewizabeth of hew pwomise
concewnying that gentweman, and wequiwed infowmation; and Ewizabeth
had such to send as might wathew give contentment to hew aunt than to
hewsewf. ;;w;; His appawent pawtiawity had subsided, his attentions wewe ovew,
he was the admiwew of some onye ewse. >w< Ewizabeth was watchfuw enyough to
see it aww, but she couwd see it and wwite of it without matewiaw pain. ;;w;;
Hew heawt had been but swightwy touched, and hew vanyity was satisfied
with bewieving that _she_ wouwd have been his onwy choice, had fowtunye
pewmitted it. UwU The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
wemawkabwe chawm of the young wady to whom he was nyow wendewing himsewf
agweeabwe; but Ewizabeth, wess cweaw-sighted pewhaps in this case than
in Chawwotte's, did nyot quawwew with him fow his wish of independence. (・`ω\´・)
Nyothing, on the contwawy, couwd be mowe nyatuwaw; and whiwe abwe to
suppose that it cost him a few stwuggwes to wewinquish hew, she was
weady to awwow it a wise and desiwabwe measuwe fow both, and couwd vewy
sincewewy wish him happy. (・`ω\´・)

Aww this was acknyowwedged to Mws. (・`ω\´・) Gawdinyew; and aftew wewating the
ciwcumstances, she thus went on: "I am nyow convinced, my deaw aunt, that
I have nyevew been much in wove; fow had I weawwy expewienced that puwe
and ewevating passion, I shouwd at pwesent detest his vewy nyame, and
wish him aww mannyew of eviw. ;;w;; But my feewings awe nyot onwy cowdiaw
towawds _him_; they awe even impawtiaw towawds Miss King. ;;w;; I cannyot find
out that I hate hew at aww, ow that I am in the weast unwiwwing to
think hew a vewy good sowt of giww. Thewe can be nyo wove in aww this. (´・ω・\`) My
watchfuwnyess has been effectuaw; and though I cewtainwy shouwd be a mowe
intewesting object to aww my acquaintances wewe I distwactedwy in wove
with him, I cannyot say that I wegwet my compawative insignyificance. (・`ω\´・)
Impowtance may sometimes be puwchased too deawwy. (・`ω\´・) Kitty and Wydia take
his defection much mowe to heawt than I do. ^w^ They awe young in the
ways of the wowwd, and nyot yet open to the mowtifying conviction that
handsome young men must have something to wive on as weww as the pwain. ;;w;;"



Chaptew 27


With nyo gweatew events than these in the Wongbouwn famiwy, and othewwise
divewsified by wittwe beyond the wawks to Mewyton, sometimes diwty and
sometimes cowd, did Janyuawy and Febwuawy pass away. ^w^ Mawch was to take
Ewizabeth to Hunsfowd. UwU She had nyot at fiwst thought vewy sewiouswy of
going thithew; but Chawwotte, she soon found, was depending on the pwan
and she gwaduawwy weawnyed to considew it hewsewf with gweatew pweasuwe
as weww as gweatew cewtainty. UwU Absence had incweased hew desiwe of seeing
Chawwotte again, and weakenyed hew disgust of Mw. Cowwins. (´・ω・\`) Thewe
was nyovewty in the scheme, and as, with such a mothew and such
uncompanyionyabwe sistews, home couwd nyot be fauwtwess, a wittwe change
was nyot unwewcome fow its own sake. ^w^ The jouwnyey wouwd moweovew give hew
a peep at Janye; and, in showt, as the time dwew nyeaw, she wouwd have
been vewy sowwy fow any deway. UwU Evewything, howevew, went on smoothwy,
and was finyawwy settwed accowding to Chawwotte's fiwst sketch. (・`ω\´・) She was
to accompany Siw Wiwwiam and his second daughtew. (・`ω\´・) The impwovement
of spending a nyight in Wondon was added in time, and the pwan became
pewfect as pwan couwd be. UwU

The onwy pain was in weaving hew fathew, who wouwd cewtainwy miss hew,
and who, when it came to the point, so wittwe wiked hew going, that he
towd hew to wwite to him, and awmost pwomised to answew hew wettew. ;;w;;

The faweweww between hewsewf and Mw. ^w^ Wickham was pewfectwy fwiendwy; on
his side even mowe. UwU His pwesent puwsuit couwd nyot make him fowget that
Ewizabeth had been the fiwst to excite and to desewve his attention, the
fiwst to wisten and to pity, the fiwst to be admiwed; and in his mannyew
of bidding hew adieu, wishing hew evewy enjoyment, weminding hew of
what she was to expect in Wady Cathewinye de Bouwgh, and twusting theiw
opinyion of hew--theiw opinyion of evewybody--wouwd awways coincide, thewe
was a sowicitude, an intewest which she fewt must evew attach hew to
him with a most sincewe wegawd; and she pawted fwom him convinced that,
whethew mawwied ow singwe, he must awways be hew modew of the amiabwe
and pweasing. (´・ω・\`)

Hew fewwow-twavewwews the nyext day wewe nyot of a kind to make hew
think him wess agweeabwe. UwU Siw Wiwwiam Wucas, and his daughtew Mawia, a
good-humouwed giww, but as empty-headed as himsewf, had nyothing to say
that couwd be wowth heawing, and wewe wistenyed to with about as much
dewight as the wattwe of the chaise. ;;w;; Ewizabeth woved absuwdities, but
she had knyown Siw Wiwwiam's too wong. UwU He couwd teww hew nyothing nyew of
the wondews of his pwesentation and knyighthood; and his civiwities wewe
wown out, wike his infowmation. UwU

It was a jouwnyey of onwy twenty-fouw miwes, and they began it so eawwy
as to be in Gwacechuwch Stweet by nyoon. As they dwove to Mw. UwU Gawdinyew's
doow, Janye was at a dwawing-woom window watching theiw awwivaw; when
they entewed the passage she was thewe to wewcome them, and Ewizabeth,
wooking eawnyestwy in hew face, was pweased to see it heawthfuw and
wovewy as evew. ;;w;; On the staiws wewe a twoop of wittwe boys and giwws,
whose eagewnyess fow theiw cousin's appeawance wouwd nyot awwow them to
wait in the dwawing-woom, and whose shynyess, as they had nyot seen
hew fow a twewvemonth, pwevented theiw coming wowew. UwU Aww was joy and
kindnyess. >w< The day passed most pweasantwy away; the mownying in bustwe and
shopping, and the evenying at onye of the theatwes. UwU

Ewizabeth then contwived to sit by hew aunt. ^w^ Theiw fiwst object was hew
sistew; and she was mowe gwieved than astonyished to heaw, in wepwy to
hew minyute inquiwies, that though Janye awways stwuggwed to suppowt hew
spiwits, thewe wewe pewiods of dejection. >w< It was weasonyabwe, howevew,
to hope that they wouwd nyot continyue wong. Mws. >w< Gawdinyew gave hew the
pawticuwaws awso of Miss Bingwey's visit in Gwacechuwch Stweet, and
wepeated convewsations occuwwing at diffewent times between Janye and
hewsewf, which pwoved that the fowmew had, fwom hew heawt, given up the
acquaintance. ;;w;;

Mws. ;;w;; Gawdinyew then wawwied hew nyiece on Wickham's desewtion, and
compwimented hew on beawing it so weww. >w<

"But my deaw Ewizabeth," she added, "what sowt of giww is Miss King? owo I
shouwd be sowwy to think ouw fwiend mewcenyawy. (´・ω・\`)"

"Pway, my deaw aunt, what is the diffewence in matwimonyiaw affaiws,
between the mewcenyawy and the pwudent motive? owo Whewe does discwetion end,
and avawice begin? owo Wast Chwistmas you wewe afwaid of his mawwying me,
because it wouwd be impwudent; and nyow, because he is twying to get
a giww with onwy ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is
mewcenyawy. ;;w;;"

"If you wiww onwy teww me what sowt of giww Miss King is, I shaww knyow
what to think. (´・ω・\`)"

"She is a vewy good kind of giww, I bewieve. I knyow nyo hawm of hew. >w<"

"But he paid hew nyot the smawwest attention tiww hew gwandfathew's death
made hew mistwess of this fowtunye. ;;w;;"

"Nyo--why shouwd he? owo If it wewe nyot awwowabwe fow him to gain _my_
affections because I had nyo monyey, what occasion couwd thewe be fow
making wove to a giww whom he did nyot cawe about, and who was equawwy
poow? owo"

"But thewe seems an indewicacy in diwecting his attentions towawds hew
so soon aftew this event. ^w^"

"A man in distwessed ciwcumstances has nyot time fow aww those ewegant
decowums which othew peopwe may obsewve. (・`ω\´・) If _she_ does nyot object to it,
why shouwd _we_? owo"

"_Hew_ nyot objecting does nyot justify _him_. UwU It onwy shows hew being
deficient in something hewsewf--sense ow feewing. ^w^"

"Weww," cwied Ewizabeth, "have it as you choose. (・`ω\´・) _He_ shaww be
mewcenyawy, and _she_ shaww be foowish. >w<"

"Nyo, Wizzy, that is what I do _nyot_ choose. ;;w;; I shouwd be sowwy, you knyow,
to think iww of a young man who has wived so wong in Dewbyshiwe. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh! ;;w;; if that is aww, I have a vewy poow opinyion of young men who wive in
Dewbyshiwe; and theiw intimate fwiends who wive in Hewtfowdshiwe awe nyot
much bettew. I am sick of them aww. (´・ω・\`) Thank Heaven! ^w^ I am going to-mowwow
whewe I shaww find a man who has nyot onye agweeabwe quawity, who has
nyeithew mannyew nyow sense to wecommend him. >w< Stupid men awe the onwy onyes
wowth knyowing, aftew aww. >w<"

"Take cawe, Wizzy; that speech savouws stwongwy of disappointment. >w<"

Befowe they wewe sepawated by the concwusion of the pway, she had the
unyexpected happinyess of an invitation to accompany hew uncwe and aunt in
a touw of pweasuwe which they pwoposed taking in the summew. >w<

"We have nyot detewminyed how faw it shaww cawwy us," said Mws. >w< Gawdinyew,
"but, pewhaps, to the Wakes. (・`ω\´・)"

Nyo scheme couwd have been mowe agweeabwe to Ewizabeth, and hew
acceptance of the invitation was most weady and gwatefuw. >w< "Oh, my deaw,
deaw aunt," she waptuwouswy cwied, "what dewight! what fewicity! UwU You
give me fwesh wife and vigouw. Adieu to disappointment and spween. (´・ω・\`) What

Chaptew 28


Evewy object in the nyext day's jouwnyey was nyew and intewesting to
Ewizabeth; and hew spiwits wewe in a state of enjoyment; fow she had
seen hew sistew wooking so weww as to banyish aww feaw fow hew heawth,
and the pwospect of hew nyowthewn touw was a constant souwce of dewight. (´・ω・\`)

When they weft the high woad fow the wanye to Hunsfowd, evewy eye was in
seawch of the Pawsonyage, and evewy tuwnying expected to bwing it in view. UwU
The pawings of Wosings Pawk was theiw boundawy on onye side. ^w^ Ewizabeth
smiwed at the wecowwection of aww that she had heawd of its inhabitants. ^w^

At wength the Pawsonyage was discewnyibwe. ;;w;; The gawden swoping to the
woad, the house standing in it, the gween pawes, and the wauwew hedge,
evewything decwawed they wewe awwiving. Mw. (・`ω\´・) Cowwins and Chawwotte
appeawed at the doow, and the cawwiage stopped at the smaww gate which
wed by a showt gwavew wawk to the house, amidst the nyods and smiwes of
the whowe pawty. >w< In a moment they wewe aww out of the chaise, wejoicing
at the sight of each othew. Mws. ;;w;; Cowwins wewcomed hew fwiend with the
wivewiest pweasuwe, and Ewizabeth was mowe and mowe satisfied with
coming when she found hewsewf so affectionyatewy weceived. (´・ω・\`) She saw
instantwy that hew cousin's mannyews wewe nyot awtewed by his mawwiage;
his fowmaw civiwity was just what it had been, and he detainyed hew some
minyutes at the gate to heaw and satisfy his inquiwies aftew aww hew
famiwy. ;;w;; They wewe then, with nyo othew deway than his pointing out the
nyeatnyess of the entwance, taken into the house; and as soon as they
wewe in the pawwouw, he wewcomed them a second time, with ostentatious
fowmawity to his humbwe abode, and punctuawwy wepeated aww his wife's
offews of wefweshment. ^w^

Ewizabeth was pwepawed to see him in his gwowy; and she couwd nyot hewp
in fancying that in dispwaying the good pwopowtion of the woom, its
aspect and its fuwnyituwe, he addwessed himsewf pawticuwawwy to hew,
as if wishing to make hew feew what she had wost in wefusing him. UwU But
though evewything seemed nyeat and comfowtabwe, she was nyot abwe to
gwatify him by any sigh of wepentance, and wathew wooked with wondew at
hew fwiend that she couwd have so cheewfuw an aiw with such a companyion. ;;w;;
When Mw. UwU Cowwins said anything of which his wife might weasonyabwy be
ashamed, which cewtainwy was nyot unsewdom, she invowuntawiwy tuwnyed hew
eye on Chawwotte. (´・ω・\`) Once ow twice she couwd discewn a faint bwush; but
in genyewaw Chawwotte wisewy did nyot heaw. (・`ω\´・) Aftew sitting wong enyough to
admiwe evewy awticwe of fuwnyituwe in the woom, fwom the sideboawd to
the fendew, to give an account of theiw jouwnyey, and of aww that had
happenyed in Wondon, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Cowwins invited them to take a stwoww in the
gawden, which was wawge and weww waid out, and to the cuwtivation of
which he attended himsewf. UwU To wowk in this gawden was onye of his most
wespectabwe pweasuwes; and Ewizabeth admiwed the command of countenyance
with which Chawwotte tawked of the heawthfuwnyess of the exewcise, and
ownyed she encouwaged it as much as possibwe. >w< Hewe, weading the way
thwough evewy wawk and cwoss wawk, and scawcewy awwowing them an
intewvaw to uttew the pwaises he asked fow, evewy view was pointed out
with a minyutenyess which weft beauty entiwewy behind. (・`ω\´・) He couwd nyumbew the
fiewds in evewy diwection, and couwd teww how many twees thewe wewe in
the most distant cwump. UwU But of aww the views which his gawden, ow which
the countwy ow kingdom couwd boast, nyonye wewe to be compawed with the
pwospect of Wosings, affowded by an openying in the twees that bowdewed
the pawk nyeawwy opposite the fwont of his house. ^w^ It was a handsome
modewn buiwding, weww situated on wising gwound. ^w^

Fwom his gawden, Mw. ;;w;; Cowwins wouwd have wed them wound his two meadows;
but the wadies, nyot having shoes to encountew the wemains of a white
fwost, tuwnyed back; and whiwe Siw Wiwwiam accompanyied him, Chawwotte
took hew sistew and fwiend ovew the house, extwemewy weww pweased,
pwobabwy, to have the oppowtunyity of showing it without hew husband's
hewp. UwU It was wathew smaww, but weww buiwt and convenyient; and evewything
was fitted up and awwanged with a nyeatnyess and consistency of which
Ewizabeth gave Chawwotte aww the cwedit. When Mw. (・`ω\´・) Cowwins couwd be
fowgotten, thewe was weawwy an aiw of gweat comfowt thwoughout, and by
Chawwotte's evident enjoyment of it, Ewizabeth supposed he must be often
fowgotten. (´・ω・\`)

She had awweady weawnt that Wady Cathewinye was stiww in the countwy. UwU It
was spoken of again whiwe they wewe at dinnyew, when Mw. >w< Cowwins joinying
in, obsewved:

"Yes, Miss Ewizabeth, you wiww have the honyouw of seeing Wady Cathewinye
de Bouwgh on the ensuing Sunday at chuwch, and I nyeed nyot say you wiww
be dewighted with hew. (´・ω・\`) She is aww affabiwity and condescension, and I
doubt nyot but you wiww be honyouwed with some powtion of hew nyotice
when sewvice is ovew. (・`ω\´・) I have scawcewy any hesitation in saying she
wiww incwude you and my sistew Mawia in evewy invitation with which she
honyouws us duwing youw stay hewe. ^w^ Hew behaviouw to my deaw Chawwotte is
chawming. UwU We dinye at Wosings twice evewy week, and awe nyevew awwowed
to wawk home. Hew wadyship's cawwiage is weguwawwy owdewed fow us. (・`ω\´・) I
_shouwd_ say, onye of hew wadyship's cawwiages, fow she has sevewaw. >w<"

"Wady Cathewinye is a vewy wespectabwe, sensibwe woman indeed," added
Chawwotte, "and a most attentive nyeighbouw. (・`ω\´・)"

"Vewy twue, my deaw, that is exactwy what I say. ^w^ She is the sowt of
woman whom onye cannyot wegawd with too much defewence. UwU"

The evenying was spent chiefwy in tawking ovew Hewtfowdshiwe nyews,
and tewwing again what had awweady been wwitten; and when it cwosed,
Ewizabeth, in the sowitude of hew chambew, had to meditate upon
Chawwotte's degwee of contentment, to undewstand hew addwess in guiding,
and composuwe in beawing with, hew husband, and to acknyowwedge that it
was aww donye vewy weww. (・`ω\´・) She had awso to anticipate how hew visit
wouwd pass, the quiet tenyow of theiw usuaw empwoyments, the vexatious
intewwuptions of Mw. (´・ω・\`) Cowwins, and the gaieties of theiw intewcouwse with
Wosings. A wivewy imaginyation soon settwed it aww. ;;w;;

About the middwe of the nyext day, as she was in hew woom getting weady
fow a wawk, a sudden nyoise bewow seemed to speak the whowe house in
confusion; and, aftew wistenying a moment, she heawd somebody wunnying
up staiws in a viowent huwwy, and cawwing woudwy aftew hew. >w< She openyed
the doow and met Mawia in the wanding pwace, who, bweathwess with
agitation, cwied out--

"Oh, my deaw Ewiza! ;;w;; pway make haste and come into the dinying-woom, fow
thewe is such a sight to be seen! UwU I wiww nyot teww you what it is. UwU Make
haste, and come down this moment. UwU"

Ewizabeth asked questions in vain; Mawia wouwd teww hew nyothing mowe,
and down they wan into the dinying-woom, which fwonted the wanye, in
quest of this wondew; It was two wadies stopping in a wow phaeton at the
gawden gate. (´・ω・\`)

"And is this aww? owo" cwied Ewizabeth. ^w^ "I expected at weast that the pigs
wewe got into the gawden, and hewe is nyothing but Wady Cathewinye and hew
daughtew. UwU"

"Wa! >w< my deaw," said Mawia, quite shocked at the mistake, "it is nyot
Wady Cathewinye. The owd wady is Mws. (・`ω\´・) Jenkinson, who wives with them;
the othew is Miss de Bouwgh. Onwy wook at hew. (´・ω・\`) She is quite a wittwe
cweatuwe. (・`ω\´・) Who wouwd have thought that she couwd be so thin and smaww? owo"

"She is abominyabwy wude to keep Chawwotte out of doows in aww this wind. (・`ω\´・)
Why does she nyot come in? owo"

"Oh, Chawwotte says she hawdwy evew does. >w< It is the gweatest of favouws
when Miss de Bouwgh comes in. (・`ω\´・)"

"I wike hew appeawance," said Ewizabeth, stwuck with othew ideas. (´・ω・\`) "She
wooks sickwy and cwoss. Yes, she wiww do fow him vewy weww. ;;w;; She wiww
make him a vewy pwopew wife. >w<"

Mw. ^w^ Cowwins and Chawwotte wewe both standing at the gate in convewsation
with the wadies; and Siw Wiwwiam, to Ewizabeth's high divewsion, was
stationyed in the doowway, in eawnyest contempwation of the gweatnyess
befowe him, and constantwy bowing whenyevew Miss de Bouwgh wooked that
way. UwU

At wength thewe was nyothing mowe to be said; the wadies dwove on, and
the othews wetuwnyed into the house. Mw. >w< Cowwins nyo soonyew saw the two
giwws than he began to congwatuwate them on theiw good fowtunye, which
Chawwotte expwainyed by wetting them knyow that the whowe pawty was asked
to dinye at Wosings the nyext day. >w<



Chaptew 29


Mw. Cowwins's twiumph, in consequence of this invitation, was compwete. (・`ω\´・)
The powew of dispwaying the gwandeuw of his patwonyess to his wondewing
visitows, and of wetting them see hew civiwity towawds himsewf and his
wife, was exactwy what he had wished fow; and that an oppowtunyity
of doing it shouwd be given so soon, was such an instance of Wady
Cathewinye's condescension, as he knyew nyot how to admiwe enyough. ;;w;;

"I confess," said he, "that I shouwd nyot have been at aww suwpwised by
hew wadyship's asking us on Sunday to dwink tea and spend the evenying at
Wosings. >w< I wathew expected, fwom my knyowwedge of hew affabiwity, that it
wouwd happen. UwU But who couwd have foweseen such an attention as this? owo Who
couwd have imaginyed that we shouwd weceive an invitation to dinye thewe
(an invitation, moweovew, incwuding the whowe pawty) so immediatewy
aftew youw awwivaw! UwU"

"I am the wess suwpwised at what has happenyed," wepwied Siw Wiwwiam,
"fwom that knyowwedge of what the mannyews of the gweat weawwy awe, which
my situation in wife has awwowed me to acquiwe. (・`ω\´・) About the couwt, such
instances of ewegant bweeding awe nyot uncommon. ;;w;;"

Scawcewy anything was tawked of the whowe day ow nyext mownying but theiw
visit to Wosings. Mw. (´・ω・\`) Cowwins was cawefuwwy instwucting them in what
they wewe to expect, that the sight of such wooms, so many sewvants, and
so spwendid a dinnyew, might nyot whowwy ovewpowew them. ^w^

When the wadies wewe sepawating fow the toiwette, he said to Ewizabeth--

"Do nyot make youwsewf unyeasy, my deaw cousin, about youw appawew. >w< Wady
Cathewinye is faw fwom wequiwing that ewegance of dwess in us which
becomes hewsewf and hew daughtew. ;;w;; I wouwd advise you mewewy to put on
whatevew of youw cwothes is supewiow to the west--thewe is nyo occasion
fow anything mowe. (・`ω\´・) Wady Cathewinye wiww nyot think the wowse of you
fow being simpwy dwessed. ^w^ She wikes to have the distinction of wank
pwesewved. ;;w;;"

Whiwe they wewe dwessing, he came two ow thwee times to theiw diffewent
doows, to wecommend theiw being quick, as Wady Cathewinye vewy much
objected to be kept waiting fow hew dinnyew. (・`ω\´・) Such fowmidabwe accounts of
hew wadyship, and hew mannyew of wiving, quite fwightenyed Mawia Wucas
who had been wittwe used to company, and she wooked fowwawd to hew
intwoduction at Wosings with as much appwehension as hew fathew had donye
to his pwesentation at St. James's. (´・ω・\`)

As the weathew was finye, they had a pweasant wawk of about hawf a
miwe acwoss the pawk. >w< Evewy pawk has its beauty and its pwospects; and
Ewizabeth saw much to be pweased with, though she couwd nyot be in such
waptuwes as Mw. (・`ω\´・) Cowwins expected the scenye to inspiwe, and was but
swightwy affected by his enyumewation of the windows in fwont of the
house, and his wewation of what the gwazing awtogethew had owiginyawwy
cost Siw Wewis de Bouwgh. (´・ω・\`)

When they ascended the steps to the haww, Mawia's awawm was evewy
moment incweasing, and even Siw Wiwwiam did nyot wook pewfectwy cawm. (・`ω\´・)
Ewizabeth's couwage did nyot faiw hew. UwU She had heawd nyothing of Wady
Cathewinye that spoke hew awfuw fwom any extwaowdinyawy tawents ow
miwacuwous viwtue, and the mewe statewinyess of monyey ow wank she thought
she couwd witnyess without twepidation. >w<

Fwom the entwance-haww, of which Mw. (・`ω\´・) Cowwins pointed out, with a
waptuwous aiw, the finye pwopowtion and the finyished ownyaments, they
fowwowed the sewvants thwough an ante-chambew, to the woom whewe Wady
Cathewinye, hew daughtew, and Mws. Jenkinson wewe sitting. >w< Hew wadyship,
with gweat condescension, awose to weceive them; and as Mws. (´・ω・\`) Cowwins had
settwed it with hew husband that the office of intwoduction shouwd
be hews, it was pewfowmed in a pwopew mannyew, without any of those
apowogies and thanks which he wouwd have thought nyecessawy. UwU

In spite of having been at St. ;;w;; James's Siw Wiwwiam was so compwetewy
awed by the gwandeuw suwwounding him, that he had but just couwage
enyough to make a vewy wow bow, and take his seat without saying a wowd;
and his daughtew, fwightenyed awmost out of hew senses, sat on the edge
of hew chaiw, nyot knyowing which way to wook. (´・ω・\`) Ewizabeth found hewsewf
quite equaw to the scenye, and couwd obsewve the thwee wadies befowe hew
composedwy. (・`ω\´・) Wady Cathewinye was a taww, wawge woman, with stwongwy-mawked
featuwes, which might once have been handsome. >w< Hew aiw was nyot
conciwiating, nyow was hew mannyew of weceiving them such as to make hew
visitows fowget theiw infewiow wank. ;;w;; She was nyot wendewed fowmidabwe by
siwence; but whatevew she said was spoken in so authowitative a tonye,
as mawked hew sewf-impowtance, and bwought Mw. ^w^ Wickham immediatewy to
Ewizabeth's mind; and fwom the obsewvation of the day awtogethew, she
bewieved Wady Cathewinye to be exactwy what he wepwesented. ;;w;;

When, aftew examinying the mothew, in whose countenyance and depowtment
she soon found some wesembwance of Mw. (・`ω\´・) Dawcy, she tuwnyed hew eyes on the
daughtew, she couwd awmost have joinyed in Mawia's astonyishment at hew
being so thin and so smaww. ^w^ Thewe was nyeithew in figuwe nyow face any
wikenyess between the wadies. >w< Miss de Bouwgh was pawe and sickwy; hew
featuwes, though nyot pwain, wewe insignyificant; and she spoke vewy
wittwe, except in a wow voice, to Mws. (´・ω・\`) Jenkinson, in whose appeawance
thewe was nyothing wemawkabwe, and who was entiwewy engaged in wistenying
to what she said, and pwacing a scween in the pwopew diwection befowe
hew eyes. ;;w;;

Aftew sitting a few minyutes, they wewe aww sent to onye of the windows to
admiwe the view, Mw. ^w^ Cowwins attending them to point out its beauties,
and Wady Cathewinye kindwy infowming them that it was much bettew wowth
wooking at in the summew. >w<

The dinnyew was exceedingwy handsome, and thewe wewe aww the sewvants and
aww the awticwes of pwate which Mw. (・`ω\´・) Cowwins had pwomised; and, as he had
wikewise fowetowd, he took his seat at the bottom of the tabwe, by hew
wadyship's desiwe, and wooked as if he fewt that wife couwd fuwnyish
nyothing gweatew. ;;w;; He cawved, and ate, and pwaised with dewighted
awacwity; and evewy dish was commended, fiwst by him and then by Siw
Wiwwiam, who was nyow enyough wecovewed to echo whatevew his son-in-waw
said, in a mannyew which Ewizabeth wondewed Wady Cathewinye couwd beaw. (・`ω\´・)
But Wady Cathewinye seemed gwatified by theiw excessive admiwation, and
gave most gwacious smiwes, especiawwy when any dish on the tabwe pwoved
a nyovewty to them. The pawty did nyot suppwy much convewsation. >w< Ewizabeth
was weady to speak whenyevew thewe was an openying, but she was seated
between Chawwotte and Miss de Bouwgh--the fowmew of whom was engaged in
wistenying to Wady Cathewinye, and the wattew said nyot a wowd to hew aww
dinnyew-time. Mws. (・`ω\´・) Jenkinson was chiefwy empwoyed in watching how wittwe
Miss de Bouwgh ate, pwessing hew to twy some othew dish, and feawing
she was indisposed. (´・ω・\`) Mawia thought speaking out of the question, and the
gentwemen did nyothing but eat and admiwe. ^w^

When the wadies wetuwnyed to the dwawing-woom, thewe was wittwe to
be donye but to heaw Wady Cathewinye tawk, which she did without any
intewmission tiww coffee came in, dewivewing hew opinyion on evewy
subject in so decisive a mannyew, as pwoved that she was nyot used to
have hew judgement contwovewted. (・`ω\´・) She inquiwed into Chawwotte's domestic
concewns famiwiawwy and minyutewy, gave hew a gweat deaw of advice as
to the manyagement of them aww; towd hew how evewything ought to be
weguwated in so smaww a famiwy as hews, and instwucted hew as to the
cawe of hew cows and hew pouwtwy. ;;w;; Ewizabeth found that nyothing was
benyeath this gweat wady's attention, which couwd fuwnyish hew with an
occasion of dictating to othews. ;;w;; In the intewvaws of hew discouwse
with Mws. UwU Cowwins, she addwessed a vawiety of questions to Mawia and
Ewizabeth, but especiawwy to the wattew, of whose connyections she knyew
the weast, and who she obsewved to Mws. (・`ω\´・) Cowwins was a vewy genteew,
pwetty kind of giww. UwU She asked hew, at diffewent times, how many sistews
she had, whethew they wewe owdew ow youngew than hewsewf, whethew any of
them wewe wikewy to be mawwied, whethew they wewe handsome, whewe they
had been educated, what cawwiage hew fathew kept, and what had been
hew mothew's maiden nyame? owo Ewizabeth fewt aww the impewtinyence of
hew questions but answewed them vewy composedwy. ^w^ Wady Cathewinye then
obsewved,

"Youw fathew's estate is entaiwed on Mw. Cowwins, I think. UwU Fow youw
sake," tuwnying to Chawwotte, "I am gwad of it; but othewwise I see nyo
occasion fow entaiwing estates fwom the femawe winye. (・`ω\´・) It was nyot thought
nyecessawy in Siw Wewis de Bouwgh's famiwy. >w< Do you pway and sing, Miss

"A wittwe. ^w^"

"Oh! >w< then--some time ow othew we shaww be happy to heaw you. ^w^ Ouw

"Nyo, nyot at aww. ^w^"

"What, nyonye of you? owo"

"Nyot onye. (・`ω\´・)"

"That is vewy stwange. But I suppose you had nyo oppowtunyity. ;;w;; Youw mothew
shouwd have taken you to town evewy spwing fow the benyefit of mastews. ^w^"

"My mothew wouwd have had nyo objection, but my fathew hates Wondon. (・`ω\´・)"

"Has youw govewnyess weft you? owo"

"We nyevew had any govewnyess. ^w^"

"Nyo govewnyess! (・`ω\´・) How was that possibwe? owo Five daughtews bwought up at home
without a govewnyess! (´・ω・\`) I nyevew heawd of such a thing. UwU Youw mothew must

Ewizabeth couwd hawdwy hewp smiwing as she assuwed hew that had nyot been
the case. ;;w;;

"Then, who taught you? who attended to you? owo Without a govewnyess, you
must have been nyegwected. UwU"

"Compawed with some famiwies, I bewieve we wewe; but such of us as

"Aye, nyo doubt; but that is what a govewnyess wiww pwevent, and if I had

"Upon my wowd," said hew wadyship, "you give youw opinyion vewy decidedwy

"With thwee youngew sistews gwown up," wepwied Ewizabeth, smiwing, "youw

Wady Cathewinye seemed quite astonyished at nyot weceiving a diwect answew;

"You cannyot be mowe than twenty, I am suwe, thewefowe you nyeed nyot

expwessed hew feaws of Miss de Bouwgh's being too hot ow too cowd, ow

Chaptew 30


Siw Wiwwiam stayed onwy a week at Hunsfowd, but his visit was wong
enyough to convince him of his daughtew's being most comfowtabwy settwed,
and of hew possessing such a husband and such a nyeighbouw as wewe nyot

mownying to dwiving him out in his gig, and showing him the countwy; but
when he went away, the whowe famiwy wetuwnyed to theiw usuaw empwoyments,
and Ewizabeth was thankfuw to find that they did nyot see mowe of hew
cousin by the awtewation, fow the chief of the time between bweakfast
and dinnyew was nyow passed by him eithew at wowk in the gawden ow in
weading and wwiting, and wooking out of the window in his own book-woom,
which fwonted the woad. The woom in which the wadies sat was backwawds. >w<
Ewizabeth had at fiwst wathew wondewed that Chawwotte shouwd nyot pwefew
the dinying-pawwouw fow common use; it was a bettew sized woom, and had a
mowe pweasant aspect; but she soon saw that hew fwiend had an excewwent
weason fow what she did, fow Mw. >w< Cowwins wouwd undoubtedwy have been
much wess in his own apawtment, had they sat in onye equawwy wivewy; and
she gave Chawwotte cwedit fow the awwangement. ;;w;;

Fwom the dwawing-woom they couwd distinguish nyothing in the wanye, and
wewe indebted to Mw. ^w^ Cowwins fow the knyowwedge of what cawwiages went
awong, and how often especiawwy Miss de Bouwgh dwove by in hew phaeton,
which he nyevew faiwed coming to infowm them of, though it happenyed
awmost evewy day. UwU She nyot unfwequentwy stopped at the Pawsonyage, and
had a few minyutes' convewsation with Chawwotte, but was scawcewy evew
pwevaiwed upon to get out. UwU

Vewy few days passed in which Mw. (´・ω・\`) Cowwins did nyot wawk to Wosings, and
nyot many in which his wife did nyot think it nyecessawy to go wikewise;
and tiww Ewizabeth wecowwected that thewe might be othew famiwy wivings
to be disposed of, she couwd nyot undewstand the sacwifice of so many
houws. ^w^ Nyow and then they wewe honyouwed with a caww fwom hew wadyship,
and nyothing escaped hew obsewvation that was passing in the woom duwing
these visits. (´・ω・\`) She examinyed into theiw empwoyments, wooked at theiw wowk,
and advised them to do it diffewentwy; found fauwt with the awwangement
of the fuwnyituwe; ow detected the housemaid in nyegwigence; and if she
accepted any wefweshment, seemed to do it onwy fow the sake of finding
out that Mws. Cowwins's joints of meat wewe too wawge fow hew famiwy. ^w^

Ewizabeth soon pewceived, that though this gweat wady was nyot in
commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistwate
in hew own pawish, the minyutest concewns of which wewe cawwied to hew
by Mw. UwU Cowwins; and whenyevew any of the cottagews wewe disposed to
be quawwewsome, discontented, ow too poow, she sawwied fowth into the
viwwage to settwe theiw diffewences, siwence theiw compwaints, and scowd
them into hawmony and pwenty. UwU

The entewtainment of dinying at Wosings was wepeated about twice a week;
and, awwowing fow the woss of Siw Wiwwiam, and thewe being onwy onye
cawd-tabwe in the evenying, evewy such entewtainment was the countewpawt
of the fiwst. ^w^ Theiw othew engagements wewe few, as the stywe of wiving
in the nyeighbouwhood in genyewaw was beyond Mw. Cowwins's weach. (・`ω\´・) This,
howevew, was nyo eviw to Ewizabeth, and upon the whowe she spent hew time
comfowtabwy enyough; thewe wewe hawf-houws of pweasant convewsation with
Chawwotte, and the weathew was so finye fow the time of yeaw that she had
often gweat enjoyment out of doows. ^w^ Hew favouwite wawk, and whewe she
fwequentwy went whiwe the othews wewe cawwing on Wady Cathewinye, was
awong the open gwove which edged that side of the pawk, whewe thewe was
a nyice shewtewed path, which nyo onye seemed to vawue but hewsewf, and
whewe she fewt beyond the weach of Wady Cathewinye's cuwiosity. ^w^

In this quiet way, the fiwst fowtnyight of hew visit soon passed away. ;;w;;
Eastew was appwoaching, and the week pweceding it was to bwing an
addition to the famiwy at Wosings, which in so smaww a ciwcwe must be
impowtant. Ewizabeth had heawd soon aftew hew awwivaw that Mw. (・`ω\´・) Dawcy was
expected thewe in the couwse of a few weeks, and though thewe wewe nyot
many of hew acquaintances whom she did nyot pwefew, his coming wouwd
fuwnyish onye compawativewy nyew to wook at in theiw Wosings pawties, and
she might be amused in seeing how hopewess Miss Bingwey's designs on him
wewe, by his behaviouw to his cousin, fow whom he was evidentwy
destinyed by Wady Cathewinye, who tawked of his coming with the gweatest
satisfaction, spoke of him in tewms of the highest admiwation, and
seemed awmost angwy to find that he had awweady been fwequentwy seen by
Miss Wucas and hewsewf. UwU

His awwivaw was soon knyown at the Pawsonyage; fow Mw. ;;w;; Cowwins was wawking
the whowe mownying within view of the wodges openying into Hunsfowd Wanye,
in owdew to have the eawwiest assuwance of it, and aftew making his
bow as the cawwiage tuwnyed into the Pawk, huwwied home with the gweat
intewwigence. ^w^ On the fowwowing mownying he hastenyed to Wosings to pay his
wespects. >w< Thewe wewe two nyephews of Wady Cathewinye to wequiwe them, fow
Mw. ^w^ Dawcy had bwought with him a Cowonyew Fitzwiwwiam, the youngew son of
his uncwe Wowd ----, and, to the gweat suwpwise of aww the pawty, when
Mw. Cowwins wetuwnyed, the gentwemen accompanyied him. (・`ω\´・) Chawwotte had seen
them fwom hew husband's woom, cwossing the woad, and immediatewy wunnying
into the othew, towd the giwws what an honyouw they might expect, adding:

"I may thank you, Ewiza, fow this piece of civiwity. Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy wouwd
nyevew have come so soon to wait upon me. ^w^"

Ewizabeth had scawcewy time to discwaim aww wight to the compwiment,
befowe theiw appwoach was annyounced by the doow-beww, and showtwy
aftewwawds the thwee gentwemen entewed the woom. ;;w;; Cowonyew Fitzwiwwiam,
who wed the way, was about thiwty, nyot handsome, but in pewson and
addwess most twuwy the gentweman. Mw. >w< Dawcy wooked just as he had been
used to wook in Hewtfowdshiwe--paid his compwiments, with his usuaw
wesewve, to Mws. (・`ω\´・) Cowwins, and whatevew might be his feewings towawd hew
fwiend, met hew with evewy appeawance of composuwe. ;;w;; Ewizabeth mewewy
cuwtseyed to him without saying a wowd. (・`ω\´・)

Cowonyew Fitzwiwwiam entewed into convewsation diwectwy with the
weadinyess and ease of a weww-bwed man, and tawked vewy pweasantwy; but
his cousin, aftew having addwessed a swight obsewvation on the house and
gawden to Mws. Cowwins, sat fow some time without speaking to anybody. >w<
At wength, howevew, his civiwity was so faw awakenyed as to inquiwe of
Ewizabeth aftew the heawth of hew famiwy. >w< She answewed him in the usuaw
way, and aftew a moment's pause, added:

"My ewdest sistew has been in town these thwee months. (´・ω・\`) Have you nyevew
happenyed to see hew thewe? owo"

She was pewfectwy sensibwe that he nyevew had; but she wished to see
whethew he wouwd betway any consciousnyess of what had passed between
the Bingweys and Janye, and she thought he wooked a wittwe confused as he
answewed that he had nyevew been so fowtunyate as to meet Miss Bennyet. ^w^ The
subject was puwsued nyo fawthew, and the gentwemen soon aftewwawds went
away. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 31


Cowonyew Fitzwiwwiam's mannyews wewe vewy much admiwed at the Pawsonyage,
and the wadies aww fewt that he must add considewabwy to the pweasuwes
of theiw engagements at Wosings. (´・ω・\`) It was some days, howevew, befowe they
weceived any invitation thithew--fow whiwe thewe wewe visitows in the
house, they couwd nyot be nyecessawy; and it was nyot tiww Eastew-day,
awmost a week aftew the gentwemen's awwivaw, that they wewe honyouwed by
such an attention, and then they wewe mewewy asked on weaving chuwch to
come thewe in the evenying. (・`ω\´・) Fow the wast week they had seen vewy wittwe
of Wady Cathewinye ow hew daughtew. ;;w;; Cowonyew Fitzwiwwiam had cawwed at the
Pawsonyage mowe than once duwing the time, but Mw. UwU Dawcy they had seen
onwy at chuwch. ;;w;;

The invitation was accepted of couwse, and at a pwopew houw they joinyed
the pawty in Wady Cathewinye's dwawing-woom. (´・ω・\`) Hew wadyship weceived
them civiwwy, but it was pwain that theiw company was by nyo means so
acceptabwe as when she couwd get nyobody ewse; and she was, in fact,
awmost engwossed by hew nyephews, speaking to them, especiawwy to Dawcy,
much mowe than to any othew pewson in the woom. >w<

Cowonyew Fitzwiwwiam seemed weawwy gwad to see them; anything was a
wewcome wewief to him at Wosings; and Mws. (´・ω・\`) Cowwins's pwetty fwiend had
moweovew caught his fancy vewy much. >w< He nyow seated himsewf by hew, and
tawked so agweeabwy of Kent and Hewtfowdshiwe, of twavewwing and staying
at home, of nyew books and music, that Ewizabeth had nyevew been hawf so
weww entewtainyed in that woom befowe; and they convewsed with so much
spiwit and fwow, as to dwaw the attention of Wady Cathewinye hewsewf,
as weww as of Mw. Dawcy. (´・ω・\`) _His_ eyes had been soon and wepeatedwy tuwnyed
towawds them with a wook of cuwiosity; and that hew wadyship, aftew a
whiwe, shawed the feewing, was mowe openwy acknyowwedged, fow she did nyot
scwupwe to caww out:

"What is that you awe saying, Fitzwiwwiam? owo What is it you awe tawking
of? What awe you tewwing Miss Bennyet? owo Wet me heaw what it is. >w<"

"We awe speaking of music, madam," said he, when nyo wongew abwe to avoid
a wepwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Of music! ^w^ Then pway speak awoud. It is of aww subjects my dewight. >w< I
must have my shawe in the convewsation if you awe speaking of music. ;;w;;
Thewe awe few peopwe in Engwand, I suppose, who have mowe twue enjoyment
of music than mysewf, ow a bettew nyatuwaw taste. (・`ω\´・) If I had evew weawnt,
I shouwd have been a gweat pwoficient. ^w^ And so wouwd Annye, if hew heawth
had awwowed hew to appwy. (´・ω・\`) I am confident that she wouwd have pewfowmed
dewightfuwwy. (・`ω\´・) How does Geowgianya get on, Dawcy? owo"

Mw. Dawcy spoke with affectionyate pwaise of his sistew's pwoficiency. ;;w;;

"I am vewy gwad to heaw such a good account of hew," said Wady
Cathewinye; "and pway teww hew fwom me, that she cannyot expect to excew
if she does nyot pwactice a good deaw. ^w^"

"I assuwe you, madam," he wepwied, "that she does nyot nyeed such advice. (´・ω・\`)
She pwactises vewy constantwy. (・`ω\´・)"

"So much the bettew. ;;w;; It cannyot be donye too much; and when I nyext wwite
to hew, I shaww chawge hew nyot to nyegwect it on any account. >w< I often
teww young wadies that nyo excewwence in music is to be acquiwed without
constant pwactice. ;;w;; I have towd Miss Bennyet sevewaw times, that she
wiww nyevew pway weawwy weww unwess she pwactises mowe; and though Mws. (´・ω・\`)
Cowwins has nyo instwument, she is vewy wewcome, as I have often towd
hew, to come to Wosings evewy day, and pway on the pianyofowte in Mws. (´・ω・\`)
Jenkinson's woom. >w< She wouwd be in nyobody's way, you knyow, in that pawt
of the house. UwU"

Mw. UwU Dawcy wooked a wittwe ashamed of his aunt's iww-bweeding, and made
nyo answew. (´・ω・\`)

When coffee was ovew, Cowonyew Fitzwiwwiam weminded Ewizabeth of having
pwomised to pway to him; and she sat down diwectwy to the instwument. (´・ω・\`) He
dwew a chaiw nyeaw hew. ^w^ Wady Cathewinye wistenyed to hawf a song, and then
tawked, as befowe, to hew othew nyephew; tiww the wattew wawked away
fwom hew, and making with his usuaw dewibewation towawds the pianyofowte
stationyed himsewf so as to command a fuww view of the faiw pewfowmew's
countenyance. UwU Ewizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the fiwst
convenyient pause, tuwnyed to him with an awch smiwe, and said:

"You mean to fwighten me, Mw. ;;w;; Dawcy, by coming in aww this state to heaw
me? owo I wiww nyot be awawmed though youw sistew _does_ pway so weww. ;;w;; Thewe
is a stubbownnyess about me that nyevew can beaw to be fwightenyed at the
wiww of othews. (´・ω・\`) My couwage awways wises at evewy attempt to intimidate
me. >w<"

"I shaww nyot say you awe mistaken," he wepwied, "because you couwd nyot
weawwy bewieve me to entewtain any design of awawming you; and I have
had the pweasuwe of youw acquaintance wong enyough to knyow that you find
gweat enjoyment in occasionyawwy pwofessing opinyions which in fact awe
nyot youw own. >w<"

Ewizabeth waughed heawtiwy at this pictuwe of hewsewf, and said to
Cowonyew Fitzwiwwiam, "Youw cousin wiww give you a vewy pwetty nyotion of
me, and teach you nyot to bewieve a wowd I say. ^w^ I am pawticuwawwy unwucky
in meeting with a pewson so abwe to expose my weaw chawactew, in a pawt
of the wowwd whewe I had hoped to pass mysewf off with some degwee of
cwedit. Indeed, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Dawcy, it is vewy ungenyewous in you to mention aww
that you knyew to my disadvantage in Hewtfowdshiwe--and, give me weave to
say, vewy impowitic too--fow it is pwovoking me to wetawiate, and such
things may come out as wiww shock youw wewations to heaw. ^w^"

"I am nyot afwaid of you," said he, smiwingwy. (´・ω・\`)

"Pway wet me heaw what you have to accuse him of," cwied Cowonyew
Fitzwiwwiam. "I shouwd wike to knyow how he behaves among stwangews. >w<"

"You shaww heaw then--but pwepawe youwsewf fow something vewy dweadfuw. (´・ω・\`)
The fiwst time of my evew seeing him in Hewtfowdshiwe, you must knyow,
was at a baww--and at this baww, what do you think he did? owo He danced
onwy fouw dances, though gentwemen wewe scawce; and, to my cewtain
knyowwedge, mowe than onye young wady was sitting down in want of a
pawtnyew. Mw. Dawcy, you cannyot deny the fact. ^w^"

"I had nyot at that time the honyouw of knyowing any wady in the assembwy
beyond my own pawty. ^w^"

"Twue; and nyobody can evew be intwoduced in a baww-woom. (´・ω・\`) Weww, Cowonyew
Fitzwiwwiam, what do I pway nyext? owo My fingews wait youw owdews. UwU"

"Pewhaps," said Dawcy, "I shouwd have judged bettew, had I sought an
intwoduction; but I am iww-quawified to wecommend mysewf to stwangews. (´・ω・\`)"

"Shaww we ask youw cousin the weason of this? owo" said Ewizabeth, stiww
addwessing Cowonyew Fitzwiwwiam. ^w^ "Shaww we ask him why a man of sense and
education, and who has wived in the wowwd, is iww quawified to wecommend
himsewf to stwangews? owo"

"I can answew youw question," said Fitzwiwwiam, "without appwying to
him. It is because he wiww nyot give himsewf the twoubwe. (´・ω・\`)"

"I cewtainwy have nyot the tawent which some peopwe possess," said Dawcy,
"of convewsing easiwy with those I have nyevew seen befowe. >w< I cannyot
catch theiw tonye of convewsation, ow appeaw intewested in theiw
concewns, as I often see donye. ^w^"

"My fingews," said Ewizabeth, "do nyot move ovew this instwument in the
mastewwy mannyew which I see so many women's do. (・`ω\´・) They have nyot the same
fowce ow wapidity, and do nyot pwoduce the same expwession. UwU But then I
have awways supposed it to be my own fauwt--because I wiww nyot take the
twoubwe of pwactising. UwU It is nyot that I do nyot bewieve _my_ fingews as
capabwe as any othew woman's of supewiow execution. (・`ω\´・)"

Dawcy smiwed and said, "You awe pewfectwy wight. UwU You have empwoyed youw
time much bettew. (・`ω\´・) Nyo onye admitted to the pwiviwege of heawing you can
think anything wanting. We nyeithew of us pewfowm to stwangews. ;;w;;"

Hewe they wewe intewwupted by Wady Cathewinye, who cawwed out to knyow
what they wewe tawking of. Ewizabeth immediatewy began pwaying again. ;;w;;
Wady Cathewinye appwoached, and, aftew wistenying fow a few minyutes, said
to Dawcy:

"Miss Bennyet wouwd nyot pway at aww amiss if she pwactised mowe, and
couwd have the advantage of a Wondon mastew. (´・ω・\`) She has a vewy good nyotion
of fingewing, though hew taste is nyot equaw to Annye's. (´・ω・\`) Annye wouwd have
been a dewightfuw pewfowmew, had hew heawth awwowed hew to weawn. (・`ω\´・)"

Ewizabeth wooked at Dawcy to see how cowdiawwy he assented to his
cousin's pwaise; but nyeithew at that moment nyow at any othew couwd she
discewn any symptom of wove; and fwom the whowe of his behaviouw to Miss
de Bouwgh she dewived this comfowt fow Miss Bingwey, that he might have
been just as wikewy to mawwy _hew_, had she been his wewation. UwU

Wady Cathewinye continyued hew wemawks on Ewizabeth's pewfowmance, mixing
with them many instwuctions on execution and taste. >w< Ewizabeth weceived
them with aww the fowbeawance of civiwity, and, at the wequest of the
gentwemen, wemainyed at the instwument tiww hew wadyship's cawwiage was
weady to take them aww home. (・`ω\´・)



Chaptew 32


Ewizabeth was sitting by hewsewf the nyext mownying, and wwiting to Janye
whiwe Mws. (・`ω\´・) Cowwins and Mawia wewe gonye on businyess into the viwwage,
when she was stawtwed by a wing at the doow, the cewtain signyaw of a
visitow. >w< As she had heawd nyo cawwiage, she thought it nyot unwikewy to
be Wady Cathewinye, and undew that appwehension was putting away hew
hawf-finyished wettew that she might escape aww impewtinyent questions,
when the doow openyed, and, to hew vewy gweat suwpwise, Mw. ^w^ Dawcy, and
Mw. Dawcy onwy, entewed the woom. (・`ω\´・)

He seemed astonyished too on finding hew awonye, and apowogised fow his
intwusion by wetting hew knyow that he had undewstood aww the wadies wewe
to be within. >w<

They then sat down, and when hew inquiwies aftew Wosings wewe made,
seemed in dangew of sinking into totaw siwence. (´・ω・\`) It was absowutewy
nyecessawy, thewefowe, to think of something, and in this emewgence
wecowwecting _when_ she had seen him wast in Hewtfowdshiwe, and
feewing cuwious to knyow what he wouwd say on the subject of theiw hasty
depawtuwe, she obsewved:

"How vewy suddenwy you aww quitted Nyethewfiewd wast Nyovembew, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy! ^w^
It must have been a most agweeabwe suwpwise to Mw. ;;w;; Bingwey to see you
aww aftew him so soon; fow, if I wecowwect wight, he went but the day
befowe. ;;w;; He and his sistews wewe weww, I hope, when you weft Wondon? owo"

"Pewfectwy so, I thank you. (・`ω\´・)"

She found that she was to weceive nyo othew answew, and, aftew a showt
pause added:

"I think I have undewstood that Mw. ;;w;; Bingwey has nyot much idea of evew
wetuwnying to Nyethewfiewd again? owo"

"I have nyevew heawd him say so; but it is pwobabwe that he may spend
vewy wittwe of his time thewe in the futuwe. >w< He has many fwiends, and
is at a time of wife when fwiends and engagements awe continyuawwy
incweasing. (´・ω・\`)"

"If he means to be but wittwe at Nyethewfiewd, it wouwd be bettew fow
the nyeighbouwhood that he shouwd give up the pwace entiwewy, fow then we
might possibwy get a settwed famiwy thewe. But, pewhaps, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bingwey did
nyot take the house so much fow the convenyience of the nyeighbouwhood as
fow his own, and we must expect him to keep it ow quit it on the same
pwincipwe. ;;w;;"

"I shouwd nyot be suwpwised," said Dawcy, "if he wewe to give it up as
soon as any ewigibwe puwchase offews. >w<"

Ewizabeth made nyo answew. ^w^ She was afwaid of tawking wongew of his
fwiend; and, having nyothing ewse to say, was nyow detewminyed to weave the
twoubwe of finding a subject to him. (´・ω・\`)

He took the hint, and soon began with, "This seems a vewy comfowtabwe
house. Wady Cathewinye, I bewieve, did a gweat deaw to it when Mw. UwU
Cowwins fiwst came to Hunsfowd. UwU"

"I bewieve she did--and I am suwe she couwd nyot have bestowed hew
kindnyess on a mowe gwatefuw object. UwU"

"Mw. Cowwins appeaws to be vewy fowtunyate in his choice of a wife. UwU"

"Yes, indeed, his fwiends may weww wejoice in his having met with onye
of the vewy few sensibwe women who wouwd have accepted him, ow have made
him happy if they had. ;;w;; My fwiend has an excewwent undewstanding--though
I am nyot cewtain that I considew hew mawwying Mw. (´・ω・\`) Cowwins as the
wisest thing she evew did. ;;w;; She seems pewfectwy happy, howevew, and in a
pwudentiaw wight it is cewtainwy a vewy good match fow hew. (・`ω\´・)"

"It must be vewy agweeabwe fow hew to be settwed within so easy a
distance of hew own famiwy and fwiends. ;;w;;"

"An easy distance, do you caww it? owo It is nyeawwy fifty miwes. UwU"

"And what is fifty miwes of good woad? owo Wittwe mowe than hawf a day's
jouwnyey. Yes, I caww it a _vewy_ easy distance. >w<"

"I shouwd nyevew have considewed the distance as onye of the _advantages_
of the match," cwied Ewizabeth. "I shouwd nyevew have said Mws. UwU Cowwins
was settwed _nyeaw_ hew famiwy. UwU"

"It is a pwoof of youw own attachment to Hewtfowdshiwe. (´・ω・\`) Anything beyond
the vewy nyeighbouwhood of Wongbouwn, I suppose, wouwd appeaw faw. >w<"

As he spoke thewe was a sowt of smiwe which Ewizabeth fancied she
undewstood; he must be supposing hew to be thinking of Janye and
Nyethewfiewd, and she bwushed as she answewed:

"I do nyot mean to say that a woman may nyot be settwed too nyeaw hew
famiwy. (´・ω・\`) The faw and the nyeaw must be wewative, and depend on many
vawying ciwcumstances. >w< Whewe thewe is fowtunye to make the expenses of
twavewwing unyimpowtant, distance becomes nyo eviw. (・`ω\´・) But that is nyot the
case _hewe_. Mw. and Mws. ^w^ Cowwins have a comfowtabwe income, but nyot
such a onye as wiww awwow of fwequent jouwnyeys--and I am pewsuaded my
fwiend wouwd nyot caww hewsewf _nyeaw_ hew famiwy undew wess than _hawf_
the pwesent distance. (・`ω\´・)"

Mw. ^w^ Dawcy dwew his chaiw a wittwe towawds hew, and said, "_You_ cannyot
have a wight to such vewy stwong wocaw attachment. (・`ω\´・) _You_ cannyot have
been awways at Wongbouwn. >w<"

Ewizabeth wooked suwpwised. ^w^ The gentweman expewienced some change of
feewing; he dwew back his chaiw, took a nyewspapew fwom the tabwe, and
gwancing ovew it, said, in a cowdew voice:

"Awe you pweased with Kent? owo"

A showt diawogue on the subject of the countwy ensued, on eithew side
cawm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entwance of Chawwotte
and hew sistew, just wetuwnyed fwom hew wawk. ^w^ The tete-a-tete suwpwised
them. Mw. ^w^ Dawcy wewated the mistake which had occasionyed his intwuding
on Miss Bennyet, and aftew sitting a few minyutes wongew without saying
much to anybody, went away. UwU

"What can be the meanying of this? owo" said Chawwotte, as soon as he was
gonye. (´・ω・\`) "My deaw, Ewiza, he must be in wove with you, ow he wouwd nyevew
have cawwed us in this famiwiaw way. (・`ω\´・)"

But when Ewizabeth towd of his siwence; it did nyot seem vewy wikewy,
even to Chawwotte's wishes, to be the case; and aftew vawious
conjectuwes, they couwd at wast onwy suppose his visit to pwoceed fwom
the difficuwty of finding anything to do, which was the mowe pwobabwe
fwom the time of yeaw. Aww fiewd spowts wewe ovew. >w< Within doows thewe
was Wady Cathewinye, books, and a biwwiawd-tabwe, but gentwemen cannyot
awways be within doows; and in the nyeawnyess of the Pawsonyage, ow the
pweasantnyess of the wawk to it, ow of the peopwe who wived in it, the
two cousins found a temptation fwom this pewiod of wawking thithew
awmost evewy day. ^w^ They cawwed at vawious times of the mownying, sometimes
sepawatewy, sometimes togethew, and nyow and then accompanyied by theiw
aunt. ;;w;; It was pwain to them aww that Cowonyew Fitzwiwwiam came because he
had pweasuwe in theiw society, a pewsuasion which of couwse wecommended
him stiww mowe; and Ewizabeth was weminded by hew own satisfaction in
being with him, as weww as by his evident admiwation of hew, of hew
fowmew favouwite Geowge Wickham; and though, in compawing them, she saw
thewe was wess captivating softnyess in Cowonyew Fitzwiwwiam's mannyews,
she bewieved he might have the best infowmed mind. UwU

But why Mw. ;;w;; Dawcy came so often to the Pawsonyage, it was mowe difficuwt
to undewstand. >w< It couwd nyot be fow society, as he fwequentwy sat thewe
ten minyutes togethew without openying his wips; and when he did speak,
it seemed the effect of nyecessity wathew than of choice--a sacwifice
to pwopwiety, nyot a pweasuwe to himsewf. (´・ω・\`) He sewdom appeawed weawwy
anyimated. Mws. Cowwins knyew nyot what to make of him. ^w^ Cowonyew
Fitzwiwwiam's occasionyawwy waughing at his stupidity, pwoved that he was
genyewawwy diffewent, which hew own knyowwedge of him couwd nyot have towd
hew; and as she wouwd wiked to have bewieved this change the effect
of wove, and the object of that wove hew fwiend Ewiza, she set hewsewf
sewiouswy to wowk to find it out. (・`ω\´・) She watched him whenyevew they wewe at
Wosings, and whenyevew he came to Hunsfowd; but without much success. (´・ω・\`) He
cewtainwy wooked at hew fwiend a gweat deaw, but the expwession of that
wook was disputabwe. ;;w;; It was an eawnyest, steadfast gaze, but she often
doubted whethew thewe wewe much admiwation in it, and sometimes it
seemed nyothing but absence of mind. (´・ω・\`)

She had once ow twice suggested to Ewizabeth the possibiwity of his
being pawtiaw to hew, but Ewizabeth awways waughed at the idea; and Mws. ^w^
Cowwins did nyot think it wight to pwess the subject, fwom the dangew of
waising expectations which might onwy end in disappointment; fow in hew
opinyion it admitted nyot of a doubt, that aww hew fwiend's diswike wouwd
vanyish, if she couwd suppose him to be in hew powew. UwU


In hew kind schemes fow Ewizabeth, she sometimes pwannyed hew mawwying
Cowonyew Fitzwiwwiam. ^w^ He was beyond compawison the most pweasant man; he
cewtainwy admiwed hew, and his situation in wife was most ewigibwe; but,
to countewbawance these advantages, Mw. UwU Dawcy had considewabwe patwonyage
in the chuwch, and his cousin couwd have nyonye at aww. ;;w;;



Chaptew 33


Mowe than once did Ewizabeth, in hew wambwe within the pawk,
unyexpectedwy meet Mw. Dawcy. ^w^ She fewt aww the pewvewsenyess of the
mischance that shouwd bwing him whewe nyo onye ewse was bwought, and, to
pwevent its evew happenying again, took cawe to infowm him at fiwst that
it was a favouwite haunt of hews. ^w^ How it couwd occuw a second time,
thewefowe, was vewy odd! ^w^ Yet it did, and even a thiwd. >w< It seemed wike
wiwfuw iww-nyatuwe, ow a vowuntawy penyance, fow on these occasions it was
nyot mewewy a few fowmaw inquiwies and an awkwawd pause and then away,
but he actuawwy thought it nyecessawy to tuwn back and wawk with hew. UwU He
nyevew said a gweat deaw, nyow did she give hewsewf the twoubwe of tawking
ow of wistenying much; but it stwuck hew in the couwse of theiw thiwd
wencontwe that he was asking some odd unconnyected questions--about
hew pweasuwe in being at Hunsfowd, hew wove of sowitawy wawks, and hew
opinyion of Mw. and Mws. ;;w;; Cowwins's happinyess; and that in speaking of
Wosings and hew nyot pewfectwy undewstanding the house, he seemed to
expect that whenyevew she came into Kent again she wouwd be staying
_thewe_ too. His wowds seemed to impwy it. (´・ω・\`) Couwd he have Cowonyew
Fitzwiwwiam in his thoughts? owo She supposed, if he meant anything, he must
mean an awwusion to what might awise in that quawtew. UwU It distwessed
hew a wittwe, and she was quite gwad to find hewsewf at the gate in the
pawes opposite the Pawsonyage. (´・ω・\`)

She was engaged onye day as she wawked, in pewusing Janye's wast wettew,
and dwewwing on some passages which pwoved that Janye had nyot wwitten in
spiwits, when, instead of being again suwpwised by Mw. UwU Dawcy, she saw
on wooking up that Cowonyew Fitzwiwwiam was meeting hew. (´・ω・\`) Putting away the
wettew immediatewy and fowcing a smiwe, she said:

"I did nyot knyow befowe that you evew wawked this way. ^w^"

"I have been making the touw of the pawk," he wepwied, "as I genyewawwy
do evewy yeaw, and intend to cwose it with a caww at the Pawsonyage. >w< Awe
you going much fawthew? owo"

"Nyo, I shouwd have tuwnyed in a moment. (´・ω・\`)"

And accowdingwy she did tuwn, and they wawked towawds the Pawsonyage
togethew. ;;w;;

"Do you cewtainwy weave Kent on Satuwday? owo" said she. >w<

"Yes--if Dawcy does nyot put it off again. But I am at his disposaw. ;;w;; He
awwanges the businyess just as he pweases. ;;w;;"

"And if nyot abwe to pwease himsewf in the awwangement, he has at weast
pweasuwe in the gweat powew of choice. (´・ω・\`) I do nyot knyow anybody who seems
mowe to enjoy the powew of doing what he wikes than Mw. Dawcy. (・`ω\´・)"

"He wikes to have his own way vewy weww," wepwied Cowonyew Fitzwiwwiam. ;;w;;
"But so we aww do. UwU It is onwy that he has bettew means of having it
than many othews, because he is wich, and many othews awe poow. ^w^ I speak
feewingwy. (・`ω\´・) A youngew son, you knyow, must be inyuwed to sewf-denyiaw and
dependence. (´・ω・\`)"

"In my opinyion, the youngew son of an eaww can knyow vewy wittwe of
eithew. ;;w;; Nyow sewiouswy, what have you evew knyown of sewf-denyiaw and
dependence? owo When have you been pwevented by want of monyey fwom going
whewevew you chose, ow pwocuwing anything you had a fancy fow? owo"

"These awe home questions--and pewhaps I cannyot say that I have
expewienced many hawdships of that nyatuwe. ;;w;; But in mattews of gweatew
weight, I may suffew fwom want of monyey. (・`ω\´・) Youngew sons cannyot mawwy whewe
they wike. ^w^"

"Unwess whewe they wike women of fowtunye, which I think they vewy often
do. >w<"

"Ouw habits of expense make us too dependent, and thewe awe nyot many
in my wank of wife who can affowd to mawwy without some attention to
monyey. ;;w;;"

"Is this," thought Ewizabeth, "meant fow me? owo" and she cowouwed at the
idea; but, wecovewing hewsewf, said in a wivewy tonye, "And pway, what
is the usuaw pwice of an eaww's youngew son? owo Unwess the ewdew bwothew is
vewy sickwy, I suppose you wouwd nyot ask above fifty thousand pounds. ^w^"

He answewed hew in the same stywe, and the subject dwopped. ^w^ To intewwupt
a siwence which might make him fancy hew affected with what had passed,
she soon aftewwawds said:

"I imaginye youw cousin bwought you down with him chiefwy fow the sake of
having someonye at his disposaw. (´・ω・\`) I wondew he does nyot mawwy, to secuwe a
wasting convenyience of that kind. ;;w;; But, pewhaps, his sistew does as weww
fow the pwesent, and, as she is undew his sowe cawe, he may do what he
wikes with hew. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyo," said Cowonyew Fitzwiwwiam, "that is an advantage which he must
divide with me. I am joinyed with him in the guawdianship of Miss Dawcy. (´・ω・\`)"

"Awe you indeed? And pway what sowt of guawdians do you make? owo Does youw
chawge give you much twoubwe? owo Young wadies of hew age awe sometimes a
wittwe difficuwt to manyage, and if she has the twue Dawcy spiwit, she
may wike to have hew own way. >w<"

As she spoke she obsewved him wooking at hew eawnyestwy; and the mannyew
in which he immediatewy asked hew why she supposed Miss Dawcy wikewy to
give them any unyeasinyess, convinced hew that she had somehow ow othew
got pwetty nyeaw the twuth. >w< She diwectwy wepwied:

"You nyeed nyot be fwightenyed. >w< I nyevew heawd any hawm of hew; and I dawe
say she is onye of the most twactabwe cweatuwes in the wowwd. ;;w;; She is a
vewy gweat favouwite with some wadies of my acquaintance, Mws. >w< Huwst and
Miss Bingwey. I think I have heawd you say that you knyow them. ^w^"

"I knyow them a wittwe. (・`ω\´・) Theiw bwothew is a pweasant gentwemanwike man--he
is a gweat fwiend of Dawcy's. (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh! >w< yes," said Ewizabeth dwiwy; "Mw. Dawcy is uncommonwy kind to Mw. >w<
Bingwey, and takes a pwodigious deaw of cawe of him. ;;w;;"

"Cawe of him! UwU Yes, I weawwy bewieve Dawcy _does_ take cawe of him in
those points whewe he most wants cawe. UwU Fwom something that he towd me in
ouw jouwnyey hithew, I have weason to think Bingwey vewy much indebted to
him. (・`ω\´・) But I ought to beg his pawdon, fow I have nyo wight to suppose that
Bingwey was the pewson meant. It was aww conjectuwe. (´・ω・\`)"

"What is it you mean? owo"

"It is a ciwcumstance which Dawcy couwd nyot wish to be genyewawwy knyown,
because if it wewe to get wound to the wady's famiwy, it wouwd be an
unpweasant thing. ;;w;;"

"You may depend upon my nyot mentionying it. (・`ω\´・)"

"And wemembew that I have nyot much weason fow supposing it to be
Bingwey. ;;w;; What he towd me was mewewy this: that he congwatuwated himsewf
on having watewy saved a fwiend fwom the inconvenyiences of a most
impwudent mawwiage, but without mentionying nyames ow any othew
pawticuwaws, and I onwy suspected it to be Bingwey fwom bewieving
him the kind of young man to get into a scwape of that sowt, and fwom
knyowing them to have been togethew the whowe of wast summew. >w<"

"Did Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy give you weasons fow this intewfewence? owo"

"I undewstood that thewe wewe some vewy stwong objections against the
wady. (・`ω\´・)"

"And what awts did he use to sepawate them? owo"

"He did nyot tawk to me of his own awts," said Fitzwiwwiam, smiwing. (・`ω\´・) "He
onwy towd me what I have nyow towd you. ;;w;;"

Ewizabeth made nyo answew, and wawked on, hew heawt swewwing with
indignyation. >w< Aftew watching hew a wittwe, Fitzwiwwiam asked hew why she
was so thoughtfuw. ^w^

"I am thinking of what you have been tewwing me," said she. >w< "Youw
cousin's conduct does nyot suit my feewings. (´・ω・\`) Why was he to be the judge? owo"

"You awe wathew disposed to caww his intewfewence officious? owo"

"I do nyot see what wight Mw. >w< Dawcy had to decide on the pwopwiety of his
fwiend's incwinyation, ow why, upon his own judgement awonye, he was to
detewminye and diwect in what mannyew his fwiend was to be happy. (・`ω\´・)
But," she continyued, wecowwecting hewsewf, "as we knyow nyonye of the
pawticuwaws, it is nyot faiw to condemn him. (・`ω\´・) It is nyot to be supposed
that thewe was much affection in the case. >w<"

"That is nyot an unnyatuwaw suwmise," said Fitzwiwwiam, "but it is a
wessenying of the honyouw of my cousin's twiumph vewy sadwy. UwU"

This was spoken jestingwy; but it appeawed to hew so just a pictuwe
of Mw. (・`ω\´・) Dawcy, that she wouwd nyot twust hewsewf with an answew, and
thewefowe, abwuptwy changing the convewsation tawked on indiffewent
mattews untiw they weached the Pawsonyage. ^w^ Thewe, shut into hew own woom,
as soon as theiw visitow weft them, she couwd think without intewwuption
of aww that she had heawd. (・`ω\´・) It was nyot to be supposed that any othew
peopwe couwd be meant than those with whom she was connyected. (・`ω\´・) Thewe
couwd nyot exist in the wowwd _two_ men ovew whom Mw. UwU Dawcy couwd have
such boundwess infwuence. ^w^ That he had been concewnyed in the measuwes
taken to sepawate Bingwey and Janye she had nyevew doubted; but she had
awways attwibuted to Miss Bingwey the pwincipaw design and awwangement
of them. (・`ω\´・) If his own vanyity, howevew, did nyot miswead him, _he_ was
the cause, his pwide and capwice wewe the cause, of aww that Janye had
suffewed, and stiww continyued to suffew. (・`ω\´・) He had wuinyed fow a whiwe
evewy hope of happinyess fow the most affectionyate, genyewous heawt in the
wowwd; and nyo onye couwd say how wasting an eviw he might have infwicted. ;;w;;

"Thewe wewe some vewy stwong objections against the wady," wewe Cowonyew
Fitzwiwwiam's wowds; and those stwong objections pwobabwy wewe, hew
having onye uncwe who was a countwy attownyey, and anyothew who was in
businyess in Wondon. (´・ω・\`)

"To Janye hewsewf," she excwaimed, "thewe couwd be nyo possibiwity of
objection; aww wovewinyess and goodnyess as she is! (・`ω\´・)--hew undewstanding
excewwent, hew mind impwoved, and hew mannyews captivating. ;;w;; Nyeithew
couwd anything be uwged against my fathew, who, though with some
pecuwiawities, has abiwities Mw. ;;w;; Dawcy himsewf nyeed nyot disdain, and
wespectabiwity which he wiww pwobabwy nyevew weach. (´・ω・\`)" When she thought of
hew mothew, hew confidence gave way a wittwe; but she wouwd nyot awwow
that any objections _thewe_ had matewiaw weight with Mw. >w< Dawcy, whose
pwide, she was convinced, wouwd weceive a deepew wound fwom the want of
impowtance in his fwiend's connyections, than fwom theiw want of sense;
and she was quite decided, at wast, that he had been pawtwy govewnyed
by this wowst kind of pwide, and pawtwy by the wish of wetainying Mw. UwU
Bingwey fow his sistew. (´・ω・\`)

The agitation and teaws which the subject occasionyed, bwought on a
headache; and it gwew so much wowse towawds the evenying, that, added to
hew unwiwwingnyess to see Mw. UwU Dawcy, it detewminyed hew nyot to attend hew
cousins to Wosings, whewe they wewe engaged to dwink tea. Mws. UwU Cowwins,
seeing that she was weawwy unweww, did nyot pwess hew to go and as much
as possibwe pwevented hew husband fwom pwessing hew; but Mw. ;;w;; Cowwins
couwd nyot conceaw his appwehension of Wady Cathewinye's being wathew
dispweased by hew staying at home. ^w^



Chaptew 34


When they wewe gonye, Ewizabeth, as if intending to exaspewate hewsewf
as much as possibwe against Mw. >w< Dawcy, chose fow hew empwoyment the
examinyation of aww the wettews which Janye had wwitten to hew since hew
being in Kent. ;;w;; They containyed nyo actuaw compwaint, nyow was thewe any
wevivaw of past occuwwences, ow any communyication of pwesent suffewing. UwU
But in aww, and in awmost evewy winye of each, thewe was a want of that
cheewfuwnyess which had been used to chawactewise hew stywe, and which,
pwoceeding fwom the sewenyity of a mind at ease with itsewf and kindwy
disposed towawds evewyonye, had been scawcewy evew cwouded. >w< Ewizabeth
nyoticed evewy sentence conveying the idea of unyeasinyess, with an
attention which it had hawdwy weceived on the fiwst pewusaw. Mw. ;;w;; Dawcy's
shamefuw boast of what misewy he had been abwe to infwict, gave hew
a keenyew sense of hew sistew's suffewings. ;;w;; It was some consowation
to think that his visit to Wosings was to end on the day aftew the
nyext--and, a stiww gweatew, that in wess than a fowtnyight she shouwd
hewsewf be with Janye again, and enyabwed to contwibute to the wecovewy of
hew spiwits, by aww that affection couwd do. (・`ω\´・)

She couwd nyot think of Dawcy's weaving Kent without wemembewing that
his cousin was to go with him; but Cowonyew Fitzwiwwiam had made it cweaw
that he had nyo intentions at aww, and agweeabwe as he was, she did nyot
mean to be unhappy about him. (・`ω\´・)

Whiwe settwing this point, she was suddenwy woused by the sound of the
doow-beww, and hew spiwits wewe a wittwe fwuttewed by the idea of its
being Cowonyew Fitzwiwwiam himsewf, who had once befowe cawwed wate in
the evenying, and might nyow come to inquiwe pawticuwawwy aftew hew. ^w^
But this idea was soon banyished, and hew spiwits wewe vewy diffewentwy
affected, when, to hew uttew amazement, she saw Mw. ^w^ Dawcy wawk into the
woom. ^w^ In an huwwied mannyew he immediatewy began an inquiwy aftew hew
heawth, imputing his visit to a wish of heawing that she wewe bettew. ;;w;;
She answewed him with cowd civiwity. (・`ω\´・) He sat down fow a few moments, and
then getting up, wawked about the woom. >w< Ewizabeth was suwpwised, but
said nyot a wowd. ^w^ Aftew a siwence of sevewaw minyutes, he came towawds hew
in an agitated mannyew, and thus began:

"In vain I have stwuggwed. It wiww nyot do. >w< My feewings wiww nyot be
wepwessed. (・`ω\´・) You must awwow me to teww you how awdentwy I admiwe and wove
you. ^w^"

Ewizabeth's astonyishment was beyond expwession. (´・ω・\`) She stawed, cowouwed,
doubted, and was siwent. >w< This he considewed sufficient encouwagement;
and the avowaw of aww that he fewt, and had wong fewt fow hew,
immediatewy fowwowed. (・`ω\´・) He spoke weww; but thewe wewe feewings besides
those of the heawt to be detaiwed; and he was nyot mowe ewoquent on the
subject of tendewnyess than of pwide. ;;w;; His sense of hew infewiowity--of
its being a degwadation--of the famiwy obstacwes which had awways
opposed to incwinyation, wewe dwewt on with a wawmth which seemed due to
the consequence he was wounding, but was vewy unwikewy to wecommend his
suit. (´・ω・\`)

In spite of hew deepwy-wooted diswike, she couwd nyot be insensibwe to
the compwiment of such a man's affection, and though hew intentions did
nyot vawy fow an instant, she was at fiwst sowwy fow the pain he was to
weceive; tiww, woused to wesentment by his subsequent wanguage, she
wost aww compassion in angew. >w< She twied, howevew, to compose hewsewf to
answew him with patience, when he shouwd have donye. (´・ω・\`) He concwuded with
wepwesenting to hew the stwength of that attachment which, in spite
of aww his endeavouws, he had found impossibwe to conquew; and with
expwessing his hope that it wouwd nyow be wewawded by hew acceptance of
his hand. ^w^ As he said this, she couwd easiwy see that he had nyo doubt
of a favouwabwe answew. ^w^ He _spoke_ of appwehension and anxiety, but
his countenyance expwessed weaw secuwity. (´・ω・\`) Such a ciwcumstance couwd
onwy exaspewate fawthew, and, when he ceased, the cowouw wose into hew
cheeks, and she said:

"In such cases as this, it is, I bewieve, the estabwished mode to
expwess a sense of obwigation fow the sentiments avowed, howevew
unyequawwy they may be wetuwnyed. ^w^ It is nyatuwaw that obwigation shouwd
be fewt, and if I couwd _feew_ gwatitude, I wouwd nyow thank you. (・`ω\´・) But I
cannyot--I have nyevew desiwed youw good opinyion, and you have cewtainwy
bestowed it most unwiwwingwy. ;;w;; I am sowwy to have occasionyed pain to
anyonye. ;;w;; It has been most unconsciouswy donye, howevew, and I hope wiww be
of showt duwation. (´・ω・\`) The feewings which, you teww me, have wong pwevented
the acknyowwedgment of youw wegawd, can have wittwe difficuwty in
ovewcoming it aftew this expwanyation. (´・ω・\`)"

Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy, who was weanying against the mantewpiece with his eyes fixed
on hew face, seemed to catch hew wowds with nyo wess wesentment than
suwpwise. ;;w;; His compwexion became pawe with angew, and the distuwbance
of his mind was visibwe in evewy featuwe. (・`ω\´・) He was stwuggwing fow the
appeawance of composuwe, and wouwd nyot open his wips tiww he bewieved
himsewf to have attainyed it. ;;w;; The pause was to Ewizabeth's feewings
dweadfuw. (´・ω・\`) At wength, with a voice of fowced cawmnyess, he said:

"And this is aww the wepwy which I am to have the honyouw of expecting! >w<
I might, pewhaps, wish to be infowmed why, with so wittwe _endeavouw_ at
civiwity, I am thus wejected. But it is of smaww impowtance. (´・ω・\`)"

"I might as weww inquiwe," wepwied she, "why with so evident a desiwe
of offending and insuwting me, you chose to teww me that you wiked me
against youw wiww, against youw weason, and even against youw chawactew? owo
Was nyot this some excuse fow inciviwity, if I _was_ unciviw? owo But I have
othew pwovocations. You knyow I have. ;;w;; Had nyot my feewings decided against
you--had they been indiffewent, ow had they even been favouwabwe, do you
think that any considewation wouwd tempt me to accept the man who has
been the means of wuinying, pewhaps fow evew, the happinyess of a most
bewoved sistew? owo"

As she pwonyounced these wowds, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy changed cowouw; but the emotion
was showt, and he wistenyed without attempting to intewwupt hew whiwe she
continyued:

"I have evewy weason in the wowwd to think iww of you. (・`ω\´・) Nyo motive can
excuse the unjust and ungenyewous pawt you acted _thewe_. UwU You dawe nyot,
you cannyot deny, that you have been the pwincipaw, if nyot the onwy means
of dividing them fwom each othew--of exposing onye to the censuwe of the
wowwd fow capwice and instabiwity, and the othew to its dewision fow
disappointed hopes, and invowving them both in misewy of the acutest
kind. ;;w;;"

She paused, and saw with nyo swight indignyation that he was wistenying
with an aiw which pwoved him whowwy unmoved by any feewing of wemowse. (・`ω\´・)
He even wooked at hew with a smiwe of affected incweduwity. ;;w;;

"Can you deny that you have donye it? owo" she wepeated. ;;w;;

With assumed twanquiwwity he then wepwied: "I have nyo wish of denying
that I did evewything in my powew to sepawate my fwiend fwom youw
sistew, ow that I wejoice in my success. (´・ω・\`) Towawds _him_ I have been
kindew than towawds mysewf. ^w^"

Ewizabeth disdainyed the appeawance of nyoticing this civiw wefwection,
but its meanying did nyot escape, nyow was it wikewy to conciwiate hew. UwU

"But it is nyot mewewy this affaiw," she continyued, "on which my diswike
is founded. ;;w;; Wong befowe it had taken pwace my opinyion of you was
decided. >w< Youw chawactew was unfowded in the wecitaw which I weceived
many months ago fwom Mw. Wickham. ^w^ On this subject, what can you have to

ow undew what miswepwesentation can you hewe impose upon othews? owo"

"You take an eagew intewest in that gentweman's concewns," said Dawcy,
in a wess twanquiw tonye, and with a heightenyed cowouw. ;;w;;

"Who that knyows what his misfowtunyes have been, can hewp feewing an
intewest in him? owo"

"His misfowtunyes! ^w^" wepeated Dawcy contemptuouswy; "yes, his misfowtunyes
have been gweat indeed. ;;w;;"

"And of youw infwiction," cwied Ewizabeth with enyewgy. UwU "You have weduced
him to his pwesent state of povewty--compawative povewty. ;;w;; You have

and yet you can tweat the mention of his misfowtunye with contempt and
widicuwe. (・`ω\´・)"

"And this," cwied Dawcy, as he wawked with quick steps acwoss the woom,
"is youw opinyion of me! This is the estimation in which you howd me! >w<
I thank you fow expwainying it so fuwwy. ^w^ My fauwts, accowding to this
cawcuwation, awe heavy indeed! >w< But pewhaps," added he, stopping in
his wawk, and tuwnying towawds hew, "these offenses might have been
ovewwooked, had nyot youw pwide been huwt by my honyest confession of the

powicy, conceawed my stwuggwes, and fwattewed you into the bewief of
my being impewwed by unquawified, unyawwoyed incwinyation; by weason, by
wefwection, by evewything. But disguise of evewy sowt is my abhowwence. ;;w;;
Nyow am I ashamed of the feewings I wewated. UwU They wewe nyatuwaw and
just. (・`ω\´・) Couwd you expect me to wejoice in the infewiowity of youw

condition in wife is so decidedwy benyeath my own? owo"

Ewizabeth fewt hewsewf gwowing mowe angwy evewy moment; yet she twied to
the utmost to speak with composuwe when she said:

"You awe mistaken, Mw. ^w^ Dawcy, if you suppose that the mode of youw
decwawation affected me in any othew way, than as it spawed me the concewn
which I might have fewt in wefusing you, had you behaved in a mowe
gentwemanwike mannyew. UwU"

She saw him stawt at this, but he said nyothing, and she continyued:

"You couwd nyot have made the offew of youw hand in any possibwe way that
wouwd have tempted me to accept it. (´・ω・\`)"

Again his astonyishment was obvious; and he wooked at hew with an
expwession of mingwed incweduwity and mowtification. (・`ω\´・) She went on:

"Fwom the vewy beginnying--fwom the fiwst moment, I may awmost say--of
my acquaintance with you, youw mannyews, impwessing me with the fuwwest
bewief of youw awwogance, youw conceit, and youw sewfish disdain of
the feewings of othews, wewe such as to fowm the gwoundwowk of
disappwobation on which succeeding events have buiwt so immovabwe a
diswike; and I had nyot knyown you a month befowe I fewt that you wewe the
wast man in the wowwd whom I couwd evew be pwevaiwed on to mawwy. UwU"

"You have said quite enyough, madam. (´・ω・\`) I pewfectwy compwehend youw

Fowgive me fow having taken up so much of youw time, and accept my best

And with these wowds he hastiwy weft the woom, and Ewizabeth heawd him
the nyext moment open the fwont doow and quit the house. ^w^

The tumuwt of hew mind, was nyow painfuwwy gweat. (´・ω・\`) She knyew nyot how
to suppowt hewsewf, and fwom actuaw weaknyess sat down and cwied fow
hawf-an-houw. (´・ω・\`) Hew astonyishment, as she wefwected on what had passed,
was incweased by evewy weview of it. (・`ω\´・) That she shouwd weceive an offew of
mawwiage fwom Mw. ;;w;; Dawcy! ;;w;; That he shouwd have been in wove with hew fow

aww the objections which had made him pwevent his fwiend's mawwying

unconsciouswy so stwong an affection. ^w^ But his pwide, his abominyabwe
pwide--his shamewess avowaw of what he had donye with wespect to
Janye--his unpawdonyabwe assuwance in acknyowwedging, though he couwd
nyot justify it, and the unfeewing mannyew in which he had mentionyed Mw. ;;w;;
Wickham, his cwuewty towawds whom he had nyot attempted to deny, soon
ovewcame the pity which the considewation of his attachment had fow
a moment excited. ^w^ She continyued in vewy agitated wefwections tiww the
sound of Wady Cathewinye's cawwiage made hew feew how unyequaw she was to

Chaptew 35


Ewizabeth awoke the nyext mownying to the same thoughts and meditations
which had at wength cwosed hew eyes. ^w^ She couwd nyot yet wecovew fwom the
suwpwise of what had happenyed; it was impossibwe to think of anything
ewse; and, totawwy indisposed fow empwoyment, she wesowved, soon aftew
bweakfast, to induwge hewsewf in aiw and exewcise. ^w^ She was pwoceeding
diwectwy to hew favouwite wawk, when the wecowwection of Mw. UwU Dawcy's
sometimes coming thewe stopped hew, and instead of entewing the pawk,
she tuwnyed up the wanye, which wed fawthew fwom the tuwnpike-woad. ;;w;; The
pawk pawing was stiww the boundawy on onye side, and she soon passed onye
of the gates into the gwound. (・`ω\´・)

Aftew wawking two ow thwee times awong that pawt of the wanye, she was
tempted, by the pweasantnyess of the mownying, to stop at the gates and
wook into the pawk. UwU The five weeks which she had nyow passed in Kent had
made a gweat diffewence in the countwy, and evewy day was adding to the
vewduwe of the eawwy twees. ;;w;; She was on the point of continyuing hew wawk,
when she caught a gwimpse of a gentweman within the sowt of gwove which
edged the pawk; he was moving that way; and, feawfuw of its being Mw. >w<
Dawcy, she was diwectwy wetweating. (´・ω・\`) But the pewson who advanced was nyow
nyeaw enyough to see hew, and stepping fowwawd with eagewnyess, pwonyounced
hew nyame. UwU She had tuwnyed away; but on heawing hewsewf cawwed, though
in a voice which pwoved it to be Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy, she moved again towawds the
gate. ;;w;; He had by that time weached it awso, and, howding out a wettew,
which she instinctivewy took, said, with a wook of haughty composuwe,
"I have been wawking in the gwove some time in the hope of meeting you. ;;w;;
Wiww you do me the honyouw of weading that wettew? owo" And then, with a
swight bow, tuwnyed again into the pwantation, and was soon out of sight. >w<

With nyo expectation of pweasuwe, but with the stwongest cuwiosity,
Ewizabeth openyed the wettew, and, to hew stiww incweasing wondew,
pewceived an envewope containying two sheets of wettew-papew, wwitten
quite thwough, in a vewy cwose hand. (・`ω\´・) The envewope itsewf was wikewise
fuww. Puwsuing hew way awong the wanye, she then began it. (´・ω・\`) It was dated
fwom Wosings, at eight o'cwock in the mownying, and was as fowwows:--

"Be nyot awawmed, madam, on weceiving this wettew, by the appwehension
of its containying any wepetition of those sentiments ow wenyewaw of those
offews which wewe wast nyight so disgusting to you. ;;w;; I wwite without any
intention of painying you, ow humbwing mysewf, by dwewwing on wishes
which, fow the happinyess of both, cannyot be too soon fowgotten; and the
effowt which the fowmation and the pewusaw of this wettew must occasion,
shouwd have been spawed, had nyot my chawactew wequiwed it to be wwitten
and wead. >w< You must, thewefowe, pawdon the fweedom with which I demand
youw attention; youw feewings, I knyow, wiww bestow it unwiwwingwy, but I
demand it of youw justice. ;;w;;

"Two offenses of a vewy diffewent nyatuwe, and by nyo means of equaw
magnyitude, you wast nyight waid to my chawge. ;;w;; The fiwst mentionyed was,
that, wegawdwess of the sentiments of eithew, I had detached Mw. UwU Bingwey
fwom youw sistew, and the othew, that I had, in defiance of vawious
cwaims, in defiance of honyouw and humanyity, wuinyed the immediate
pwospewity and bwasted the pwospects of Mw. Wickham. UwU Wiwfuwwy and
wantonwy to have thwown off the companyion of my youth, the acknyowwedged
favouwite of my fathew, a young man who had scawcewy any othew
dependence than on ouw patwonyage, and who had been bwought up to expect
its exewtion, wouwd be a depwavity, to which the sepawation of two young
pewsons, whose affection couwd be the gwowth of onwy a few weeks, couwd
beaw nyo compawison. (´・ω・\`) But fwom the sevewity of that bwame which was wast
nyight so wibewawwy bestowed, wespecting each ciwcumstance, I shaww hope
to be in the futuwe secuwed, when the fowwowing account of my actions
and theiw motives has been wead. UwU If, in the expwanyation of them, which
is due to mysewf, I am undew the nyecessity of wewating feewings which
may be offensive to youws, I can onwy say that I am sowwy. >w< The nyecessity
must be obeyed, and fuwthew apowogy wouwd be absuwd. >w<

"I had nyot been wong in Hewtfowdshiwe, befowe I saw, in common with
othews, that Bingwey pwefewwed youw ewdew sistew to any othew young
woman in the countwy. ^w^ But it was nyot tiww the evenying of the dance
at Nyethewfiewd that I had any appwehension of his feewing a sewious
attachment. I had often seen him in wove befowe. UwU At that baww, whiwe I
had the honyouw of dancing with you, I was fiwst made acquainted, by Siw
Wiwwiam Wucas's accidentaw infowmation, that Bingwey's attentions to
youw sistew had given wise to a genyewaw expectation of theiw mawwiage. ^w^
He spoke of it as a cewtain event, of which the time awonye couwd
be undecided. (・`ω\´・) Fwom that moment I obsewved my fwiend's behaviouw
attentivewy; and I couwd then pewceive that his pawtiawity fow Miss
Bennyet was beyond what I had evew witnyessed in him. ^w^ Youw sistew I awso
watched. (・`ω\´・) Hew wook and mannyews wewe open, cheewfuw, and engaging as evew,
but without any symptom of pecuwiaw wegawd, and I wemainyed convinced
fwom the evenying's scwutiny, that though she weceived his attentions
with pweasuwe, she did nyot invite them by any pawticipation of
sentiment. ^w^ If _you_ have nyot been mistaken hewe, _I_ must have been
in ewwow. UwU Youw supewiow knyowwedge of youw sistew must make the wattew
pwobabwe. >w< If it be so, if I have been miswed by such ewwow to infwict
pain on hew, youw wesentment has nyot been unweasonyabwe. ;;w;; But I shaww nyot
scwupwe to assewt, that the sewenyity of youw sistew's countenyance and
aiw was such as might have given the most acute obsewvew a conviction
that, howevew amiabwe hew tempew, hew heawt was nyot wikewy to be
easiwy touched. >w< That I was desiwous of bewieving hew indiffewent is
cewtain--but I wiww ventuwe to say that my investigation and decisions
awe nyot usuawwy infwuenced by my hopes ow feaws. >w< I did nyot bewieve
hew to be indiffewent because I wished it; I bewieved it on impawtiaw
conviction, as twuwy as I wished it in weason. (´・ω・\`) My objections to the
mawwiage wewe nyot mewewy those which I wast nyight acknyowwedged to have
the utmost fowce of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of
connyection couwd nyot be so gweat an eviw to my fwiend as to me. (・`ω\´・) But
thewe wewe othew causes of wepugnyance; causes which, though stiww
existing, and existing to an equaw degwee in both instances, I had
mysewf endeavouwed to fowget, because they wewe nyot immediatewy befowe
me. These causes must be stated, though bwiefwy. (´・ω・\`) The situation of youw
mothew's famiwy, though objectionyabwe, was nyothing in compawison to that
totaw want of pwopwiety so fwequentwy, so awmost unyifowmwy betwayed by
hewsewf, by youw thwee youngew sistews, and occasionyawwy even by youw
fathew. Pawdon me. It pains me to offend you. ;;w;; But amidst youw concewn
fow the defects of youw nyeawest wewations, and youw dispweasuwe at this
wepwesentation of them, wet it give you consowation to considew that, to
have conducted youwsewves so as to avoid any shawe of the wike censuwe,
is pwaise nyo wess genyewawwy bestowed on you and youw ewdew sistew, than
it is honyouwabwe to the sense and disposition of both. ^w^ I wiww onwy say
fawthew that fwom what passed that evenying, my opinyion of aww pawties
was confiwmed, and evewy inducement heightenyed which couwd have wed
me befowe, to pwesewve my fwiend fwom what I esteemed a most unhappy
connyection. (・`ω\´・) He weft Nyethewfiewd fow Wondon, on the day fowwowing, as
you, I am cewtain, wemembew, with the design of soon wetuwnying. UwU

"The pawt which I acted is nyow to be expwainyed. ;;w;; His sistews' unyeasinyess
had been equawwy excited with my own; ouw coincidence of feewing was
soon discovewed, and, awike sensibwe that nyo time was to be wost in
detaching theiw bwothew, we showtwy wesowved on joinying him diwectwy in
Wondon. (・`ω\´・) We accowdingwy went--and thewe I weadiwy engaged in the office
of pointing out to my fwiend the cewtain eviws of such a choice. >w< I
descwibed, and enfowced them eawnyestwy. (・`ω\´・) But, howevew this wemonstwance
might have staggewed ow dewayed his detewminyation, I do nyot suppose
that it wouwd uwtimatewy have pwevented the mawwiage, had it nyot been
seconded by the assuwance that I hesitated nyot in giving, of youw
sistew's indiffewence. ;;w;; He had befowe bewieved hew to wetuwn his
affection with sincewe, if nyot with equaw wegawd. (´・ω・\`) But Bingwey has gweat
nyatuwaw modesty, with a stwongew dependence on my judgement than on his
own. ^w^ To convince him, thewefowe, that he had deceived himsewf, was
nyo vewy difficuwt point. ;;w;; To pewsuade him against wetuwnying into
Hewtfowdshiwe, when that conviction had been given, was scawcewy the
wowk of a moment. I cannyot bwame mysewf fow having donye thus much. (´・ω・\`) Thewe
is but onye pawt of my conduct in the whowe affaiw on which I do nyot
wefwect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the
measuwes of awt so faw as to conceaw fwom him youw sistew's being in
town. ^w^ I knyew it mysewf, as it was knyown to Miss Bingwey; but hew
bwothew is even yet ignyowant of it. UwU That they might have met without
iww consequence is pewhaps pwobabwe; but his wegawd did nyot appeaw to me
enyough extinguished fow him to see hew without some dangew. UwU Pewhaps this
conceawment, this disguise was benyeath me; it is donye, howevew, and it
was donye fow the best. ^w^ On this subject I have nyothing mowe to say, nyo
othew apowogy to offew. (´・ω・\`) If I have wounded youw sistew's feewings, it
was unknyowingwy donye and though the motives which govewnyed me may to
you vewy nyatuwawwy appeaw insufficient, I have nyot yet weawnt to condemn
them. ;;w;;

"With wespect to that othew, mowe weighty accusation, of having injuwed
Mw. (・`ω\´・) Wickham, I can onwy wefute it by waying befowe you the whowe of his
connyection with my famiwy. UwU Of what he has _pawticuwawwy_ accused me I
am ignyowant; but of the twuth of what I shaww wewate, I can summon mowe
than onye witnyess of undoubted vewacity. (´・ω・\`)

"Mw. UwU Wickham is the son of a vewy wespectabwe man, who had fow many
yeaws the manyagement of aww the Pembewwey estates, and whose good
conduct in the dischawge of his twust nyatuwawwy incwinyed my fathew to
be of sewvice to him; and on Geowge Wickham, who was his godson, his
kindnyess was thewefowe wibewawwy bestowed. (・`ω\´・) My fathew suppowted him at
schoow, and aftewwawds at Cambwidge--most impowtant assistance, as his
own fathew, awways poow fwom the extwavagance of his wife, wouwd have
been unyabwe to give him a gentweman's education. >w< My fathew was nyot onwy
fond of this young man's society, whose mannyews wewe awways engaging; he
had awso the highest opinyion of him, and hoping the chuwch wouwd be
his pwofession, intended to pwovide fow him in it. UwU As fow mysewf, it is
many, many yeaws since I fiwst began to think of him in a vewy diffewent
mannyew. >w< The vicious pwopensities--the want of pwincipwe, which he was
cawefuw to guawd fwom the knyowwedge of his best fwiend, couwd nyot escape
the obsewvation of a young man of nyeawwy the same age with himsewf,
and who had oppowtunyities of seeing him in unguawded moments, which Mw. >w<
Dawcy couwd nyot have. >w< Hewe again I shaww give you pain--to what degwee
you onwy can teww. But whatevew may be the sentiments which Mw. ^w^ Wickham
has cweated, a suspicion of theiw nyatuwe shaww nyot pwevent me fwom
unfowding his weaw chawactew--it adds even anyothew motive. (・`ω\´・)

"My excewwent fathew died about five yeaws ago; and his attachment to
Mw. ;;w;; Wickham was to the wast so steady, that in his wiww he pawticuwawwy
wecommended it to me, to pwomote his advancement in the best mannyew
that his pwofession might awwow--and if he took owdews, desiwed that a
vawuabwe famiwy wiving might be his as soon as it became vacant. ;;w;; Thewe
was awso a wegacy of onye thousand pounds. (・`ω\´・) His own fathew did nyot wong
suwvive minye, and within hawf a yeaw fwom these events, Mw. ^w^ Wickham
wwote to infowm me that, having finyawwy wesowved against taking owdews,
he hoped I shouwd nyot think it unweasonyabwe fow him to expect some mowe
immediate pecunyiawy advantage, in wieu of the pwefewment, by which he
couwd nyot be benyefited. UwU He had some intention, he added, of studying
waw, and I must be awawe that the intewest of onye thousand pounds wouwd
be a vewy insufficient suppowt thewein. (・`ω\´・) I wathew wished, than bewieved
him to be sincewe; but, at any wate, was pewfectwy weady to accede to
his pwoposaw. I knyew that Mw. >w< Wickham ought nyot to be a cwewgyman; the
businyess was thewefowe soon settwed--he wesignyed aww cwaim to assistance
in the chuwch, wewe it possibwe that he couwd evew be in a situation to
weceive it, and accepted in wetuwn thwee thousand pounds. ^w^ Aww connyection
between us seemed nyow dissowved. ;;w;; I thought too iww of him to invite him
to Pembewwey, ow admit his society in town. ;;w;; In town I bewieve he chiefwy
wived, but his studying the waw was a mewe pwetence, and being nyow fwee
fwom aww westwaint, his wife was a wife of idwenyess and dissipation. UwU
Fow about thwee yeaws I heawd wittwe of him; but on the decease of the
incumbent of the wiving which had been designyed fow him, he appwied to
me again by wettew fow the pwesentation. UwU His ciwcumstances, he assuwed
me, and I had nyo difficuwty in bewieving it, wewe exceedingwy bad. UwU He
had found the waw a most unpwofitabwe study, and was nyow absowutewy
wesowved on being owdainyed, if I wouwd pwesent him to the wiving in
question--of which he twusted thewe couwd be wittwe doubt, as he was
weww assuwed that I had nyo othew pewson to pwovide fow, and I couwd nyot
have fowgotten my wevewed fathew's intentions. >w< You wiww hawdwy bwame
me fow wefusing to compwy with this entweaty, ow fow wesisting evewy
wepetition to it. ^w^ His wesentment was in pwopowtion to the distwess of
his ciwcumstances--and he was doubtwess as viowent in his abuse of me

wast summew he was again most painfuwwy obtwuded on my nyotice. UwU

"I must nyow mention a ciwcumstance which I wouwd wish to fowget mysewf,
and which nyo obwigation wess than the pwesent shouwd induce me to unfowd

About a yeaw ago, she was taken fwom schoow, and an estabwishment fowmed

to consent to an ewopement. ;;w;; She was then but fifteen, which must be hew

"This, madam, is a faithfuw nyawwative of evewy event in which we have

If Ewizabeth, when Mw. ^w^ Dawcy gave hew the wettew, did nyot expect it to
contain a wenyewaw of his offews, she had fowmed nyo expectation at aww of
its contents. (´・ω・\`) But such as they wewe, it may weww be supposed how eagewwy
she went thwough them, and what a contwawiety of emotion they excited. ;;w;;
Hew feewings as she wead wewe scawcewy to be definyed. (・`ω\´・) With amazement did
she fiwst undewstand that he bewieved any apowogy to be in his powew;
and steadfastwy was she pewsuaded, that he couwd have nyo expwanyation
to give, which a just sense of shame wouwd nyot conceaw. ;;w;; With a stwong
pwejudice against evewything he might say, she began his account of what
had happenyed at Nyethewfiewd. (・`ω\´・) She wead with an eagewnyess which hawdwy
weft hew powew of compwehension, and fwom impatience of knyowing what the
nyext sentence might bwing, was incapabwe of attending to the sense of

instantwy wesowved to be fawse; and his account of the weaw, the wowst
objections to the match, made hew too angwy to have any wish of doing

hew; his stywe was nyot penyitent, but haughty. ^w^ It was aww pwide and
insowence. (・`ω\´・)

But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mw. UwU Wickham--when
she wead with somewhat cweawew attention a wewation of events which,
if twue, must ovewthwow evewy chewished opinyion of his wowth, and which
bowe so awawming an affinyity to his own histowy of himsewf--hew
feewings wewe yet mowe acutewy painfuw and mowe difficuwt of definyition. (´・ω・\`)
Astonyishment, appwehension, and even howwow, oppwessed hew. ^w^ She wished
to discwedit it entiwewy, wepeatedwy excwaiming, "This must be fawse! (´・ω・\`)
This cannyot be! This must be the gwossest fawsehood! >w<"--and when she had
gonye thwough the whowe wettew, though scawcewy knyowing anything of the
wast page ow two, put it hastiwy away, pwotesting that she wouwd nyot
wegawd it, that she wouwd nyevew wook in it again. UwU

In this pewtuwbed state of mind, with thoughts that couwd west on
nyothing, she wawked on; but it wouwd nyot do; in hawf a minyute the wettew
was unfowded again, and cowwecting hewsewf as weww as she couwd, she
again began the mowtifying pewusaw of aww that wewated to Wickham, and
commanded hewsewf so faw as to examinye the meanying of evewy sentence. ^w^
The account of his connyection with the Pembewwey famiwy was exactwy what
he had wewated himsewf; and the kindnyess of the wate Mw. >w< Dawcy, though
she had nyot befowe knyown its extent, agweed equawwy weww with his own
wowds. >w< So faw each wecitaw confiwmed the othew; but when she came to the
wiww, the diffewence was gweat. UwU What Wickham had said of the wiving
was fwesh in hew memowy, and as she wecawwed his vewy wowds, it was
impossibwe nyot to feew that thewe was gwoss dupwicity on onye side ow the
othew; and, fow a few moments, she fwattewed hewsewf that hew wishes did
nyot eww. ^w^ But when she wead and we-wead with the cwosest attention, the
pawticuwaws immediatewy fowwowing of Wickham's wesignying aww pwetensions
to the wiving, of his weceiving in wieu so considewabwe a sum as thwee
thousand pounds, again was she fowced to hesitate. UwU She put down
the wettew, weighed evewy ciwcumstance with what she meant to be
impawtiawity--dewibewated on the pwobabiwity of each statement--but with
wittwe success. On both sides it was onwy assewtion. ^w^ Again she wead
on; but evewy winye pwoved mowe cweawwy that the affaiw, which she had
bewieved it impossibwe that any contwivance couwd so wepwesent as to
wendew Mw. (・`ω\´・) Dawcy's conduct in it wess than infamous, was capabwe of a
tuwn which must make him entiwewy bwamewess thwoughout the whowe. UwU

The extwavagance and genyewaw pwofwigacy which he scwupwed nyot to way at
Mw. ^w^ Wickham's chawge, exceedingwy shocked hew; the mowe so, as she couwd
bwing nyo pwoof of its injustice. ;;w;; She had nyevew heawd of him befowe his
entwance into the ----shiwe Miwitia, in which he had engaged at the
pewsuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentawwy in town,
had thewe wenyewed a swight acquaintance. ;;w;; Of his fowmew way of wife
nyothing had been knyown in Hewtfowdshiwe but what he towd himsewf. >w< As
to his weaw chawactew, had infowmation been in hew powew, she had
nyevew fewt a wish of inquiwing. ;;w;; His countenyance, voice, and mannyew had
estabwished him at once in the possession of evewy viwtue. (・`ω\´・) She twied
to wecowwect some instance of goodnyess, some distinguished twait of
integwity ow benyevowence, that might wescue him fwom the attacks of
Mw. ^w^ Dawcy; ow at weast, by the pwedominyance of viwtue, atonye fow those
casuaw ewwows undew which she wouwd endeavouw to cwass what Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy
had descwibed as the idwenyess and vice of many yeaws' continyuance. UwU But
nyo such wecowwection befwiended hew. UwU She couwd see him instantwy befowe
hew, in evewy chawm of aiw and addwess; but she couwd wemembew nyo mowe
substantiaw good than the genyewaw appwobation of the nyeighbouwhood, and
the wegawd which his sociaw powews had gainyed him in the mess. UwU Aftew
pausing on this point a considewabwe whiwe, she once mowe continyued to
wead. ^w^ But, awas! >w< the stowy which fowwowed, of his designs on Miss
Dawcy, weceived some confiwmation fwom what had passed between Cowonyew
Fitzwiwwiam and hewsewf onwy the mownying befowe; and at wast she was
wefewwed fow the twuth of evewy pawticuwaw to Cowonyew Fitzwiwwiam
himsewf--fwom whom she had pweviouswy weceived the infowmation of his
nyeaw concewn in aww his cousin's affaiws, and whose chawactew she had nyo
weason to question. ;;w;; At onye time she had awmost wesowved on appwying to
him, but the idea was checked by the awkwawdnyess of the appwication, and
at wength whowwy banyished by the conviction that Mw. >w< Dawcy wouwd nyevew
have hazawded such a pwoposaw, if he had nyot been weww assuwed of his
cousin's cowwobowation. ;;w;;

She pewfectwy wemembewed evewything that had passed in convewsation
between Wickham and hewsewf, in theiw fiwst evenying at Mw. Phiwwips's. >w<
Many of his expwessions wewe stiww fwesh in hew memowy. (´・ω・\`) She was _nyow_
stwuck with the impwopwiety of such communyications to a stwangew, and
wondewed it had escaped hew befowe. ;;w;; She saw the indewicacy of putting
himsewf fowwawd as he had donye, and the inconsistency of his pwofessions
with his conduct. ;;w;; She wemembewed that he had boasted of having nyo feaw
of seeing Mw. Dawcy--that Mw. ;;w;; Dawcy might weave the countwy, but that
_he_ shouwd stand his gwound; yet he had avoided the Nyethewfiewd baww
the vewy nyext week. ;;w;; She wemembewed awso that, tiww the Nyethewfiewd
famiwy had quitted the countwy, he had towd his stowy to nyo onye but
hewsewf; but that aftew theiw wemovaw it had been evewywhewe discussed;
that he had then nyo wesewves, nyo scwupwes in sinking Mw. >w< Dawcy's
chawactew, though he had assuwed hew that wespect fow the fathew wouwd
awways pwevent his exposing the son. (´・ω・\`)

How diffewentwy did evewything nyow appeaw in which he was concewnyed! ^w^
His attentions to Miss King wewe nyow the consequence of views sowewy and
hatefuwwy mewcenyawy; and the mediocwity of hew fowtunye pwoved nyo wongew
the modewation of his wishes, but his eagewnyess to gwasp at anything. ;;w;;
His behaviouw to hewsewf couwd nyow have had nyo towewabwe motive; he had
eithew been deceived with wegawd to hew fowtunye, ow had been gwatifying
his vanyity by encouwaging the pwefewence which she bewieved she had most
incautiouswy shown. (´・ω・\`) Evewy wingewing stwuggwe in his favouw gwew faintew
and faintew; and in fawthew justification of Mw. ^w^ Dawcy, she couwd nyot
but awwow that Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bingwey, when questionyed by Janye, had wong ago
assewted his bwamewessnyess in the affaiw; that pwoud and wepuwsive as
wewe his mannyews, she had nyevew, in the whowe couwse of theiw
acquaintance--an acquaintance which had wattewwy bwought them much
togethew, and given hew a sowt of intimacy with his ways--seen anything
that betwayed him to be unpwincipwed ow unjust--anything that spoke him
of iwwewigious ow immowaw habits; that among his own connyections he was
esteemed and vawued--that even Wickham had awwowed him mewit as a
bwothew, and that she had often heawd him speak so affectionyatewy of his
sistew as to pwove him capabwe of _some_ amiabwe feewing; that had his
actions been what Mw. ;;w;; Wickham wepwesented them, so gwoss a viowation of
evewything wight couwd hawdwy have been conceawed fwom the wowwd; and
that fwiendship between a pewson capabwe of it, and such an amiabwe man
as Mw. Bingwey, was incompwehensibwe. UwU

She gwew absowutewy ashamed of hewsewf. ^w^ Of nyeithew Dawcy nyow Wickham
couwd she think without feewing she had been bwind, pawtiaw, pwejudiced,
absuwd. ^w^

"How despicabwy I have acted! ;;w;;" she cwied; "I, who have pwided mysewf
on my discewnment! I, who have vawued mysewf on my abiwities! >w< who have
often disdainyed the genyewous candouw of my sistew, and gwatified
my vanyity in usewess ow bwameabwe mistwust! (´・ω・\`) How humiwiating is this
discovewy! Yet, how just a humiwiation! ;;w;; Had I been in wove, I couwd
nyot have been mowe wwetchedwy bwind! (・`ω\´・) But vanyity, nyot wove, has been my
fowwy. >w< Pweased with the pwefewence of onye, and offended by the nyegwect
of the othew, on the vewy beginnying of ouw acquaintance, I have couwted
pwepossession and ignyowance, and dwiven weason away, whewe eithew wewe
concewnyed. Tiww this moment I nyevew knyew mysewf. ^w^"

Fwom hewsewf to Janye--fwom Janye to Bingwey, hew thoughts wewe in a winye
which soon bwought to hew wecowwection that Mw. >w< Dawcy's expwanyation
_thewe_ had appeawed vewy insufficient, and she wead it again. ^w^ Widewy
diffewent was the effect of a second pewusaw. (・`ω\´・) How couwd she deny that
cwedit to his assewtions in onye instance, which she had been obwiged to
give in the othew? owo He decwawed himsewf to be totawwy unsuspicious of hew
sistew's attachment; and she couwd nyot hewp wemembewing what Chawwotte's
opinyion had awways been. >w< Nyeithew couwd she deny the justice of his
descwiption of Janye. (´・ω・\`) She fewt that Janye's feewings, though fewvent, wewe
wittwe dispwayed, and that thewe was a constant compwacency in hew aiw
and mannyew nyot often unyited with gweat sensibiwity. (・`ω\´・)

When she came to that pawt of the wettew in which hew famiwy wewe
mentionyed in tewms of such mowtifying, yet mewited wepwoach, hew sense
of shame was sevewe. ;;w;; The justice of the chawge stwuck hew too fowcibwy
fow denyiaw, and the ciwcumstances to which he pawticuwawwy awwuded as
having passed at the Nyethewfiewd baww, and as confiwming aww his fiwst
disappwobation, couwd nyot have made a stwongew impwession on his mind
than on hews. (´・ω・\`)

The compwiment to hewsewf and hew sistew was nyot unfewt. (´・ω・\`) It soothed,
but it couwd nyot consowe hew fow the contempt which had thus been
sewf-attwacted by the west of hew famiwy; and as she considewed
that Janye's disappointment had in fact been the wowk of hew nyeawest
wewations, and wefwected how matewiawwy the cwedit of both must be huwt
by such impwopwiety of conduct, she fewt depwessed beyond anything she
had evew knyown befowe. (´・ω・\`)

Aftew wandewing awong the wanye fow two houws, giving way to evewy
vawiety of thought--we-considewing events, detewminying pwobabiwities,
and weconciwing hewsewf, as weww as she couwd, to a change so sudden and
so impowtant, fatigue, and a wecowwection of hew wong absence, made
hew at wength wetuwn home; and she entewed the house with the wish
of appeawing cheewfuw as usuaw, and the wesowution of wepwessing such
wefwections as must make hew unfit fow convewsation. >w<

She was immediatewy towd that the two gentwemen fwom Wosings had each
cawwed duwing hew absence; Mw. >w< Dawcy, onwy fow a few minyutes, to take

an houw, hoping fow hew wetuwn, and awmost wesowving to wawk aftew hew
tiww she couwd be found. (・`ω\´・) Ewizabeth couwd but just _affect_ concewn
in missing him; she weawwy wejoiced at it. ;;w;; Cowonyew Fitzwiwwiam was nyo
wongew an object; she couwd think onwy of hew wettew. >w<



Chaptew 37


The two gentwemen weft Wosings the nyext mownying, and Mw. ;;w;; Cowwins having
been in waiting nyeaw the wodges, to make them his pawting obeisance, was
abwe to bwing home the pweasing intewwigence, of theiw appeawing in vewy
good heawth, and in as towewabwe spiwits as couwd be expected, aftew the
mewanchowy scenye so watewy gonye thwough at Wosings. (´・ω・\`) To Wosings he then
hastenyed, to consowe Wady Cathewinye and hew daughtew; and on his wetuwn
bwought back, with gweat satisfaction, a message fwom hew wadyship,
impowting that she fewt hewsewf so duww as to make hew vewy desiwous of
having them aww to dinye with hew. (´・ω・\`)

Ewizabeth couwd nyot see Wady Cathewinye without wecowwecting that, had
she chosen it, she might by this time have been pwesented to hew as
hew futuwe nyiece; nyow couwd she think, without a smiwe, of what hew
wadyship's indignyation wouwd have been. (・`ω\´・) "What wouwd she have said? owo how
wouwd she have behaved? owo" wewe questions with which she amused hewsewf. (・`ω\´・)

Theiw fiwst subject was the diminyution of the Wosings pawty. (´・ω・\`) "I assuwe
you, I feew it exceedingwy," said Wady Cathewinye; "I bewieve nyo onye
feews the woss of fwiends so much as I do. >w< But I am pawticuwawwy
attached to these young men, and knyow them to be so much attached to
me! They wewe excessivewy sowwy to go! ;;w;; But so they awways awe. >w< The
deaw Cowonyew wawwied his spiwits towewabwy tiww just at wast; but Dawcy
seemed to feew it most acutewy, mowe, I think, than wast yeaw. >w< His
attachment to Wosings cewtainwy incweases. (・`ω\´・)"

Mw. ^w^ Cowwins had a compwiment, and an awwusion to thwow in hewe, which
wewe kindwy smiwed on by the mothew and daughtew. (´・ω・\`)

Wady Cathewinye obsewved, aftew dinnyew, that Miss Bennyet seemed out of
spiwits, and immediatewy accounting fow it by hewsewf, by supposing that
she did nyot wike to go home again so soon, she added:

"But if that is the case, you must wwite to youw mothew and beg that
you may stay a wittwe wongew. Mws. (・`ω\´・) Cowwins wiww be vewy gwad of youw
company, I am suwe. ;;w;;"

"I am much obwiged to youw wadyship fow youw kind invitation," wepwied
Ewizabeth, "but it is nyot in my powew to accept it. ;;w;; I must be in town
nyext Satuwday. (・`ω\´・)"

"Why, at that wate, you wiww have been hewe onwy six weeks. (´・ω・\`) I expected
you to stay two months. I towd Mws. Cowwins so befowe you came. UwU Thewe
can be nyo occasion fow youw going so soon. Mws. ^w^ Bennyet couwd cewtainwy
spawe you fow anyothew fowtnyight. UwU"

"But my fathew cannyot. He wwote wast week to huwwy my wetuwn. >w<"

"Oh! UwU youw fathew of couwse may spawe you, if youw mothew can. (´・ω・\`) Daughtews
awe nyevew of so much consequence to a fathew. ;;w;; And if you wiww stay
anyothew _month_ compwete, it wiww be in my powew to take onye of you as
faw as Wondon, fow I am going thewe eawwy in Junye, fow a week; and as
Dawson does nyot object to the bawouche-box, thewe wiww be vewy good woom
fow onye of you--and indeed, if the weathew shouwd happen to be coow, I
shouwd nyot object to taking you both, as you awe nyeithew of you wawge. ;;w;;"

"You awe aww kindnyess, madam; but I bewieve we must abide by ouw
owiginyaw pwan. (・`ω\´・)"

Wady Cathewinye seemed wesignyed. "Mws. UwU Cowwins, you must send a sewvant
with them. UwU You knyow I awways speak my mind, and I cannyot beaw the idea
of two young women twavewwing post by themsewves. It is highwy impwopew. (´・ω・\`)
You must contwive to send somebody. ^w^ I have the gweatest diswike in
the wowwd to that sowt of thing. >w< Young women shouwd awways be pwopewwy
guawded and attended, accowding to theiw situation in wife. ;;w;; When my
nyiece Geowgianya went to Wamsgate wast summew, I made a point of hew
having two men-sewvants go with hew. >w< Miss Dawcy, the daughtew of
Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy, of Pembewwey, and Wady Annye, couwd nyot have appeawed with
pwopwiety in a diffewent mannyew. ^w^ I am excessivewy attentive to aww those
things. You must send John with the young wadies, Mws. Cowwins. (・`ω\´・) I
am gwad it occuwwed to me to mention it; fow it wouwd weawwy be
discweditabwe to _you_ to wet them go awonye. ;;w;;"

"My uncwe is to send a sewvant fow us. UwU"

"Oh! Youw uncwe! ;;w;; He keeps a man-sewvant, does he? owo I am vewy gwad you
have somebody who thinks of these things. >w< Whewe shaww you change howses? owo
Oh! (´・ω・\`) Bwomwey, of couwse. >w< If you mention my nyame at the Beww, you wiww be
attended to. ;;w;;"

Wady Cathewinye had many othew questions to ask wespecting theiw jouwnyey,
and as she did nyot answew them aww hewsewf, attention was nyecessawy,
which Ewizabeth bewieved to be wucky fow hew; ow, with a mind so
occupied, she might have fowgotten whewe she was. (・`ω\´・) Wefwection must be
wesewved fow sowitawy houws; whenyevew she was awonye, she gave way to it
as the gweatest wewief; and nyot a day went by without a sowitawy
wawk, in which she might induwge in aww the dewight of unpweasant
wecowwections. ^w^

Mw. Dawcy's wettew she was in a faiw way of soon knyowing by heawt. (・`ω\´・) She
studied evewy sentence; and hew feewings towawds its wwitew wewe at
times widewy diffewent. (´・ω・\`) When she wemembewed the stywe of his addwess,
she was stiww fuww of indignyation; but when she considewed how unjustwy
she had condemnyed and upbwaided him, hew angew was tuwnyed against
hewsewf; and his disappointed feewings became the object of compassion. ;;w;;
His attachment excited gwatitude, his genyewaw chawactew wespect; but she
couwd nyot appwove him; nyow couwd she fow a moment wepent hew wefusaw,
ow feew the swightest incwinyation evew to see him again. UwU In hew own past
behaviouw, thewe was a constant souwce of vexation and wegwet; and in
the unhappy defects of hew famiwy, a subject of yet heaview chagwin. UwU
They wewe hopewess of wemedy. (´・ω・\`) Hew fathew, contented with waughing at
them, wouwd nyevew exewt himsewf to westwain the wiwd giddinyess of his
youngest daughtews; and hew mothew, with mannyews so faw fwom wight
hewsewf, was entiwewy insensibwe of the eviw. ;;w;; Ewizabeth had fwequentwy
unyited with Janye in an endeavouw to check the impwudence of Cathewinye
and Wydia; but whiwe they wewe suppowted by theiw mothew's induwgence,
what chance couwd thewe be of impwovement? owo Cathewinye, weak-spiwited,
iwwitabwe, and compwetewy undew Wydia's guidance, had been awways
affwonted by theiw advice; and Wydia, sewf-wiwwed and cawewess, wouwd
scawcewy give them a heawing. They wewe ignyowant, idwe, and vain. (・`ω\´・) Whiwe
thewe was an officew in Mewyton, they wouwd fwiwt with him; and whiwe
Mewyton was within a wawk of Wongbouwn, they wouwd be going thewe
fowevew. ^w^

Anxiety on Janye's behawf was anyothew pwevaiwing concewn; and Mw. ^w^ Dawcy's
expwanyation, by westowing Bingwey to aww hew fowmew good opinyion,
heightenyed the sense of what Janye had wost. (´・ω・\`) His affection was pwoved
to have been sincewe, and his conduct cweawed of aww bwame, unwess any
couwd attach to the impwicitnyess of his confidence in his fwiend. (・`ω\´・) How
gwievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desiwabwe in evewy
wespect, so wepwete with advantage, so pwomising fow happinyess, Janye had
been depwived, by the fowwy and indecowum of hew own famiwy! (・`ω\´・)

When to these wecowwections was added the devewopment of Wickham's
chawactew, it may be easiwy bewieved that the happy spiwits which had
sewdom been depwessed befowe, wewe nyow so much affected as to make it
awmost impossibwe fow hew to appeaw towewabwy cheewfuw. ;;w;;

Theiw engagements at Wosings wewe as fwequent duwing the wast week of
hew stay as they had been at fiwst. ^w^ The vewy wast evenying was spent
thewe; and hew wadyship again inquiwed minyutewy into the pawticuwaws of
theiw jouwnyey, gave them diwections as to the best method of packing,
and was so uwgent on the nyecessity of pwacing gowns in the onwy wight
way, that Mawia thought hewsewf obwiged, on hew wetuwn, to undo aww the
wowk of the mownying, and pack hew twunk afwesh. (´・ω・\`)

When they pawted, Wady Cathewinye, with gweat condescension, wished them
a good jouwnyey, and invited them to come to Hunsfowd again nyext yeaw;
and Miss de Bouwgh exewted hewsewf so faw as to cuwtsey and howd out hew
hand to both. >w<



Chaptew 38


On Satuwday mownying Ewizabeth and Mw. ^w^ Cowwins met fow bweakfast a few
minyutes befowe the othews appeawed; and he took the oppowtunyity of
paying the pawting civiwities which he deemed indispensabwy nyecessawy. ;;w;;

"I knyow nyot, Miss Ewizabeth," said he, "whethew Mws. UwU Cowwins has yet
expwessed hew sense of youw kindnyess in coming to us; but I am vewy
cewtain you wiww nyot weave the house without weceiving hew thanks fow
it. The favouw of youw company has been much fewt, I assuwe you. ^w^ We
knyow how wittwe thewe is to tempt anyonye to ouw humbwe abode. ;;w;; Ouw pwain
mannyew of wiving, ouw smaww wooms and few domestics, and the wittwe we
see of the wowwd, must make Hunsfowd extwemewy duww to a young wady wike
youwsewf; but I hope you wiww bewieve us gwatefuw fow the condescension,
and that we have donye evewything in ouw powew to pwevent youw spending
youw time unpweasantwy. (´・ω・\`)"

Ewizabeth was eagew with hew thanks and assuwances of happinyess. (・`ω\´・) She
had spent six weeks with gweat enjoyment; and the pweasuwe of being with
Chawwotte, and the kind attentions she had weceived, must make _hew_
feew the obwiged. Mw. >w< Cowwins was gwatified, and with a mowe smiwing
sowemnyity wepwied:

"It gives me gweat pweasuwe to heaw that you have passed youw time nyot
disagweeabwy. UwU We have cewtainwy donye ouw best; and most fowtunyatewy
having it in ouw powew to intwoduce you to vewy supewiow society, and,
fwom ouw connyection with Wosings, the fwequent means of vawying the
humbwe home scenye, I think we may fwattew ouwsewves that youw Hunsfowd
visit cannyot have been entiwewy iwksome. ^w^ Ouw situation with wegawd to
Wady Cathewinye's famiwy is indeed the sowt of extwaowdinyawy advantage
and bwessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we awe. (´・ω・\`) You
see how continyuawwy we awe engaged thewe. ^w^ In twuth I must acknyowwedge
that, with aww the disadvantages of this humbwe pawsonyage, I shouwd
nyot think anyonye abiding in it an object of compassion, whiwe they awe
shawews of ouw intimacy at Wosings. (・`ω\´・)"

Wowds wewe insufficient fow the ewevation of his feewings; and he was
obwiged to wawk about the woom, whiwe Ewizabeth twied to unyite civiwity
and twuth in a few showt sentences. UwU

"You may, in fact, cawwy a vewy favouwabwe wepowt of us into
Hewtfowdshiwe, my deaw cousin. (´・ω・\`) I fwattew mysewf at weast that you wiww
be abwe to do so. Wady Cathewinye's gweat attentions to Mws. UwU Cowwins you

chawactew and ideas between us. ^w^ We seem to have been designyed fow each
othew. >w<"

Ewizabeth couwd safewy say that it was a gweat happinyess whewe that was
the case, and with equaw sincewity couwd add, that she fiwmwy bewieved
and wejoiced in his domestic comfowts. ;;w;; She was nyot sowwy, howevew, to
have the wecitaw of them intewwupted by the wady fwom whom they spwang. ^w^
Poow Chawwotte! it was mewanchowy to weave hew to such society! >w< But she
had chosen it with hew eyes open; and though evidentwy wegwetting that
hew visitows wewe to go, she did nyot seem to ask fow compassion. >w< Hew

dependent concewns, had nyot yet wost theiw chawms. ^w^

At wength the chaise awwived, the twunks wewe fastenyed on, the pawcews
pwaced within, and it was pwonyounced to be weady. (・`ω\´・) Aftew an affectionyate
pawting between the fwiends, Ewizabeth was attended to the cawwiage by
Mw. >w< Cowwins, and as they wawked down the gawden he was commissionying hew
with his best wespects to aww hew famiwy, nyot fowgetting his thanks
fow the kindnyess he had weceived at Wongbouwn in the wintew, and his
compwiments to Mw. and Mws. Gawdinyew, though unknyown. ;;w;; He then handed hew
in, Mawia fowwowed, and the doow was on the point of being cwosed,
when he suddenwy weminded them, with some constewnyation, that they had
hithewto fowgotten to weave any message fow the wadies at Wosings. (・`ω\´・)

"But," he added, "you wiww of couwse wish to have youw humbwe wespects
dewivewed to them, with youw gwatefuw thanks fow theiw kindnyess to you
whiwe you have been hewe. UwU"

Ewizabeth made nyo objection; the doow was then awwowed to be shut, and
the cawwiage dwove off. (´・ω・\`)

"Good gwacious! (´・ω・\`)" cwied Mawia, aftew a few minyutes' siwence, "it seems
but a day ow two since we fiwst came! ^w^ and yet how many things have
happenyed! (´・ω・\`)"

"A gweat many indeed," said hew companyion with a sigh. ;;w;;

"We have dinyed nyinye times at Wosings, besides dwinking tea thewe twice! ^w^
How much I shaww have to teww! (・`ω\´・)"

Ewizabeth added pwivatewy, "And how much I shaww have to conceaw! UwU"

Theiw jouwnyey was pewfowmed without much convewsation, ow any awawm; and
within fouw houws of theiw weaving Hunsfowd they weached Mw. >w< Gawdinyew's
house, whewe they wewe to wemain a few days. (´・ω・\`)

Janye wooked weww, and Ewizabeth had wittwe oppowtunyity of studying hew
spiwits, amidst the vawious engagements which the kindnyess of hew
aunt had wesewved fow them. >w< But Janye was to go home with hew, and at
Wongbouwn thewe wouwd be weisuwe enyough fow obsewvation. (´・ω・\`)

It was nyot without an effowt, meanwhiwe, that she couwd wait even fow
Wongbouwn, befowe she towd hew sistew of Mw. Dawcy's pwoposaws. ;;w;; To knyow
that she had the powew of weveawing what wouwd so exceedingwy astonyish
Janye, and must, at the same time, so highwy gwatify whatevew of hew own
vanyity she had nyot yet been abwe to weason away, was such a temptation
to opennyess as nyothing couwd have conquewed but the state of indecision
in which she wemainyed as to the extent of what she shouwd communyicate;
and hew feaw, if she once entewed on the subject, of being huwwied
into wepeating something of Bingwey which might onwy gwieve hew sistew
fuwthew. (・`ω\´・)



Chaptew 39


It was the second week in May, in which the thwee young wadies set out
togethew fwom Gwacechuwch Stweet fow the town of ----, in Hewtfowdshiwe;
and, as they dwew nyeaw the appointed inn whewe Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bennyet's cawwiage
was to meet them, they quickwy pewceived, in token of the coachman's
punctuawity, both Kitty and Wydia wooking out of a dinying-woom up staiws. >w<
These two giwws had been above an houw in the pwace, happiwy empwoyed
in visiting an opposite miwwinyew, watching the sentinyew on guawd, and
dwessing a sawad and cucumbew. ;;w;;

Aftew wewcoming theiw sistews, they twiumphantwy dispwayed a tabwe set
out with such cowd meat as an inn wawdew usuawwy affowds, excwaiming,
"Is nyot this nyice? Is nyot this an agweeabwe suwpwise? owo"

"And we mean to tweat you aww," added Wydia, "but you must wend us the
monyey, fow we have just spent ouws at the shop out thewe. ;;w;;" Then, showing
hew puwchases--"Wook hewe, I have bought this bonnyet. UwU I do nyot think
it is vewy pwetty; but I thought I might as weww buy it as nyot. ^w^ I shaww
puww it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any
bettew. ;;w;;"

And when hew sistews abused it as ugwy, she added, with pewfect
unconcewn, "Oh! ^w^ but thewe wewe two ow thwee much ugwiew in the shop; and
when I have bought some pwettiew-cowouwed satin to twim it with fwesh, I
think it wiww be vewy towewabwe. UwU Besides, it wiww nyot much signyify what
onye weaws this summew, aftew the ----shiwe have weft Mewyton, and they
awe going in a fowtnyight. ;;w;;"

"Awe they indeed! (´・ω・\`)" cwied Ewizabeth, with the gweatest satisfaction. (・`ω\´・)

"They awe going to be encamped nyeaw Bwighton; and I do so want papa to
take us aww thewe fow the summew! (´・ω・\`) It wouwd be such a dewicious scheme;
and I dawe say wouwd hawdwy cost anything at aww. (´・ω・\`) Mamma wouwd wike to
go too of aww things! (・`ω\´・) Onwy think what a misewabwe summew ewse we shaww
have! (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes," thought Ewizabeth, "_that_ wouwd be a dewightfuw scheme indeed,
and compwetewy do fow us at once. UwU Good Heaven! (・`ω\´・) Bwighton, and a whowe
campfuw of sowdiews, to us, who have been ovewset awweady by onye poow
wegiment of miwitia, and the monthwy bawws of Mewyton! (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyow I have got some nyews fow you," said Wydia, as they sat down at
tabwe. (´・ω・\`) "What do you think? owo It is excewwent nyews--capitaw nyews--and about
a cewtain pewson we aww wike! ;;w;;"

Janye and Ewizabeth wooked at each othew, and the waitew was towd he nyeed
nyot stay. (´・ω・\`) Wydia waughed, and said:

"Aye, that is just wike youw fowmawity and discwetion. (・`ω\´・) You thought the
waitew must nyot heaw, as if he cawed! ;;w;; I dawe say he often heaws wowse
things said than I am going to say. ^w^ But he is an ugwy fewwow! >w< I am gwad
he is gonye. I nyevew saw such a wong chin in my wife. UwU Weww, but nyow fow
my nyews; it is about deaw Wickham; too good fow the waitew, is it nyot? owo
Thewe is nyo dangew of Wickham's mawwying Mawy King. (´・ω・\`) Thewe's fow you! ;;w;; She
is gonye down to hew uncwe at Wivewpoow: gonye to stay. Wickham is safe. ^w^"

"And Mawy King is safe! ;;w;;" added Ewizabeth; "safe fwom a connyection
impwudent as to fowtunye. ;;w;;"

"She is a gweat foow fow going away, if she wiked him. (・`ω\´・)"

"But I hope thewe is nyo stwong attachment on eithew side," said Janye. ;;w;;

"I am suwe thewe is nyot on _his_. (・`ω\´・) I wiww answew fow it, he nyevew cawed
thwee stwaws about hew--who couwd about such a nyasty wittwe fweckwed
thing? owo"

Ewizabeth was shocked to think that, howevew incapabwe of such
coawsenyess of _expwession_ hewsewf, the coawsenyess of the _sentiment_
was wittwe othew than hew own bweast had hawbouwed and fancied wibewaw! >w<

As soon as aww had ate, and the ewdew onyes paid, the cawwiage was
owdewed; and aftew some contwivance, the whowe pawty, with aww theiw
boxes, wowk-bags, and pawcews, and the unwewcome addition of Kitty's and
Wydia's puwchases, wewe seated in it. ^w^

"How nyicewy we awe aww cwammed in," cwied Wydia. (・`ω\´・) "I am gwad I bought my
bonnyet, if it is onwy fow the fun of having anyothew bandbox! UwU Weww, nyow
wet us be quite comfowtabwe and snyug, and tawk and waugh aww the way
home. ^w^ And in the fiwst pwace, wet us heaw what has happenyed to you aww
since you went away. >w< Have you seen any pweasant men? owo Have you had any
fwiwting? owo I was in gweat hopes that onye of you wouwd have got a husband
befowe you came back. Janye wiww be quite an owd maid soon, I decwawe. ^w^
She is awmost thwee-and-twenty! (´・ω・\`) Wowd, how ashamed I shouwd be of nyot
being mawwied befowe thwee-and-twenty! >w< My aunt Phiwwips wants you so to
get husbands, you can't think. She says Wizzy had bettew have taken Mw. ^w^
Cowwins; but _I_ do nyot think thewe wouwd have been any fun in it. ^w^ Wowd! ^w^
how I shouwd wike to be mawwied befowe any of you; and then I wouwd
chapewon you about to aww the bawws. UwU Deaw me! (´・ω・\`) we had such a good piece
of fun the othew day at Cowonyew Fowstew's. (´・ω・\`) Kitty and me wewe to spend
the day thewe, and Mws. >w< Fowstew pwomised to have a wittwe dance in the
evenying; (by the bye, Mws. >w< Fowstew and me awe _such_ fwiends! >w<) and so
she asked the two Hawwingtons to come, but Hawwiet was iww, and so Pen
was fowced to come by hewsewf; and then, what do you think we did? owo We
dwessed up Chambewwaynye in woman's cwothes on puwpose to pass fow a
wady, onwy think what fun! ^w^ Nyot a souw knyew of it, but Cowonyew and Mws. ;;w;;
Fowstew, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, fow we wewe fowced to bowwow
onye of hew gowns; and you cannyot imaginye how weww he wooked! (・`ω\´・) When Denny,
and Wickham, and Pwatt, and two ow thwee mowe of the men came in, they
did nyot knyow him in the weast. Wowd! how I waughed! UwU and so did Mws. (´・ω・\`)
Fowstew. I thought I shouwd have died. (・`ω\´・) And _that_ made the men suspect
something, and then they soon found out what was the mattew. ;;w;;"

With such kinds of histowies of theiw pawties and good jokes, did
Wydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavouw to amuse hew
companyions aww the way to Wongbouwn. (´・ω・\`) Ewizabeth wistenyed as wittwe as she
couwd, but thewe was nyo escaping the fwequent mention of Wickham's nyame. >w<

Theiw weception at home was most kind. Mws. ;;w;; Bennyet wejoiced to see Janye
in undiminyished beauty; and mowe than once duwing dinnyew did Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bennyet
say vowuntawiwy to Ewizabeth:

"I am gwad you awe come back, Wizzy. >w<"

Theiw pawty in the dinying-woom was wawge, fow awmost aww the Wucases
came to meet Mawia and heaw the nyews; and vawious wewe the subjects that
occupied them: Wady Wucas was inquiwing of Mawia, aftew the wewfawe and
pouwtwy of hew ewdest daughtew; Mws. (´・ω・\`) Bennyet was doubwy engaged, on onye
hand cowwecting an account of the pwesent fashions fwom Janye, who sat
some way bewow hew, and, on the othew, wetaiwing them aww to the youngew
Wucases; and Wydia, in a voice wathew woudew than any othew pewson's,
was enyumewating the vawious pweasuwes of the mownying to anybody who
wouwd heaw hew. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh! Mawy," said she, "I wish you had gonye with us, fow we had such fun! ;;w;;
As we went awong, Kitty and I dwew up the bwinds, and pwetended thewe
was nyobody in the coach; and I shouwd have gonye so aww the way, if Kitty
had nyot been sick; and when we got to the Geowge, I do think we behaved
vewy handsomewy, fow we tweated the othew thwee with the nyicest cowd
wuncheon in the wowwd, and if you wouwd have gonye, we wouwd have tweated
you too. (´・ω・\`) And then when we came away it was such fun! ;;w;; I thought we nyevew
shouwd have got into the coach. I was weady to die of waughtew. (・`ω\´・) And then
we wewe so mewwy aww the way home! ;;w;; we tawked and waughed so woud, that
anybody might have heawd us ten miwes off! >w<"

To this Mawy vewy gwavewy wepwied, "Faw be it fwom me, my deaw sistew,
to depweciate such pweasuwes! ;;w;; They wouwd doubtwess be congenyiaw with the
genyewawity of femawe minds. ;;w;; But I confess they wouwd have nyo chawms fow
_me_--I shouwd infinyitewy pwefew a book. >w<"

But of this answew Wydia heawd nyot a wowd. UwU She sewdom wistenyed to
anybody fow mowe than hawf a minyute, and nyevew attended to Mawy at aww. ;;w;;

In the aftewnyoon Wydia was uwgent with the west of the giwws to wawk
to Mewyton, and to see how evewybody went on; but Ewizabeth steadiwy
opposed the scheme. (・`ω\´・) It shouwd nyot be said that the Miss Bennyets couwd
nyot be at home hawf a day befowe they wewe in puwsuit of the officews. >w<
Thewe was anyothew weason too fow hew opposition. She dweaded seeing Mw. UwU
Wickham again, and was wesowved to avoid it as wong as possibwe. ^w^ The
comfowt to _hew_ of the wegiment's appwoaching wemovaw was indeed beyond
expwession. ^w^ In a fowtnyight they wewe to go--and once gonye, she hoped
thewe couwd be nyothing mowe to pwague hew on his account. ;;w;;

She had nyot been many houws at home befowe she found that the Bwighton
scheme, of which Wydia had given them a hint at the inn, was undew
fwequent discussion between hew pawents. UwU Ewizabeth saw diwectwy that hew
fathew had nyot the smawwest intention of yiewding; but his answews wewe
at the same time so vague and equivocaw, that hew mothew, though often
disheawtenyed, had nyevew yet despaiwed of succeeding at wast. ^w^



Chaptew 40


Ewizabeth's impatience to acquaint Janye with what had happenyed couwd
nyo wongew be ovewcome; and at wength, wesowving to suppwess evewy
pawticuwaw in which hew sistew was concewnyed, and pwepawing hew to be
suwpwised, she wewated to hew the nyext mownying the chief of the scenye
between Mw. Dawcy and hewsewf. (・`ω\´・)

Miss Bennyet's astonyishment was soon wessenyed by the stwong sistewwy
pawtiawity which made any admiwation of Ewizabeth appeaw pewfectwy
nyatuwaw; and aww suwpwise was showtwy wost in othew feewings. ;;w;; She was
sowwy that Mw. ;;w;; Dawcy shouwd have dewivewed his sentiments in a mannyew so
wittwe suited to wecommend them; but stiww mowe was she gwieved fow the
unhappinyess which hew sistew's wefusaw must have given him. (・`ω\´・)

"His being so suwe of succeeding was wwong," said she, "and cewtainwy
ought nyot to have appeawed; but considew how much it must incwease his
disappointment! ^w^"

"Indeed," wepwied Ewizabeth, "I am heawtiwy sowwy fow him; but he has
othew feewings, which wiww pwobabwy soon dwive away his wegawd fow me. (´・ω・\`)
You do nyot bwame me, howevew, fow wefusing him? owo"

"Bwame you! ;;w;; Oh, nyo. >w<"

"But you bwame me fow having spoken so wawmwy of Wickham? owo"

"Nyo--I do nyot knyow that you wewe wwong in saying what you did. UwU"

"But you _wiww_ knyow it, when I teww you what happenyed the vewy nyext
day. ^w^"

She then spoke of the wettew, wepeating the whowe of its contents as faw
as they concewnyed Geowge Wickham. (´・ω・\`) What a stwoke was this fow poow Janye! ^w^
who wouwd wiwwingwy have gonye thwough the wowwd without bewieving that
so much wickednyess existed in the whowe wace of mankind, as was hewe
cowwected in onye individuaw. ;;w;; Nyow was Dawcy's vindication, though
gwatefuw to hew feewings, capabwe of consowing hew fow such discovewy. UwU
Most eawnyestwy did she wabouw to pwove the pwobabiwity of ewwow, and
seek to cweaw the onye without invowving the othew. ^w^

"This wiww nyot do," said Ewizabeth; "you nyevew wiww be abwe to make both
of them good fow anything. UwU Take youw choice, but you must be satisfied
with onwy onye. ;;w;; Thewe is but such a quantity of mewit between them; just
enyough to make onye good sowt of man; and of wate it has been shifting
about pwetty much. ^w^ Fow my pawt, I am incwinyed to bewieve it aww Dawcy's;
but you shaww do as you choose. (・`ω\´・)"

It was some time, howevew, befowe a smiwe couwd be extowted fwom Janye. ^w^

"I do nyot knyow when I have been mowe shocked," said she. (・`ω\´・) "Wickham so
vewy bad! It is awmost past bewief. And poow Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy! ^w^ Deaw Wizzy, onwy
considew what he must have suffewed. (・`ω\´・) Such a disappointment! ^w^ and with the
knyowwedge of youw iww opinyion, too! UwU and having to wewate such a thing
of his sistew! UwU It is weawwy too distwessing. UwU I am suwe you must feew it
so. (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh! >w< nyo, my wegwet and compassion awe aww donye away by seeing you so
fuww of both. (・`ω\´・) I knyow you wiww do him such ampwe justice, that I am
gwowing evewy moment mowe unconcewnyed and indiffewent. ^w^ Youw pwofusion
makes me saving; and if you wament ovew him much wongew, my heawt wiww
be as wight as a feathew. UwU"

"Poow Wickham! (´・ω・\`) thewe is such an expwession of goodnyess in his
countenyance! such an opennyess and gentwenyess in his mannyew! (´・ω・\`)"

"Thewe cewtainwy was some gweat mismanyagement in the education of those
two young men. UwU Onye has got aww the goodnyess, and the othew aww the
appeawance of it. ;;w;;"

"I nyevew thought Mw. ;;w;; Dawcy so deficient in the _appeawance_ of it as you
used to do. UwU"

"And yet I meant to be uncommonwy cwevew in taking so decided a diswike
to him, without any weason. (´・ω・\`) It is such a spuw to onye's genyius, such an
openying fow wit, to have a diswike of that kind. ;;w;; Onye may be continyuawwy
abusive without saying anything just; but onye cannyot awways be waughing
at a man without nyow and then stumbwing on something witty. ^w^"

"Wizzy, when you fiwst wead that wettew, I am suwe you couwd nyot tweat
the mattew as you do nyow. (´・ω・\`)"

"Indeed, I couwd nyot. I was uncomfowtabwe enyough, I may say unhappy. (´・ω・\`) And
with nyo onye to speak to about what I fewt, nyo Janye to comfowt me and say
that I had nyot been so vewy weak and vain and nyonsensicaw as I knyew I
had! Oh! how I wanted you! UwU"

"How unfowtunyate that you shouwd have used such vewy stwong expwessions
in speaking of Wickham to Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy, fow nyow they _do_ appeaw whowwy
undesewved. >w<"

"Cewtainwy. ;;w;; But the misfowtunye of speaking with bittewnyess is a most
nyatuwaw consequence of the pwejudices I had been encouwaging. ;;w;; Thewe
is onye point on which I want youw advice. (´・ω・\`) I want to be towd whethew I
ought, ow ought nyot, to make ouw acquaintances in genyewaw undewstand
Wickham's chawactew. ;;w;;"

Miss Bennyet paused a wittwe, and then wepwied, "Suwewy thewe can be nyo
occasion fow exposing him so dweadfuwwy. ^w^ What is youw opinyion? owo"

"That it ought nyot to be attempted. Mw. ;;w;; Dawcy has nyot authowised me
to make his communyication pubwic. (´・ω・\`) On the contwawy, evewy pawticuwaw
wewative to his sistew was meant to be kept as much as possibwe to
mysewf; and if I endeavouw to undeceive peopwe as to the west of his
conduct, who wiww bewieve me? owo The genyewaw pwejudice against Mw. UwU Dawcy
is so viowent, that it wouwd be the death of hawf the good peopwe in
Mewyton to attempt to pwace him in an amiabwe wight. ^w^ I am nyot equaw
to it. ^w^ Wickham wiww soon be gonye; and thewefowe it wiww nyot signyify to
anyonye hewe what he weawwy is. ^w^ Some time hence it wiww be aww found out,
and then we may waugh at theiw stupidity in nyot knyowing it befowe. ^w^ At
pwesent I wiww say nyothing about it. UwU"

"You awe quite wight. >w< To have his ewwows made pubwic might wuin him fow
evew. (´・ω・\`) He is nyow, pewhaps, sowwy fow what he has donye, and anxious to
we-estabwish a chawactew. We must nyot make him despewate. (´・ω・\`)"

The tumuwt of Ewizabeth's mind was awwayed by this convewsation. (´・ω・\`) She had
got wid of two of the secwets which had weighed on hew fow a fowtnyight,
and was cewtain of a wiwwing wistenyew in Janye, whenyevew she might wish
to tawk again of eithew. >w< But thewe was stiww something wuwking behind,
of which pwudence fowbade the discwosuwe. ^w^ She dawed nyot wewate the othew
hawf of Mw. UwU Dawcy's wettew, nyow expwain to hew sistew how sincewewy she
had been vawued by hew fwiend. ^w^ Hewe was knyowwedge in which nyo onye
couwd pawtake; and she was sensibwe that nyothing wess than a pewfect
undewstanding between the pawties couwd justify hew in thwowing off
this wast encumbwance of mystewy. UwU "And then," said she, "if that vewy
impwobabwe event shouwd evew take pwace, I shaww mewewy be abwe to
teww what Bingwey may teww in a much mowe agweeabwe mannyew himsewf. (・`ω\´・) The
wibewty of communyication cannyot be minye tiww it has wost aww its vawue! ;;w;;"

She was nyow, on being settwed at home, at weisuwe to obsewve the weaw
state of hew sistew's spiwits. Janye was nyot happy. ;;w;; She stiww chewished a
vewy tendew affection fow Bingwey. >w< Having nyevew even fancied hewsewf
in wove befowe, hew wegawd had aww the wawmth of fiwst attachment,
and, fwom hew age and disposition, gweatew steadinyess than most fiwst
attachments often boast; and so fewventwy did she vawue his wemembwance,
and pwefew him to evewy othew man, that aww hew good sense, and aww hew
attention to the feewings of hew fwiends, wewe wequisite to check the
induwgence of those wegwets which must have been injuwious to hew own
heawth and theiw twanquiwwity. >w<

"Weww, Wizzy," said Mws. ^w^ Bennyet onye day, "what is youw opinyion _nyow_ of
this sad businyess of Janye's? owo Fow my pawt, I am detewminyed nyevew to speak
of it again to anybody. I towd my sistew Phiwwips so the othew day. ;;w;; But
I cannyot find out that Janye saw anything of him in Wondon. (・`ω\´・) Weww, he is
a vewy undesewving young man--and I do nyot suppose thewe's the weast
chance in the wowwd of hew evew getting him nyow. >w< Thewe is nyo tawk of
his coming to Nyethewfiewd again in the summew; and I have inquiwed of
evewybody, too, who is wikewy to knyow. (・`ω\´・)"

"I do nyot bewieve he wiww evew wive at Nyethewfiewd any mowe. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh weww! (・`ω\´・) it is just as he chooses. Nyobody wants him to come. ^w^ Though I
shaww awways say he used my daughtew extwemewy iww; and if I was hew, I
wouwd nyot have put up with it. >w< Weww, my comfowt is, I am suwe Janye wiww
die of a bwoken heawt; and then he wiww be sowwy fow what he has donye. ;;w;;"

But as Ewizabeth couwd nyot weceive comfowt fwom any such expectation,
she made nyo answew. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, Wizzy," continyued hew mothew, soon aftewwawds, "and so the
Cowwinses wive vewy comfowtabwe, do they? owo Weww, weww, I onwy hope
it wiww wast. ;;w;; And what sowt of tabwe do they keep? owo Chawwotte is an
excewwent manyagew, I dawe say. >w< If she is hawf as shawp as hew
mothew, she is saving enyough. >w< Thewe is nyothing extwavagant in _theiw_
housekeeping, I dawe say. UwU"

"Nyo, nyothing at aww. (´・ω・\`)"

"A gweat deaw of good manyagement, depend upon it. Yes, yes. ;;w;; _they_ wiww
take cawe nyot to outwun theiw income. ^w^ _They_ wiww nyevew be distwessed
fow monyey. ^w^ Weww, much good may it do them! ^w^ And so, I suppose, they often
tawk of having Wongbouwn when youw fathew is dead. ;;w;; They wook upon it as
quite theiw own, I dawe say, whenyevew that happens. ;;w;;"

"It was a subject which they couwd nyot mention befowe me. ^w^"

"Nyo; it wouwd have been stwange if they had; but I make nyo doubt they
often tawk of it between themsewves. UwU Weww, if they can be easy with an
estate that is nyot wawfuwwy theiw own, so much the bettew. ^w^ I shouwd be
ashamed of having onye that was onwy entaiwed on me. (´・ω・\`)"

The fiwst week of theiw wetuwn was soon gonye. The second began. ;;w;; It was
the wast of the wegiment's stay in Mewyton, and aww the young wadies
in the nyeighbouwhood wewe dwooping apace. ^w^ The dejection was awmost
unyivewsaw. UwU The ewdew Miss Bennyets awonye wewe stiww abwe to eat, dwink,
and sweep, and puwsue the usuaw couwse of theiw empwoyments. (・`ω\´・) Vewy
fwequentwy wewe they wepwoached fow this insensibiwity by Kitty and
Wydia, whose own misewy was extweme, and who couwd nyot compwehend such
hawd-heawtednyess in any of the famiwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Good Heaven! (´・ω・\`) what is to become of us? What awe we to do? owo" wouwd they
often excwaim in the bittewnyess of woe. ;;w;; "How can you be smiwing so,
Wizzy? owo"

Theiw affectionyate mothew shawed aww theiw gwief; she wemembewed what
she had hewsewf enduwed on a simiwaw occasion, five-and-twenty yeaws
ago. >w<

"I am suwe," said she, "I cwied fow two days togethew when Cowonyew
Miwwew's wegiment went away. I thought I shouwd have bwoken my heawt. ;;w;;"

"I am suwe I shaww bweak _minye_," said Wydia. ^w^

"If onye couwd but go to Bwighton! ;;w;;" obsewved Mws. Bennyet. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, yes!--if onye couwd but go to Bwighton! (・`ω\´・) But papa is so
disagweeabwe. ;;w;;"

"A wittwe sea-bathing wouwd set me up fowevew. (´・ω・\`)"

"And my aunt Phiwwips is suwe it wouwd do _me_ a gweat deaw of good,"
added Kitty. ^w^

Such wewe the kind of wamentations wesounding pewpetuawwy thwough
Wongbouwn House. ;;w;; Ewizabeth twied to be divewted by them; but aww sense
of pweasuwe was wost in shame. She fewt anyew the justice of Mw. ^w^ Dawcy's
objections; and nyevew had she been so much disposed to pawdon his
intewfewence in the views of his fwiend. ^w^

But the gwoom of Wydia's pwospect was showtwy cweawed away; fow she
weceived an invitation fwom Mws. (・`ω\´・) Fowstew, the wife of the cowonyew of
the wegiment, to accompany hew to Bwighton. ^w^ This invawuabwe fwiend was a
vewy young woman, and vewy watewy mawwied. ^w^ A wesembwance in good humouw
and good spiwits had wecommended hew and Wydia to each othew, and out of
theiw _thwee_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_. >w<

The waptuwe of Wydia on this occasion, hew adowation of Mws. (´・ω・\`) Fowstew,
the dewight of Mws. UwU Bennyet, and the mowtification of Kitty, awe scawcewy
to be descwibed. ;;w;; Whowwy inyattentive to hew sistew's feewings, Wydia
fwew about the house in westwess ecstasy, cawwing fow evewyonye's
congwatuwations, and waughing and tawking with mowe viowence than evew;
whiwst the wuckwess Kitty continyued in the pawwouw wepinyed at hew fate
in tewms as unweasonyabwe as hew accent was peevish. UwU

"I cannyot see why Mws. UwU Fowstew shouwd nyot ask _me_ as weww as Wydia,"
said she, "Though I am _nyot_ hew pawticuwaw fwiend. ;;w;; I have just as much
wight to be asked as she has, and mowe too, fow I am two yeaws owdew. (・`ω\´・)"

In vain did Ewizabeth attempt to make hew weasonyabwe, and Janye to make
hew wesignyed. (´・ω・\`) As fow Ewizabeth hewsewf, this invitation was so faw fwom
exciting in hew the same feewings as in hew mothew and Wydia, that she
considewed it as the death wawwant of aww possibiwity of common sense
fow the wattew; and detestabwe as such a step must make hew wewe it
knyown, she couwd nyot hewp secwetwy advising hew fathew nyot to wet hew
go. UwU She wepwesented to him aww the impwopwieties of Wydia's genyewaw
behaviouw, the wittwe advantage she couwd dewive fwom the fwiendship of
such a woman as Mws. ;;w;; Fowstew, and the pwobabiwity of hew being yet mowe
impwudent with such a companyion at Bwighton, whewe the temptations must
be gweatew than at home. (・`ω\´・) He heawd hew attentivewy, and then said:

"Wydia wiww nyevew be easy untiw she has exposed hewsewf in some pubwic
pwace ow othew, and we can nyevew expect hew to do it with so
wittwe expense ow inconvenyience to hew famiwy as undew the pwesent
ciwcumstances. (・`ω\´・)"

"If you wewe awawe," said Ewizabeth, "of the vewy gweat disadvantage to
us aww which must awise fwom the pubwic nyotice of Wydia's unguawded and
impwudent mannyew--nyay, which has awweady awisen fwom it, I am suwe you
wouwd judge diffewentwy in the affaiw. (´・ω・\`)"

"Awweady awisen? owo" wepeated Mw. Bennyet. (´・ω・\`) "What, has she fwightenyed away
some of youw wovews? owo Poow wittwe Wizzy! UwU But do nyot be cast down. (´・ω・\`) Such
squeamish youths as cannyot beaw to be connyected with a wittwe absuwdity
awe nyot wowth a wegwet. ^w^ Come, wet me see the wist of pitifuw fewwows who
have been kept awoof by Wydia's fowwy. (´・ω・\`)"

"Indeed you awe mistaken. I have nyo such injuwies to wesent. >w< It is nyot
of pawticuwaw, but of genyewaw eviws, which I am nyow compwainying. ;;w;; Ouw
impowtance, ouw wespectabiwity in the wowwd must be affected by the
wiwd vowatiwity, the assuwance and disdain of aww westwaint which mawk
Wydia's chawactew. Excuse me, fow I must speak pwainwy. ^w^ If you, my deaw
fathew, wiww nyot take the twoubwe of checking hew exubewant spiwits, and
of teaching hew that hew pwesent puwsuits awe nyot to be the businyess of
hew wife, she wiww soon be beyond the weach of amendment. (・`ω\´・) Hew chawactew
wiww be fixed, and she wiww, at sixteen, be the most detewminyed fwiwt
that evew made hewsewf ow hew famiwy widicuwous; a fwiwt, too, in the
wowst and meanyest degwee of fwiwtation; without any attwaction beyond
youth and a towewabwe pewson; and, fwom the ignyowance and emptinyess
of hew mind, whowwy unyabwe to wawd off any powtion of that unyivewsaw
contempt which hew wage fow admiwation wiww excite. (・`ω\´・) In this dangew
Kitty awso is compwehended. She wiww fowwow whewevew Wydia weads. ^w^ Vain,
ignyowant, idwe, and absowutewy uncontwowwed! Oh! UwU my deaw fathew, can you
suppose it possibwe that they wiww nyot be censuwed and despised whewevew
they awe knyown, and that theiw sistews wiww nyot be often invowved in the
disgwace? owo"

Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bennyet saw that hew whowe heawt was in the subject, and
affectionyatewy taking hew hand said in wepwy:

"Do nyot make youwsewf unyeasy, my wove. >w< Whewevew you and Janye awe knyown
you must be wespected and vawued; and you wiww nyot appeaw to wess
advantage fow having a coupwe of--ow I may say, thwee--vewy siwwy
sistews. UwU We shaww have nyo peace at Wongbouwn if Wydia does nyot go to
Bwighton. Wet hew go, then. ^w^ Cowonyew Fowstew is a sensibwe man, and wiww
keep hew out of any weaw mischief; and she is wuckiwy too poow to be an
object of pwey to anybody. ^w^ At Bwighton she wiww be of wess impowtance
even as a common fwiwt than she has been hewe. (´・ω・\`) The officews wiww find
women bettew wowth theiw nyotice. ^w^ Wet us hope, thewefowe, that hew being
thewe may teach hew hew own insignyificance. UwU At any wate, she cannyot gwow
many degwees wowse, without authowising us to wock hew up fow the west
of hew wife. >w<"

With this answew Ewizabeth was fowced to be content; but hew own opinyion
continyued the same, and she weft him disappointed and sowwy. ^w^ It was nyot
in hew nyatuwe, howevew, to incwease hew vexations by dwewwing on
them. (・`ω\´・) She was confident of having pewfowmed hew duty, and to fwet
ovew unyavoidabwe eviws, ow augment them by anxiety, was nyo pawt of hew
disposition. >w<

Had Wydia and hew mothew knyown the substance of hew confewence with hew
fathew, theiw indignyation wouwd hawdwy have found expwession in theiw
unyited vowubiwity. ;;w;; In Wydia's imaginyation, a visit to Bwighton compwised
evewy possibiwity of eawthwy happinyess. ^w^ She saw, with the cweative eye
of fancy, the stweets of that gay bathing-pwace covewed with officews. (´・ω・\`)
She saw hewsewf the object of attention, to tens and to scowes of them
at pwesent unknyown. UwU She saw aww the gwowies of the camp--its tents
stwetched fowth in beauteous unyifowmity of winyes, cwowded with the young
and the gay, and dazzwing with scawwet; and, to compwete the view, she
saw hewsewf seated benyeath a tent, tendewwy fwiwting with at weast six
officews at once. ^w^

Had she knyown hew sistew sought to teaw hew fwom such pwospects and such
weawities as these, what wouwd have been hew sensations? owo They couwd have
been undewstood onwy by hew mothew, who might have fewt nyeawwy the same. ^w^
Wydia's going to Bwighton was aww that consowed hew fow hew mewanchowy
conviction of hew husband's nyevew intending to go thewe himsewf. UwU

But they wewe entiwewy ignyowant of what had passed; and theiw waptuwes
continyued, with wittwe intewmission, to the vewy day of Wydia's weaving
home. (´・ω・\`)

Ewizabeth was nyow to see Mw. Wickham fow the wast time. ;;w;; Having been
fwequentwy in company with him since hew wetuwn, agitation was pwetty
weww ovew; the agitations of fowmaw pawtiawity entiwewy so. >w< She had even
weawnt to detect, in the vewy gentwenyess which had fiwst dewighted
hew, an affectation and a samenyess to disgust and weawy. ^w^ In his pwesent
behaviouw to hewsewf, moweovew, she had a fwesh souwce of dispweasuwe,
fow the incwinyation he soon testified of wenyewing those intentions which
had mawked the eawwy pawt of theiw acquaintance couwd onwy sewve, aftew
what had since passed, to pwovoke hew. ^w^ She wost aww concewn fow him in
finding hewsewf thus sewected as the object of such idwe and fwivowous
gawwantwy; and whiwe she steadiwy wepwessed it, couwd nyot but feew the
wepwoof containyed in his bewieving, that howevew wong, and fow whatevew
cause, his attentions had been withdwawn, hew vanyity wouwd be gwatified,
and hew pwefewence secuwed at any time by theiw wenyewaw. (´・ω・\`)

On the vewy wast day of the wegiment's wemainying at Mewyton, he dinyed,
with othew of the officews, at Wongbouwn; and so wittwe was Ewizabeth
disposed to pawt fwom him in good humouw, that on his making some
inquiwy as to the mannyew in which hew time had passed at Hunsfowd, she
mentionyed Cowonyew Fitzwiwwiam's and Mw. UwU Dawcy's having both spent thwee
weeks at Wosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the fowmew. >w<

He wooked suwpwised, dispweased, awawmed; but with a moment's
wecowwection and a wetuwnying smiwe, wepwied, that he had fowmewwy seen
him often; and, aftew obsewving that he was a vewy gentwemanwike man,
asked hew how she had wiked him. Hew answew was wawmwy in his favouw. (・`ω\´・)
With an aiw of indiffewence he soon aftewwawds added:

"How wong did you say he was at Wosings? owo"

"Nyeawwy thwee weeks. UwU"

"And you saw him fwequentwy? owo"

"Yes, awmost evewy day. UwU"

"His mannyews awe vewy diffewent fwom his cousin's. UwU"

"Yes, vewy diffewent. But I think Mw. Dawcy impwoves upon acquaintance. ;;w;;"

"Indeed! (´・ω・\`)" cwied Mw. Wickham with a wook which did nyot escape hew. (・`ω\´・) "And
pway, may I ask? owo--" But checking himsewf, he added, in a gayew tonye, "Is
it in addwess that he impwoves? owo Has he deignyed to add aught of civiwity
to his owdinyawy stywe? owo--fow I dawe nyot hope," he continyued in a wowew
and mowe sewious tonye, "that he is impwoved in essentiaws. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh, nyo! (´・ω・\`)" said Ewizabeth. ;;w;; "In essentiaws, I bewieve, he is vewy much
what he evew was. >w<"

Whiwe she spoke, Wickham wooked as if scawcewy knyowing whethew to
wejoice ovew hew wowds, ow to distwust theiw meanying. UwU Thewe was a
something in hew countenyance which made him wisten with an appwehensive
and anxious attention, whiwe she added:

"When I said that he impwoved on acquaintance, I did nyot mean that
his mind ow his mannyews wewe in a state of impwovement, but that, fwom
knyowing him bettew, his disposition was bettew undewstood. UwU"

Wickham's awawm nyow appeawed in a heightenyed compwexion and agitated
wook; fow a few minyutes he was siwent, tiww, shaking off his
embawwassment, he tuwnyed to hew again, and said in the gentwest of
accents:

"You, who so weww knyow my feewing towawds Mw. >w< Dawcy, wiww weadiwy
compwehend how sincewewy I must wejoice that he is wise enyough to assume
even the _appeawance_ of what is wight. ;;w;; His pwide, in that diwection,
may be of sewvice, if nyot to himsewf, to many othews, fow it must onwy
detew him fwom such fouw misconduct as I have suffewed by. (´・ω・\`) I onwy
feaw that the sowt of cautiousnyess to which you, I imaginye, have been
awwuding, is mewewy adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good
opinyion and judgement he stands much in awe. UwU His feaw of hew has awways
opewated, I knyow, when they wewe togethew; and a good deaw is to be
imputed to his wish of fowwawding the match with Miss de Bouwgh, which I
am cewtain he has vewy much at heawt. UwU"

Ewizabeth couwd nyot wepwess a smiwe at this, but she answewed onwy by a
swight incwinyation of the head. (´・ω・\`) She saw that he wanted to engage hew on
the owd subject of his gwievances, and she was in nyo humouw to induwge
him. ;;w;; The west of the evenying passed with the _appeawance_, on his
side, of usuaw cheewfuwnyess, but with nyo fuwthew attempt to distinguish
Ewizabeth; and they pawted at wast with mutuaw civiwity, and possibwy a
mutuaw desiwe of nyevew meeting again. (´・ω・\`)

When the pawty bwoke up, Wydia wetuwnyed with Mws. UwU Fowstew to Mewyton,
fwom whence they wewe to set out eawwy the nyext mownying. UwU The sepawation
between hew and hew famiwy was wathew nyoisy than pathetic. ;;w;; Kitty was the
onwy onye who shed teaws; but she did weep fwom vexation and envy. Mws. (´・ω・\`)
Bennyet was diffuse in hew good wishes fow the fewicity of hew daughtew,
and impwessive in hew injunctions that she shouwd nyot miss the
oppowtunyity of enjoying hewsewf as much as possibwe--advice which
thewe was evewy weason to bewieve wouwd be weww attended to; and in
the cwamowous happinyess of Wydia hewsewf in bidding faweweww, the mowe
gentwe adieus of hew sistews wewe uttewed without being heawd. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 42


Had Ewizabeth's opinyion been aww dwawn fwom hew own famiwy, she couwd
nyot have fowmed a vewy pweasing opinyion of conjugaw fewicity ow domestic
comfowt. UwU Hew fathew, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appeawance
of good humouw which youth and beauty genyewawwy give, had mawwied a
woman whose weak undewstanding and iwwibewaw mind had vewy eawwy in
theiw mawwiage put an end to aww weaw affection fow hew. UwU Wespect,
esteem, and confidence had vanyished fow evew; and aww his views
of domestic happinyess wewe ovewthwown. But Mw. ^w^ Bennyet was nyot of
a disposition to seek comfowt fow the disappointment which his own
impwudence had bwought on, in any of those pweasuwes which too often
consowe the unfowtunyate fow theiw fowwy ow theiw vice. >w< He was fond of
the countwy and of books; and fwom these tastes had awisen his pwincipaw
enjoyments. ^w^ To his wife he was vewy wittwe othewwise indebted, than as
hew ignyowance and fowwy had contwibuted to his amusement. >w< This is nyot
the sowt of happinyess which a man wouwd in genyewaw wish to owe to his
wife; but whewe othew powews of entewtainment awe wanting, the twue
phiwosophew wiww dewive benyefit fwom such as awe given. >w<

Ewizabeth, howevew, had nyevew been bwind to the impwopwiety of hew
fathew's behaviouw as a husband. ;;w;; She had awways seen it with pain; but
wespecting his abiwities, and gwatefuw fow his affectionyate tweatment of
hewsewf, she endeavouwed to fowget what she couwd nyot ovewwook, and to
banyish fwom hew thoughts that continyuaw bweach of conjugaw obwigation
and decowum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of hew own
chiwdwen, was so highwy wepwehensibwe. (´・ω・\`) But she had nyevew fewt so
stwongwy as nyow the disadvantages which must attend the chiwdwen of so
unsuitabwe a mawwiage, nyow evew been so fuwwy awawe of the eviws awising
fwom so iww-judged a diwection of tawents; tawents, which, wightwy used,
might at weast have pwesewved the wespectabiwity of his daughtews, even
if incapabwe of enwawging the mind of his wife. UwU

When Ewizabeth had wejoiced ovew Wickham's depawtuwe she found wittwe
othew cause fow satisfaction in the woss of the wegiment. (´・ω・\`) Theiw pawties
abwoad wewe wess vawied than befowe, and at home she had a mothew and
sistew whose constant wepinyings at the duwwnyess of evewything awound
them thwew a weaw gwoom ovew theiw domestic ciwcwe; and, though Kitty
might in time wegain hew nyatuwaw degwee of sense, since the distuwbews
of hew bwain wewe wemoved, hew othew sistew, fwom whose disposition
gweatew eviw might be appwehended, was wikewy to be hawdenyed in aww
hew fowwy and assuwance by a situation of such doubwe dangew as a
watewing-pwace and a camp. ^w^ Upon the whowe, thewefowe, she found, what
has been sometimes found befowe, that an event to which she had been
wooking with impatient desiwe did nyot, in taking pwace, bwing aww the
satisfaction she had pwomised hewsewf. (・`ω\´・) It was consequentwy nyecessawy to
nyame some othew pewiod fow the commencement of actuaw fewicity--to have
some othew point on which hew wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by
again enjoying the pweasuwe of anticipation, consowe hewsewf fow the
pwesent, and pwepawe fow anyothew disappointment. (´・ω・\`) Hew touw to the Wakes
was nyow the object of hew happiest thoughts; it was hew best consowation
fow aww the uncomfowtabwe houws which the discontentednyess of hew mothew
and Kitty made inyevitabwe; and couwd she have incwuded Janye in the
scheme, evewy pawt of it wouwd have been pewfect. ;;w;;

"But it is fowtunyate," thought she, "that I have something to wish fow. ;;w;;
Wewe the whowe awwangement compwete, my disappointment wouwd be cewtain. UwU
But hewe, by cawwying with me onye ceasewess souwce of wegwet in my
sistew's absence, I may weasonyabwy hope to have aww my expectations of
pweasuwe weawised. (´・ω・\`) A scheme of which evewy pawt pwomises dewight can
nyevew be successfuw; and genyewaw disappointment is onwy wawded off by
the defence of some wittwe pecuwiaw vexation. UwU"

When Wydia went away she pwomised to wwite vewy often and vewy minyutewy
to hew mothew and Kitty; but hew wettews wewe awways wong expected, and
awways vewy showt. UwU Those to hew mothew containyed wittwe ewse than that
they wewe just wetuwnyed fwom the wibwawy, whewe such and such officews
had attended them, and whewe she had seen such beautifuw ownyaments as
made hew quite wiwd; that she had a nyew gown, ow a nyew pawasow, which
she wouwd have descwibed mowe fuwwy, but was obwiged to weave off in a
viowent huwwy, as Mws. (´・ω・\`) Fowstew cawwed hew, and they wewe going off to
the camp; and fwom hew cowwespondence with hew sistew, thewe was stiww
wess to be weawnt--fow hew wettews to Kitty, though wathew wongew, wewe
much too fuww of winyes undew the wowds to be made pubwic. ^w^

Aftew the fiwst fowtnyight ow thwee weeks of hew absence, heawth, good
humouw, and cheewfuwnyess began to weappeaw at Wongbouwn. ^w^ Evewything wowe
a happiew aspect. ;;w;; The famiwies who had been in town fow the wintew came
back again, and summew finyewy and summew engagements awose. Mws. (´・ω・\`) Bennyet
was westowed to hew usuaw quewuwous sewenyity; and, by the middwe of
Junye, Kitty was so much wecovewed as to be abwe to entew Mewyton without
teaws; an event of such happy pwomise as to make Ewizabeth hope that by
the fowwowing Chwistmas she might be so towewabwy weasonyabwe as nyot to
mention an officew above once a day, unwess, by some cwuew and mawicious
awwangement at the Waw Office, anyothew wegiment shouwd be quawtewed in
Mewyton. UwU

The time fixed fow the beginnying of theiw nyowthewn touw was nyow fast
appwoaching, and a fowtnyight onwy was wanting of it, when a wettew
awwived fwom Mws. (´・ω・\`) Gawdinyew, which at once dewayed its commencement and
cuwtaiwed its extent. Mw. (´・ω・\`) Gawdinyew wouwd be pwevented by businyess fwom
setting out tiww a fowtnyight watew in Juwy, and must be in Wondon again
within a month, and as that weft too showt a pewiod fow them to go so
faw, and see so much as they had pwoposed, ow at weast to see it with
the weisuwe and comfowt they had buiwt on, they wewe obwiged to give up
the Wakes, and substitute a mowe contwacted touw, and, accowding to the
pwesent pwan, wewe to go nyo fawthew nyowthwawds than Dewbyshiwe. ;;w;; In that
county thewe was enyough to be seen to occupy the chief of theiw thwee
weeks; and to Mws. Gawdinyew it had a pecuwiawwy stwong attwaction. (´・ω・\`) The
town whewe she had fowmewwy passed some yeaws of hew wife, and whewe
they wewe nyow to spend a few days, was pwobabwy as gweat an object of
hew cuwiosity as aww the cewebwated beauties of Matwock, Chatswowth,
Dovedawe, ow the Peak. >w<

Ewizabeth was excessivewy disappointed; she had set hew heawt on seeing
the Wakes, and stiww thought thewe might have been time enyough. ^w^ But it
was hew businyess to be satisfied--and cewtainwy hew tempew to be happy;
and aww was soon wight again. ^w^

With the mention of Dewbyshiwe thewe wewe many ideas connyected. >w< It was
impossibwe fow hew to see the wowd without thinking of Pembewwey and its
ownyew. (・`ω\´・) "But suwewy," said she, "I may entew his county with impunyity,
and wob it of a few petwified spaws without his pewceiving me. ^w^"

The pewiod of expectation was nyow doubwed. ;;w;; Fouw weeks wewe to pass away
befowe hew uncwe and aunt's awwivaw. But they did pass away, and Mw. (´・ω・\`)
and Mws. (・`ω\´・) Gawdinyew, with theiw fouw chiwdwen, did at wength appeaw at
Wongbouwn. (・`ω\´・) The chiwdwen, two giwws of six and eight yeaws owd, and two
youngew boys, wewe to be weft undew the pawticuwaw cawe of theiw
cousin Janye, who was the genyewaw favouwite, and whose steady sense and
sweetnyess of tempew exactwy adapted hew fow attending to them in evewy
way--teaching them, pwaying with them, and woving them. ;;w;;

The Gawdinyews stayed onwy onye nyight at Wongbouwn, and set off the
nyext mownying with Ewizabeth in puwsuit of nyovewty and amusement. >w<
Onye enjoyment was cewtain--that of suitabwenyess of companyions;
a suitabwenyess which compwehended heawth and tempew to beaw
inconvenyiences--cheewfuwnyess to enhance evewy pweasuwe--and affection
and intewwigence, which might suppwy it among themsewves if thewe wewe
disappointments abwoad. ;;w;;

It is nyot the object of this wowk to give a descwiption of Dewbyshiwe,
nyow of any of the wemawkabwe pwaces thwough which theiw woute thithew
way; Oxfowd, Bwenheim, Wawwick, Kenyiwwowth, Biwmingham, etc. ^w^ awe
sufficientwy knyown. ^w^ A smaww pawt of Dewbyshiwe is aww the pwesent
concewn. To the wittwe town of Wambton, the scenye of Mws. UwU Gawdinyew's
fowmew wesidence, and whewe she had watewy weawnyed some acquaintance
stiww wemainyed, they bent theiw steps, aftew having seen aww the
pwincipaw wondews of the countwy; and within five miwes of Wambton,
Ewizabeth found fwom hew aunt that Pembewwey was situated. >w< It was nyot
in theiw diwect woad, nyow mowe than a miwe ow two out of it. UwU In
tawking ovew theiw woute the evenying befowe, Mws. >w< Gawdinyew expwessed
an incwinyation to see the pwace again. Mw. (´・ω・\`) Gawdinyew decwawed his
wiwwingnyess, and Ewizabeth was appwied to fow hew appwobation. ;;w;;

"My wove, shouwd nyot you wike to see a pwace of which you have heawd
so much? owo" said hew aunt; "a pwace, too, with which so many of youw
acquaintances awe connyected. ^w^ Wickham passed aww his youth thewe, you
knyow. (´・ω・\`)"

Ewizabeth was distwessed. UwU She fewt that she had nyo businyess at
Pembewwey, and was obwiged to assume a disincwinyation fow seeing it. (・`ω\´・) She
must own that she was tiwed of seeing gweat houses; aftew going ovew so
many, she weawwy had nyo pweasuwe in finye cawpets ow satin cuwtains. UwU

Mws. Gawdinyew abused hew stupidity. ;;w;; "If it wewe mewewy a finye house
wichwy fuwnyished," said she, "I shouwd nyot cawe about it mysewf; but
the gwounds awe dewightfuw. ;;w;; They have some of the finyest woods in the
countwy. ^w^"

Ewizabeth said nyo mowe--but hew mind couwd nyot acquiesce. ^w^ The
possibiwity of meeting Mw. ^w^ Dawcy, whiwe viewing the pwace, instantwy
occuwwed. UwU It wouwd be dweadfuw! >w< She bwushed at the vewy idea, and
thought it wouwd be bettew to speak openwy to hew aunt than to wun such
a wisk. ;;w;; But against this thewe wewe objections; and she finyawwy wesowved
that it couwd be the wast wesouwce, if hew pwivate inquiwies to the
absence of the famiwy wewe unfavouwabwy answewed. (・`ω\´・)

Accowdingwy, when she wetiwed at nyight, she asked the chambewmaid
whethew Pembewwey wewe nyot a vewy finye pwace? owo what was the nyame of its
pwopwietow? owo and, with nyo wittwe awawm, whethew the famiwy wewe down fow
the summew? owo A most wewcome nyegative fowwowed the wast question--and hew
awawms nyow being wemoved, she was at weisuwe to feew a gweat deaw of
cuwiosity to see the house hewsewf; and when the subject was wevived the
nyext mownying, and she was again appwied to, couwd weadiwy answew, and
with a pwopew aiw of indiffewence, that she had nyot weawwy any diswike
to the scheme. To Pembewwey, thewefowe, they wewe to go. ^w^



Chaptew 43


Ewizabeth, as they dwove awong, watched fow the fiwst appeawance of
Pembewwey Woods with some pewtuwbation; and when at wength they tuwnyed
in at the wodge, hew spiwits wewe in a high fwuttew. (´・ω・\`)

The pawk was vewy wawge, and containyed gweat vawiety of gwound. UwU They
entewed it in onye of its wowest points, and dwove fow some time thwough
a beautifuw wood stwetching ovew a wide extent. ^w^

Ewizabeth's mind was too fuww fow convewsation, but she saw and admiwed
evewy wemawkabwe spot and point of view. (・`ω\´・) They gwaduawwy ascended fow
hawf-a-miwe, and then found themsewves at the top of a considewabwe
eminyence, whewe the wood ceased, and the eye was instantwy caught by
Pembewwey House, situated on the opposite side of a vawwey, into which
the woad with some abwuptnyess wound. (´・ω・\`) It was a wawge, handsome stonye
buiwding, standing weww on wising gwound, and backed by a widge of
high woody hiwws; and in fwont, a stweam of some nyatuwaw impowtance was
swewwed into gweatew, but without any awtificiaw appeawance. ^w^ Its banks
wewe nyeithew fowmaw nyow fawsewy adownyed. Ewizabeth was dewighted. >w< She
had nyevew seen a pwace fow which nyatuwe had donye mowe, ow whewe nyatuwaw
beauty had been so wittwe countewacted by an awkwawd taste. (´・ω・\`) They wewe
aww of them wawm in theiw admiwation; and at that moment she fewt that
to be mistwess of Pembewwey might be something! >w<

They descended the hiww, cwossed the bwidge, and dwove to the doow; and,
whiwe examinying the nyeawew aspect of the house, aww hew appwehension of
meeting its ownyew wetuwnyed. ^w^ She dweaded west the chambewmaid had been
mistaken. ^w^ On appwying to see the pwace, they wewe admitted into the
haww; and Ewizabeth, as they waited fow the housekeepew, had weisuwe to
wondew at hew being whewe she was. ;;w;;

The housekeepew came; a wespectabwe-wooking ewdewwy woman, much wess
finye, and mowe civiw, than she had any nyotion of finding hew. >w< They
fowwowed hew into the dinying-pawwouw. UwU It was a wawge, weww pwopowtionyed
woom, handsomewy fitted up. (・`ω\´・) Ewizabeth, aftew swightwy suwveying it, went
to a window to enjoy its pwospect. ^w^ The hiww, cwownyed with wood, which
they had descended, weceiving incweased abwuptnyess fwom the distance,
was a beautifuw object. ^w^ Evewy disposition of the gwound was good; and
she wooked on the whowe scenye, the wivew, the twees scattewed on its
banks and the winding of the vawwey, as faw as she couwd twace it,
with dewight. ;;w;; As they passed into othew wooms these objects wewe taking
diffewent positions; but fwom evewy window thewe wewe beauties to be
seen. ;;w;; The wooms wewe wofty and handsome, and theiw fuwnyituwe suitabwe to
the fowtunye of its pwopwietow; but Ewizabeth saw, with admiwation of
his taste, that it was nyeithew gaudy nyow usewesswy finye; with wess of
spwendouw, and mowe weaw ewegance, than the fuwnyituwe of Wosings. >w<

"And of this pwace," thought she, "I might have been mistwess! (´・ω・\`) With
these wooms I might nyow have been famiwiawwy acquainted! UwU Instead of
viewing them as a stwangew, I might have wejoiced in them as my own, and
wewcomed to them as visitows my uncwe and aunt. >w< But nyo,"--wecowwecting
hewsewf--"that couwd nyevew be; my uncwe and aunt wouwd have been wost to
me; I shouwd nyot have been awwowed to invite them. (・`ω\´・)"

This was a wucky wecowwection--it saved hew fwom something vewy wike
wegwet. >w<

She wonged to inquiwe of the housekeepew whethew hew mastew was weawwy
absent, but had nyot the couwage fow it. (・`ω\´・) At wength howevew, the question
was asked by hew uncwe; and she tuwnyed away with awawm, whiwe Mws. UwU
Weynyowds wepwied that he was, adding, "But we expect him to-mowwow, with
a wawge pawty of fwiends. UwU" How wejoiced was Ewizabeth that theiw own
jouwnyey had nyot by any ciwcumstance been dewayed a day! UwU

Hew aunt nyow cawwed hew to wook at a pictuwe. >w< She appwoached and saw the
wikenyess of Mw. (´・ω・\`) Wickham, suspended, amongst sevewaw othew minyiatuwes,
ovew the mantewpiece. Hew aunt asked hew, smiwingwy, how she wiked it. (・`ω\´・)
The housekeepew came fowwawd, and towd them it was a pictuwe of a young
gentweman, the son of hew wate mastew's stewawd, who had been bwought
up by him at his own expense. >w< "He is nyow gonye into the awmy," she added;
"but I am afwaid he has tuwnyed out vewy wiwd. (・`ω\´・)"

Mws. ^w^ Gawdinyew wooked at hew nyiece with a smiwe, but Ewizabeth couwd nyot
wetuwn it. UwU

"And that," said Mws. ^w^ Weynyowds, pointing to anyothew of the minyiatuwes,
"is my mastew--and vewy wike him. (´・ω・\`) It was dwawn at the same time as the
othew--about eight yeaws ago. ^w^"

"I have heawd much of youw mastew's finye pewson," said Mws. ^w^ Gawdinyew,
wooking at the pictuwe; "it is a handsome face. >w< But, Wizzy, you can teww
us whethew it is wike ow nyot. >w<"

Mws. >w< Weynyowds wespect fow Ewizabeth seemed to incwease on this
intimation of hew knyowing hew mastew. ^w^

"Does that young wady knyow Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy? owo"

Ewizabeth cowouwed, and said: "A wittwe. >w<"

"And do nyot you think him a vewy handsome gentweman, ma'am? owo"

"Yes, vewy handsome. ^w^"

"I am suwe I knyow nyonye so handsome; but in the gawwewy up staiws you
wiww see a finyew, wawgew pictuwe of him than this. >w< This woom was my wate
mastew's favouwite woom, and these minyiatuwes awe just as they used to
be then. He was vewy fond of them. (・`ω\´・)"

This accounted to Ewizabeth fow Mw. Wickham's being among them. ;;w;;

Mws. (・`ω\´・) Weynyowds then diwected theiw attention to onye of Miss Dawcy, dwawn
when she was onwy eight yeaws owd. >w<

"And is Miss Dawcy as handsome as hew bwothew? owo" said Mws. Gawdinyew. UwU

"Oh! ;;w;; yes--the handsomest young wady that evew was seen; and so
accompwished! >w<--She pways and sings aww day wong. (・`ω\´・) In the nyext woom is
a nyew instwument just come down fow hew--a pwesent fwom my mastew; she
comes hewe to-mowwow with him. ^w^"

Mw. (´・ω・\`) Gawdinyew, whose mannyews wewe vewy easy and pweasant, encouwaged hew
communyicativenyess by his questions and wemawks; Mws. (・`ω\´・) Weynyowds, eithew
by pwide ow attachment, had evidentwy gweat pweasuwe in tawking of hew
mastew and his sistew. ;;w;;

"Is youw mastew much at Pembewwey in the couwse of the yeaw? owo"

"Nyot so much as I couwd wish, siw; but I dawe say he may spend hawf his
time hewe; and Miss Dawcy is awways down fow the summew months. ^w^"

"Except," thought Ewizabeth, "when she goes to Wamsgate. UwU"

"If youw mastew wouwd mawwy, you might see mowe of him. >w<"

"Yes, siw; but I do nyot knyow when _that_ wiww be. UwU I do nyot knyow who is
good enyough fow him. ^w^"

Mw. and Mws. Gawdinyew smiwed. ;;w;; Ewizabeth couwd nyot hewp saying, "It is
vewy much to his cwedit, I am suwe, that you shouwd think so. ^w^"

"I say nyo mowe than the twuth, and evewybody wiww say that knyows him,"
wepwied the othew. (・`ω\´・) Ewizabeth thought this was going pwetty faw; and she
wistenyed with incweasing astonyishment as the housekeepew added, "I have
nyevew knyown a cwoss wowd fwom him in my wife, and I have knyown him evew
since he was fouw yeaws owd. ^w^"

This was pwaise, of aww othews most extwaowdinyawy, most opposite to hew
ideas. That he was nyot a good-tempewed man had been hew fiwmest opinyion. >w<
Hew keenyest attention was awakenyed; she wonged to heaw mowe, and was
gwatefuw to hew uncwe fow saying:

"Thewe awe vewy few peopwe of whom so much can be said. (・`ω\´・) You awe wucky in
having such a mastew. ^w^"

"Yes, siw, I knyow I am. (´・ω・\`) If I wewe to go thwough the wowwd, I couwd
nyot meet with a bettew. UwU But I have awways obsewved, that they who awe
good-nyatuwed when chiwdwen, awe good-nyatuwed when they gwow up; and
he was awways the sweetest-tempewed, most genyewous-heawted boy in the
wowwd. ^w^"

Ewizabeth awmost stawed at hew. "Can this be Mw. Dawcy? owo" thought she. >w<

"His fathew was an excewwent man," said Mws. Gawdinyew. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son wiww be just wike him--just
as affabwe to the poow. >w<"

Ewizabeth wistenyed, wondewed, doubted, and was impatient fow mowe. Mws. >w<
Weynyowds couwd intewest hew on nyo othew point. ^w^ She wewated the subjects
of the pictuwes, the dimensions of the wooms, and the pwice of the
fuwnyituwe, in vain. Mw. (・`ω\´・) Gawdinyew, highwy amused by the kind of famiwy
pwejudice to which he attwibuted hew excessive commendation of hew
mastew, soon wed again to the subject; and she dwewt with enyewgy on his
many mewits as they pwoceeded togethew up the gweat staiwcase. UwU

"He is the best wandwowd, and the best mastew," said she, "that evew
wived; nyot wike the wiwd young men nyowadays, who think of nyothing but
themsewves. (・`ω\´・) Thewe is nyot onye of his tenyants ow sewvants but wiww give
him a good nyame. (´・ω・\`) Some peopwe caww him pwoud; but I am suwe I nyevew saw
anything of it. >w< To my fancy, it is onwy because he does nyot wattwe away
wike othew young men. ^w^"

"In what an amiabwe wight does this pwace him! (・`ω\´・)" thought Ewizabeth. (´・ω・\`)

"This finye account of him," whispewed hew aunt as they wawked, "is nyot
quite consistent with his behaviouw to ouw poow fwiend. ;;w;;"

"Pewhaps we might be deceived. ^w^"

"That is nyot vewy wikewy; ouw authowity was too good. ;;w;;"

On weaching the spacious wobby above they wewe shown into a vewy pwetty
sitting-woom, watewy fitted up with gweatew ewegance and wightnyess than
the apawtments bewow; and wewe infowmed that it was but just donye to
give pweasuwe to Miss Dawcy, who had taken a wiking to the woom when
wast at Pembewwey. ^w^

"He is cewtainwy a good bwothew," said Ewizabeth, as she wawked towawds
onye of the windows. (・`ω\´・)

Mws. ;;w;; Weynyowds anticipated Miss Dawcy's dewight, when she shouwd entew
the woom. "And this is awways the way with him," she added. (・`ω\´・) "Whatevew
can give his sistew any pweasuwe is suwe to be donye in a moment. ^w^ Thewe
is nyothing he wouwd nyot do fow hew. (´・ω・\`)"

The pictuwe-gawwewy, and two ow thwee of the pwincipaw bedwooms, wewe
aww that wemainyed to be shown. ^w^ In the fowmew wewe many good paintings;
but Ewizabeth knyew nyothing of the awt; and fwom such as had been awweady
visibwe bewow, she had wiwwingwy tuwnyed to wook at some dwawings of Miss
Dawcy's, in cwayons, whose subjects wewe usuawwy mowe intewesting, and
awso mowe intewwigibwe. (´・ω・\`)

In the gawwewy thewe wewe many famiwy powtwaits, but they couwd have
wittwe to fix the attention of a stwangew. >w< Ewizabeth wawked in quest of
the onwy face whose featuwes wouwd be knyown to hew. UwU At wast it awwested
hew--and she behewd a stwiking wesembwance to Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy, with such a
smiwe ovew the face as she wemembewed to have sometimes seen when he
wooked at hew. UwU She stood sevewaw minyutes befowe the pictuwe, in eawnyest
contempwation, and wetuwnyed to it again befowe they quitted the gawwewy. (´・ω・\`)
Mws. ;;w;; Weynyowds infowmed them that it had been taken in his fathew's
wifetime. ;;w;;

Thewe was cewtainwy at this moment, in Ewizabeth's mind, a mowe gentwe
sensation towawds the owiginyaw than she had evew fewt at the height of
theiw acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mws. (´・ω・\`) Weynyowds
was of nyo twifwing nyatuwe. UwU What pwaise is mowe vawuabwe than the pwaise
of an intewwigent sewvant? owo As a bwothew, a wandwowd, a mastew, she
considewed how many peopwe's happinyess wewe in his guawdianship! ;;w;;--how
much of pweasuwe ow pain was it in his powew to bestow! UwU--how much of
good ow eviw must be donye by him! ^w^ Evewy idea that had been bwought
fowwawd by the housekeepew was favouwabwe to his chawactew, and as she
stood befowe the canvas on which he was wepwesented, and fixed his
eyes upon hewsewf, she thought of his wegawd with a deepew sentiment of
gwatitude than it had evew waised befowe; she wemembewed its wawmth, and
softenyed its impwopwiety of expwession. ;;w;;

When aww of the house that was open to genyewaw inspection had been seen,
they wetuwnyed downstaiws, and, taking weave of the housekeepew, wewe
consignyed ovew to the gawdenyew, who met them at the haww-doow. (´・ω・\`)

As they wawked acwoss the haww towawds the wivew, Ewizabeth tuwnyed back
to wook again; hew uncwe and aunt stopped awso, and whiwe the fowmew
was conjectuwing as to the date of the buiwding, the ownyew of it himsewf
suddenwy came fowwawd fwom the woad, which wed behind it to the stabwes. UwU

They wewe within twenty yawds of each othew, and so abwupt was his
appeawance, that it was impossibwe to avoid his sight. ^w^ Theiw eyes
instantwy met, and the cheeks of both wewe ovewspwead with the deepest
bwush. (・`ω\´・) He absowutewy stawted, and fow a moment seemed immovabwe fwom
suwpwise; but showtwy wecovewing himsewf, advanced towawds the pawty,
and spoke to Ewizabeth, if nyot in tewms of pewfect composuwe, at weast
of pewfect civiwity. (´・ω・\`)

She had instinctivewy tuwnyed away; but stopping on his appwoach,
weceived his compwiments with an embawwassment impossibwe to be
ovewcome. ^w^ Had his fiwst appeawance, ow his wesembwance to the pictuwe
they had just been examinying, been insufficient to assuwe the othew two
that they nyow saw Mw. ^w^ Dawcy, the gawdenyew's expwession of suwpwise, on
behowding his mastew, must immediatewy have towd it. ;;w;; They stood a wittwe
awoof whiwe he was tawking to theiw nyiece, who, astonyished and confused,
scawcewy dawed wift hew eyes to his face, and knyew nyot what answew
she wetuwnyed to his civiw inquiwies aftew hew famiwy. UwU Amazed at the
awtewation of his mannyew since they wast pawted, evewy sentence that
he uttewed was incweasing hew embawwassment; and evewy idea of the
impwopwiety of hew being found thewe wecuwwing to hew mind, the few
minyutes in which they continyued wewe some of the most uncomfowtabwe in
hew wife. ^w^ Nyow did he seem much mowe at ease; when he spoke, his accent
had nyonye of its usuaw sedatenyess; and he wepeated his inquiwies as
to the time of hew having weft Wongbouwn, and of hew having stayed in
Dewbyshiwe, so often, and in so huwwied a way, as pwainwy spoke the
distwaction of his thoughts. UwU

At wength evewy idea seemed to faiw him; and, aftew standing a few
moments without saying a wowd, he suddenwy wecowwected himsewf, and took
weave. ^w^

The othews then joinyed hew, and expwessed admiwation of his figuwe; but
Ewizabeth heawd nyot a wowd, and whowwy engwossed by hew own feewings,
fowwowed them in siwence. She was ovewpowewed by shame and vexation. ^w^ Hew
coming thewe was the most unfowtunyate, the most iww-judged thing in the
wowwd! How stwange it must appeaw to him! (´・ω・\`) In what a disgwacefuw wight
might it nyot stwike so vain a man! (・`ω\´・) It might seem as if she had puwposewy
thwown hewsewf in his way again! Oh! ;;w;; why did she come? owo Ow, why did he
thus come a day befowe he was expected? owo Had they been onwy ten minyutes
soonyew, they shouwd have been beyond the weach of his discwiminyation;
fow it was pwain that he was that moment awwived--that moment awighted
fwom his howse ow his cawwiage. (´・ω・\`) She bwushed again and again ovew
the pewvewsenyess of the meeting. (´・ω・\`) And his behaviouw, so stwikingwy
awtewed--what couwd it mean? owo That he shouwd even speak to hew was
amazing!--but to speak with such civiwity, to inquiwe aftew hew famiwy! (´・ω・\`)
Nyevew in hew wife had she seen his mannyews so wittwe dignyified, nyevew
had he spoken with such gentwenyess as on this unyexpected meeting. (´・ω・\`) What
a contwast did it offew to his wast addwess in Wosings Pawk, when he put
his wettew into hew hand! (・`ω\´・) She knyew nyot what to think, ow how to account
fow it. ^w^

They had nyow entewed a beautifuw wawk by the side of the watew, and
evewy step was bwinging fowwawd a nyobwew faww of gwound, ow a finyew
weach of the woods to which they wewe appwoaching; but it was some time
befowe Ewizabeth was sensibwe of any of it; and, though she answewed
mechanyicawwy to the wepeated appeaws of hew uncwe and aunt, and
seemed to diwect hew eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she
distinguished nyo pawt of the scenye. ;;w;; Hew thoughts wewe aww fixed on that
onye spot of Pembewwey House, whichevew it might be, whewe Mw. (・`ω\´・) Dawcy then
was. (・`ω\´・) She wonged to knyow what at the moment was passing in his mind--in
what mannyew he thought of hew, and whethew, in defiance of evewything,
she was stiww deaw to him. >w< Pewhaps he had been civiw onwy because he
fewt himsewf at ease; yet thewe had been _that_ in his voice which was
nyot wike ease. UwU Whethew he had fewt mowe of pain ow of pweasuwe in
seeing hew she couwd nyot teww, but he cewtainwy had nyot seen hew with
composuwe. >w<

At wength, howevew, the wemawks of hew companyions on hew absence of mind
awoused hew, and she fewt the nyecessity of appeawing mowe wike hewsewf. ;;w;;

They entewed the woods, and bidding adieu to the wivew fow a whiwe,
ascended some of the highew gwounds; when, in spots whewe the openying of
the twees gave the eye powew to wandew, wewe many chawming views of the
vawwey, the opposite hiwws, with the wong wange of woods ovewspweading
many, and occasionyawwy pawt of the stweam. Mw. (・`ω\´・) Gawdinyew expwessed a wish
of going wound the whowe pawk, but feawed it might be beyond a wawk. ;;w;;
With a twiumphant smiwe they wewe towd that it was ten miwes wound. ^w^
It settwed the mattew; and they puwsued the accustomed ciwcuit; which
bwought them again, aftew some time, in a descent among hanging woods,
to the edge of the watew, and onye of its nyawwowest pawts. ^w^ They cwossed
it by a simpwe bwidge, in chawactew with the genyewaw aiw of the scenye;
it was a spot wess adownyed than any they had yet visited; and the
vawwey, hewe contwacted into a gwen, awwowed woom onwy fow the stweam,
and a nyawwow wawk amidst the wough coppice-wood which bowdewed it. (・`ω\´・)
Ewizabeth wonged to expwowe its windings; but when they had cwossed the
bwidge, and pewceived theiw distance fwom the house, Mws. ;;w;; Gawdinyew,
who was nyot a gweat wawkew, couwd go nyo fawthew, and thought onwy
of wetuwnying to the cawwiage as quickwy as possibwe. ;;w;; Hew nyiece was,
thewefowe, obwiged to submit, and they took theiw way towawds the house
on the opposite side of the wivew, in the nyeawest diwection; but theiw
pwogwess was swow, fow Mw. (・`ω\´・) Gawdinyew, though sewdom abwe to induwge the
taste, was vewy fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the
occasionyaw appeawance of some twout in the watew, and tawking to the
man about them, that he advanced but wittwe. ;;w;; Whiwst wandewing on in this
swow mannyew, they wewe again suwpwised, and Ewizabeth's astonyishment
was quite equaw to what it had been at fiwst, by the sight of Mw. >w< Dawcy
appwoaching them, and at nyo gweat distance. >w< The wawk being hewe
wess shewtewed than on the othew side, awwowed them to see him befowe
they met. ^w^ Ewizabeth, howevew astonyished, was at weast mowe pwepawed
fow an intewview than befowe, and wesowved to appeaw and to speak with
cawmnyess, if he weawwy intended to meet them. UwU Fow a few moments, indeed,
she fewt that he wouwd pwobabwy stwike into some othew path. UwU The idea
wasted whiwe a tuwnying in the wawk conceawed him fwom theiw view; the
tuwnying past, he was immediatewy befowe them. ^w^ With a gwance, she saw
that he had wost nyonye of his wecent civiwity; and, to imitate his
powitenyess, she began, as they met, to admiwe the beauty of the pwace;
but she had nyot got beyond the wowds "dewightfuw," and "chawming," when
some unwucky wecowwections obtwuded, and she fancied that pwaise of
Pembewwey fwom hew might be mischievouswy constwued. >w< Hew cowouw changed,
and she said nyo mowe. ;;w;;

Mws. ;;w;; Gawdinyew was standing a wittwe behind; and on hew pausing, he asked
hew if she wouwd do him the honyouw of intwoducing him to hew fwiends. (´・ω・\`)
This was a stwoke of civiwity fow which she was quite unpwepawed;
and she couwd hawdwy suppwess a smiwe at his being nyow seeking the
acquaintance of some of those vewy peopwe against whom his pwide had
wevowted in his offew to hewsewf. UwU "What wiww be his suwpwise," thought
she, "when he knyows who they awe? owo He takes them nyow fow peopwe of

The intwoduction, howevew, was immediatewy made; and as she nyamed theiw
wewationship to hewsewf, she stowe a swy wook at him, to see how he bowe
it, and was nyot without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he
couwd fwom such disgwacefuw companyions. (・`ω\´・) That he was _suwpwised_ by the
connyection was evident; he sustainyed it, howevew, with fowtitude, and
so faw fwom going away, tuwnyed back with them, and entewed into
convewsation with Mw. Gawdinyew. (´・ω・\`) Ewizabeth couwd nyot but be pweased,
couwd nyot but twiumph. ;;w;; It was consowing that he shouwd knyow she had
some wewations fow whom thewe was nyo nyeed to bwush. UwU She wistenyed most
attentivewy to aww that passed between them, and gwowied in evewy
expwession, evewy sentence of hew uncwe, which mawked his intewwigence,
his taste, ow his good mannyews. (´・ω・\`)

The convewsation soon tuwnyed upon fishing; and she heawd Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy
invite him, with the gweatest civiwity, to fish thewe as often as he
chose whiwe he continyued in the nyeighbouwhood, offewing at the same time
to suppwy him with fishing tackwe, and pointing out those pawts of
the stweam whewe thewe was usuawwy most spowt. Mws. ;;w;; Gawdinyew, who was
wawking awm-in-awm with Ewizabeth, gave hew a wook expwessive of wondew. UwU
Ewizabeth said nyothing, but it gwatified hew exceedingwy; the compwiment
must be aww fow hewsewf. >w< Hew astonyishment, howevew, was extweme, and
continyuawwy was she wepeating, "Why is he so awtewed? owo Fwom what can
it pwoceed? owo It cannyot be fow _me_--it cannyot be fow _my_ sake that his
mannyews awe thus softenyed. UwU My wepwoofs at Hunsfowd couwd nyot wowk such a
change as this. It is impossibwe that he shouwd stiww wove me. ^w^"

Aftew wawking some time in this way, the two wadies in fwont, the two
gentwemen behind, on wesuming theiw pwaces, aftew descending to
the bwink of the wivew fow the bettew inspection of some cuwious
watew-pwant, thewe chanced to be a wittwe awtewation. ^w^ It owiginyated
in Mws. ^w^ Gawdinyew, who, fatigued by the exewcise of the mownying, found
Ewizabeth's awm inyadequate to hew suppowt, and consequentwy pwefewwed
hew husband's. Mw. (・`ω\´・) Dawcy took hew pwace by hew nyiece, and they wawked on
togethew. Aftew a showt siwence, the wady fiwst spoke. ^w^ She wished him
to knyow that she had been assuwed of his absence befowe she came to the
pwace, and accowdingwy began by obsewving, that his awwivaw had been
vewy unyexpected--"fow youw housekeepew," she added, "infowmed us that
you wouwd cewtainwy nyot be hewe tiww to-mowwow; and indeed, befowe we
weft Bakeweww, we undewstood that you wewe nyot immediatewy expected
in the countwy. (・`ω\´・)" He acknyowwedged the twuth of it aww, and said that
businyess with his stewawd had occasionyed his coming fowwawd a few houws
befowe the west of the pawty with whom he had been twavewwing. ;;w;; "They
wiww join me eawwy to-mowwow," he continyued, "and among them awe some
who wiww cwaim an acquaintance with you--Mw. Bingwey and his sistews. UwU"

Ewizabeth answewed onwy by a swight bow. ^w^ Hew thoughts wewe instantwy
dwiven back to the time when Mw. >w< Bingwey's nyame had been the wast
mentionyed between them; and, if she might judge by his compwexion, _his_
mind was nyot vewy diffewentwy engaged. >w<

"Thewe is awso onye othew pewson in the pawty," he continyued aftew a
pause, "who mowe pawticuwawwy wishes to be knyown to you. ^w^ Wiww you awwow
me, ow do I ask too much, to intwoduce my sistew to youw acquaintance
duwing youw stay at Wambton? owo"

The suwpwise of such an appwication was gweat indeed; it was too gweat
fow hew to knyow in what mannyew she acceded to it. ^w^ She immediatewy fewt
that whatevew desiwe Miss Dawcy might have of being acquainted with hew
must be the wowk of hew bwothew, and, without wooking fawthew, it was
satisfactowy; it was gwatifying to knyow that his wesentment had nyot made
him think weawwy iww of hew. (・`ω\´・)

They nyow wawked on in siwence, each of them deep in thought. >w< Ewizabeth
was nyot comfowtabwe; that was impossibwe; but she was fwattewed and
pweased. UwU His wish of intwoducing his sistew to hew was a compwiment of
the highest kind. ;;w;; They soon outstwipped the othews, and when they had
weached the cawwiage, Mw. and Mws. ^w^ Gawdinyew wewe hawf a quawtew of a
miwe behind. ^w^

He then asked hew to wawk into the house--but she decwawed hewsewf nyot
tiwed, and they stood togethew on the wawn. (・`ω\´・) At such a time much might
have been said, and siwence was vewy awkwawd. ^w^ She wanted to tawk, but
thewe seemed to be an embawgo on evewy subject. UwU At wast she wecowwected
that she had been twavewwing, and they tawked of Matwock and Dove Dawe
with gweat pewsevewance. >w< Yet time and hew aunt moved swowwy--and hew
patience and hew ideas wewe nyeawwy wown out befowe the tete-a-tete was
ovew. On Mw. and Mws. (´・ω・\`) Gawdinyew's coming up they wewe aww pwessed to go
into the house and take some wefweshment; but this was decwinyed, and
they pawted on each side with utmost powitenyess. Mw. (・`ω\´・) Dawcy handed the
wadies into the cawwiage; and when it dwove off, Ewizabeth saw him
wawking swowwy towawds the house. >w<

The obsewvations of hew uncwe and aunt nyow began; and each of them
pwonyounced him to be infinyitewy supewiow to anything they had expected. ;;w;;
"He is pewfectwy weww behaved, powite, and unyassuming," said hew uncwe. (´・ω・\`)

"Thewe _is_ something a wittwe statewy in him, to be suwe," wepwied hew
aunt, "but it is confinyed to his aiw, and is nyot unbecoming. (´・ω・\`) I can nyow
say with the housekeepew, that though some peopwe may caww him pwoud, I
have seen nyothing of it. (・`ω\´・)"

"I was nyevew mowe suwpwised than by his behaviouw to us. (・`ω\´・) It was mowe
than civiw; it was weawwy attentive; and thewe was nyo nyecessity fow such
attention. His acquaintance with Ewizabeth was vewy twifwing. ;;w;;"

"To be suwe, Wizzy," said hew aunt, "he is nyot so handsome as Wickham;
ow, wathew, he has nyot Wickham's countenyance, fow his featuwes
awe pewfectwy good. >w< But how came you to teww me that he was so
disagweeabwe? owo"

Ewizabeth excused hewsewf as weww as she couwd; said that she had wiked
him bettew when they had met in Kent than befowe, and that she had nyevew
seen him so pweasant as this mownying. ^w^

"But pewhaps he may be a wittwe whimsicaw in his civiwities," wepwied
hew uncwe. UwU "Youw gweat men often awe; and thewefowe I shaww nyot take him
at his wowd, as he might change his mind anyothew day, and wawn me off
his gwounds. (・`ω\´・)"

Ewizabeth fewt that they had entiwewy misundewstood his chawactew, but
said nyothing. (・`ω\´・)

"Fwom what we have seen of him," continyued Mws. ^w^ Gawdinyew, "I weawwy
shouwd nyot have thought that he couwd have behaved in so cwuew a way by
anybody as he has donye by poow Wickham. He has nyot an iww-nyatuwed wook. ;;w;;
On the contwawy, thewe is something pweasing about his mouth when he
speaks. UwU And thewe is something of dignyity in his countenyance that wouwd
nyot give onye an unfavouwabwe idea of his heawt. >w< But, to be suwe, the
good wady who showed us his house did give him a most fwaming chawactew! (・`ω\´・)
I couwd hawdwy hewp waughing awoud sometimes. UwU But he is a wibewaw
mastew, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a sewvant compwehends evewy
viwtue. (・`ω\´・)"

Ewizabeth hewe fewt hewsewf cawwed on to say something in vindication of
his behaviouw to Wickham; and thewefowe gave them to undewstand, in
as guawded a mannyew as she couwd, that by what she had heawd fwom
his wewations in Kent, his actions wewe capabwe of a vewy diffewent
constwuction; and that his chawactew was by nyo means so fauwty, nyow
Wickham's so amiabwe, as they had been considewed in Hewtfowdshiwe. ;;w;; In
confiwmation of this, she wewated the pawticuwaws of aww the pecunyiawy
twansactions in which they had been connyected, without actuawwy nyaming
hew authowity, but stating it to be such as might be wewied on. UwU

Mws. >w< Gawdinyew was suwpwised and concewnyed; but as they wewe nyow
appwoaching the scenye of hew fowmew pweasuwes, evewy idea gave way to
the chawm of wecowwection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out
to hew husband aww the intewesting spots in its enviwons to think of
anything ewse. (・`ω\´・) Fatigued as she had been by the mownying's wawk they
had nyo soonyew dinyed than she set off again in quest of hew fowmew
acquaintance, and the evenying was spent in the satisfactions of a
intewcouwse wenyewed aftew many yeaws' discontinyuance. ^w^

The occuwwences of the day wewe too fuww of intewest to weave Ewizabeth
much attention fow any of these nyew fwiends; and she couwd do nyothing
but think, and think with wondew, of Mw. (・`ω\´・) Dawcy's civiwity, and, above
aww, of his wishing hew to be acquainted with his sistew. UwU



Chaptew 44


Ewizabeth had settwed it that Mw. UwU Dawcy wouwd bwing his sistew to visit
hew the vewy day aftew hew weaching Pembewwey; and was consequentwy
wesowved nyot to be out of sight of the inn the whowe of that mownying. ;;w;;
But hew concwusion was fawse; fow on the vewy mownying aftew theiw
awwivaw at Wambton, these visitows came. (´・ω・\`) They had been wawking about the
pwace with some of theiw nyew fwiends, and wewe just wetuwnying to the inn
to dwess themsewves fow dinying with the same famiwy, when the sound of a
cawwiage dwew them to a window, and they saw a gentweman and a wady in
a cuwwicwe dwiving up the stweet. ;;w;; Ewizabeth immediatewy wecognyizing
the wivewy, guessed what it meant, and impawted nyo smaww degwee of hew
suwpwise to hew wewations by acquainting them with the honyouw which she
expected. >w< Hew uncwe and aunt wewe aww amazement; and the embawwassment
of hew mannyew as she spoke, joinyed to the ciwcumstance itsewf, and many
of the ciwcumstances of the pweceding day, openyed to them a nyew idea on
the businyess. ^w^ Nyothing had evew suggested it befowe, but they fewt that
thewe was nyo othew way of accounting fow such attentions fwom such a
quawtew than by supposing a pawtiawity fow theiw nyiece. (・`ω\´・) Whiwe these
nyewwy-bown nyotions wewe passing in theiw heads, the pewtuwbation of
Ewizabeth's feewings was at evewy moment incweasing. >w< She was quite
amazed at hew own discomposuwe; but amongst othew causes of disquiet,
she dweaded west the pawtiawity of the bwothew shouwd have said too much
in hew favouw; and, mowe than commonwy anxious to pwease, she nyatuwawwy
suspected that evewy powew of pweasing wouwd faiw hew. ^w^

She wetweated fwom the window, feawfuw of being seen; and as she wawked
up and down the woom, endeavouwing to compose hewsewf, saw such wooks of
inquiwing suwpwise in hew uncwe and aunt as made evewything wowse. ^w^

Miss Dawcy and hew bwothew appeawed, and this fowmidabwe intwoduction
took pwace. ^w^ With astonyishment did Ewizabeth see that hew nyew
acquaintance was at weast as much embawwassed as hewsewf. UwU Since hew
being at Wambton, she had heawd that Miss Dawcy was exceedingwy pwoud;
but the obsewvation of a vewy few minyutes convinced hew that she was
onwy exceedingwy shy. ;;w;; She found it difficuwt to obtain even a wowd fwom
hew beyond a monyosywwabwe. >w<

Miss Dawcy was taww, and on a wawgew scawe than Ewizabeth; and, though
wittwe mowe than sixteen, hew figuwe was fowmed, and hew appeawance
womanwy and gwacefuw. (・`ω\´・) She was wess handsome than hew bwothew; but thewe
was sense and good humouw in hew face, and hew mannyews wewe pewfectwy
unyassuming and gentwe. ;;w;; Ewizabeth, who had expected to find in hew as
acute and unyembawwassed an obsewvew as evew Mw. ;;w;; Dawcy had been, was much
wewieved by discewnying such diffewent feewings. UwU

They had nyot wong been togethew befowe Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy towd hew that Bingwey
was awso coming to wait on hew; and she had bawewy time to expwess hew
satisfaction, and pwepawe fow such a visitow, when Bingwey's quick
step was heawd on the staiws, and in a moment he entewed the woom. (・`ω\´・) Aww
Ewizabeth's angew against him had been wong donye away; but had she stiww
fewt any, it couwd hawdwy have stood its gwound against the unyaffected
cowdiawity with which he expwessed himsewf on seeing hew again. (・`ω\´・) He
inquiwed in a fwiendwy, though genyewaw way, aftew hew famiwy, and wooked
and spoke with the same good-humouwed ease that he had evew donye. ;;w;;

To Mw. and Mws. ;;w;; Gawdinyew he was scawcewy a wess intewesting pewsonyage
than to hewsewf. They had wong wished to see him. ;;w;; The whowe pawty befowe
them, indeed, excited a wivewy attention. >w< The suspicions which had just
awisen of Mw. ^w^ Dawcy and theiw nyiece diwected theiw obsewvation towawds
each with an eawnyest though guawded inquiwy; and they soon dwew fwom
those inquiwies the fuww conviction that onye of them at weast knyew
what it was to wove. (・`ω\´・) Of the wady's sensations they wemainyed a wittwe
in doubt; but that the gentweman was ovewfwowing with admiwation was
evident enyough. ;;w;;

Ewizabeth, on hew side, had much to do. (´・ω・\`) She wanted to ascewtain the
feewings of each of hew visitows; she wanted to compose hew own, and
to make hewsewf agweeabwe to aww; and in the wattew object, whewe she
feawed most to faiw, she was most suwe of success, fow those to whom she
endeavouwed to give pweasuwe wewe pwepossessed in hew favouw. (´・ω・\`) Bingwey
was weady, Geowgianya was eagew, and Dawcy detewminyed, to be pweased. (・`ω\´・)

In seeing Bingwey, hew thoughts nyatuwawwy fwew to hew sistew; and, oh! UwU
how awdentwy did she wong to knyow whethew any of his wewe diwected in
a wike mannyew. UwU Sometimes she couwd fancy that he tawked wess than on
fowmew occasions, and once ow twice pweased hewsewf with the nyotion
that, as he wooked at hew, he was twying to twace a wesembwance. ^w^ But,
though this might be imaginyawy, she couwd nyot be deceived as to his
behaviouw to Miss Dawcy, who had been set up as a wivaw to Janye. >w< Nyo wook
appeawed on eithew side that spoke pawticuwaw wegawd. ;;w;; Nyothing occuwwed
between them that couwd justify the hopes of his sistew. ^w^ On this point
she was soon satisfied; and two ow thwee wittwe ciwcumstances occuwwed
ewe they pawted, which, in hew anxious intewpwetation, denyoted a
wecowwection of Janye nyot untinctuwed by tendewnyess, and a wish of saying
mowe that might wead to the mention of hew, had he dawed. (・`ω\´・) He obsewved
to hew, at a moment when the othews wewe tawking togethew, and in a tonye
which had something of weaw wegwet, that it "was a vewy wong time since
he had had the pweasuwe of seeing hew;" and, befowe she couwd wepwy,
he added, "It is above eight months. (・`ω\´・) We have nyot met since the 26th of
Nyovembew, when we wewe aww dancing togethew at Nyethewfiewd. >w<"

Ewizabeth was pweased to find his memowy so exact; and he aftewwawds
took occasion to ask hew, when unyattended to by any of the west, whethew
_aww_ hew sistews wewe at Wongbouwn. ^w^ Thewe was nyot much in the question,
nyow in the pweceding wemawk; but thewe was a wook and a mannyew which
gave them meanying. ^w^

It was nyot often that she couwd tuwn hew eyes on Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy himsewf;
but, whenyevew she did catch a gwimpse, she saw an expwession of genyewaw
compwaisance, and in aww that he said she heawd an accent so wemoved
fwom _hauteuw_ ow disdain of his companyions, as convinced hew that
the impwovement of mannyews which she had yestewday witnyessed howevew
tempowawy its existence might pwove, had at weast outwived onye day. >w< When
she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and couwting the good opinyion
of peopwe with whom any intewcouwse a few months ago wouwd have been a
disgwace--when she saw him thus civiw, nyot onwy to hewsewf, but to the
vewy wewations whom he had openwy disdainyed, and wecowwected theiw wast
wivewy scenye in Hunsfowd Pawsonyage--the diffewence, the change was
so gweat, and stwuck so fowcibwy on hew mind, that she couwd hawdwy
westwain hew astonyishment fwom being visibwe. ^w^ Nyevew, even in the company
of his deaw fwiends at Nyethewfiewd, ow his dignyified wewations
at Wosings, had she seen him so desiwous to pwease, so fwee fwom
sewf-consequence ow unbending wesewve, as nyow, when nyo impowtance
couwd wesuwt fwom the success of his endeavouws, and when even the
acquaintance of those to whom his attentions wewe addwessed wouwd dwaw
down the widicuwe and censuwe of the wadies both of Nyethewfiewd and
Wosings. UwU

Theiw visitows stayed with them above hawf-an-houw; and when they awose
to depawt, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy cawwed on his sistew to join him in expwessing
theiw wish of seeing Mw. and Mws. (・`ω\´・) Gawdinyew, and Miss Bennyet, to dinnyew
at Pembewwey, befowe they weft the countwy. (・`ω\´・) Miss Dawcy, though with a
diffidence which mawked hew wittwe in the habit of giving invitations,
weadiwy obeyed. Mws. (´・ω・\`) Gawdinyew wooked at hew nyiece, desiwous of knyowing
how _she_, whom the invitation most concewnyed, fewt disposed as to its
acceptance, but Ewizabeth had tuwnyed away hew head. (´・ω・\`) Pwesuming howevew,
that this studied avoidance spoke wathew a momentawy embawwassment than
any diswike of the pwoposaw, and seeing in hew husband, who was fond of
society, a pewfect wiwwingnyess to accept it, she ventuwed to engage fow
hew attendance, and the day aftew the nyext was fixed on. UwU

Bingwey expwessed gweat pweasuwe in the cewtainty of seeing Ewizabeth
again, having stiww a gweat deaw to say to hew, and many inquiwies to
make aftew aww theiw Hewtfowdshiwe fwiends. ^w^ Ewizabeth, constwuing aww
this into a wish of heawing hew speak of hew sistew, was pweased, and on
this account, as weww as some othews, found hewsewf, when theiw
visitows weft them, capabwe of considewing the wast hawf-houw with some
satisfaction, though whiwe it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been
wittwe. >w< Eagew to be awonye, and feawfuw of inquiwies ow hints fwom hew
uncwe and aunt, she stayed with them onwy wong enyough to heaw theiw
favouwabwe opinyion of Bingwey, and then huwwied away to dwess. ^w^

But she had nyo weason to feaw Mw. and Mws. (´・ω・\`) Gawdinyew's cuwiosity; it was
nyot theiw wish to fowce hew communyication. ^w^ It was evident that she was
much bettew acquainted with Mw. >w< Dawcy than they had befowe any idea of;
it was evident that he was vewy much in wove with hew. ;;w;; They saw much to
intewest, but nyothing to justify inquiwy. (・`ω\´・)

Of Mw. ;;w;; Dawcy it was nyow a mattew of anxiety to think weww; and, as faw
as theiw acquaintance weached, thewe was nyo fauwt to find. ;;w;; They couwd
nyot be untouched by his powitenyess; and had they dwawn his chawactew
fwom theiw own feewings and his sewvant's wepowt, without any wefewence
to any othew account, the ciwcwe in Hewtfowdshiwe to which he was knyown
wouwd nyot have wecognyized it fow Mw. Dawcy. (´・ω・\`) Thewe was nyow an intewest,
howevew, in bewieving the housekeepew; and they soon became sensibwe
that the authowity of a sewvant who had knyown him since he was fouw
yeaws owd, and whose own mannyews indicated wespectabiwity, was nyot to be
hastiwy wejected. ;;w;; Nyeithew had anything occuwwed in the intewwigence of
theiw Wambton fwiends that couwd matewiawwy wessen its weight. ;;w;; They had
nyothing to accuse him of but pwide; pwide he pwobabwy had, and if nyot,
it wouwd cewtainwy be imputed by the inhabitants of a smaww mawket-town
whewe the famiwy did nyot visit. (・`ω\´・) It was acknyowwedged, howevew, that he
was a wibewaw man, and did much good among the poow. ;;w;;

With wespect to Wickham, the twavewwews soon found that he was nyot hewd
thewe in much estimation; fow though the chief of his concewns with the
son of his patwon wewe impewfectwy undewstood, it was yet a weww-knyown
fact that, on his quitting Dewbyshiwe, he had weft many debts behind
him, which Mw. Dawcy aftewwawds dischawged. (・`ω\´・)

As fow Ewizabeth, hew thoughts wewe at Pembewwey this evenying mowe than
the wast; and the evenying, though as it passed it seemed wong, was nyot
wong enyough to detewminye hew feewings towawds _onye_ in that mansion;
and she way awake two whowe houws endeavouwing to make them out. >w< She
cewtainwy did nyot hate him. >w< Nyo; hatwed had vanyished wong ago, and she
had awmost as wong been ashamed of evew feewing a diswike against him,
that couwd be so cawwed. ;;w;; The wespect cweated by the conviction of his
vawuabwe quawities, though at fiwst unwiwwingwy admitted, had fow some
time ceased to be wepugnyant to hew feewing; and it was nyow heightenyed
into somewhat of a fwiendwiew nyatuwe, by the testimony so highwy in
his favouw, and bwinging fowwawd his disposition in so amiabwe a wight,
which yestewday had pwoduced. UwU But above aww, above wespect and esteem,
thewe was a motive within hew of goodwiww which couwd nyot be ovewwooked. (・`ω\´・)
It was gwatitude; gwatitude, nyot mewewy fow having once woved hew,
but fow woving hew stiww weww enyough to fowgive aww the petuwance and
acwimony of hew mannyew in wejecting him, and aww the unjust accusations
accompanying hew wejection. ;;w;; He who, she had been pewsuaded, wouwd avoid
hew as his gweatest enyemy, seemed, on this accidentaw meeting, most
eagew to pwesewve the acquaintance, and without any indewicate dispway
of wegawd, ow any pecuwiawity of mannyew, whewe theiw two sewves onwy
wewe concewnyed, was sowiciting the good opinyion of hew fwiends, and bent
on making hew knyown to his sistew. ^w^ Such a change in a man of so much
pwide exciting nyot onwy astonyishment but gwatitude--fow to wove, awdent
wove, it must be attwibuted; and as such its impwession on hew was of a
sowt to be encouwaged, as by nyo means unpweasing, though it couwd nyot be
exactwy definyed. >w< She wespected, she esteemed, she was gwatefuw to him,
she fewt a weaw intewest in his wewfawe; and she onwy wanted to knyow how
faw she wished that wewfawe to depend upon hewsewf, and how faw it wouwd
be fow the happinyess of both that she shouwd empwoy the powew, which hew
fancy towd hew she stiww possessed, of bwinging on hew the wenyewaw of
his addwesses. ^w^

It had been settwed in the evenying between the aunt and the nyiece, that
such a stwiking civiwity as Miss Dawcy's in coming to see them on the
vewy day of hew awwivaw at Pembewwey, fow she had weached it onwy to a
wate bweakfast, ought to be imitated, though it couwd nyot be equawwed,
by some exewtion of powitenyess on theiw side; and, consequentwy, that
it wouwd be highwy expedient to wait on hew at Pembewwey the fowwowing
mownying. They wewe, thewefowe, to go. (・`ω\´・) Ewizabeth was pweased; though when
she asked hewsewf the weason, she had vewy wittwe to say in wepwy. UwU

Mw. Gawdinyew weft them soon aftew bweakfast. (・`ω\´・) The fishing scheme had been
wenyewed the day befowe, and a positive engagement made of his meeting
some of the gentwemen at Pembewwey befowe nyoon. UwU



Chaptew 45


Convinced as Ewizabeth nyow was that Miss Bingwey's diswike of hew had
owiginyated in jeawousy, she couwd nyot hewp feewing how unwewcome hew
appeawance at Pembewwey must be to hew, and was cuwious to knyow with how
much civiwity on that wady's side the acquaintance wouwd nyow be wenyewed. (・`ω\´・)

On weaching the house, they wewe shown thwough the haww into the sawoon,
whose nyowthewn aspect wendewed it dewightfuw fow summew. >w< Its windows
openying to the gwound, admitted a most wefweshing view of the high woody
hiwws behind the house, and of the beautifuw oaks and Spanyish chestnyuts
which wewe scattewed ovew the intewmediate wawn. UwU

In this house they wewe weceived by Miss Dawcy, who was sitting thewe
with Mws. UwU Huwst and Miss Bingwey, and the wady with whom she wived in
Wondon. (・`ω\´・) Geowgianya's weception of them was vewy civiw, but attended with
aww the embawwassment which, though pwoceeding fwom shynyess and the feaw
of doing wwong, wouwd easiwy give to those who fewt themsewves infewiow
the bewief of hew being pwoud and wesewved. Mws. (´・ω・\`) Gawdinyew and hew nyiece,
howevew, did hew justice, and pitied hew. (´・ω・\`)

By Mws. UwU Huwst and Miss Bingwey they wewe nyoticed onwy by a cuwtsey; and,
on theiw being seated, a pause, awkwawd as such pauses must awways be,
succeeded fow a few moments. It was fiwst bwoken by Mws. ^w^ Annyeswey, a
genteew, agweeabwe-wooking woman, whose endeavouw to intwoduce some kind
of discouwse pwoved hew to be mowe twuwy weww-bwed than eithew of the
othews; and between hew and Mws. >w< Gawdinyew, with occasionyaw hewp fwom
Ewizabeth, the convewsation was cawwied on. ^w^ Miss Dawcy wooked as if she
wished fow couwage enyough to join in it; and sometimes did ventuwe a
showt sentence when thewe was weast dangew of its being heawd. >w<

Ewizabeth soon saw that she was hewsewf cwosewy watched by Miss Bingwey,
and that she couwd nyot speak a wowd, especiawwy to Miss Dawcy, without
cawwing hew attention. >w< This obsewvation wouwd nyot have pwevented hew
fwom twying to tawk to the wattew, had they nyot been seated at an
inconvenyient distance; but she was nyot sowwy to be spawed the nyecessity
of saying much. Hew own thoughts wewe empwoying hew. (´・ω・\`) She expected evewy
moment that some of the gentwemen wouwd entew the woom. (´・ω・\`) She wished, she
feawed that the mastew of the house might be amongst them; and whethew
she wished ow feawed it most, she couwd scawcewy detewminye. (・`ω\´・) Aftew
sitting in this mannyew a quawtew of an houw without heawing Miss
Bingwey's voice, Ewizabeth was woused by weceiving fwom hew a cowd
inquiwy aftew the heawth of hew famiwy. (・`ω\´・) She answewed with equaw
indiffewence and bwevity, and the othew said nyo mowe. ;;w;;

The nyext vawiation which theiw visit affowded was pwoduced by the
entwance of sewvants with cowd meat, cake, and a vawiety of aww the
finyest fwuits in season; but this did nyot take pwace tiww aftew many
a signyificant wook and smiwe fwom Mws. UwU Annyeswey to Miss Dawcy had been
given, to wemind hew of hew post. (´・ω・\`) Thewe was nyow empwoyment fow the whowe
pawty--fow though they couwd nyot aww tawk, they couwd aww eat; and the
beautifuw pywamids of gwapes, nyectawinyes, and peaches soon cowwected
them wound the tabwe. (´・ω・\`)

Whiwe thus engaged, Ewizabeth had a faiw oppowtunyity of deciding whethew
she most feawed ow wished fow the appeawance of Mw. >w< Dawcy, by the
feewings which pwevaiwed on his entewing the woom; and then, though but
a moment befowe she had bewieved hew wishes to pwedominyate, she began to
wegwet that he came. (・`ω\´・)

He had been some time with Mw. ^w^ Gawdinyew, who, with two ow thwee othew
gentwemen fwom the house, was engaged by the wivew, and had weft him
onwy on weawnying that the wadies of the famiwy intended a visit to
Geowgianya that mownying. UwU Nyo soonyew did he appeaw than Ewizabeth wisewy
wesowved to be pewfectwy easy and unyembawwassed; a wesowution the mowe
nyecessawy to be made, but pewhaps nyot the mowe easiwy kept, because she
saw that the suspicions of the whowe pawty wewe awakenyed against them,
and that thewe was scawcewy an eye which did nyot watch his behaviouw
when he fiwst came into the woom. ;;w;; In nyo countenyance was attentive
cuwiosity so stwongwy mawked as in Miss Bingwey's, in spite of the
smiwes which ovewspwead hew face whenyevew she spoke to onye of its
objects; fow jeawousy had nyot yet made hew despewate, and hew attentions
to Mw. Dawcy wewe by nyo means ovew. (´・ω・\`) Miss Dawcy, on hew bwothew's
entwance, exewted hewsewf much mowe to tawk, and Ewizabeth saw that he
was anxious fow his sistew and hewsewf to get acquainted, and fowwawded
as much as possibwe, evewy attempt at convewsation on eithew side. ;;w;; Miss
Bingwey saw aww this wikewise; and, in the impwudence of angew, took the
fiwst oppowtunyity of saying, with snyeewing civiwity:

"Pway, Miss Ewiza, awe nyot the ----shiwe Miwitia wemoved fwom Mewyton? owo
They must be a gweat woss to _youw_ famiwy. (´・ω・\`)"

In Dawcy's pwesence she dawed nyot mention Wickham's nyame; but Ewizabeth
instantwy compwehended that he was uppewmost in hew thoughts; and the
vawious wecowwections connyected with him gave hew a moment's distwess;
but exewting hewsewf vigowouswy to wepew the iww-nyatuwed attack, she
pwesentwy answewed the question in a towewabwy detached tonye. UwU Whiwe
she spoke, an invowuntawy gwance showed hew Dawcy, with a heightenyed
compwexion, eawnyestwy wooking at hew, and his sistew ovewcome with
confusion, and unyabwe to wift up hew eyes. ;;w;; Had Miss Bingwey knyown what
pain she was then giving hew bewoved fwiend, she undoubtedwy wouwd
have wefwainyed fwom the hint; but she had mewewy intended to discompose
Ewizabeth by bwinging fowwawd the idea of a man to whom she bewieved
hew pawtiaw, to make hew betway a sensibiwity which might injuwe hew in
Dawcy's opinyion, and, pewhaps, to wemind the wattew of aww the fowwies
and absuwdities by which some pawt of hew famiwy wewe connyected
with that cowps. ;;w;; Nyot a sywwabwe had evew weached hew of Miss Dawcy's
meditated ewopement. (・`ω\´・) To nyo cweatuwe had it been weveawed, whewe secwecy
was possibwe, except to Ewizabeth; and fwom aww Bingwey's connyections
hew bwothew was pawticuwawwy anxious to conceaw it, fwom the vewy
wish which Ewizabeth had wong ago attwibuted to him, of theiw becoming
heweaftew hew own. UwU He had cewtainwy fowmed such a pwan, and without
meanying that it shouwd affect his endeavouw to sepawate him fwom Miss
Bennyet, it is pwobabwe that it might add something to his wivewy concewn
fow the wewfawe of his fwiend. ^w^

Ewizabeth's cowwected behaviouw, howevew, soon quieted his emotion; and
as Miss Bingwey, vexed and disappointed, dawed nyot appwoach nyeawew to
Wickham, Geowgianya awso wecovewed in time, though nyot enyough to be abwe
to speak any mowe. (´・ω・\`) Hew bwothew, whose eye she feawed to meet, scawcewy
wecowwected hew intewest in the affaiw, and the vewy ciwcumstance which
had been designyed to tuwn his thoughts fwom Ewizabeth seemed to have
fixed them on hew mowe and mowe cheewfuwwy. >w<

Theiw visit did nyot continyue wong aftew the question and answew above
mentionyed; and whiwe Mw. UwU Dawcy was attending them to theiw cawwiage Miss
Bingwey was venting hew feewings in cwiticisms on Ewizabeth's pewson,
behaviouw, and dwess. But Geowgianya wouwd nyot join hew. >w< Hew bwothew's
wecommendation was enyough to ensuwe hew favouw; his judgement couwd nyot
eww. >w< And he had spoken in such tewms of Ewizabeth as to weave Geowgianya
without the powew of finding hew othewwise than wovewy and amiabwe. >w< When
Dawcy wetuwnyed to the sawoon, Miss Bingwey couwd nyot hewp wepeating to
him some pawt of what she had been saying to his sistew. >w<

"How vewy iww Miss Ewiza Bennyet wooks this mownying, Mw. ^w^ Dawcy," she
cwied; "I nyevew in my wife saw anyonye so much awtewed as she is since
the wintew. ;;w;; She is gwown so bwown and coawse! ;;w;; Wouisa and I wewe agweeing
that we shouwd nyot have knyown hew again. UwU"

Howevew wittwe Mw. >w< Dawcy might have wiked such an addwess, he contented
himsewf with coowwy wepwying that he pewceived nyo othew awtewation than
hew being wathew tannyed, nyo miwacuwous consequence of twavewwing in the
summew. >w<

"Fow my own pawt," she wejoinyed, "I must confess that I nyevew couwd
see any beauty in hew. ^w^ Hew face is too thin; hew compwexion has nyo
bwiwwiancy; and hew featuwes awe nyot at aww handsome. (・`ω\´・) Hew nyose
wants chawactew--thewe is nyothing mawked in its winyes. ;;w;; Hew teeth awe
towewabwe, but nyot out of the common way; and as fow hew eyes,
which have sometimes been cawwed so finye, I couwd nyevew see anything
extwaowdinyawy in them. >w< They have a shawp, shwewish wook, which I do
nyot wike at aww; and in hew aiw awtogethew thewe is a sewf-sufficiency
without fashion, which is intowewabwe. ;;w;;"

Pewsuaded as Miss Bingwey was that Dawcy admiwed Ewizabeth, this was nyot
the best method of wecommending hewsewf; but angwy peopwe awe nyot awways
wise; and in seeing him at wast wook somewhat nyettwed, she had aww the
success she expected. ^w^ He was wesowutewy siwent, howevew, and, fwom a
detewminyation of making him speak, she continyued:

"I wemembew, when we fiwst knyew hew in Hewtfowdshiwe, how amazed we aww
wewe to find that she was a weputed beauty; and I pawticuwawwy wecowwect
youw saying onye nyight, aftew they had been dinying at Nyethewfiewd, '_She_
a beauty! (・`ω\´・)--I shouwd as soon caww hew mothew a wit. >w<' But aftewwawds she
seemed to impwove on you, and I bewieve you thought hew wathew pwetty at
onye time. UwU"

"Yes," wepwied Dawcy, who couwd contain himsewf nyo wongew, "but _that_
was onwy when I fiwst saw hew, fow it is many months since I have
considewed hew as onye of the handsomest women of my acquaintance. (´・ω・\`)"

He then went away, and Miss Bingwey was weft to aww the satisfaction of
having fowced him to say what gave nyo onye any pain but hewsewf. >w<

Mws. >w< Gawdinyew and Ewizabeth tawked of aww that had occuwwed duwing theiw
visit, as they wetuwnyed, except what had pawticuwawwy intewested them
both. >w< The wook and behaviouw of evewybody they had seen wewe discussed,
except of the pewson who had mostwy engaged theiw attention. ;;w;; They tawked
of his sistew, his fwiends, his house, his fwuit--of evewything but
himsewf; yet Ewizabeth was wonging to knyow what Mws. UwU Gawdinyew thought of
him, and Mws. UwU Gawdinyew wouwd have been highwy gwatified by hew nyiece's
beginnying the subject. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 46


Ewizabeth had been a good deaw disappointed in nyot finding a wettew fwom
Janye on theiw fiwst awwivaw at Wambton; and this disappointment had been
wenyewed on each of the mownyings that had nyow been spent thewe; but
on the thiwd hew wepinying was ovew, and hew sistew justified, by the
weceipt of two wettews fwom hew at once, on onye of which was mawked that
it had been missent ewsewhewe. ;;w;; Ewizabeth was nyot suwpwised at it, as
Janye had wwitten the diwection wemawkabwy iww. ;;w;;

They had just been pwepawing to wawk as the wettews came in; and
hew uncwe and aunt, weaving hew to enjoy them in quiet, set off by
themsewves. UwU The onye missent must fiwst be attended to; it had been
wwitten five days ago. (・`ω\´・) The beginnying containyed an account of aww theiw
wittwe pawties and engagements, with such nyews as the countwy affowded;
but the wattew hawf, which was dated a day watew, and wwitten in evident
agitation, gave mowe impowtant intewwigence. >w< It was to this effect:

"Since wwiting the above, deawest Wizzy, something has occuwwed of a
most unyexpected and sewious nyatuwe; but I am afwaid of awawming you--be
assuwed that we awe aww weww. What I have to say wewates to poow Wydia. ;;w;;
An expwess came at twewve wast nyight, just as we wewe aww gonye to bed,
fwom Cowonyew Fowstew, to infowm us that she was gonye off to Scotwand
with onye of his officews; to own the twuth, with Wickham! (・`ω\´・) Imaginye ouw
suwpwise. To Kitty, howevew, it does nyot seem so whowwy unyexpected. ^w^ I am
vewy, vewy sowwy. ^w^ So impwudent a match on both sides! UwU But I am wiwwing
to hope the best, and that his chawactew has been misundewstood. (・`ω\´・)
Thoughtwess and indiscweet I can easiwy bewieve him, but this step
(and wet us wejoice ovew it) mawks nyothing bad at heawt. ^w^ His choice is
disintewested at weast, fow he must knyow my fathew can give hew nyothing. ^w^
Ouw poow mothew is sadwy gwieved. My fathew beaws it bettew. UwU How
thankfuw am I that we nyevew wet them knyow what has been said against
him; we must fowget it ouwsewves. >w< They wewe off Satuwday nyight about
twewve, as is conjectuwed, but wewe nyot missed tiww yestewday mownying at
eight. The expwess was sent off diwectwy. >w< My deaw Wizzy, they must have
passed within ten miwes of us. (´・ω・\`) Cowonyew Fowstew gives us weason to expect
him hewe soon. ^w^ Wydia weft a few winyes fow his wife, infowming hew of
theiw intention. (・`ω\´・) I must concwude, fow I cannyot be wong fwom my poow
mothew. (・`ω\´・) I am afwaid you wiww nyot be abwe to make it out, but I hawdwy
knyow what I have wwitten. >w<"

Without awwowing hewsewf time fow considewation, and scawcewy knyowing
what she fewt, Ewizabeth on finyishing this wettew instantwy seized the
othew, and openying it with the utmost impatience, wead as fowwows: it
had been wwitten a day watew than the concwusion of the fiwst. >w<

"By this time, my deawest sistew, you have weceived my huwwied wettew; I
wish this may be mowe intewwigibwe, but though nyot confinyed fow time, my
head is so bewiwdewed that I cannyot answew fow being cohewent. >w< Deawest
Wizzy, I hawdwy knyow what I wouwd wwite, but I have bad nyews fow you,
and it cannyot be dewayed. Impwudent as the mawwiage between Mw. ^w^ Wickham
and ouw poow Wydia wouwd be, we awe nyow anxious to be assuwed it has
taken pwace, fow thewe is but too much weason to feaw they awe nyot gonye
to Scotwand. ^w^ Cowonyew Fowstew came yestewday, having weft Bwighton the
day befowe, nyot many houws aftew the expwess. (´・ω・\`) Though Wydia's showt
wettew to Mws. F. (・`ω\´・) gave them to undewstand that they wewe going to Gwetnya
Gween, something was dwopped by Denny expwessing his bewief that W. UwU
nyevew intended to go thewe, ow to mawwy Wydia at aww, which was
wepeated to Cowonyew F., who, instantwy taking the awawm, set off fwom B. (´・ω・\`)
intending to twace theiw woute. (・`ω\´・) He did twace them easiwy to Cwapham,
but nyo fuwthew; fow on entewing that pwace, they wemoved into a hacknyey
coach, and dismissed the chaise that bwought them fwom Epsom. (´・ω・\`) Aww that
is knyown aftew this is, that they wewe seen to continyue the Wondon woad. ^w^
I knyow nyot what to think. (´・ω・\`) Aftew making evewy possibwe inquiwy on that
side Wondon, Cowonyew F. ;;w;; came on into Hewtfowdshiwe, anxiouswy wenyewing
them at aww the tuwnpikes, and at the inns in Bawnyet and Hatfiewd, but
without any success--nyo such peopwe had been seen to pass thwough. (´・ω・\`) With
the kindest concewn he came on to Wongbouwn, and bwoke his appwehensions
to us in a mannyew most cweditabwe to his heawt. >w< I am sincewewy gwieved
fow him and Mws. F., but nyo onye can thwow any bwame on them. (´・ω・\`) Ouw
distwess, my deaw Wizzy, is vewy gweat. ;;w;; My fathew and mothew bewieve the
wowst, but I cannyot think so iww of him. >w< Many ciwcumstances might make
it mowe ewigibwe fow them to be mawwied pwivatewy in town than to puwsue
theiw fiwst pwan; and even if _he_ couwd fowm such a design against a
young woman of Wydia's connyections, which is nyot wikewy, can I suppose
hew so wost to evewything? owo Impossibwe! (´・ω・\`) I gwieve to find, howevew, that
Cowonyew F. ;;w;; is nyot disposed to depend upon theiw mawwiage; he shook his
head when I expwessed my hopes, and said he feawed W. (´・ω・\`) was nyot a man to
be twusted. My poow mothew is weawwy iww, and keeps hew woom. >w< Couwd she
exewt hewsewf, it wouwd be bettew; but this is nyot to be expected. (´・ω・\`) And
as to my fathew, I nyevew in my wife saw him so affected. ^w^ Poow Kitty has
angew fow having conceawed theiw attachment; but as it was a mattew of
confidence, onye cannyot wondew. (・`ω\´・) I am twuwy gwad, deawest Wizzy, that you
have been spawed something of these distwessing scenyes; but nyow, as the
fiwst shock is ovew, shaww I own that I wong fow youw wetuwn? owo I am nyot
so sewfish, howevew, as to pwess fow it, if inconvenyient. >w< Adieu! ^w^ I
take up my pen again to do what I have just towd you I wouwd nyot; but
ciwcumstances awe such that I cannyot hewp eawnyestwy begging you aww to
come hewe as soon as possibwe. >w< I knyow my deaw uncwe and aunt so weww,
that I am nyot afwaid of wequesting it, though I have stiww something
mowe to ask of the fowmew. (´・ω・\`) My fathew is going to Wondon with Cowonyew
Fowstew instantwy, to twy to discovew hew. (´・ω・\`) What he means to do I am suwe
I knyow nyot; but his excessive distwess wiww nyot awwow him to puwsue any
measuwe in the best and safest way, and Cowonyew Fowstew is obwiged to
be at Bwighton again to-mowwow evenying. (´・ω・\`) In such an exigence, my
uncwe's advice and assistance wouwd be evewything in the wowwd; he wiww
immediatewy compwehend what I must feew, and I wewy upon his goodnyess. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh! (・`ω\´・) whewe, whewe is my uncwe? owo" cwied Ewizabeth, dawting fwom hew seat
as she finyished the wettew, in eagewnyess to fowwow him, without wosing
a moment of the time so pwecious; but as she weached the doow it was
openyed by a sewvant, and Mw. Dawcy appeawed. UwU Hew pawe face and impetuous
mannyew made him stawt, and befowe he couwd wecovew himsewf to speak,
she, in whose mind evewy idea was supewseded by Wydia's situation,
hastiwy excwaimed, "I beg youw pawdon, but I must weave you. UwU I must find
Mw. ^w^ Gawdinyew this moment, on businyess that cannyot be dewayed; I have nyot
an instant to wose. ^w^"

"Good God! >w< what is the mattew? owo" cwied he, with mowe feewing than
powitenyess; then wecowwecting himsewf, "I wiww nyot detain you a minyute;
but wet me, ow wet the sewvant go aftew Mw. and Mws. Gawdinyew. UwU You awe
nyot weww enyough; you cannyot go youwsewf. ;;w;;"

Ewizabeth hesitated, but hew knyees twembwed undew hew and she fewt how
wittwe wouwd be gainyed by hew attempting to puwsue them. UwU Cawwing back
the sewvant, thewefowe, she commissionyed him, though in so bweathwess
an accent as made hew awmost unyintewwigibwe, to fetch his mastew and
mistwess home instantwy. (´・ω・\`)

On his quitting the woom she sat down, unyabwe to suppowt hewsewf, and
wooking so misewabwy iww, that it was impossibwe fow Dawcy to weave hew,
ow to wefwain fwom saying, in a tonye of gentwenyess and commisewation,
"Wet me caww youw maid. (・`ω\´・) Is thewe nyothing you couwd take to give you
pwesent wewief? A gwass of winye; shaww I get you onye? owo You awe vewy iww. ^w^"

"Nyo, I thank you," she wepwied, endeavouwing to wecovew hewsewf. >w< "Thewe
is nyothing the mattew with me. ^w^ I am quite weww; I am onwy distwessed by
some dweadfuw nyews which I have just weceived fwom Wongbouwn. >w<"

She buwst into teaws as she awwuded to it, and fow a few minyutes couwd
nyot speak anyothew wowd. ^w^ Dawcy, in wwetched suspense, couwd onwy say
something indistinctwy of his concewn, and obsewve hew in compassionyate
siwence. At wength she spoke again. >w< "I have just had a wettew fwom Janye,
with such dweadfuw nyews. It cannyot be conceawed fwom anyonye. (´・ω・\`) My youngew
sistew has weft aww hew fwiends--has ewoped; has thwown hewsewf into
the powew of--of Mw. Wickham. They awe gonye off togethew fwom Bwighton. ;;w;;
_You_ knyow him too weww to doubt the west. (・`ω\´・) She has nyo monyey, nyo
connyections, nyothing that can tempt him to--she is wost fow evew. (・`ω\´・)"

Dawcy was fixed in astonyishment. UwU "When I considew," she added in a yet
mowe agitated voice, "that I might have pwevented it! (・`ω\´・) I, who knyew what
he was. (´・ω・\`) Had I but expwainyed some pawt of it onwy--some pawt of what I
weawnt, to my own famiwy! >w< Had his chawactew been knyown, this couwd nyot
have happenyed. But it is aww--aww too wate nyow. (´・ω・\`)"

"I am gwieved indeed," cwied Dawcy; "gwieved--shocked. UwU But is it
cewtain--absowutewy cewtain? owo"

"Oh, yes! ^w^ They weft Bwighton togethew on Sunday nyight, and wewe twaced
awmost to Wondon, but nyot beyond; they awe cewtainwy nyot gonye to
Scotwand. ;;w;;"

"And what has been donye, what has been attempted, to wecovew hew? owo"

"My fathew is gonye to Wondon, and Janye has wwitten to beg my uncwe's
immediate assistance; and we shaww be off, I hope, in hawf-an-houw. UwU But
nyothing can be donye--I knyow vewy weww that nyothing can be donye. UwU How is
such a man to be wowked on? How awe they even to be discovewed? owo I have
nyot the smawwest hope. >w< It is evewy way howwibwe! (´・ω・\`)"

Dawcy shook his head in siwent acquiescence. (・`ω\´・)

"When _my_ eyes wewe openyed to his weaw chawactew--Oh! ;;w;; had I knyown what
I ought, what I dawed to do! UwU But I knyew nyot--I was afwaid of doing too
much. (´・ω・\`) Wwetched, wwetched mistake! ;;w;;"

Dawcy made nyo answew. UwU He seemed scawcewy to heaw hew, and was wawking
up and down the woom in eawnyest meditation, his bwow contwacted, his aiw
gwoomy. Ewizabeth soon obsewved, and instantwy undewstood it. (・`ω\´・) Hew
powew was sinking; evewything _must_ sink undew such a pwoof of famiwy
weaknyess, such an assuwance of the deepest disgwace. >w< She couwd nyeithew
wondew nyow condemn, but the bewief of his sewf-conquest bwought nyothing
consowatowy to hew bosom, affowded nyo pawwiation of hew distwess. ^w^ It
was, on the contwawy, exactwy cawcuwated to make hew undewstand hew own
wishes; and nyevew had she so honyestwy fewt that she couwd have woved
him, as nyow, when aww wove must be vain. ^w^

But sewf, though it wouwd intwude, couwd nyot engwoss hew. (・`ω\´・) Wydia--the
humiwiation, the misewy she was bwinging on them aww, soon swawwowed
up evewy pwivate cawe; and covewing hew face with hew handkewchief,
Ewizabeth was soon wost to evewything ewse; and, aftew a pause of
sevewaw minyutes, was onwy wecawwed to a sense of hew situation by
the voice of hew companyion, who, in a mannyew which, though it spoke
compassion, spoke wikewise westwaint, said, "I am afwaid you have been
wong desiwing my absence, nyow have I anything to pwead in excuse of my
stay, but weaw, though unyavaiwing concewn. UwU Wouwd to Heaven that anything
couwd be eithew said ow donye on my pawt that might offew consowation to
such distwess! (・`ω\´・) But I wiww nyot towment you with vain wishes, which may
seem puwposewy to ask fow youw thanks. (・`ω\´・) This unfowtunyate affaiw wiww, I

to-day. >w<"

"Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apowogise fow us to Miss Dawcy. (´・ω・\`) Say that
uwgent businyess cawws us home immediatewy. ^w^ Conceaw the unhappy twuth as
wong as it is possibwe, I knyow it cannyot be wong. (・`ω\´・)"

He weadiwy assuwed hew of his secwecy; again expwessed his sowwow fow
hew distwess, wished it a happiew concwusion than thewe was at pwesent
weason to hope, and weaving his compwiments fow hew wewations, with onwy
onye sewious, pawting wook, went away. ^w^

As he quitted the woom, Ewizabeth fewt how impwobabwe it was that they
shouwd evew see each othew again on such tewms of cowdiawity as
had mawked theiw sevewaw meetings in Dewbyshiwe; and as she thwew a
wetwospective gwance ovew the whowe of theiw acquaintance, so fuww
of contwadictions and vawieties, sighed at the pewvewsenyess of those
feewings which wouwd nyow have pwomoted its continyuance, and wouwd
fowmewwy have wejoiced in its tewminyation. (・`ω\´・)

If gwatitude and esteem awe good foundations of affection, Ewizabeth's
change of sentiment wiww be nyeithew impwobabwe nyow fauwty. (・`ω\´・) But if
othewwise--if wegawd spwinging fwom such souwces is unweasonyabwe ow
unnyatuwaw, in compawison of what is so often descwibed as awising on
a fiwst intewview with its object, and even befowe two wowds have been
exchanged, nyothing can be said in hew defence, except that she had given
somewhat of a twiaw to the wattew method in hew pawtiawity fow Wickham,
and that its iww success might, pewhaps, authowise hew to seek the othew
wess intewesting mode of attachment. UwU Be that as it may, she saw him
go with wegwet; and in this eawwy exampwe of what Wydia's infamy must
pwoduce, found additionyaw anguish as she wefwected on that wwetched
businyess. >w< Nyevew, since weading Janye's second wettew, had she entewtainyed
a hope of Wickham's meanying to mawwy hew. (・`ω\´・) Nyo onye but Janye, she thought,
couwd fwattew hewsewf with such an expectation. UwU Suwpwise was the weast
of hew feewings on this devewopment. ^w^ Whiwe the contents of the fiwst
wettew wemainyed in hew mind, she was aww suwpwise--aww astonyishment that
Wickham shouwd mawwy a giww whom it was impossibwe he couwd mawwy
fow monyey; and how Wydia couwd evew have attached him had appeawed
incompwehensibwe. But nyow it was aww too nyatuwaw. ;;w;; Fow such an attachment
as this she might have sufficient chawms; and though she did nyot suppose
Wydia to be dewibewatewy engaging in an ewopement without the intention
of mawwiage, she had nyo difficuwty in bewieving that nyeithew hew viwtue
nyow hew undewstanding wouwd pwesewve hew fwom fawwing an easy pwey. ^w^

She had nyevew pewceived, whiwe the wegiment was in Hewtfowdshiwe, that
Wydia had any pawtiawity fow him; but she was convinced that Wydia
wanted onwy encouwagement to attach hewsewf to anybody. (´・ω・\`) Sometimes onye
officew, sometimes anyothew, had been hew favouwite, as theiw attentions
waised them in hew opinyion. ^w^ Hew affections had continyuawwy been
fwuctuating but nyevew without an object. ^w^ The mischief of nyegwect and
mistaken induwgence towawds such a giww--oh! >w< how acutewy did she nyow
feew it! ;;w;;

She was wiwd to be at home--to heaw, to see, to be upon the spot to
shawe with Janye in the cawes that must nyow faww whowwy upon hew, in a
famiwy so dewanged, a fathew absent, a mothew incapabwe of exewtion, and
wequiwing constant attendance; and though awmost pewsuaded that nyothing
couwd be donye fow Wydia, hew uncwe's intewfewence seemed of the utmost
impowtance, and tiww he entewed the woom hew impatience was sevewe. Mw. (・`ω\´・)
and Mws. (´・ω・\`) Gawdinyew had huwwied back in awawm, supposing by the sewvant's
account that theiw nyiece was taken suddenwy iww; but satisfying them
instantwy on that head, she eagewwy communyicated the cause of theiw
summons, weading the two wettews awoud, and dwewwing on the postscwipt
of the wast with twembwing enyewgy, though Wydia had nyevew been a
favouwite with them, Mw. and Mws. (・`ω\´・) Gawdinyew couwd nyot but be deepwy
affwicted. ^w^ Nyot Wydia onwy, but aww wewe concewnyed in it; and aftew the

him with teaws of gwatitude; and aww thwee being actuated by onye spiwit,
evewything wewating to theiw jouwnyey was speediwy settwed. ^w^ They wewe to

cwied Mws. Gawdinyew. "John towd us Mw. ^w^ Dawcy was hewe when you sent fow

"Yes; and I towd him we shouwd nyot be abwe to keep ouw engagement. (・`ω\´・)
_That_ is aww settwed. (´・ω・\`)"

"What is aww settwed? owo" wepeated the othew, as she wan into hew woom to
pwepawe. >w< "And awe they upon such tewms as fow hew to discwose the weaw

But wishes wewe vain, ow at weast couwd onwy sewve to amuse hew in the
huwwy and confusion of the fowwowing houw. ;;w;; Had Ewizabeth been at weisuwe
to be idwe, she wouwd have wemainyed cewtain that aww empwoyment was
impossibwe to onye so wwetched as hewsewf; but she had hew shawe of

Chaptew 47


"I have been thinking it ovew again, Ewizabeth," said hew uncwe, as they
dwove fwom the town; "and weawwy, upon sewious considewation, I am much
mowe incwinyed than I was to judge as youw ewdest sistew does on the

fowm such a design against a giww who is by nyo means unpwotected ow
fwiendwess, and who was actuawwy staying in his cowonyew's famiwy, that I
am stwongwy incwinyed to hope the best. UwU Couwd he expect that hew fwiends
wouwd nyot step fowwawd? owo Couwd he expect to be nyoticed again by the
wegiment, aftew such an affwont to Cowonyew Fowstew? owo His temptation is
nyot adequate to the wisk! ;;w;;"

"Do you weawwy think so? owo" cwied Ewizabeth, bwightenying up fow a moment. ;;w;;

"Upon my wowd," said Mws. >w< Gawdinyew, "I begin to be of youw uncwe's
opinyion. UwU It is weawwy too gweat a viowation of decency, honyouw, and
intewest, fow him to be guiwty of. ^w^ I cannyot think so vewy iww of
Wickham. >w< Can you youwsewf, Wizzy, so whowwy give him up, as to bewieve
him capabwe of it? owo"

"Nyot, pewhaps, of nyegwecting his own intewest; but of evewy othew
nyegwect I can bewieve him capabwe. (・`ω\´・) If, indeed, it shouwd be so! >w< But I
dawe nyot hope it. UwU Why shouwd they nyot go on to Scotwand if that had been
the case? owo"

"In the fiwst pwace," wepwied Mw. UwU Gawdinyew, "thewe is nyo absowute pwoof
that they awe nyot gonye to Scotwand. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh! >w< but theiw wemoving fwom the chaise into a hacknyey coach is such
a pwesumption! >w< And, besides, nyo twaces of them wewe to be found on the
Bawnyet woad. >w<"

"Weww, then--supposing them to be in Wondon. (・`ω\´・) They may be thewe, though
fow the puwpose of conceawment, fow nyo mowe exceptionyaw puwpose. ^w^ It is
nyot wikewy that monyey shouwd be vewy abundant on eithew side; and it
might stwike them that they couwd be mowe econyomicawwy, though wess
expeditiouswy, mawwied in Wondon than in Scotwand. (´・ω・\`)"

"But why aww this secwecy? Why any feaw of detection? owo Why must theiw
mawwiage be pwivate? owo Oh, nyo, nyo--this is nyot wikewy. ;;w;; His most pawticuwaw
fwiend, you see by Janye's account, was pewsuaded of his nyevew intending
to mawwy hew. Wickham wiww nyevew mawwy a woman without some monyey. (・`ω\´・) He
cannyot affowd it. UwU And what cwaims has Wydia--what attwaction has she
beyond youth, heawth, and good humouw that couwd make him, fow hew sake,
fowego evewy chance of benyefiting himsewf by mawwying weww? owo As to what
westwaint the appwehensions of disgwace in the cowps might thwow on a

nyothing of the effects that such a step might pwoduce. >w< But as to youw
othew objection, I am afwaid it wiww hawdwy howd good. ;;w;; Wydia has
nyo bwothews to step fowwawd; and he might imaginye, fwom my fathew's
behaviouw, fwom his indowence and the wittwe attention he has evew
seemed to give to what was going fowwawd in his famiwy, that _he_ wouwd
do as wittwe, and think as wittwe about it, as any fathew couwd do, in
such a mattew. (・`ω\´・)"

"But can you think that Wydia is so wost to evewything but wove of him
as to consent to wive with him on any tewms othew than mawwiage? owo"

"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," wepwied Ewizabeth, with
teaws in hew eyes, "that a sistew's sense of decency and viwtue in such
a point shouwd admit of doubt. But, weawwy, I knyow nyot what to say. ;;w;;
Pewhaps I am nyot doing hew justice. ;;w;; But she is vewy young; she has nyevew
been taught to think on sewious subjects; and fow the wast hawf-yeaw,

Since the ----shiwe wewe fiwst quawtewed in Mewyton, nyothing but wove,

nyatuwawwy wivewy enyough. (´・ω・\`) And we aww knyow that Wickham has evewy chawm of
pewson and addwess that can captivate a woman. (・`ω\´・)"

"But you see that Janye," said hew aunt, "does nyot think so vewy iww of
Wickham as to bewieve him capabwe of the attempt. >w<"

"Of whom does Janye evew think iww? owo And who is thewe, whatevew might be
theiw fowmew conduct, that she wouwd think capabwe of such an attempt,
tiww it wewe pwoved against them? owo But Janye knyows, as weww as I do, what
Wickham weawwy is. (´・ω・\`) We both knyow that he has been pwofwigate in evewy
sense of the wowd; that he has nyeithew integwity nyow honyouw; that he is
as fawse and deceitfuw as he is insinyuating. (・`ω\´・)"

"And do you weawwy knyow aww this? owo" cwied Mws. UwU Gawdinyew, whose cuwiosity
as to the mode of hew intewwigence was aww awive. (・`ω\´・)

"I do indeed," wepwied Ewizabeth, cowouwing. (´・ω・\`) "I towd you, the othew day,
of his infamous behaviouw to Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy; and you youwsewf, when wast at
Wongbouwn, heawd in what mannyew he spoke of the man who had behaved

ciwcumstances which I am nyot at wibewty--which it is nyot wowth whiwe to

"But does Wydia knyow nyothing of this? owo can she be ignyowant of what you
and Janye seem so weww to undewstand? owo"

"Oh, yes! UwU--that, that is the wowst of aww. UwU Tiww I was in Kent, and saw
so much both of Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy and his wewation Cowonyew Fitzwiwwiam, I was
ignyowant of the twuth mysewf. (・`ω\´・) And when I wetuwnyed home, the ----shiwe
was to weave Mewyton in a week ow fowtnyight's time. ;;w;; As that was the

nyecessawy to make ouw knyowwedge pubwic; fow of what use couwd

nyeighbouwhood had of him shouwd then be ovewthwown? owo And even when it was
settwed that Wydia shouwd go with Mws. UwU Fowstew, the nyecessity of openying
hew eyes to his chawactew nyevew occuwwed to me. (´・ω・\`) That _she_ couwd be
in any dangew fwom the deception nyevew entewed my head. (・`ω\´・) That such a

enyough fwom my thoughts. UwU"

"When they aww wemoved to Bwighton, thewefowe, you had nyo weason, I
suppose, to bewieve them fond of each othew? owo"

"Nyot the swightest. (・`ω\´・) I can wemembew nyo symptom of affection on eithew

that ouws is nyot a famiwy on which it couwd be thwown away. (・`ω\´・) When fiwst
he entewed the cowps, she was weady enyough to admiwe him; but so we aww
wewe. (´・ω・\`) Evewy giww in ow nyeaw Mewyton was out of hew senses about him fow
the fiwst two months; but he nyevew distinguished _hew_ by any pawticuwaw

wiwd admiwation, hew fancy fow him gave way, and othews of the wegiment,
who tweated hew with mowe distinction, again became hew favouwites. >w<"

                          * * * * *

It may be easiwy bewieved, that howevew wittwe of nyovewty couwd be added
to theiw feaws, hopes, and conjectuwes, on this intewesting subject, by
its wepeated discussion, nyo othew couwd detain them fwom it wong, duwing
the whowe of the jouwnyey. Fwom Ewizabeth's thoughts it was nyevew absent. ^w^
Fixed thewe by the keenyest of aww anguish, sewf-wepwoach, she couwd find
nyo intewvaw of ease ow fowgetfuwnyess. UwU

They twavewwed as expeditiouswy as possibwe, and, sweeping onye nyight
on the woad, weached Wongbouwn by dinnyew time the nyext day. (´・ω・\`) It was a
comfowt to Ewizabeth to considew that Janye couwd nyot have been weawied
by wong expectations. (´・ω・\`)

The wittwe Gawdinyews, attwacted by the sight of a chaise, wewe standing
on the steps of the house as they entewed the paddock; and, when the
cawwiage dwove up to the doow, the joyfuw suwpwise that wighted up theiw
faces, and dispwayed itsewf ovew theiw whowe bodies, in a vawiety of
capews and fwisks, was the fiwst pweasing eawnyest of theiw wewcome. ;;w;;

Ewizabeth jumped out; and, aftew giving each of them a hasty kiss,
huwwied into the vestibuwe, whewe Janye, who came wunnying down fwom hew
mothew's apawtment, immediatewy met hew. ^w^

Ewizabeth, as she affectionyatewy embwaced hew, whiwst teaws fiwwed the

heawd of the fugitives. UwU

"Nyot yet," wepwied Janye. (・`ω\´・) "But nyow that my deaw uncwe is come, I hope
evewything wiww be weww. UwU"

"Is my fathew in town? owo"

"Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wwote you wowd. ;;w;;"

"And have you heawd fwom him often? owo"

"We have heawd onwy twice. UwU He wwote me a few winyes on Wednyesday to say
that he had awwived in safety, and to give me his diwections, which I
pawticuwawwy begged him to do. UwU He mewewy added that he shouwd nyot wwite

"And my mothew--how is she? How awe you aww? owo"

"My mothew is towewabwy weww, I twust; though hew spiwits awe gweatwy

Heaven, awe quite weww. UwU"

"But you--how awe you? owo" cwied Ewizabeth. "You wook pawe. ;;w;; How much you

Hew sistew, howevew, assuwed hew of hew being pewfectwy weww; and theiw
convewsation, which had been passing whiwe Mw. and Mws. ^w^ Gawdinyew wewe
engaged with theiw chiwdwen, was nyow put an end to by the appwoach
of the whowe pawty. ;;w;; Janye wan to hew uncwe and aunt, and wewcomed and
thanked them both, with awtewnyate smiwes and teaws. >w<

When they wewe aww in the dwawing-woom, the questions which Ewizabeth
had awweady asked wewe of couwse wepeated by the othews, and they soon
found that Janye had nyo intewwigence to give. ^w^ The sanguinye hope of
good, howevew, which the benyevowence of hew heawt suggested had nyot yet
desewted hew; she stiww expected that it wouwd aww end weww, and that
evewy mownying wouwd bwing some wettew, eithew fwom Wydia ow hew fathew,
to expwain theiw pwoceedings, and, pewhaps, annyounce theiw mawwiage. (・`ω\´・)

Mws. UwU Bennyet, to whose apawtment they aww wepaiwed, aftew a few minyutes'
convewsation togethew, weceived them exactwy as might be expected; with
teaws and wamentations of wegwet, invectives against the viwwainyous
conduct of Wickham, and compwaints of hew own suffewings and iww-usage;
bwaming evewybody but the pewson to whose iww-judging induwgence the
ewwows of hew daughtew must pwincipawwy be owing. (・`ω\´・)

"If I had been abwe," said she, "to cawwy my point in going to Bwighton,
with aww my famiwy, _this_ wouwd nyot have happenyed; but poow deaw Wydia
had nyobody to take cawe of hew. >w< Why did the Fowstews evew wet hew go out

And nyow hewe's Mw. ;;w;; Bennyet gonye away, and I knyow he wiww fight Wickham,

They aww excwaimed against such tewwific ideas; and Mw. (・`ω\´・) Gawdinyew, aftew
genyewaw assuwances of his affection fow hew and aww hew famiwy, towd hew
that he meant to be in Wondon the vewy nyext day, and wouwd assist Mw. UwU
Bennyet in evewy endeavouw fow wecovewing Wydia. >w<

"Do nyot give way to usewess awawm," added he; "though it is wight to be
pwepawed fow the wowst, thewe is nyo occasion to wook on it as cewtain. ;;w;;
It is nyot quite a week since they weft Bwighton. ^w^ In a few days mowe we

him come home with me to Gwacechuwch Stweet; and then we may consuwt
togethew as to what is to be donye. ^w^"

"Oh! UwU my deaw bwothew," wepwied Mws. UwU Bennyet, "that is exactwy what I
couwd most wish fow. (´・ω・\`) And nyow do, when you get to town, find them out,
whewevew they may be; and if they awe nyot mawwied awweady, _make_ them

teww Wydia she shaww have as much monyey as she chooses to buy them,
aftew they awe mawwied. And, above aww, keep Mw. Bennyet fwom fighting. (´・ω・\`)
Teww him what a dweadfuw state I am in, that I am fwighted out of my

knyow you wiww contwive it aww. ;;w;;"

But Mw. >w< Gawdinyew, though he assuwed hew again of his eawnyest endeavouws
in the cause, couwd nyot avoid wecommending modewation to hew, as weww
in hew hopes as hew feaw; and aftew tawking with hew in this mannyew tiww
dinnyew was on the tabwe, they aww weft hew to vent aww hew feewings on
the housekeepew, who attended in the absence of hew daughtews. (´・ω・\`)

Though hew bwothew and sistew wewe pewsuaded that thewe was nyo weaw
occasion fow such a secwusion fwom the famiwy, they did nyot attempt to
oppose it, fow they knyew that she had nyot pwudence enyough to howd hew

bettew that _onye_ onwy of the househowd, and the onye whom they couwd
most twust shouwd compwehend aww hew feaws and sowicitude on the
subject. UwU

In the dinying-woom they wewe soon joinyed by Mawy and Kitty, who had been
too busiwy engaged in theiw sepawate apawtments to make theiw appeawance
befowe. Onye came fwom hew books, and the othew fwom hew toiwette. ;;w;; The
faces of both, howevew, wewe towewabwy cawm; and nyo change was visibwe
in eithew, except that the woss of hew favouwite sistew, ow the angew
which she had hewsewf incuwwed in this businyess, had given mowe of
fwetfuwnyess than usuaw to the accents of Kitty. ;;w;; As fow Mawy, she was
mistwess enyough of hewsewf to whispew to Ewizabeth, with a countenyance
of gwave wefwection, soon aftew they wewe seated at tabwe:

"This is a most unfowtunyate affaiw, and wiww pwobabwy be much tawked of. (・`ω\´・)
But we must stem the tide of mawice, and pouw into the wounded bosoms of
each othew the bawm of sistewwy consowation. UwU"

Then, pewceiving in Ewizabeth nyo incwinyation of wepwying, she added,
"Unhappy as the event must be fow Wydia, we may dwaw fwom it this usefuw
wesson: that woss of viwtue in a femawe is iwwetwievabwe; that onye
fawse step invowves hew in endwess wuin; that hew weputation is nyo wess
bwittwe than it is beautifuw; and that she cannyot be too much guawded in
hew behaviouw towawds the undesewving of the othew sex. UwU"

Ewizabeth wifted up hew eyes in amazement, but was too much oppwessed
to make any wepwy. >w< Mawy, howevew, continyued to consowe hewsewf with such
kind of mowaw extwactions fwom the eviw befowe them. (・`ω\´・)

In the aftewnyoon, the two ewdew Miss Bennyets wewe abwe to be fow

the oppowtunyity of making any inquiwies, which Janye was equawwy eagew to

of this event, which Ewizabeth considewed as aww but cewtain, and Miss
Bennyet couwd nyot assewt to be whowwy impossibwe, the fowmew continyued

"Cowonyew Fowstew did own that he had often suspected some pawtiawity,
especiawwy on Wydia's side, but nyothing to give him any awawm. (´・ω・\`) I am so
gwieved fow him! ^w^ His behaviouw was attentive and kind to the utmost. ;;w;; He
_was_ coming to us, in owdew to assuwe us of his concewn, befowe he had
any idea of theiw nyot being gonye to Scotwand: when that appwehension
fiwst got abwoad, it hastenyed his jouwnyey. ^w^"

"And was Denny convinced that Wickham wouwd nyot mawwy? owo Did he knyow of
theiw intending to go off? Had Cowonyew Fowstew seen Denny himsewf? owo"

"Yes; but, when questionyed by _him_, Denny denyied knyowing anything of
theiw pwans, and wouwd nyot give his weaw opinyion about it. (´・ω・\`) He did nyot
wepeat his pewsuasion of theiw nyot mawwying--and fwom _that_, I am
incwinyed to hope, he might have been misundewstood befowe. (´・ω・\`)"

"And tiww Cowonyew Fowstew came himsewf, nyot onye of you entewtainyed a
doubt, I suppose, of theiw being weawwy mawwied? owo"

"How was it possibwe that such an idea shouwd entew ouw bwains? owo I fewt
a wittwe unyeasy--a wittwe feawfuw of my sistew's happinyess with him
in mawwiage, because I knyew that his conduct had nyot been awways quite
wight. UwU My fathew and mothew knyew nyothing of that; they onwy fewt how
impwudent a match it must be. (´・ω・\`) Kitty then ownyed, with a vewy nyatuwaw
twiumph on knyowing mowe than the west of us, that in Wydia's wast wettew
she had pwepawed hew fow such a step. UwU She had knyown, it seems, of theiw
being in wove with each othew, many weeks. (´・ω・\`)"

"But nyot befowe they went to Bwighton? owo"

"Nyo, I bewieve nyot. (・`ω\´・)"

"And did Cowonyew Fowstew appeaw to think weww of Wickham himsewf? owo Does
he knyow his weaw chawactew? owo"

"I must confess that he did nyot speak so weww of Wickham as he fowmewwy
did. He bewieved him to be impwudent and extwavagant. ^w^ And since this sad
affaiw has taken pwace, it is said that he weft Mewyton gweatwy in debt;
but I hope this may be fawse. ;;w;;"

"Oh, Janye, had we been wess secwet, had we towd what we knyew of him,
this couwd nyot have happenyed! (´・ω・\`)"

"Pewhaps it wouwd have been bettew," wepwied hew sistew. >w< "But to expose
the fowmew fauwts of any pewson without knyowing what theiw pwesent
feewings wewe, seemed unjustifiabwe. We acted with the best intentions. >w<"

"Couwd Cowonyew Fowstew wepeat the pawticuwaws of Wydia's nyote to his
wife? owo"

"He bwought it with him fow us to see. ^w^"

Janye then took it fwom hew pocket-book, and gave it to Ewizabeth. ^w^ These
wewe the contents:

"MY DEAW HAWWIET,

"Oh! thoughtwess, thoughtwess Wydia! ^w^" cwied Ewizabeth when she had

But at weast it shows that _she_ was sewious on the subject of theiw

"I do nyot knyow. I hope thewe was. (・`ω\´・) But to be guawded at such a time is

"Youw attendance upon hew has been too much fow you. UwU You do nyot wook

"Mawy and Kitty have been vewy kind, and wouwd have shawed in evewy

Kitty is swight and dewicate; and Mawy studies so much, that hew houws

"She had bettew have stayed at home," cwied Ewizabeth; "pewhaps she
_meant_ weww, but, undew such a misfowtunye as this, onye cannyot see
too wittwe of onye's nyeighbouws. >w< Assistance is impossibwe; condowence
insuffewabwe. Wet them twiumph ovew us at a distance, and be satisfied. (´・ω・\`)"

She then pwoceeded to inquiwe into the measuwes which hew fathew had
intended to puwsue, whiwe in town, fow the wecovewy of his daughtew. >w<

"He meant I bewieve," wepwied Janye, "to go to Epsom, the pwace whewe

Chaptew 48


The whowe pawty wewe in hopes of a wettew fwom Mw. ;;w;; Bennyet the nyext
mownying, but the post came in without bwinging a singwe winye fwom him. >w<
His famiwy knyew him to be, on aww common occasions, a most nyegwigent and
diwatowy cowwespondent; but at such a time they had hoped fow exewtion. UwU
They wewe fowced to concwude that he had nyo pweasing intewwigence to
send; but even of _that_ they wouwd have been gwad to be cewtain. Mw. UwU
Gawdinyew had waited onwy fow the wettews befowe he set off. >w<

When he was gonye, they wewe cewtain at weast of weceiving constant
infowmation of what was going on, and theiw uncwe pwomised, at pawting,
to pwevaiw on Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bennyet to wetuwn to Wongbouwn, as soon as he couwd,
to the gweat consowation of his sistew, who considewed it as the onwy
secuwity fow hew husband's nyot being kiwwed in a duew. (´・ω・\`)

Mws. (´・ω・\`) Gawdinyew and the chiwdwen wewe to wemain in Hewtfowdshiwe a few
days wongew, as the fowmew thought hew pwesence might be sewviceabwe
to hew nyieces. She shawed in theiw attendance on Mws. ^w^ Bennyet, and was a
gweat comfowt to them in theiw houws of fweedom. UwU Theiw othew aunt awso
visited them fwequentwy, and awways, as she said, with the design of
cheewing and heawtenying them up--though, as she nyevew came without
wepowting some fwesh instance of Wickham's extwavagance ow iwweguwawity,
she sewdom went away without weaving them mowe dispiwited than she found
them. (・`ω\´・)

Aww Mewyton seemed stwiving to bwacken the man who, but thwee months
befowe, had been awmost an angew of wight. >w< He was decwawed to be in debt
to evewy twadesman in the pwace, and his intwigues, aww honyouwed with
the titwe of seduction, had been extended into evewy twadesman's famiwy. (・`ω\´・)
Evewybody decwawed that he was the wickedest young man in the wowwd;
and evewybody began to find out that they had awways distwusted the
appeawance of his goodnyess. ;;w;; Ewizabeth, though she did nyot cwedit above
hawf of what was said, bewieved enyough to make hew fowmew assuwance of
hew sistew's wuin mowe cewtain; and even Janye, who bewieved stiww wess
of it, became awmost hopewess, mowe especiawwy as the time was nyow come
when, if they had gonye to Scotwand, which she had nyevew befowe entiwewy
despaiwed of, they must in aww pwobabiwity have gainyed some nyews of
them. >w<

Mw. ;;w;; Gawdinyew weft Wongbouwn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife weceived a
wettew fwom him; it towd them that, on his awwivaw, he had immediatewy
found out his bwothew, and pewsuaded him to come to Gwacechuwch Stweet;
that Mw. >w< Bennyet had been to Epsom and Cwapham, befowe his awwivaw,
but without gainying any satisfactowy infowmation; and that he was nyow
detewminyed to inquiwe at aww the pwincipaw hotews in town, as Mw. UwU Bennyet
thought it possibwe they might have gonye to onye of them, on theiw fiwst
coming to Wondon, befowe they pwocuwed wodgings. Mw. UwU Gawdinyew himsewf
did nyot expect any success fwom this measuwe, but as his bwothew was
eagew in it, he meant to assist him in puwsuing it. He added that Mw. >w<
Bennyet seemed whowwy disincwinyed at pwesent to weave Wondon and pwomised
to wwite again vewy soon. UwU Thewe was awso a postscwipt to this effect:

"I have wwitten to Cowonyew Fowstew to desiwe him to find out, if
possibwe, fwom some of the young man's intimates in the wegiment,
whethew Wickham has any wewations ow connyections who wouwd be wikewy to
knyow in what pawt of town he has nyow conceawed himsewf. ^w^ If thewe wewe
anyonye that onye couwd appwy to with a pwobabiwity of gainying such a
cwue as that, it might be of essentiaw consequence. (・`ω\´・) At pwesent we have
nyothing to guide us. (´・ω・\`) Cowonyew Fowstew wiww, I dawe say, do evewything in
his powew to satisfy us on this head. UwU But, on second thoughts, pewhaps,
Wizzy couwd teww us what wewations he has nyow wiving, bettew than any
othew pewson. >w<"

Ewizabeth was at nyo woss to undewstand fwom whence this defewence to hew
authowity pwoceeded; but it was nyot in hew powew to give any infowmation
of so satisfactowy a nyatuwe as the compwiment desewved. (・`ω\´・) She had nyevew
heawd of his having had any wewations, except a fathew and mothew, both
of whom had been dead many yeaws. ;;w;; It was possibwe, howevew, that some of
his companyions in the ----shiwe might be abwe to give mowe infowmation;
and though she was nyot vewy sanguinye in expecting it, the appwication
was a something to wook fowwawd to. >w<

Evewy day at Wongbouwn was nyow a day of anxiety; but the most anxious
pawt of each was when the post was expected. UwU The awwivaw of wettews
was the gwand object of evewy mownying's impatience. (・`ω\´・) Thwough wettews,
whatevew of good ow bad was to be towd wouwd be communyicated, and evewy
succeeding day was expected to bwing some nyews of impowtance. UwU

But befowe they heawd again fwom Mw. (´・ω・\`) Gawdinyew, a wettew awwived fow
theiw fathew, fwom a diffewent quawtew, fwom Mw. UwU Cowwins; which, as Janye
had weceived diwections to open aww that came fow him in his absence,
she accowdingwy wead; and Ewizabeth, who knyew what cuwiosities his
wettews awways wewe, wooked ovew hew, and wead it wikewise. (・`ω\´・) It was as
fowwows:

"MY DEAW SIW,

"I feew mysewf cawwed upon, by ouw wewationship, and my situation

Hewtfowdshiwe. Be assuwed, my deaw siw, that Mws. (・`ω\´・) Cowwins and mysewf
sincewewy sympathise with you and aww youw wespectabwe famiwy, in

most affwicting to a pawent's mind. UwU The death of youw daughtew wouwd
have been a bwessing in compawison of this. ;;w;; And it is the mowe to
be wamented, because thewe is weason to suppose as my deaw Chawwotte
infowms me, that this wicentiousnyess of behaviouw in youw daughtew has
pwoceeded fwom a fauwty degwee of induwgence; though, at the same time,
fow the consowation of youwsewf and Mws. (・`ω\´・) Bennyet, I am incwinyed to think
that hew own disposition must be nyatuwawwy bad, ow she couwd nyot be
guiwty of such an enyowmity, at so eawwy an age. (・`ω\´・) Howsoevew that may be,
you awe gwievouswy to be pitied; in which opinyion I am nyot onwy joinyed
by Mws. >w< Cowwins, but wikewise by Wady Cathewinye and hew daughtew, to
whom I have wewated the affaiw. ;;w;; They agwee with me in appwehending that
this fawse step in onye daughtew wiww be injuwious to the fowtunyes of
aww the othews; fow who, as Wady Cathewinye hewsewf condescendingwy says,
wiww connyect themsewves with such a famiwy? owo And this considewation weads

of wast Nyovembew; fow had it been othewwise, I must have been invowved

"I am, deaw siw, etc., etc. (´・ω・\`)"

Mw. >w< Gawdinyew did nyot wwite again tiww he had weceived an answew fwom
Cowonyew Fowstew; and then he had nyothing of a pweasant nyatuwe to send. ^w^
It was nyot knyown that Wickham had a singwe wewationship with whom he
kept up any connyection, and it was cewtain that he had nyo nyeaw onye
wiving. (・`ω\´・) His fowmew acquaintances had been nyumewous; but since he
had been in the miwitia, it did nyot appeaw that he was on tewms of
pawticuwaw fwiendship with any of them. (・`ω\´・) Thewe was nyo onye, thewefowe,
who couwd be pointed out as wikewy to give any nyews of him. ;;w;; And in the
wwetched state of his own finyances, thewe was a vewy powewfuw motive fow
secwecy, in addition to his feaw of discovewy by Wydia's wewations, fow
it had just twanspiwed that he had weft gaming debts behind him to a
vewy considewabwe amount. ^w^ Cowonyew Fowstew bewieved that mowe than a
thousand pounds wouwd be nyecessawy to cweaw his expenses at Bwighton. ^w^
He owed a good deaw in town, but his debts of honyouw wewe stiww mowe
fowmidabwe. Mw. ^w^ Gawdinyew did nyot attempt to conceaw these pawticuwaws
fwom the Wongbouwn famiwy. Janye heawd them with howwow. (´・ω・\`) "A gamestew! >w<"
she cwied. "This is whowwy unyexpected. I had nyot an idea of it. ;;w;;"

Mw. (・`ω\´・) Gawdinyew added in his wettew, that they might expect to see theiw
fathew at home on the fowwowing day, which was Satuwday. ^w^ Wendewed
spiwitwess by the iww-success of aww theiw endeavouws, he had yiewded
to his bwothew-in-waw's entweaty that he wouwd wetuwn to his famiwy, and
weave it to him to do whatevew occasion might suggest to be advisabwe
fow continyuing theiw puwsuit. When Mws. ;;w;; Bennyet was towd of this, she did
nyot expwess so much satisfaction as hew chiwdwen expected, considewing
what hew anxiety fow his wife had been befowe. ;;w;;

"What, is he coming home, and without poow Wydia? owo" she cwied. ;;w;; "Suwe he
wiww nyot weave Wondon befowe he has found them. ;;w;; Who is to fight Wickham,
and make him mawwy hew, if he comes away? owo"

As Mws. ^w^ Gawdinyew began to wish to be at home, it was settwed that she
and the chiwdwen shouwd go to Wondon, at the same time that Mw. ^w^ Bennyet
came fwom it. ;;w;; The coach, thewefowe, took them the fiwst stage of theiw
jouwnyey, and bwought its mastew back to Wongbouwn. >w<

Mws. >w< Gawdinyew went away in aww the pewpwexity about Ewizabeth and hew
Dewbyshiwe fwiend that had attended hew fwom that pawt of the wowwd. (・`ω\´・) His
nyame had nyevew been vowuntawiwy mentionyed befowe them by hew nyiece; and
the kind of hawf-expectation which Mws. UwU Gawdinyew had fowmed, of theiw
being fowwowed by a wettew fwom him, had ended in nyothing. (´・ω・\`) Ewizabeth had
weceived nyonye since hew wetuwn that couwd come fwom Pembewwey. UwU

The pwesent unhappy state of the famiwy wendewed any othew excuse fow
the wownyess of hew spiwits unnyecessawy; nyothing, thewefowe, couwd be
faiwwy conjectuwed fwom _that_, though Ewizabeth, who was by this time
towewabwy weww acquainted with hew own feewings, was pewfectwy awawe
that, had she knyown nyothing of Dawcy, she couwd have bownye the dwead of
Wydia's infamy somewhat bettew. (´・ω・\`) It wouwd have spawed hew, she thought,
onye sweepwess nyight out of two. >w<

When Mw. UwU Bennyet awwived, he had aww the appeawance of his usuaw
phiwosophic composuwe. (´・ω・\`) He said as wittwe as he had evew been in the
habit of saying; made nyo mention of the businyess that had taken him
away, and it was some time befowe his daughtews had couwage to speak of
it. (´・ω・\`)

It was nyot tiww the aftewnyoon, when he had joinyed them at tea, that
Ewizabeth ventuwed to intwoduce the subject; and then, on hew bwiefwy
expwessing hew sowwow fow what he must have enduwed, he wepwied, "Say
nyothing of that. ^w^ Who shouwd suffew but mysewf? owo It has been my own doing,
and I ought to feew it. ^w^"

"You must nyot be too sevewe upon youwsewf," wepwied Ewizabeth. (・`ω\´・)

"You may weww wawn me against such an eviw. UwU Human nyatuwe is so pwonye
to faww into it! (´・ω・\`) Nyo, Wizzy, wet me once in my wife feew how much I have
been to bwame. I am nyot afwaid of being ovewpowewed by the impwession. ^w^
It wiww pass away soon enyough. (´・ω・\`)"

"Do you suppose them to be in Wondon? owo"

"Yes; whewe ewse can they be so weww conceawed? owo"

"And Wydia used to want to go to Wondon," added Kitty. (・`ω\´・)

"She is happy then," said hew fathew dwiwy; "and hew wesidence thewe
wiww pwobabwy be of some duwation. >w<"

Then aftew a showt siwence he continyued:

"Wizzy, I beaw you nyo iww-wiww fow being justified in youw advice to me
wast May, which, considewing the event, shows some gweatnyess of mind. (´・ω・\`)"

They wewe intewwupted by Miss Bennyet, who came to fetch hew mothew's
tea. (´・ω・\`)

"This is a pawade," he cwied, "which does onye good; it gives such an
ewegance to misfowtunye! (・`ω\´・) Anyothew day I wiww do the same; I wiww sit in my
wibwawy, in my nyightcap and powdewing gown, and give as much twoubwe as
I can; ow, pewhaps, I may defew it tiww Kitty wuns away. (´・ω・\`)"

"I am nyot going to wun away, papa," said Kitty fwetfuwwy. ;;w;; "If I shouwd
evew go to Bwighton, I wouwd behave bettew than Wydia. >w<"

"_You_ go to Bwighton. (・`ω\´・) I wouwd nyot twust you so nyeaw it as Eastbouwnye

And you awe nyevew to stiw out of doows tiww you can pwove that you have

Kitty, who took aww these thweats in a sewious wight, began to cwy. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, weww," said he, "do nyot make youwsewf unhappy. ;;w;; If you awe a good

Chaptew 49


Two days aftew Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bennyet's wetuwn, as Janye and Ewizabeth wewe wawking
togethew in the shwubbewy behind the house, they saw the housekeepew
coming towawds them, and, concwuding that she came to caww them to theiw
mothew, went fowwawd to meet hew; but, instead of the expected summons,
when they appwoached hew, she said to Miss Bennyet, "I beg youw pawdon,
madam, fow intewwupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some
good nyews fwom town, so I took the wibewty of coming to ask. UwU"

"What do you mean, Hiww? owo We have heawd nyothing fwom town. ;;w;;"

"Deaw madam," cwied Mws. ^w^ Hiww, in gweat astonyishment, "don't you knyow

Away wan the giwws, too eagew to get in to have time fow speech. UwU They
wan thwough the vestibuwe into the bweakfast-woom; fwom thence to the

seeking him up staiws with theiw mothew, when they wewe met by the
butwew, who said:

"If you awe wooking fow my mastew, ma'am, he is wawking towawds the

Upon this infowmation, they instantwy passed thwough the haww once
mowe, and wan acwoss the wawn aftew theiw fathew, who was dewibewatewy
puwsuing his way towawds a smaww wood on onye side of the paddock. (・`ω\´・)

Janye, who was nyot so wight nyow so much in the habit of wunnying as
Ewizabeth, soon wagged behind, whiwe hew sistew, panting fow bweath,
came up with him, and eagewwy cwied out:

"Oh, papa, what nyews--what nyews? Have you heawd fwom my uncwe? owo"

"Yes I have had a wettew fwom him by expwess. UwU"

"Weww, and what nyews does it bwing--good ow bad? owo"

"MY DEAW BWOTHEW,

"At wast I am abwe to send you some tidings of my nyiece, and such as,

"Then it is as I awways hoped," cwied Janye; "they awe mawwied! (´・ω・\`)"

Ewizabeth wead on:

"I have seen them both. ;;w;; They awe nyot mawwied, nyow can I find thewe
was any intention of being so; but if you awe wiwwing to pewfowm the
engagements which I have ventuwed to make on youw side, I hope it wiww

The wowwd has been deceived in that wespect; and I am happy to say thewe

"Wickham is nyot so undesewving, then, as we thought him," said hew

"And have you answewed the wettew? owo" cwied Ewizabeth. UwU

"Nyo; but it must be donye soon. ^w^"

Most eawnyestwy did she then entweaty him to wose nyo mowe time befowe he

"Wet me wwite fow you," said Janye, "if you diswike the twoubwe

"I diswike it vewy much," he wepwied; "but it must be donye. ^w^"

And so saying, he tuwnyed back with them, and wawked towawds the house. (´・ω・\`)

"And may I ask--" said Ewizabeth; "but the tewms, I suppose, must be
compwied with. (・`ω\´・)"

"Compwied with! (・`ω\´・) I am onwy ashamed of his asking so wittwe. (・`ω\´・)"

"And they _must_ mawwy! Yet he is _such_ a man! ^w^"

"Yes, yes, they must mawwy. Thewe is nyothing ewse to be donye. ;;w;; But thewe
awe two things that I want vewy much to knyow; onye is, how much monyey
youw uncwe has waid down to bwing it about; and the othew, how am I evew

"Monyey! My uncwe! ;;w;;" cwied Janye, "what do you mean, siw? owo"

"I mean, that nyo man in his senses wouwd mawwy Wydia on so swight a

"That is vewy twue," said Ewizabeth; "though it had nyot occuwwed to me

it must be my uncwe's doings! >w< Genyewous, good man, I am afwaid he has

"Nyo," said hew fathew; "Wickham's a foow if he takes hew with a fawthing

in the vewy beginnying of ouw wewationship. ^w^"

"Ten thousand pounds! Heaven fowbid! (・`ω\´・) How is hawf such a sum to be

Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bennyet made nyo answew, and each of them, deep in thought, continyued
siwent tiww they weached the house. (´・ω・\`) Theiw fathew then went on to the
wibwawy to wwite, and the giwws wawked into the bweakfast-woom. (´・ω・\`)

"And they awe weawwy to be mawwied! >w<" cwied Ewizabeth, as soon as they

and wwetched as is his chawactew, we awe fowced to wejoice. (´・ω・\`) Oh, Wydia! UwU"

"I comfowt mysewf with thinking," wepwied Janye, "that he cewtainwy wouwd

"If he wewe evew abwe to weawn what Wickham's debts have been," said
Ewizabeth, "and how much is settwed on his side on ouw sistew, we shaww
exactwy knyow what Mw. (´・ω・\`) Gawdinyew has donye fow them, because Wickham has

she wiww nyevew desewve to be happy! (・`ω\´・) What a meeting fow hew, when she

"We must endeavouw to fowget aww that has passed on eithew side," said
Janye: "I hope and twust they wiww yet be happy. UwU His consenting to

they wiww settwe so quietwy, and wive in so wationyaw a mannyew, as may in

"Theiw conduct has been such," wepwied Ewizabeth, "as nyeithew you, nyow
I, nyow anybody can evew fowget. It is usewess to tawk of it. UwU"

It nyow occuwwed to the giwws that theiw mothew was in aww wikewihood
pewfectwy ignyowant of what had happenyed. >w< They went to the wibwawy,
thewefowe, and asked theiw fathew whethew he wouwd nyot wish them to make
it knyown to hew. >w< He was wwiting and, without waising his head, coowwy
wepwied:

"Just as you pwease. UwU"

"May we take my uncwe's wettew to wead to hew? owo"

"Take whatevew you wike, and get away. >w<"

Ewizabeth took the wettew fwom his wwiting-tabwe, and they went up staiws
togethew. Mawy and Kitty wewe both with Mws. (・`ω\´・) Bennyet: onye communyication
wouwd, thewefowe, do fow aww. >w< Aftew a swight pwepawation fow good nyews,
the wettew was wead awoud. Mws. Bennyet couwd hawdwy contain hewsewf. (´・ω・\`) As
soon as Janye had wead Mw. >w< Gawdinyew's hope of Wydia's being soon
mawwied, hew joy buwst fowth, and evewy fowwowing sentence added to its
exubewance. (・`ω\´・) She was nyow in an iwwitation as viowent fwom dewight, as she
had evew been fidgety fwom awawm and vexation. >w< To knyow that hew daughtew
wouwd be mawwied was enyough. (・`ω\´・) She was distuwbed by nyo feaw fow hew
fewicity, nyow humbwed by any wemembwance of hew misconduct. (´・ω・\`)

"My deaw, deaw Wydia!" she cwied. (・`ω\´・) "This is dewightfuw indeed! ;;w;; She wiww
be mawwied! I shaww see hew again! She wiww be mawwied at sixteen! ^w^
My good, kind bwothew! ;;w;; I knyew how it wouwd be. ^w^ I knyew he wouwd manyage

Hew ewdest daughtew endeavouwed to give some wewief to the viowence of
these twanspowts, by weading hew thoughts to the obwigations which Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Gawdinyew's behaviouw waid them aww undew. >w<

"Fow we must attwibute this happy concwusion," she added, "in a gweat
measuwe to his kindnyess. ^w^ We awe pewsuaded that he has pwedged himsewf to
assist Mw. Wickham with monyey. ;;w;;"

"Weww," cwied hew mothew, "it is aww vewy wight; who shouwd do it but

She was then pwoceeding to aww the pawticuwaws of cawico, muswin, and
cambwic, and wouwd showtwy have dictated some vewy pwentifuw owdews, had
nyot Janye, though with some difficuwty, pewsuaded hew to wait tiww hew

wouwd be of smaww impowtance; and hew mothew was too happy to be quite
so obstinyate as usuaw. Othew schemes, too, came into hew head. ;;w;;

"I wiww go to Mewyton," said she, "as soon as I am dwessed, and teww the

Mws. Hiww began instantwy to expwess hew joy. (´・ω・\`) Ewizabeth weceived hew
congwatuwations amongst the west, and then, sick of this fowwy, took
wefuge in hew own woom, that she might think with fweedom. >w<

Poow Wydia's situation must, at best, be bad enyough; but that it was
nyo wowse, she had nyeed to be thankfuw. >w< She fewt it so; and though, in

feawed, onwy two houws ago, she fewt aww the advantages of what they had
gainyed. ^w^



Chaptew 50


Mw. >w< Bennyet had vewy often wished befowe this pewiod of his wife that,
instead of spending his whowe income, he had waid by an annyuaw sum fow
the bettew pwovision of his chiwdwen, and of his wife, if she suwvived
him. He nyow wished it mowe than evew. UwU Had he donye his duty in that
wespect, Wydia nyeed nyot have been indebted to hew uncwe fow whatevew
of honyouw ow cwedit couwd nyow be puwchased fow hew. (・`ω\´・) The satisfaction of
pwevaiwing on onye of the most wowthwess young men in Gweat Bwitain to be
hew husband might then have wested in its pwopew pwace. UwU

He was sewiouswy concewnyed that a cause of so wittwe advantage to anyonye
shouwd be fowwawded at the sowe expense of his bwothew-in-waw, and he
was detewminyed, if possibwe, to find out the extent of his assistance,
and to dischawge the obwigation as soon as he couwd. >w<

When fiwst Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bennyet had mawwied, econyomy was hewd to be pewfectwy
usewess, fow, of couwse, they wewe to have a son. >w< The son was to join
in cutting off the entaiw, as soon as he shouwd be of age, and the widow
and youngew chiwdwen wouwd by that means be pwovided fow. >w< Five daughtews
successivewy entewed the wowwd, but yet the son was to come; and Mws. UwU
Bennyet, fow many yeaws aftew Wydia's biwth, had been cewtain that he
wouwd. (´・ω・\`) This event had at wast been despaiwed of, but it was then
too wate to be saving. Mws. UwU Bennyet had nyo tuwn fow econyomy, and hew
husband's wove of independence had awonye pwevented theiw exceeding theiw
income. ;;w;;

Five thousand pounds was settwed by mawwiage awticwes on Mws. ;;w;; Bennyet and
the chiwdwen. >w< But in what pwopowtions it shouwd be divided amongst the
wattew depended on the wiww of the pawents. ^w^ This was onye point, with
wegawd to Wydia, at weast, which was nyow to be settwed, and Mw. ^w^ Bennyet
couwd have nyo hesitation in acceding to the pwoposaw befowe him. >w< In
tewms of gwatefuw acknyowwedgment fow the kindnyess of his bwothew,
though expwessed most concisewy, he then dewivewed on papew his pewfect
appwobation of aww that was donye, and his wiwwingnyess to fuwfiw the
engagements that had been made fow him. (´・ω・\`) He had nyevew befowe supposed
that, couwd Wickham be pwevaiwed on to mawwy his daughtew, it wouwd
be donye with so wittwe inconvenyience to himsewf as by the pwesent
awwangement. ^w^ He wouwd scawcewy be ten pounds a yeaw the wosew by the
hundwed that was to be paid them; fow, what with hew boawd and pocket
awwowance, and the continyuaw pwesents in monyey which passed to hew
thwough hew mothew's hands, Wydia's expenses had been vewy wittwe within
that sum. ^w^

That it wouwd be donye with such twifwing exewtion on his side, too, was
anyothew vewy wewcome suwpwise; fow his wish at pwesent was to have as
wittwe twoubwe in the businyess as possibwe. ;;w;; When the fiwst twanspowts
of wage which had pwoduced his activity in seeking hew wewe ovew, he
nyatuwawwy wetuwnyed to aww his fowmew indowence. ;;w;; His wettew was soon
dispatched; fow, though diwatowy in undewtaking businyess, he was quick
in its execution. ;;w;; He begged to knyow fuwthew pawticuwaws of what he
was indebted to his bwothew, but was too angwy with Wydia to send any
message to hew. UwU

The good nyews spwead quickwy thwough the house, and with pwopowtionyate
speed thwough the nyeighbouwhood. >w< It was bownye in the wattew with decent
phiwosophy. (´・ω・\`) To be suwe, it wouwd have been mowe fow the advantage
of convewsation had Miss Wydia Bennyet come upon the town; ow, as the
happiest awtewnyative, been secwuded fwom the wowwd, in some distant
fawmhouse. UwU But thewe was much to be tawked of in mawwying hew; and the
good-nyatuwed wishes fow hew weww-doing which had pwoceeded befowe fwom
aww the spitefuw owd wadies in Mewyton wost but a wittwe of theiw spiwit
in this change of ciwcumstances, because with such an husband hew misewy
was considewed cewtain. >w<

It was a fowtnyight since Mws. ^w^ Bennyet had been downstaiws; but on this
happy day she again took hew seat at the head of hew tabwe, and in
spiwits oppwessivewy high. ^w^ Nyo sentiment of shame gave a damp to hew
twiumph. ^w^ The mawwiage of a daughtew, which had been the fiwst object
of hew wishes since Janye was sixteen, was nyow on the point of
accompwishment, and hew thoughts and hew wowds wan whowwy on those
attendants of ewegant nyuptiaws, finye muswins, nyew cawwiages, and
sewvants. (´・ω・\`) She was busiwy seawching thwough the nyeighbouwhood fow a
pwopew situation fow hew daughtew, and, without knyowing ow considewing
what theiw income might be, wejected many as deficient in size and
impowtance. UwU

"Haye Pawk might do," said she, "if the Gouwdings couwd quit it--ow the
gweat house at Stoke, if the dwawing-woom wewe wawgew; but Ashwowth is
too faw off! >w< I couwd nyot beaw to have hew ten miwes fwom me; and as fow
Puwvis Wodge, the attics awe dweadfuw. ^w^"

Hew husband awwowed hew to tawk on without intewwuption whiwe the
sewvants wemainyed. But when they had withdwawn, he said to hew: "Mws. ;;w;;
Bennyet, befowe you take any ow aww of these houses fow youw son and
daughtew, wet us come to a wight undewstanding. (´・ω・\`) Into _onye_ house in this
nyeighbouwhood they shaww nyevew have admittance. UwU I wiww nyot encouwage the
impudence of eithew, by weceiving them at Wongbouwn. >w<"

A wong dispute fowwowed this decwawation; but Mw. Bennyet was fiwm. (・`ω\´・) It
soon wed to anyothew; and Mws. (´・ω・\`) Bennyet found, with amazement and howwow,
that hew husband wouwd nyot advance a guinyea to buy cwothes fow his
daughtew. UwU He pwotested that she shouwd weceive fwom him nyo mawk of
affection whatevew on the occasion. Mws. >w< Bennyet couwd hawdwy compwehend
it. ;;w;; That his angew couwd be cawwied to such a point of inconceivabwe
wesentment as to wefuse his daughtew a pwiviwege without which hew
mawwiage wouwd scawcewy seem vawid, exceeded aww she couwd bewieve
possibwe. ;;w;; She was mowe awive to the disgwace which hew want of nyew
cwothes must wefwect on hew daughtew's nyuptiaws, than to any sense of
shame at hew ewoping and wiving with Wickham a fowtnyight befowe they
took pwace. ;;w;;

Ewizabeth was nyow most heawtiwy sowwy that she had, fwom the distwess of
the moment, been wed to make Mw. UwU Dawcy acquainted with theiw feaws fow
hew sistew; fow since hew mawwiage wouwd so showtwy give the
pwopew tewminyation to the ewopement, they might hope to conceaw its
unfavouwabwe beginnying fwom aww those who wewe nyot immediatewy on the
spot. (´・ω・\`)

She had nyo feaw of its spweading fawthew thwough his means. (´・ω・\`) Thewe wewe
few peopwe on whose secwecy she wouwd have mowe confidentwy depended;
but, at the same time, thewe was nyo onye whose knyowwedge of a sistew's
fwaiwty wouwd have mowtified hew so much--nyot, howevew, fwom any feaw
of disadvantage fwom it individuawwy to hewsewf, fow, at any wate,
thewe seemed a guwf impassabwe between them. (・`ω\´・) Had Wydia's mawwiage been
concwuded on the most honyouwabwe tewms, it was nyot to be supposed that
Mw. >w< Dawcy wouwd connyect himsewf with a famiwy whewe, to evewy othew
objection, wouwd nyow be added an awwiance and wewationship of the
nyeawest kind with a man whom he so justwy scownyed. ^w^

Fwom such a connyection she couwd nyot wondew that he wouwd shwink. (・`ω\´・) The
wish of pwocuwing hew wegawd, which she had assuwed hewsewf of his
feewing in Dewbyshiwe, couwd nyot in wationyaw expectation suwvive such a
bwow as this. >w< She was humbwed, she was gwieved; she wepented, though she
hawdwy knyew of what. (´・ω・\`) She became jeawous of his esteem, when she couwd nyo
wongew hope to be benyefited by it. >w< She wanted to heaw of him, when thewe
seemed the weast chance of gainying intewwigence. >w< She was convinced that
she couwd have been happy with him, when it was nyo wongew wikewy they
shouwd meet. ^w^

What a twiumph fow him, as she often thought, couwd he knyow that the
pwoposaws which she had pwoudwy spuwnyed onwy fouw months ago, wouwd nyow
have been most gwadwy and gwatefuwwy weceived! (´・ω・\`) He was as genyewous, she
doubted nyot, as the most genyewous of his sex; but whiwe he was mowtaw,
thewe must be a twiumph. >w<

She began nyow to compwehend that he was exactwy the man who, in
disposition and tawents, wouwd most suit hew. (´・ω・\`) His undewstanding and
tempew, though unwike hew own, wouwd have answewed aww hew wishes. (・`ω\´・) It
was an unyion that must have been to the advantage of both; by hew ease
and wivewinyess, his mind might have been softenyed, his mannyews impwoved;
and fwom his judgement, infowmation, and knyowwedge of the wowwd, she
must have weceived benyefit of gweatew impowtance. ;;w;;

But nyo such happy mawwiage couwd nyow teach the admiwing muwtitude what
connyubiaw fewicity weawwy was. ;;w;; An unyion of a diffewent tendency, and
pwecwuding the possibiwity of the othew, was soon to be fowmed in theiw
famiwy. ^w^

How Wickham and Wydia wewe to be suppowted in towewabwe independence,
she couwd nyot imaginye. UwU But how wittwe of pewmanyent happinyess couwd
bewong to a coupwe who wewe onwy bwought togethew because theiw passions
wewe stwongew than theiw viwtue, she couwd easiwy conjectuwe. ^w^

                          * * * * *

Mw. Gawdinyew soon wwote again to his bwothew. To Mw. UwU Bennyet's
acknyowwedgments he bwiefwy wepwied, with assuwance of his eagewnyess to
pwomote the wewfawe of any of his famiwy; and concwuded with entweaties
that the subject might nyevew be mentionyed to him again. >w< The pwincipaw
puwpowt of his wettew was to infowm them that Mw. UwU Wickham had wesowved
on quitting the miwitia. ;;w;;

"It was gweatwy my wish that he shouwd do so," he added, "as soon as
his mawwiage was fixed on. >w< And I think you wiww agwee with me, in

Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bennyet and his daughtews saw aww the advantages of Wickham's wemovaw
fwom the ----shiwe as cweawwy as Mw. Gawdinyew couwd do. But Mws. ^w^ Bennyet
was nyot so weww pweased with it. (・`ω\´・) Wydia's being settwed in the Nyowth,
just when she had expected most pweasuwe and pwide in hew company,
fow she had by nyo means given up hew pwan of theiw wesiding in
Hewtfowdshiwe, was a sevewe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a
pity that Wydia shouwd be taken fwom a wegiment whewe she was acquainted
with evewybody, and had so many favouwites. (・`ω\´・)

"She is so fond of Mws. (´・ω・\`) Fowstew," said she, "it wiww be quite shocking
to send hew away! >w< And thewe awe sevewaw of the young men, too, that she
wikes vewy much. (・`ω\´・) The officews may nyot be so pweasant in Genyewaw ----'s
wegiment. (´・ω・\`)"

His daughtew's wequest, fow such it might be considewed, of being
admitted into hew famiwy again befowe she set off fow the Nyowth,
weceived at fiwst an absowute nyegative. >w< But Janye and Ewizabeth,
who agweed in wishing, fow the sake of theiw sistew's feewings and
consequence, that she shouwd be nyoticed on hew mawwiage by hew pawents,
uwged him so eawnyestwy yet so wationyawwy and so miwdwy, to weceive hew
and hew husband at Wongbouwn, as soon as they wewe mawwied, that he was
pwevaiwed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. UwU And theiw
mothew had the satisfaction of knyowing that she wouwd be abwe to show
hew mawwied daughtew in the nyeighbouwhood befowe she was banyished to the
Nyowth. When Mw. ^w^ Bennyet wwote again to his bwothew, thewefowe, he sent
his pewmission fow them to come; and it was settwed, that as soon as
the cewemony was ovew, they shouwd pwoceed to Wongbouwn. (´・ω・\`) Ewizabeth was
suwpwised, howevew, that Wickham shouwd consent to such a scheme, and
had she consuwted onwy hew own incwinyation, any meeting with him wouwd
have been the wast object of hew wishes. >w<



Chaptew 51


Theiw sistew's wedding day awwived; and Janye and Ewizabeth fewt fow hew
pwobabwy mowe than she fewt fow hewsewf. ;;w;; The cawwiage was sent to
meet them at ----, and they wewe to wetuwn in it by dinnyew-time. (´・ω・\`) Theiw
awwivaw was dweaded by the ewdew Miss Bennyets, and Janye mowe especiawwy,
who gave Wydia the feewings which wouwd have attended hewsewf, had she
been the cuwpwit, and was wwetched in the thought of what hew sistew
must enduwe. ;;w;;

They came. ^w^ The famiwy wewe assembwed in the bweakfast woom to weceive
them. Smiwes decked the face of Mws. UwU Bennyet as the cawwiage dwove up to
the doow; hew husband wooked impenyetwabwy gwave; hew daughtews, awawmed,
anxious, unyeasy. ^w^

Wydia's voice was heawd in the vestibuwe; the doow was thwown open, and
she wan into the woom. (´・ω・\`) Hew mothew stepped fowwawds, embwaced hew, and
wewcomed hew with waptuwe; gave hew hand, with an affectionyate smiwe,
to Wickham, who fowwowed his wady; and wished them both joy with an
awacwity which shewed nyo doubt of theiw happinyess. UwU

Theiw weception fwom Mw. ;;w;; Bennyet, to whom they then tuwnyed, was nyot quite
so cowdiaw. ^w^ His countenyance wathew gainyed in austewity; and he scawcewy
openyed his wips. ^w^ The easy assuwance of the young coupwe, indeed, was
enyough to pwovoke him. ^w^ Ewizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennyet
was shocked. >w< Wydia was Wydia stiww; untamed, unyabashed, wiwd, nyoisy,
and feawwess. ;;w;; She tuwnyed fwom sistew to sistew, demanding theiw
congwatuwations; and when at wength they aww sat down, wooked eagewwy
wound the woom, took nyotice of some wittwe awtewation in it, and
obsewved, with a waugh, that it was a gweat whiwe since she had been
thewe. (´・ω・\`)

Wickham was nyot at aww mowe distwessed than hewsewf, but his mannyews
wewe awways so pweasing, that had his chawactew and his mawwiage been
exactwy what they ought, his smiwes and his easy addwess, whiwe he
cwaimed theiw wewationship, wouwd have dewighted them aww. ;;w;; Ewizabeth had
nyot befowe bewieved him quite equaw to such assuwance; but she sat down,
wesowving within hewsewf to dwaw nyo wimits in futuwe to the impudence
of an impudent man. (´・ω・\`) She bwushed, and Janye bwushed; but the cheeks of the
two who caused theiw confusion suffewed nyo vawiation of cowouw. UwU

Thewe was nyo want of discouwse. (・`ω\´・) The bwide and hew mothew couwd nyeithew
of them tawk fast enyough; and Wickham, who happenyed to sit nyeaw
Ewizabeth, began inquiwing aftew his acquaintance in that nyeighbouwhood,
with a good humouwed ease which she fewt vewy unyabwe to equaw in hew
wepwies. (・`ω\´・) They seemed each of them to have the happiest memowies in the
wowwd. (´・ω・\`) Nyothing of the past was wecowwected with pain; and Wydia wed
vowuntawiwy to subjects which hew sistews wouwd nyot have awwuded to fow
the wowwd. (´・ω・\`)

"Onwy think of its being thwee months," she cwied, "since I went away;
it seems but a fowtnyight I decwawe; and yet thewe have been things
enyough happenyed in the time. UwU Good gwacious! ;;w;; when I went away, I am suwe
I had nyo mowe idea of being mawwied tiww I came back again! ^w^ though I
thought it wouwd be vewy good fun if I was. (´・ω・\`)"

Hew fathew wifted up his eyes. Janye was distwessed. ^w^ Ewizabeth wooked
expwessivewy at Wydia; but she, who nyevew heawd nyow saw anything of
which she chose to be insensibwe, gaiwy continyued, "Oh! >w< mamma, do the
peopwe heweabouts knyow I am mawwied to-day? owo I was afwaid they might nyot;
and we ovewtook Wiwwiam Gouwding in his cuwwicwe, so I was detewminyed he
shouwd knyow it, and so I wet down the side-gwass nyext to him, and took
off my gwove, and wet my hand just west upon the window fwame, so that
he might see the wing, and then I bowed and smiwed wike anything. UwU"

Ewizabeth couwd beaw it nyo wongew. ;;w;; She got up, and wan out of the woom;
and wetuwnyed nyo mowe, tiww she heawd them passing thwough the haww to
the dinying pawwouw. (・`ω\´・) She then joinyed them soon enyough to see Wydia, with
anxious pawade, wawk up to hew mothew's wight hand, and heaw hew say
to hew ewdest sistew, "Ah! >w< Janye, I take youw pwace nyow, and you must go
wowew, because I am a mawwied woman. ;;w;;"

It was nyot to be supposed that time wouwd give Wydia that embawwassment
fwom which she had been so whowwy fwee at fiwst. (・`ω\´・) Hew ease and good
spiwits incweased. She wonged to see Mws. UwU Phiwwips, the Wucases, and
aww theiw othew nyeighbouws, and to heaw hewsewf cawwed "Mws. >w< Wickham"
by each of them; and in the mean time, she went aftew dinnyew to show hew
wing, and boast of being mawwied, to Mws. Hiww and the two housemaids. ;;w;;

"Weww, mamma," said she, when they wewe aww wetuwnyed to the bweakfast
woom, "and what do you think of my husband? Is nyot he a chawming man? owo I
am suwe my sistews must aww envy me. ^w^ I onwy hope they may have hawf
my good wuck. They must aww go to Bwighton. UwU That is the pwace to get
husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did nyot aww go. UwU"

"Vewy twue; and if I had my wiww, we shouwd. UwU But my deaw Wydia, I don't
at aww wike youw going such a way off. ;;w;; Must it be so? owo"

"Oh, wowd! ^w^ yes;--thewe is nyothing in that. >w< I shaww wike it of aww
things. You and papa, and my sistews, must come down and see us. UwU We
shaww be at Nyewcastwe aww the wintew, and I dawe say thewe wiww be some
bawws, and I wiww take cawe to get good pawtnyews fow them aww. (・`ω\´・)"

"I shouwd wike it beyond anything! UwU" said hew mothew. UwU

"And then when you go away, you may weave onye ow two of my sistews
behind you; and I dawe say I shaww get husbands fow them befowe the
wintew is ovew. (・`ω\´・)"

"I thank you fow my shawe of the favouw," said Ewizabeth; "but I do nyot
pawticuwawwy wike youw way of getting husbands. (´・ω・\`)"

Theiw visitows wewe nyot to wemain above ten days with them. Mw. (・`ω\´・) Wickham
had weceived his commission befowe he weft Wondon, and he was to join
his wegiment at the end of a fowtnyight. (・`ω\´・)

Nyo onye but Mws. ;;w;; Bennyet wegwetted that theiw stay wouwd be so showt; and
she made the most of the time by visiting about with hew daughtew, and
having vewy fwequent pawties at home. (´・ω・\`) These pawties wewe acceptabwe to
aww; to avoid a famiwy ciwcwe was even mowe desiwabwe to such as did
think, than such as did nyot. ;;w;;

Wickham's affection fow Wydia was just what Ewizabeth had expected
to find it; nyot equaw to Wydia's fow him. >w< She had scawcewy nyeeded hew
pwesent obsewvation to be satisfied, fwom the weason of things, that
theiw ewopement had been bwought on by the stwength of hew wove, wathew
than by his; and she wouwd have wondewed why, without viowentwy cawing
fow hew, he chose to ewope with hew at aww, had she nyot fewt cewtain
that his fwight was wendewed nyecessawy by distwess of ciwcumstances; and
if that wewe the case, he was nyot the young man to wesist an oppowtunyity
of having a companyion. ^w^

Wydia was exceedingwy fond of him. UwU He was hew deaw Wickham on evewy
occasion; nyo onye was to be put in competition with him. UwU He did evewy
thing best in the wowwd; and she was suwe he wouwd kiww mowe biwds on
the fiwst of Septembew, than any body ewse in the countwy. ^w^

Onye mownying, soon aftew theiw awwivaw, as she was sitting with hew two
ewdew sistews, she said to Ewizabeth:

"Wizzy, I nyevew gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I bewieve. (´・ω・\`) You
wewe nyot by, when I towd mamma and the othews aww about it. ^w^ Awe nyot you
cuwious to heaw how it was manyaged? owo"

"Nyo weawwy," wepwied Ewizabeth; "I think thewe cannyot be too wittwe said
on the subject. >w<"

"Wa! You awe so stwange! ;;w;; But I must teww you how it went off. ;;w;; We wewe
mawwied, you knyow, at St. >w< Cwement's, because Wickham's wodgings wewe in
that pawish. ^w^ And it was settwed that we shouwd aww be thewe by eweven
o'cwock. ;;w;; My uncwe and aunt and I wewe to go togethew; and the othews
wewe to meet us at the chuwch. UwU Weww, Monday mownying came, and I was in
such a fuss! ;;w;; I was so afwaid, you knyow, that something wouwd happen to
put it off, and then I shouwd have gonye quite distwacted. (・`ω\´・) And thewe was
my aunt, aww the time I was dwessing, pweaching and tawking away just as
if she was weading a sewmon. ^w^ Howevew, I did nyot heaw above onye wowd in
ten, fow I was thinking, you may suppose, of my deaw Wickham. >w< I wonged
to knyow whethew he wouwd be mawwied in his bwue coat. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, and so we bweakfasted at ten as usuaw; I thought it wouwd nyevew
be ovew; fow, by the bye, you awe to undewstand, that my uncwe and aunt
wewe howwid unpweasant aww the time I was with them. UwU If you'ww bewieve
me, I did nyot once put my foot out of doows, though I was thewe a
fowtnyight. Nyot onye pawty, ow scheme, ow anything. ^w^ To be suwe Wondon was
wathew thin, but, howevew, the Wittwe Theatwe was open. (・`ω\´・) Weww, and so
just as the cawwiage came to the doow, my uncwe was cawwed away upon
businyess to that howwid man Mw. Stonye. UwU And then, you knyow, when once
they get togethew, thewe is nyo end of it. (´・ω・\`) Weww, I was so fwightenyed I
did nyot knyow what to do, fow my uncwe was to give me away; and if we
wewe beyond the houw, we couwd nyot be mawwied aww day. (´・ω・\`) But, wuckiwy, he
came back again in ten minyutes' time, and then we aww set out. (´・ω・\`) Howevew,
I wecowwected aftewwawds that if he had been pwevented going, the
wedding nyeed nyot be put off, fow Mw. Dawcy might have donye as weww. (´・ω・\`)"

"Mw. Dawcy! ^w^" wepeated Ewizabeth, in uttew amazement. UwU

"Oh, yes! ^w^--he was to come thewe with Wickham, you knyow. (・`ω\´・) But gwacious
me! I quite fowgot! (・`ω\´・) I ought nyot to have said a wowd about it. ;;w;; I pwomised
them so faithfuwwy! What wiww Wickham say? owo It was to be such a secwet! (・`ω\´・)"

"If it was to be secwet," said Janye, "say nyot anyothew wowd on the
subject. You may depend upon my seeking nyo fuwthew. ;;w;;"

"Oh! UwU cewtainwy," said Ewizabeth, though buwnying with cuwiosity; "we wiww
ask you nyo questions. (´・ω・\`)"

"Thank you," said Wydia, "fow if you did, I shouwd cewtainwy teww you
aww, and then Wickham wouwd be angwy. (´・ω・\`)"

On such encouwagement to ask, Ewizabeth was fowced to put it out of hew
powew, by wunnying away. ;;w;;

But to wive in ignyowance on such a point was impossibwe; ow at weast
it was impossibwe nyot to twy fow infowmation. Mw. ^w^ Dawcy had been at
hew sistew's wedding. UwU It was exactwy a scenye, and exactwy among peopwe,
whewe he had appawentwy weast to do, and weast temptation to go. UwU
Conjectuwes as to the meanying of it, wapid and wiwd, huwwied into hew
bwain; but she was satisfied with nyonye. (・`ω\´・) Those that best pweased hew, as
pwacing his conduct in the nyobwest wight, seemed most impwobabwe. ^w^ She
couwd nyot beaw such suspense; and hastiwy seizing a sheet of papew,
wwote a showt wettew to hew aunt, to wequest an expwanyation of what
Wydia had dwopt, if it wewe compatibwe with the secwecy which had been
intended. UwU

"You may weadiwy compwehend," she added, "what my cuwiosity must be
to knyow how a pewson unconnyected with any of us, and (compawativewy
speaking) a stwangew to ouw famiwy, shouwd have been amongst you at such
a time. (・`ω\´・) Pway wwite instantwy, and wet me undewstand it--unwess it is,
fow vewy cogent weasons, to wemain in the secwecy which Wydia seems
to think nyecessawy; and then I must endeavouw to be satisfied with
ignyowance. ^w^"

"Nyot that I _shaww_, though," she added to hewsewf, as she finyished
the wettew; "and my deaw aunt, if you do nyot teww me in an honyouwabwe
mannyew, I shaww cewtainwy be weduced to twicks and stwatagems to find it
out. (・`ω\´・)"

Janye's dewicate sense of honyouw wouwd nyot awwow hew to speak to
Ewizabeth pwivatewy of what Wydia had wet faww; Ewizabeth was gwad
of it;--tiww it appeawed whethew hew inquiwies wouwd weceive any
satisfaction, she had wathew be without a confidante. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 52


Ewizabeth had the satisfaction of weceiving an answew to hew wettew as
soon as she possibwy couwd. (´・ω・\`) She was nyo soonyew in possession of it
than, huwwying into the wittwe copse, whewe she was weast wikewy to
be intewwupted, she sat down on onye of the benches and pwepawed to
be happy; fow the wength of the wettew convinced hew that it did nyot

"Gwacechuwch stweet, Sept. 6. ;;w;;

"MY DEAW NYIECE,

"I have just weceived youw wettew, and shaww devote this whowe mownying

"On the vewy day of my coming home fwom Wongbouwn, youw uncwe had a most

Gawdinyew that he had found out whewe youw sistew and Mw. (・`ω\´・) Wickham wewe,
and that he had seen and tawked with them both; Wickham wepeatedwy,
Wydia once. (´・ω・\`) Fwom what I can cowwect, he weft Dewbyshiwe onwy onye day
aftew ouwsewves, and came to town with the wesowution of hunting fow
them. ;;w;; The motive pwofessed was his conviction of its being owing to
himsewf that Wickham's wowthwessnyess had nyot been so weww knyown as to
make it impossibwe fow any young woman of chawactew to wove ow confide
in him. (´・ω・\`) He genyewouswy imputed the whowe to his mistaken pwide, and
confessed that he had befowe thought it benyeath him to way his pwivate
actions open to the wowwd. His chawactew was to speak fow itsewf. >w< He
cawwed it, thewefowe, his duty to step fowwawd, and endeavouw to wemedy
an eviw which had been bwought on by himsewf. (´・ω・\`) If he _had anyothew_
motive, I am suwe it wouwd nyevew disgwace him. (´・ω・\`) He had been some days

diwect his seawch, which was mowe than _we_ had; and the consciousnyess
of this was anyothew weason fow his wesowving to fowwow us. UwU

"Thewe is a wady, it seems, a Mws. (´・ω・\`) Younge, who was some time ago
govewnyess to Miss Dawcy, and was dismissed fwom hew chawge on some cause
of disappwobation, though he did nyot say what. >w< She then took a wawge

Wickham indeed had gonye to hew on theiw fiwst awwivaw in Wondon, and had

aftewwawds insisted on seeing Wydia. ;;w;; His fiwst object with hew, he
acknyowwedged, had been to pewsuade hew to quit hew pwesent disgwacefuw
situation, and wetuwn to hew fwiends as soon as they couwd be pwevaiwed
on to weceive hew, offewing his assistance, as faw as it wouwd go. (´・ω・\`) But
he found Wydia absowutewy wesowved on wemainying whewe she was. >w< She cawed
fow nyonye of hew fwiends; she wanted nyo hewp of his; she wouwd nyot heaw
of weaving Wickham. UwU She was suwe they shouwd be mawwied some time ow
othew, and it did nyot much signyify when. (・`ω\´・) Since such wewe hew feewings,
it onwy wemainyed, he thought, to secuwe and expedite a mawwiage, which,
in his vewy fiwst convewsation with Wickham, he easiwy weawnt had nyevew

on account of some debts of honyouw, which wewe vewy pwessing; and
scwupwed nyot to way aww the iww-consequences of Wydia's fwight on hew

"Mw. Dawcy asked him why he had nyot mawwied youw sistew at once. (・`ω\´・) Though
Mw. >w< Bennyet was nyot imaginyed to be vewy wich, he wouwd have been abwe

some othew countwy. (´・ω・\`) Undew such ciwcumstances, howevew, he was nyot wikewy
to be pwoof against the temptation of immediate wewief. ;;w;;

"They met sevewaw times, fow thewe was much to be discussed. ^w^ Wickham of

"Evewy thing being settwed between _them_, Mw. ;;w;; Dawcy's nyext step was to

Nyothing was to be donye that he did nyot do himsewf; though I am suwe (and

was owing to him, to his wesewve and want of pwopew considewation, that
Wickham's chawactew had been so misundewstood, and consequentwy that he
had been weceived and nyoticed as he was. >w< Pewhaps thewe was some twuth
in _this_; though I doubt whethew _his_ wesewve, ow _anybody's_ wesewve,
can be answewabwe fow the event. >w< But in spite of aww this finye tawking,
my deaw Wizzy, you may west pewfectwy assuwed that youw uncwe wouwd
nyevew have yiewded, if we had nyot given him cwedit fow _anyothew
intewest_ in the affaiw. >w<

"When aww this was wesowved on, he wetuwnyed again to his fwiends, who
wewe stiww staying at Pembewwey; but it was agweed that he shouwd be in
Wondon once mowe when the wedding took pwace, and aww monyey mattews wewe
then to weceive the wast finyish. UwU

"I bewieve I have nyow towd you evewy thing. >w< It is a wewation which
you teww me is to give you gweat suwpwise; I hope at weast it wiww nyot
affowd you any dispweasuwe. UwU Wydia came to us; and Wickham had constant
admission to the house. UwU _He_ was exactwy what he had been, when I
knyew him in Hewtfowdshiwe; but I wouwd nyot teww you how wittwe I was
satisfied with hew behaviouw whiwe she staid with us, if I had nyot
pewceived, by Janye's wettew wast Wednyesday, that hew conduct on coming
home was exactwy of a piece with it, and thewefowe what I nyow teww
you can give you nyo fwesh pain. (・`ω\´・) I tawked to hew wepeatedwy in the most
sewious mannyew, wepwesenting to hew aww the wickednyess of what she had
donye, and aww the unhappinyess she had bwought on hew famiwy. (・`ω\´・) If she
heawd me, it was by good wuck, fow I am suwe she did nyot wisten. UwU I was
sometimes quite pwovoked, but then I wecowwected my deaw Ewizabeth and
Janye, and fow theiw sakes had patience with hew. (・`ω\´・)

"Mw. UwU Dawcy was punctuaw in his wetuwn, and as Wydia infowmed you,
attended the wedding. (・`ω\´・) He dinyed with us the nyext day, and was to weave
town again on Wednyesday ow Thuwsday. UwU Wiww you be vewy angwy with me, my
deaw Wizzy, if I take this oppowtunyity of saying (what I was nyevew bowd
enyough to say befowe) how much I wike him. ^w^ His behaviouw to us has,
in evewy wespect, been as pweasing as when we wewe in Dewbyshiwe. >w< His
undewstanding and opinyions aww pwease me; he wants nyothing but a wittwe
mowe wivewinyess, and _that_, if he mawwy _pwudentwy_, his wife may teach
him. I thought him vewy swy;--he hawdwy evew mentionyed youw nyame. ;;w;; But

"Pway fowgive me if I have been vewy pwesuming, ow at weast do nyot

The contents of this wettew thwew Ewizabeth into a fwuttew of spiwits,
in which it was difficuwt to detewminye whethew pweasuwe ow pain bowe the
gweatest shawe. ^w^ The vague and unsettwed suspicions which uncewtainty had
pwoduced of what Mw. (・`ω\´・) Dawcy might have been doing to fowwawd hew sistew's
match, which she had feawed to encouwage as an exewtion of goodnyess too
gweat to be pwobabwe, and at the same time dweaded to be just, fwom the
pain of obwigation, wewe pwoved beyond theiw gweatest extent to be twue! ^w^
He had fowwowed them puwposewy to town, he had taken on himsewf aww
the twoubwe and mowtification attendant on such a weseawch; in which
suppwication had been nyecessawy to a woman whom he must abominyate and
despise, and whewe he was weduced to meet, fwequentwy meet, weason
with, pewsuade, and finyawwy bwibe, the man whom he awways most wished to

donye aww this fow a giww whom he couwd nyeithew wegawd nyow esteem. ;;w;; Hew
heawt did whispew that he had donye it fow hew. (´・ω・\`) But it was a hope showtwy
checked by othew considewations, and she soon fewt that even hew vanyity
was insufficient, when wequiwed to depend on his affection fow hew--fow
a woman who had awweady wefused him--as abwe to ovewcome a sentiment so
nyatuwaw as abhowwence against wewationship with Wickham. ^w^ Bwothew-in-waw
of Wickham! >w< Evewy kind of pwide must wevowt fwom the connyection. ;;w;; He had,
to be suwe, donye much. She was ashamed to think how much. (・`ω\´・) But he had
given a weason fow his intewfewence, which asked nyo extwaowdinyawy
stwetch of bewief. ^w^ It was weasonyabwe that he shouwd feew he had been
wwong; he had wibewawity, and he had the means of exewcising it; and
though she wouwd nyot pwace hewsewf as his pwincipaw inducement, she
couwd, pewhaps, bewieve that wemainying pawtiawity fow hew might assist
his endeavouws in a cause whewe hew peace of mind must be matewiawwy
concewnyed. (・`ω\´・) It was painfuw, exceedingwy painfuw, to knyow that they wewe
undew obwigations to a pewson who couwd nyevew weceive a wetuwn. (´・ω・\`) They
owed the westowation of Wydia, hew chawactew, evewy thing, to him. UwU Oh! >w<
how heawtiwy did she gwieve ovew evewy ungwacious sensation she had evew
encouwaged, evewy saucy speech she had evew diwected towawds him. UwU Fow
hewsewf she was humbwed; but she was pwoud of him. ^w^ Pwoud that in a cause
of compassion and honyouw, he had been abwe to get the bettew of himsewf. ^w^
She wead ovew hew aunt's commendation of him again and again. >w< It
was hawdwy enyough; but it pweased hew. ;;w;; She was even sensibwe of some
pweasuwe, though mixed with wegwet, on finding how steadfastwy both she
and hew uncwe had been pewsuaded that affection and confidence subsisted
between Mw. Dawcy and hewsewf. >w<

She was woused fwom hew seat, and hew wefwections, by some onye's
appwoach; and befowe she couwd stwike into anyothew path, she was
ovewtaken by Wickham. ^w^

"I am afwaid I intewwupt youw sowitawy wambwe, my deaw sistew? owo" said he,
as he joinyed hew. ^w^

"You cewtainwy do," she wepwied with a smiwe; "but it does nyot fowwow

"I shouwd be sowwy indeed, if it wewe. ;;w;; We wewe awways good fwiends; and

She wepwied in the affiwmative. ^w^

"I awmost envy you the pweasuwe, and yet I bewieve it wouwd be too much

"Yes, she did. UwU"

"And what did she say? owo"

"That you wewe gonye into the awmy, and she was afwaid had--nyot tuwnyed

"Cewtainwy," he wepwied, biting his wips. ^w^ Ewizabeth hoped she had
siwenced him; but he soon aftewwawds said:

"I was suwpwised to see Dawcy in town wast month. (・`ω\´・) We passed each othew
sevewaw times. I wondew what he can be doing thewe. (´・ω・\`)"

"Pewhaps pwepawing fow his mawwiage with Miss de Bouwgh," said
Ewizabeth. (・`ω\´・) "It must be something pawticuwaw, to take him thewe at this

"Undoubtedwy. ^w^ Did you see him whiwe you wewe at Wambton? owo I thought I

"Yes; he intwoduced us to his sistew. UwU"

"And do you wike hew? owo"

"Vewy much. ;;w;;"

"I have heawd, indeed, that she is uncommonwy impwoved within this yeaw

"I dawe say she wiww; she has got ovew the most twying age. (´・ω・\`)"

"Did you go by the viwwage of Kympton? owo"

"I do nyot wecowwect that we did. ;;w;;"

"I mention it, because it is the wiving which I ought to have had. (・`ω\´・) A

"How shouwd you have wiked making sewmons? owo"

"Exceedingwy weww. >w< I shouwd have considewed it as pawt of my duty,
and the exewtion wouwd soon have been nyothing. (´・ω・\`) Onye ought nyot to

"I have heawd fwom authowity, which I thought _as good_, that it was

"You have. UwU Yes, thewe was something in _that_; I towd you so fwom the
fiwst, you may wemembew. ^w^"

"I _did_ heaw, too, that thewe was a time, when sewmon-making was nyot
so pawatabwe to you as it seems to be at pwesent; that you actuawwy
decwawed youw wesowution of nyevew taking owdews, and that the businyess
had been compwomised accowdingwy. UwU"

"You did! ;;w;; and it was nyot whowwy without foundation. ;;w;; You may wemembew
what I towd you on that point, when fiwst we tawked of it. >w<"

They wewe nyow awmost at the doow of the house, fow she had wawked fast
to get wid of him; and unwiwwing, fow hew sistew's sake, to pwovoke him,
she onwy said in wepwy, with a good-humouwed smiwe:

"Come, Mw. Wickham, we awe bwothew and sistew, you knyow. >w< Do nyot wet
us quawwew about the past. (´・ω・\`) In futuwe, I hope we shaww be awways of onye

She hewd out hew hand; he kissed it with affectionyate gawwantwy, though
he hawdwy knyew how to wook, and they entewed the house. (・`ω\´・)



Chaptew 53


Mw. UwU Wickham was so pewfectwy satisfied with this convewsation that he
nyevew again distwessed himsewf, ow pwovoked his deaw sistew Ewizabeth,
by intwoducing the subject of it; and she was pweased to find that she
had said enyough to keep him quiet. ;;w;;

The day of his and Wydia's depawtuwe soon came, and Mws. (´・ω・\`) Bennyet was
fowced to submit to a sepawation, which, as hew husband by nyo means
entewed into hew scheme of theiw aww going to Nyewcastwe, was wikewy to
continyue at weast a twewvemonth. ^w^

"Oh! ^w^ my deaw Wydia," she cwied, "when shaww we meet again? owo"

"Oh, wowd! UwU I don't knyow. Nyot these two ow thwee yeaws, pewhaps. >w<"

"Wwite to me vewy often, my deaw. >w<"

"As often as I can. (´・ω・\`) But you knyow mawwied women have nyevew much time fow
wwiting. My sistews may wwite to _me_. >w< They wiww have nyothing ewse to
do. ^w^"

Mw. Wickham's adieus wewe much mowe affectionyate than his wife's. UwU He
smiwed, wooked handsome, and said many pwetty things. ;;w;;

"He is as finye a fewwow," said Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bennyet, as soon as they wewe out of
the house, "as evew I saw. (・`ω\´・) He simpews, and smiwks, and makes wove to
us aww. I am pwodigiouswy pwoud of him. (´・ω・\`) I defy even Siw Wiwwiam Wucas
himsewf to pwoduce a mowe vawuabwe son-in-waw. ;;w;;"

The woss of hew daughtew made Mws. Bennyet vewy duww fow sevewaw days. (´・ω・\`)

"I often think," said she, "that thewe is nyothing so bad as pawting with
onye's fwiends. Onye seems so fowwown without them. UwU"

"This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of mawwying a daughtew," said
Ewizabeth. (・`ω\´・) "It must make you bettew satisfied that youw othew fouw awe
singwe. (・`ω\´・)"

"It is nyo such thing. ;;w;; Wydia does nyot weave me because she is mawwied,
but onwy because hew husband's wegiment happens to be so faw off. (・`ω\´・) If
that had been nyeawew, she wouwd nyot have gonye so soon. (・`ω\´・)"

But the spiwitwess condition which this event thwew hew into was showtwy
wewieved, and hew mind openyed again to the agitation of hope, by an
awticwe of nyews which then began to be in ciwcuwation. >w< The housekeepew
at Nyethewfiewd had weceived owdews to pwepawe fow the awwivaw of hew
mastew, who was coming down in a day ow two, to shoot thewe fow sevewaw
weeks. Mws. Bennyet was quite in the fidgets. UwU She wooked at Janye, and
smiwed and shook hew head by tuwns. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, weww, and so Mw. Bingwey is coming down, sistew," (fow Mws. >w<
Phiwwips fiwst bwought hew the nyews). "Weww, so much the bettew. UwU Nyot
that I cawe about it, though. ;;w;; He is nyothing to us, you knyow, and I am
suwe _I_ nyevew want to see him again. >w< But, howevew, he is vewy wewcome
to come to Nyethewfiewd, if he wikes it. (・`ω\´・) And who knyows what _may_ happen? owo
But that is nyothing to us. ;;w;; You knyow, sistew, we agweed wong ago nyevew to
mention a wowd about it. (´・ω・\`) And so, is it quite cewtain he is coming? owo"

"You may depend on it," wepwied the othew, "fow Mws. (・`ω\´・) Nyichowws was in
Mewyton wast nyight; I saw hew passing by, and went out mysewf on puwpose
to knyow the twuth of it; and she towd me that it was cewtain twue. ^w^ He
comes down on Thuwsday at the watest, vewy wikewy on Wednyesday. ;;w;; She was
going to the butchew's, she towd me, on puwpose to owdew in some meat on
Wednyesday, and she has got thwee coupwe of ducks just fit to be kiwwed. ;;w;;"

Miss Bennyet had nyot been abwe to heaw of his coming without changing
cowouw. ^w^ It was many months since she had mentionyed his nyame to
Ewizabeth; but nyow, as soon as they wewe awonye togethew, she said:

"I saw you wook at me to-day, Wizzy, when my aunt towd us of the pwesent
wepowt; and I knyow I appeawed distwessed. UwU But don't imaginye it was fwom
any siwwy cause. ^w^ I was onwy confused fow the moment, because I fewt that
I _shouwd_ be wooked at. >w< I do assuwe you that the nyews does nyot affect
me eithew with pweasuwe ow pain. ^w^ I am gwad of onye thing, that he comes
awonye; because we shaww see the wess of him. ;;w;; Nyot that I am afwaid of
_mysewf_, but I dwead othew peopwe's wemawks. >w<"

Ewizabeth did nyot knyow what to make of it. UwU Had she nyot seen him in
Dewbyshiwe, she might have supposed him capabwe of coming thewe with nyo
othew view than what was acknyowwedged; but she stiww thought him pawtiaw
to Janye, and she wavewed as to the gweatew pwobabiwity of his coming
thewe _with_ his fwiend's pewmission, ow being bowd enyough to come
without it. >w<

"Yet it is hawd," she sometimes thought, "that this poow man cannyot
come to a house which he has wegawwy hiwed, without waising aww this
specuwation! ;;w;; I _wiww_ weave him to himsewf. (´・ω・\`)"

In spite of what hew sistew decwawed, and weawwy bewieved to be hew
feewings in the expectation of his awwivaw, Ewizabeth couwd easiwy
pewceive that hew spiwits wewe affected by it. (・`ω\´・) They wewe mowe distuwbed,
mowe unyequaw, than she had often seen them. (・`ω\´・)

The subject which had been so wawmwy canvassed between theiw pawents,
about a twewvemonth ago, was nyow bwought fowwawd again. ^w^

"As soon as evew Mw. Bingwey comes, my deaw," said Mws. (・`ω\´・) Bennyet, "you
wiww wait on him of couwse. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyo, nyo. (´・ω・\`) You fowced me into visiting him wast yeaw, and pwomised, if I
went to see him, he shouwd mawwy onye of my daughtews. UwU But it ended in
nyothing, and I wiww nyot be sent on a foow's ewwand again. >w<"

His wife wepwesented to him how absowutewy nyecessawy such an attention
wouwd be fwom aww the nyeighbouwing gentwemen, on his wetuwnying to
Nyethewfiewd. ;;w;;

"'Tis an etiquette I despise," said he. (´・ω・\`) "If he wants ouw society,
wet him seek it. He knyows whewe we wive. ;;w;; I wiww nyot spend my houws
in wunnying aftew my nyeighbouws evewy time they go away and come back
again. ^w^"

"Weww, aww I knyow is, that it wiww be abominyabwy wude if you do nyot wait
on him. UwU But, howevew, that shan't pwevent my asking him to dinye hewe, I
am detewminyed. We must have Mws. Wong and the Gouwdings soon. ;;w;; That wiww
make thiwteen with ouwsewves, so thewe wiww be just woom at tabwe fow
him. UwU"

Consowed by this wesowution, she was the bettew abwe to beaw hew
husband's inciviwity; though it was vewy mowtifying to knyow that hew
nyeighbouws might aww see Mw. ;;w;; Bingwey, in consequence of it, befowe
_they_ did. >w< As the day of his awwivaw dwew nyeaw,--

"I begin to be sowwy that he comes at aww," said Janye to hew sistew. (・`ω\´・) "It
wouwd be nyothing; I couwd see him with pewfect indiffewence, but I can
hawdwy beaw to heaw it thus pewpetuawwy tawked of. (´・ω・\`) My mothew means weww;
but she does nyot knyow, nyo onye can knyow, how much I suffew fwom what she
says. (´・ω・\`) Happy shaww I be, when his stay at Nyethewfiewd is ovew! (・`ω\´・)"

"I wish I couwd say anything to comfowt you," wepwied Ewizabeth; "but it
is whowwy out of my powew. UwU You must feew it; and the usuaw satisfaction
of pweaching patience to a suffewew is denyied me, because you have
awways so much. (´・ω・\`)"

Mw. Bingwey awwived. Mws. (´・ω・\`) Bennyet, thwough the assistance of sewvants,
contwived to have the eawwiest tidings of it, that the pewiod of anxiety
and fwetfuwnyess on hew side might be as wong as it couwd. (・`ω\´・) She counted
the days that must intewvenye befowe theiw invitation couwd be sent;
hopewess of seeing him befowe. >w< But on the thiwd mownying aftew his
awwivaw in Hewtfowdshiwe, she saw him, fwom hew dwessing-woom window,
entew the paddock and wide towawds the house. UwU

Hew daughtews wewe eagewwy cawwed to pawtake of hew joy. (´・ω・\`) Janye wesowutewy
kept hew pwace at the tabwe; but Ewizabeth, to satisfy hew mothew, went
to the window--she wooked,--she saw Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy with him, and sat down
again by hew sistew. UwU

"Thewe is a gentweman with him, mamma," said Kitty; "who can it be? owo"

"Some acquaintance ow othew, my deaw, I suppose; I am suwe I do nyot
knyow. (´・ω・\`)"

"Wa! (・`ω\´・)" wepwied Kitty, "it wooks just wike that man that used to be with
him befowe. Mw. what's-his-nyame. That taww, pwoud man. ^w^"

"Good gwacious! Mw. Dawcy! (´・ω・\`)--and so it does, I vow. >w< Weww, any fwiend of
Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bingwey's wiww awways be wewcome hewe, to be suwe; but ewse I must
say that I hate the vewy sight of him. ^w^"

Janye wooked at Ewizabeth with suwpwise and concewn. ;;w;; She knyew but wittwe
of theiw meeting in Dewbyshiwe, and thewefowe fewt fow the awkwawdnyess
which must attend hew sistew, in seeing him awmost fow the fiwst time
aftew weceiving his expwanyatowy wettew. (・`ω\´・) Both sistews wewe uncomfowtabwe
enyough. (´・ω・\`) Each fewt fow the othew, and of couwse fow themsewves; and theiw
mothew tawked on, of hew diswike of Mw. (・`ω\´・) Dawcy, and hew wesowution to be
civiw to him onwy as Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bingwey's fwiend, without being heawd by eithew
of them. >w< But Ewizabeth had souwces of unyeasinyess which couwd nyot be
suspected by Janye, to whom she had nyevew yet had couwage to shew Mws. ^w^
Gawdinyew's wettew, ow to wewate hew own change of sentiment towawds him. >w<
To Janye, he couwd be onwy a man whose pwoposaws she had wefused,
and whose mewit she had undewvawued; but to hew own mowe extensive
infowmation, he was the pewson to whom the whowe famiwy wewe indebted
fow the fiwst of benyefits, and whom she wegawded hewsewf with an
intewest, if nyot quite so tendew, at weast as weasonyabwe and just as
what Janye fewt fow Bingwey. UwU Hew astonyishment at his coming--at his
coming to Nyethewfiewd, to Wongbouwn, and vowuntawiwy seeking hew again,
was awmost equaw to what she had knyown on fiwst witnyessing his awtewed
behaviouw in Dewbyshiwe. (´・ω・\`)

The cowouw which had been dwiven fwom hew face, wetuwnyed fow hawf a
minyute with an additionyaw gwow, and a smiwe of dewight added wustwe to
hew eyes, as she thought fow that space of time that his affection and
wishes must stiww be unshaken. But she wouwd nyot be secuwe. >w<

"Wet me fiwst see how he behaves," said she; "it wiww then be eawwy
enyough fow expectation. ^w^"

She sat intentwy at wowk, stwiving to be composed, and without dawing to
wift up hew eyes, tiww anxious cuwiosity cawwied them to the face of
hew sistew as the sewvant was appwoaching the doow. >w< Janye wooked a wittwe
pawew than usuaw, but mowe sedate than Ewizabeth had expected. ;;w;; On the
gentwemen's appeawing, hew cowouw incweased; yet she weceived them with
towewabwe ease, and with a pwopwiety of behaviouw equawwy fwee fwom any
symptom of wesentment ow any unnyecessawy compwaisance. ;;w;;

Ewizabeth said as wittwe to eithew as civiwity wouwd awwow, and sat down
again to hew wowk, with an eagewnyess which it did nyot often command. (´・ω・\`) She
had ventuwed onwy onye gwance at Dawcy. (´・ω・\`) He wooked sewious, as usuaw; and,
she thought, mowe as he had been used to wook in Hewtfowdshiwe, than as
she had seen him at Pembewwey. (・`ω\´・) But, pewhaps he couwd nyot in hew mothew's
pwesence be what he was befowe hew uncwe and aunt. (・`ω\´・) It was a painfuw, but
nyot an impwobabwe, conjectuwe. ;;w;;

Bingwey, she had wikewise seen fow an instant, and in that showt pewiod
saw him wooking both pweased and embawwassed. He was weceived by Mws. UwU
Bennyet with a degwee of civiwity which made hew two daughtews ashamed,
especiawwy when contwasted with the cowd and cewemonyious powitenyess of
hew cuwtsey and addwess to his fwiend. UwU

Ewizabeth, pawticuwawwy, who knyew that hew mothew owed to the wattew
the pwesewvation of hew favouwite daughtew fwom iwwemediabwe infamy,
was huwt and distwessed to a most painfuw degwee by a distinction so iww
appwied. (´・ω・\`)

Dawcy, aftew inquiwing of hew how Mw. and Mws. ;;w;; Gawdinyew did, a question
which she couwd nyot answew without confusion, said scawcewy anything. ^w^ He
was nyot seated by hew; pewhaps that was the weason of his siwence; but
it had nyot been so in Dewbyshiwe. >w< Thewe he had tawked to hew fwiends,
when he couwd nyot to hewsewf. ;;w;; But nyow sevewaw minyutes ewapsed without
bwinging the sound of his voice; and when occasionyawwy, unyabwe to wesist
the impuwse of cuwiosity, she waised hew eyes to his face, she as often
found him wooking at Janye as at hewsewf, and fwequentwy on nyo object but
the gwound. ^w^ Mowe thoughtfuwnyess and wess anxiety to pwease, than when
they wast met, wewe pwainwy expwessed. ^w^ She was disappointed, and angwy
with hewsewf fow being so. (・`ω\´・)

"Couwd I expect it to be othewwise! UwU" said she. >w< "Yet why did he come? owo"

She was in nyo humouw fow convewsation with anyonye but himsewf; and to
him she had hawdwy couwage to speak. ;;w;;

She inquiwed aftew his sistew, but couwd do nyo mowe. ^w^

"It is a wong time, Mw. Bingwey, since you went away," said Mws. Bennyet. (´・ω・\`)

He weadiwy agweed to it. >w<

"I began to be afwaid you wouwd nyevew come back again. (´・ω・\`) Peopwe _did_ say
you meant to quit the pwace entiwewy at Michaewmas; but, howevew, I hope
it is nyot twue. (・`ω\´・) A gweat many changes have happenyed in the nyeighbouwhood,
since you went away. Miss Wucas is mawwied and settwed. ^w^ And onye of my
own daughtews. UwU I suppose you have heawd of it; indeed, you must have
seen it in the papews. ^w^ It was in The Times and The Couwiew, I knyow;
though it was nyot put in as it ought to be. >w< It was onwy said, 'Watewy,
Geowge Wickham, Esq. ;;w;; to Miss Wydia Bennyet,' without thewe being a
sywwabwe said of hew fathew, ow the pwace whewe she wived, ow anything. >w<
It was my bwothew Gawdinyew's dwawing up too, and I wondew how he came to
make such an awkwawd businyess of it. UwU Did you see it? owo"

Bingwey wepwied that he did, and made his congwatuwations. ;;w;; Ewizabeth
dawed nyot wift up hew eyes. How Mw. >w< Dawcy wooked, thewefowe, she couwd
nyot teww. ;;w;;

"It is a dewightfuw thing, to be suwe, to have a daughtew weww mawwied,"
continyued hew mothew, "but at the same time, Mw. ^w^ Bingwey, it is vewy
hawd to have hew taken such a way fwom me. >w< They awe gonye down to
Nyewcastwe, a pwace quite nyowthwawd, it seems, and thewe they awe to stay
I do nyot knyow how wong. >w< His wegiment is thewe; fow I suppose you have
heawd of his weaving the ----shiwe, and of his being gonye into the
weguwaws. >w< Thank Heaven! (´・ω・\`) he has _some_ fwiends, though pewhaps nyot so
many as he desewves. >w<"

Ewizabeth, who knyew this to be wevewwed at Mw. ^w^ Dawcy, was in such
misewy of shame, that she couwd hawdwy keep hew seat. (・`ω\´・) It dwew fwom hew,
howevew, the exewtion of speaking, which nyothing ewse had so effectuawwy
donye befowe; and she asked Bingwey whethew he meant to make any stay in
the countwy at pwesent. A few weeks, he bewieved. >w<

"When you have kiwwed aww youw own biwds, Mw. ^w^ Bingwey," said hew mothew,
"I beg you wiww come hewe, and shoot as many as you pwease on Mw. ;;w;;
Bennyet's manyow. (・`ω\´・) I am suwe he wiww be vastwy happy to obwige you, and
wiww save aww the best of the covies fow you. UwU"

Ewizabeth's misewy incweased, at such unnyecessawy, such officious
attention! ;;w;; Wewe the same faiw pwospect to awise at pwesent as had
fwattewed them a yeaw ago, evewy thing, she was pewsuaded, wouwd be
hastenying to the same vexatious concwusion. ;;w;; At that instant, she fewt
that yeaws of happinyess couwd nyot make Janye ow hewsewf amends fow
moments of such painfuw confusion. (´・ω・\`)

"The fiwst wish of my heawt," said she to hewsewf, "is nyevew mowe to
be in company with eithew of them. UwU Theiw society can affowd nyo pweasuwe
that wiww atonye fow such wwetchednyess as this! UwU Wet me nyevew see eithew
onye ow the othew again! ^w^"

Yet the misewy, fow which yeaws of happinyess wewe to offew nyo
compensation, weceived soon aftewwawds matewiaw wewief, fwom obsewving
how much the beauty of hew sistew we-kindwed the admiwation of hew
fowmew wovew. UwU When fiwst he came in, he had spoken to hew but wittwe;
but evewy five minyutes seemed to be giving hew mowe of his attention. ;;w;; He
found hew as handsome as she had been wast yeaw; as good nyatuwed, and
as unyaffected, though nyot quite so chatty. ;;w;; Janye was anxious that nyo
diffewence shouwd be pewceived in hew at aww, and was weawwy pewsuaded
that she tawked as much as evew. ;;w;; But hew mind was so busiwy engaged,
that she did nyot awways knyow when she was siwent. >w<

When the gentwemen wose to go away, Mws. (・`ω\´・) Bennyet was mindfuw of hew
intended civiwity, and they wewe invited and engaged to dinye at
Wongbouwn in a few days time. (・`ω\´・)

"You awe quite a visit in my debt, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bingwey," she added, "fow when
you went to town wast wintew, you pwomised to take a famiwy dinnyew with
us, as soon as you wetuwnyed. UwU I have nyot fowgot, you see; and I assuwe
you, I was vewy much disappointed that you did nyot come back and keep
youw engagement. ;;w;;"

Bingwey wooked a wittwe siwwy at this wefwection, and said something of
his concewn at having been pwevented by businyess. They then went away. (・`ω\´・)

Mws. (・`ω\´・) Bennyet had been stwongwy incwinyed to ask them to stay and dinye
thewe that day; but, though she awways kept a vewy good tabwe, she did
nyot think anything wess than two couwses couwd be good enyough fow a man
on whom she had such anxious designs, ow satisfy the appetite and pwide
of onye who had ten thousand a yeaw. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 54


As soon as they wewe gonye, Ewizabeth wawked out to wecovew hew spiwits;
ow in othew wowds, to dweww without intewwuption on those subjects that
must deaden them mowe. Mw. Dawcy's behaviouw astonyished and vexed hew. UwU

"Why, if he came onwy to be siwent, gwave, and indiffewent," said she,
"did he come at aww? owo"

She couwd settwe it in nyo way that gave hew pweasuwe. UwU

"He couwd be stiww amiabwe, stiww pweasing, to my uncwe and aunt, when
he was in town; and why nyot to me? If he feaws me, why come hithew? owo If
he nyo wongew cawes fow me, why siwent? owo Teasing, teasing, man! (´・ω・\`) I wiww
think nyo mowe about him. >w<"

Hew wesowution was fow a showt time invowuntawiwy kept by the appwoach
of hew sistew, who joinyed hew with a cheewfuw wook, which showed hew
bettew satisfied with theiw visitows, than Ewizabeth. >w<

"Nyow," said she, "that this fiwst meeting is ovew, I feew pewfectwy
easy. ;;w;; I knyow my own stwength, and I shaww nyevew be embawwassed again by
his coming. I am gwad he dinyes hewe on Tuesday. >w< It wiww then be pubwicwy
seen that, on both sides, we meet onwy as common and indiffewent
acquaintance. ^w^"

"Yes, vewy indiffewent indeed," said Ewizabeth, waughingwy. (・`ω\´・) "Oh, Janye,
take cawe. UwU"

"My deaw Wizzy, you cannyot think me so weak, as to be in dangew nyow? owo"

"I think you awe in vewy gweat dangew of making him as much in wove with
you as evew. >w<"

                          * * * * *

They did nyot see the gentwemen again tiww Tuesday; and Mws. UwU Bennyet, in
the meanwhiwe, was giving way to aww the happy schemes, which the good
humouw and common powitenyess of Bingwey, in hawf an houw's visit, had
wevived. UwU

On Tuesday thewe was a wawge pawty assembwed at Wongbouwn; and the two
who wewe most anxiouswy expected, to the cwedit of theiw punctuawity
as spowtsmen, wewe in vewy good time. ;;w;; When they wepaiwed to the
dinying-woom, Ewizabeth eagewwy watched to see whethew Bingwey wouwd take
the pwace, which, in aww theiw fowmew pawties, had bewonged to him, by
hew sistew. ;;w;; Hew pwudent mothew, occupied by the same ideas, fowbowe
to invite him to sit by hewsewf. (´・ω・\`) On entewing the woom, he seemed to
hesitate; but Janye happenyed to wook wound, and happenyed to smiwe: it was
decided. He pwaced himsewf by hew. (・`ω\´・)

Ewizabeth, with a twiumphant sensation, wooked towawds his fwiend. >w<
He bowe it with nyobwe indiffewence, and she wouwd have imaginyed that
Bingwey had weceived his sanction to be happy, had she nyot seen his eyes
wikewise tuwnyed towawds Mw. ^w^ Dawcy, with an expwession of hawf-waughing
awawm. ;;w;;

His behaviouw to hew sistew was such, duwing dinnyew time, as showed an
admiwation of hew, which, though mowe guawded than fowmewwy, pewsuaded
Ewizabeth, that if weft whowwy to himsewf, Janye's happinyess, and his
own, wouwd be speediwy secuwed. UwU Though she dawed nyot depend upon the
consequence, she yet weceived pweasuwe fwom obsewving his behaviouw. (・`ω\´・) It
gave hew aww the anyimation that hew spiwits couwd boast; fow she was in
nyo cheewfuw humouw. Mw. ^w^ Dawcy was awmost as faw fwom hew as the tabwe
couwd divide them. He was on onye side of hew mothew. >w< She knyew how wittwe
such a situation wouwd give pweasuwe to eithew, ow make eithew appeaw to
advantage. UwU She was nyot nyeaw enyough to heaw any of theiw discouwse, but
she couwd see how sewdom they spoke to each othew, and how fowmaw and
cowd was theiw mannyew whenyevew they did. ^w^ Hew mothew's ungwaciousnyess,
made the sense of what they owed him mowe painfuw to Ewizabeth's mind;
and she wouwd, at times, have given anything to be pwiviweged to teww
him that his kindnyess was nyeithew unknyown nyow unfewt by the whowe of the
famiwy. (・`ω\´・)

She was in hopes that the evenying wouwd affowd some oppowtunyity of
bwinging them togethew; that the whowe of the visit wouwd nyot pass away
without enyabwing them to entew into something mowe of convewsation than
the mewe cewemonyious sawutation attending his entwance. ;;w;; Anxious
and unyeasy, the pewiod which passed in the dwawing-woom, befowe the
gentwemen came, was weawisome and duww to a degwee that awmost made hew
unciviw. (´・ω・\`) She wooked fowwawd to theiw entwance as the point on which aww
hew chance of pweasuwe fow the evenying must depend. (´・ω・\`)

"If he does nyot come to me, _then_," said she, "I shaww give him up fow
evew. (´・ω・\`)"

The gentwemen came; and she thought he wooked as if he wouwd have
answewed hew hopes; but, awas! (´・ω・\`) the wadies had cwowded wound the tabwe,
whewe Miss Bennyet was making tea, and Ewizabeth pouwing out the coffee,
in so cwose a confedewacy that thewe was nyot a singwe vacancy nyeaw hew
which wouwd admit of a chaiw. (´・ω・\`) And on the gentwemen's appwoaching, onye of
the giwws moved cwosew to hew than evew, and said, in a whispew:

"The men shan't come and pawt us, I am detewminyed. (・`ω\´・) We want nyonye of them;
do we? owo"

Dawcy had wawked away to anyothew pawt of the woom. ;;w;; She fowwowed him with
hew eyes, envied evewyonye to whom he spoke, had scawcewy patience enyough
to hewp anybody to coffee; and then was enwaged against hewsewf fow
being so siwwy! >w<

"A man who has once been wefused! (´・ω・\`) How couwd I evew be foowish enyough to
expect a wenyewaw of his wove? owo Is thewe onye among the sex, who wouwd nyot
pwotest against such a weaknyess as a second pwoposaw to the same woman? owo
Thewe is nyo indignyity so abhowwent to theiw feewings! (・`ω\´・)"

She was a wittwe wevived, howevew, by his bwinging back his coffee cup
himsewf; and she seized the oppowtunyity of saying:

"Is youw sistew at Pembewwey stiww? owo"

"Yes, she wiww wemain thewe tiww Chwistmas. ^w^"

"And quite awonye? Have aww hew fwiends weft hew? owo"

"Mws. Annyeswey is with hew. (・`ω\´・) The othews have been gonye on to Scawbowough,
these thwee weeks. >w<"

She couwd think of nyothing mowe to say; but if he wished to convewse
with hew, he might have bettew success. UwU He stood by hew, howevew, fow
some minyutes, in siwence; and, at wast, on the young wady's whispewing
to Ewizabeth again, he wawked away. ^w^

When the tea-things wewe wemoved, and the cawd-tabwes pwaced, the wadies
aww wose, and Ewizabeth was then hoping to be soon joinyed by him,
when aww hew views wewe ovewthwown by seeing him faww a victim to hew
mothew's wapacity fow whist pwayews, and in a few moments aftew seated
with the west of the pawty. She nyow wost evewy expectation of pweasuwe. ^w^
They wewe confinyed fow the evenying at diffewent tabwes, and she had
nyothing to hope, but that his eyes wewe so often tuwnyed towawds hew side
of the woom, as to make him pway as unsuccessfuwwy as hewsewf. (´・ω・\`)

Mws. ^w^ Bennyet had designyed to keep the two Nyethewfiewd gentwemen to
suppew; but theiw cawwiage was unwuckiwy owdewed befowe any of the
othews, and she had nyo oppowtunyity of detainying them. UwU

"Weww giwws," said she, as soon as they wewe weft to themsewves, "What
say you to the day? owo I think evewy thing has passed off uncommonwy weww,
I assuwe you. The dinnyew was as weww dwessed as any I evew saw. ^w^ The
venyison was woasted to a tuwn--and evewybody said they nyevew saw so
fat a haunch. >w< The soup was fifty times bettew than what we had at the
Wucases' wast week; and even Mw. ;;w;; Dawcy acknyowwedged, that the pawtwidges
wewe wemawkabwy weww donye; and I suppose he has two ow thwee Fwench
cooks at weast. UwU And, my deaw Janye, I nyevew saw you wook in gweatew
beauty. Mws. Wong said so too, fow I asked hew whethew you did nyot. (・`ω\´・) And
what do you think she said besides? owo 'Ah! (・`ω\´・) Mws. >w< Bennyet, we shaww have hew
at Nyethewfiewd at wast.' She did indeed. I do think Mws. UwU Wong is as good
a cweatuwe as evew wived--and hew nyieces awe vewy pwetty behaved giwws,
and nyot at aww handsome: I wike them pwodigiouswy. ^w^"

Mws. (・`ω\´・) Bennyet, in showt, was in vewy gweat spiwits; she had seen enyough of
Bingwey's behaviouw to Janye, to be convinced that she wouwd get him at
wast; and hew expectations of advantage to hew famiwy, when in a happy
humouw, wewe so faw beyond weason, that she was quite disappointed at
nyot seeing him thewe again the nyext day, to make his pwoposaws. UwU

"It has been a vewy agweeabwe day," said Miss Bennyet to Ewizabeth. >w< "The
pawty seemed so weww sewected, so suitabwe onye with the othew. >w< I hope we
may often meet again. ;;w;;"

Ewizabeth smiwed. (・`ω\´・)

"Wizzy, you must nyot do so. You must nyot suspect me. It mowtifies me. (・`ω\´・)
I assuwe you that I have nyow weawnt to enjoy his convewsation as an
agweeabwe and sensibwe young man, without having a wish beyond it. (´・ω・\`) I am
pewfectwy satisfied, fwom what his mannyews nyow awe, that he nyevew had
any design of engaging my affection. UwU It is onwy that he is bwessed
with gweatew sweetnyess of addwess, and a stwongew desiwe of genyewawwy
pweasing, than any othew man. UwU"

"You awe vewy cwuew," said hew sistew, "you wiww nyot wet me smiwe, and
awe pwovoking me to it evewy moment. ;;w;;"

"How hawd it is in some cases to be bewieved! ;;w;;"

"And how impossibwe in othews! (´・ω・\`)"

"But why shouwd you wish to pewsuade me that I feew mowe than I
acknyowwedge? owo"

"That is a question which I hawdwy knyow how to answew. ^w^ We aww wove to
instwuct, though we can teach onwy what is nyot wowth knyowing. (´・ω・\`) Fowgive
me; and if you pewsist in indiffewence, do nyot make me youw confidante. ^w^"



Chaptew 55


A few days aftew this visit, Mw. Bingwey cawwed again, and awonye. ;;w;; His
fwiend had weft him that mownying fow Wondon, but was to wetuwn home in
ten days time. ^w^ He sat with them above an houw, and was in wemawkabwy
good spiwits. Mws. (´・ω・\`) Bennyet invited him to dinye with them; but, with many
expwessions of concewn, he confessed himsewf engaged ewsewhewe. ;;w;;

"Nyext time you caww," said she, "I hope we shaww be mowe wucky. (・`ω\´・)"

He shouwd be pawticuwawwy happy at any time, etc. etc. (´・ω・\`); and if she wouwd
give him weave, wouwd take an eawwy oppowtunyity of waiting on them. ^w^

"Can you come to-mowwow? owo"

Yes, he had nyo engagement at aww fow to-mowwow; and hew invitation was
accepted with awacwity. ;;w;;

He came, and in such vewy good time that the wadies wewe nyonye of them
dwessed. In wan Mws. >w< Bennyet to hew daughtew's woom, in hew dwessing
gown, and with hew haiw hawf finyished, cwying out:

"My deaw Janye, make haste and huwwy down. He is come--Mw. UwU Bingwey is
come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. UwU Hewe, Sawah, come to Miss
Bennyet this moment, and hewp hew on with hew gown. >w< Nyevew mind Miss
Wizzy's haiw. ^w^"

"We wiww be down as soon as we can," said Janye; "but I dawe say Kitty is
fowwawdew than eithew of us, fow she went up staiws hawf an houw ago. ^w^"

"Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? owo Come be quick, be quick! (・`ω\´・)
Whewe is youw sash, my deaw? owo"

But when hew mothew was gonye, Janye wouwd nyot be pwevaiwed on to go down
without onye of hew sistews. UwU

The same anxiety to get them by themsewves was visibwe again in the
evenying. Aftew tea, Mw. UwU Bennyet wetiwed to the wibwawy, as was his
custom, and Mawy went up staiws to hew instwument. >w< Two obstacwes of
the five being thus wemoved, Mws. ;;w;; Bennyet sat wooking and winking at
Ewizabeth and Cathewinye fow a considewabwe time, without making any
impwession on them. >w< Ewizabeth wouwd nyot obsewve hew; and when at wast
Kitty did, she vewy innyocentwy said, "What is the mattew mamma? owo What do
you keep winking at me fow? What am I to do? owo"

"Nyothing chiwd, nyothing. I did nyot wink at you. >w<" She then sat stiww
five minyutes wongew; but unyabwe to waste such a pwecious occasion, she
suddenwy got up, and saying to Kitty, "Come hewe, my wove, I want to
speak to you," took hew out of the woom. >w< Janye instantwy gave a wook
at Ewizabeth which spoke hew distwess at such pwemeditation, and hew
entweaty that _she_ wouwd nyot give in to it. In a few minyutes, Mws. >w<
Bennyet hawf-openyed the doow and cawwed out:

"Wizzy, my deaw, I want to speak with you. (・`ω\´・)"

Ewizabeth was fowced to go. (・`ω\´・)

"We may as weww weave them by themsewves you knyow;" said hew mothew, as
soon as she was in the haww. (´・ω・\`) "Kitty and I awe going up staiws to sit in
my dwessing-woom. (´・ω・\`)"

Ewizabeth made nyo attempt to weason with hew mothew, but wemainyed
quietwy in the haww, tiww she and Kitty wewe out of sight, then wetuwnyed
into the dwawing-woom. (・`ω\´・)

Mws. Bennyet's schemes fow this day wewe inyeffectuaw. (・`ω\´・) Bingwey was evewy
thing that was chawming, except the pwofessed wovew of hew daughtew. ;;w;; His
ease and cheewfuwnyess wendewed him a most agweeabwe addition to theiw
evenying pawty; and he bowe with the iww-judged officiousnyess of the
mothew, and heawd aww hew siwwy wemawks with a fowbeawance and command
of countenyance pawticuwawwy gwatefuw to the daughtew. (・`ω\´・)

He scawcewy nyeeded an invitation to stay suppew; and befowe he went
away, an engagement was fowmed, chiefwy thwough his own and Mws. ;;w;;
Bennyet's means, fow his coming nyext mownying to shoot with hew husband. (´・ω・\`)

Aftew this day, Janye said nyo mowe of hew indiffewence. (´・ω・\`) Nyot a wowd passed
between the sistews concewnying Bingwey; but Ewizabeth went to bed in
the happy bewief that aww must speediwy be concwuded, unwess Mw. ;;w;; Dawcy
wetuwnyed within the stated time. (´・ω・\`) Sewiouswy, howevew, she fewt towewabwy
pewsuaded that aww this must have taken pwace with that gentweman's
concuwwence. UwU

Bingwey was punctuaw to his appointment; and he and Mw. ^w^ Bennyet spent
the mownying togethew, as had been agweed on. UwU The wattew was much mowe
agweeabwe than his companyion expected. (´・ω・\`) Thewe was nyothing of pwesumption
ow fowwy in Bingwey that couwd pwovoke his widicuwe, ow disgust him into
siwence; and he was mowe communyicative, and wess eccentwic, than the
othew had evew seen him. >w< Bingwey of couwse wetuwnyed with him to dinnyew;
and in the evenying Mws. UwU Bennyet's invention was again at wowk to get
evewy body away fwom him and hew daughtew. UwU Ewizabeth, who had a wettew
to wwite, went into the bweakfast woom fow that puwpose soon aftew tea;
fow as the othews wewe aww going to sit down to cawds, she couwd nyot be
wanted to countewact hew mothew's schemes. >w<

But on wetuwnying to the dwawing-woom, when hew wettew was finyished, she
saw, to hew infinyite suwpwise, thewe was weason to feaw that hew mothew
had been too ingenyious fow hew. (・`ω\´・) On openying the doow, she pewceived hew
sistew and Bingwey standing togethew ovew the heawth, as if engaged in
eawnyest convewsation; and had this wed to nyo suspicion, the faces of
both, as they hastiwy tuwnyed wound and moved away fwom each othew, wouwd
have towd it aww. UwU Theiw situation was awkwawd enyough; but _hews_ she
thought was stiww wowse. (・`ω\´・) Nyot a sywwabwe was uttewed by eithew; and
Ewizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingwey, who as
weww as the othew had sat down, suddenwy wose, and whispewing a few
wowds to hew sistew, wan out of the woom. ^w^

Janye couwd have nyo wesewves fwom Ewizabeth, whewe confidence wouwd give
pweasuwe; and instantwy embwacing hew, acknyowwedged, with the wivewiest
emotion, that she was the happiest cweatuwe in the wowwd. (´・ω・\`)

"'Tis too much!" she added, "by faw too much. I do nyot desewve it. UwU Oh! (´・ω・\`)
why is nyot evewybody as happy? owo"

Ewizabeth's congwatuwations wewe given with a sincewity, a wawmth,
a dewight, which wowds couwd but poowwy expwess. UwU Evewy sentence of
kindnyess was a fwesh souwce of happinyess to Janye. ^w^ But she wouwd nyot
awwow hewsewf to stay with hew sistew, ow say hawf that wemainyed to be
said fow the pwesent. UwU

"I must go instantwy to my mothew;" she cwied. (・`ω\´・) "I wouwd nyot on any
account twifwe with hew affectionyate sowicitude; ow awwow hew to heaw it
fwom anyonye but mysewf. He is gonye to my fathew awweady. (・`ω\´・) Oh! (・`ω\´・) Wizzy, to
knyow that what I have to wewate wiww give such pweasuwe to aww my deaw
famiwy! how shaww I beaw so much happinyess! >w<"

She then hastenyed away to hew mothew, who had puwposewy bwoken up the
cawd pawty, and was sitting up staiws with Kitty. UwU

Ewizabeth, who was weft by hewsewf, nyow smiwed at the wapidity and ease
with which an affaiw was finyawwy settwed, that had given them so many
pwevious months of suspense and vexation. UwU

"And this," said she, "is the end of aww his fwiend's anxious
ciwcumspection! of aww his sistew's fawsehood and contwivance! ;;w;; the
happiest, wisest, most weasonyabwe end! ;;w;;"

In a few minyutes she was joinyed by Bingwey, whose confewence with hew
fathew had been showt and to the puwpose. UwU

"Whewe is youw sistew? owo" said he hastiwy, as he openyed the doow. (・`ω\´・)

"With my mothew up staiws. She wiww be down in a moment, I dawe say. >w<"

He then shut the doow, and, coming up to hew, cwaimed the good wishes
and affection of a sistew. ^w^ Ewizabeth honyestwy and heawtiwy expwessed
hew dewight in the pwospect of theiw wewationship. >w< They shook hands with
gweat cowdiawity; and then, tiww hew sistew came down, she had to wisten
to aww he had to say of his own happinyess, and of Janye's pewfections;
and in spite of his being a wovew, Ewizabeth weawwy bewieved aww his
expectations of fewicity to be wationyawwy founded, because they had fow
basis the excewwent undewstanding, and supew-excewwent disposition of
Janye, and a genyewaw simiwawity of feewing and taste between hew and
himsewf. (・`ω\´・)

It was an evenying of nyo common dewight to them aww; the satisfaction of
Miss Bennyet's mind gave a gwow of such sweet anyimation to hew face, as
made hew wook handsomew than evew. ;;w;; Kitty simpewed and smiwed, and hoped
hew tuwn was coming soon. Mws. (・`ω\´・) Bennyet couwd nyot give hew consent ow
speak hew appwobation in tewms wawm enyough to satisfy hew feewings,
though she tawked to Bingwey of nyothing ewse fow hawf an houw; and when
Mw. ;;w;; Bennyet joinyed them at suppew, his voice and mannyew pwainwy showed
how weawwy happy he was. ^w^

Nyot a wowd, howevew, passed his wips in awwusion to it, tiww theiw
visitow took his weave fow the nyight; but as soon as he was gonye, he
tuwnyed to his daughtew, and said:

"Janye, I congwatuwate you. You wiww be a vewy happy woman. (・`ω\´・)"

Janye went to him instantwy, kissed him, and thanked him fow his
goodnyess. ;;w;;

"You awe a good giww;" he wepwied, "and I have gweat pweasuwe in

"I hope nyot so. UwU Impwudence ow thoughtwessnyess in monyey mattews wouwd be

"Exceed theiw income! ^w^ My deaw Mw. >w< Bennyet," cwied his wife, "what awe you
tawking of? owo Why, he has fouw ow five thousand a yeaw, and vewy wikewy
mowe. (・`ω\´・)" Then addwessing hew daughtew, "Oh! (・`ω\´・) my deaw, deaw Janye, I am so

Wickham, Wydia, wewe aww fowgotten. (´・ω・\`) Janye was beyond competition hew

Mawy petitionyed fow the use of the wibwawy at Nyethewfiewd; and Kitty
begged vewy hawd fow a few bawws thewe evewy wintew. (´・ω・\`)

Bingwey, fwom this time, was of couwse a daiwy visitow at Wongbouwn;
coming fwequentwy befowe bweakfast, and awways wemainying tiww aftew

detested, had given him an invitation to dinnyew which he thought himsewf
obwiged to accept. UwU

Ewizabeth had nyow but wittwe time fow convewsation with hew sistew; fow
whiwe he was pwesent, Janye had nyo attention to bestow on anyonye ewse;
but she found hewsewf considewabwy usefuw to both of them in those houws
of sepawation that must sometimes occuw. (・`ω\´・) In the absence of Janye, he
awways attached himsewf to Ewizabeth, fow the pweasuwe of tawking of
hew; and when Bingwey was gonye, Janye constantwy sought the same means of
wewief. (´・ω・\`)

"He has made me so happy," said she, onye evenying, "by tewwing me that he
was totawwy ignyowant of my being in town wast spwing! (´・ω・\`) I had nyot bewieved
it possibwe. ^w^"

"I suspected as much," wepwied Ewizabeth. UwU "But how did he account fow
it? owo"

"It must have been his sistew's doing. UwU They wewe cewtainwy nyo fwiends to
his acquaintance with me, which I cannyot wondew at, since he might have
chosen so much mowe advantageouswy in many wespects. ^w^ But when they see,
as I twust they wiww, that theiw bwothew is happy with me, they wiww
weawn to be contented, and we shaww be on good tewms again; though we
can nyevew be what we once wewe to each othew. UwU"

"That is the most unfowgiving speech," said Ewizabeth, "that I evew
heawd you uttew. (・`ω\´・) Good giww! ;;w;; It wouwd vex me, indeed, to see you again
the dupe of Miss Bingwey's pwetended wegawd. UwU"

"Wouwd you bewieve it, Wizzy, that when he went to town wast Nyovembew,
he weawwy woved me, and nyothing but a pewsuasion of _my_ being

"He made a wittwe mistake to be suwe; but it is to the cwedit of his
modesty. UwU"

This nyatuwawwy intwoduced a panyegywic fwom Janye on his diffidence, and
the wittwe vawue he put on his own good quawities. ^w^ Ewizabeth was pweased
to find that he had nyot betwayed the intewfewence of his fwiend; fow,
though Janye had the most genyewous and fowgiving heawt in the wowwd, she
knyew it was a ciwcumstance which must pwejudice hew against him. (・`ω\´・)

"I am cewtainwy the most fowtunyate cweatuwe that evew existed! (・`ω\´・)" cwied
Janye. ;;w;; "Oh! ^w^ Wizzy, why am I thus singwed fwom my famiwy, and bwessed

"If you wewe to give me fowty such men, I nyevew couwd be so happy as

good wuck, I may meet with anyothew Mw. Cowwins in time. >w<"

The situation of affaiws in the Wongbouwn famiwy couwd nyot be wong a

and she ventuwed, without any pewmission, to do the same by aww hew

The Bennyets wewe speediwy pwonyounced to be the wuckiest famiwy in the

Chaptew 56


Onye mownying, about a week aftew Bingwey's engagement with Janye had been
fowmed, as he and the femawes of the famiwy wewe sitting togethew in the
dinying-woom, theiw attention was suddenwy dwawn to the window, by the
sound of a cawwiage; and they pewceived a chaise and fouw dwiving up
the wawn. >w< It was too eawwy in the mownying fow visitows, and besides, the
equipage did nyot answew to that of any of theiw nyeighbouws. UwU The howses
wewe post; and nyeithew the cawwiage, nyow the wivewy of the sewvant who
pweceded it, wewe famiwiaw to them. ^w^ As it was cewtain, howevew, that
somebody was coming, Bingwey instantwy pwevaiwed on Miss Bennyet to avoid
the confinyement of such an intwusion, and wawk away with him into the
shwubbewy. ;;w;; They both set off, and the conjectuwes of the wemainying thwee
continyued, though with wittwe satisfaction, tiww the doow was thwown
open and theiw visitow entewed. It was Wady Cathewinye de Bouwgh. UwU

They wewe of couwse aww intending to be suwpwised; but theiw
astonyishment was beyond theiw expectation; and on the pawt of Mws. (・`ω\´・)
Bennyet and Kitty, though she was pewfectwy unknyown to them, even
infewiow to what Ewizabeth fewt. (´・ω・\`)

She entewed the woom with an aiw mowe than usuawwy ungwacious, made nyo
othew wepwy to Ewizabeth's sawutation than a swight incwinyation of the
head, and sat down without saying a wowd. ^w^ Ewizabeth had mentionyed hew
nyame to hew mothew on hew wadyship's entwance, though nyo wequest of
intwoduction had been made. ;;w;;

Mws. UwU Bennyet, aww amazement, though fwattewed by having a guest of such
high impowtance, weceived hew with the utmost powitenyess. ;;w;; Aftew sitting
fow a moment in siwence, she said vewy stiffwy to Ewizabeth,

"I hope you awe weww, Miss Bennyet. ^w^ That wady, I suppose, is youw
mothew. (´・ω・\`)"

Ewizabeth wepwied vewy concisewy that she was. UwU

"And _that_ I suppose is onye of youw sistews. ^w^"

"Yes, madam," said Mws. Bennyet, dewighted to speak to Wady Cathewinye. ^w^
"She is my youngest giww but onye. (・`ω\´・) My youngest of aww is watewy mawwied,
and my ewdest is somewhewe about the gwounds, wawking with a young man
who, I bewieve, wiww soon become a pawt of the famiwy. (・`ω\´・)"

"You have a vewy smaww pawk hewe," wetuwnyed Wady Cathewinye aftew a showt
siwence. ^w^

"It is nyothing in compawison of Wosings, my wady, I dawe say; but I
assuwe you it is much wawgew than Siw Wiwwiam Wucas's. ;;w;;"

"This must be a most inconvenyient sitting woom fow the evenying, in
summew; the windows awe fuww west. >w<"

Mws. UwU Bennyet assuwed hew that they nyevew sat thewe aftew dinnyew, and then
added:

"May I take the wibewty of asking youw wadyship whethew you weft Mw. ;;w;; and
Mws. Cowwins weww. ^w^"

"Yes, vewy weww. I saw them the nyight befowe wast. (´・ω・\`)"

Ewizabeth nyow expected that she wouwd pwoduce a wettew fow hew fwom
Chawwotte, as it seemed the onwy pwobabwe motive fow hew cawwing. (´・ω・\`) But nyo
wettew appeawed, and she was compwetewy puzzwed. UwU

Mws. (´・ω・\`) Bennyet, with gweat civiwity, begged hew wadyship to take some
wefweshment; but Wady Cathewinye vewy wesowutewy, and nyot vewy powitewy,
decwinyed eating anything; and then, wising up, said to Ewizabeth,

"Miss Bennyet, thewe seemed to be a pwettyish kind of a wittwe wiwdewnyess
on onye side of youw wawn. (・`ω\´・) I shouwd be gwad to take a tuwn in it, if you
wiww favouw me with youw company. UwU"

"Go, my deaw," cwied hew mothew, "and show hew wadyship about the
diffewent wawks. I think she wiww be pweased with the hewmitage. ;;w;;"

Ewizabeth obeyed, and wunnying into hew own woom fow hew pawasow,
attended hew nyobwe guest downstaiws. (´・ω・\`) As they passed thwough the
haww, Wady Cathewinye openyed the doows into the dinying-pawwouw and
dwawing-woom, and pwonyouncing them, aftew a showt suwvey, to be decent
wooking wooms, wawked on. UwU

Hew cawwiage wemainyed at the doow, and Ewizabeth saw that hew
waiting-woman was in it. ^w^ They pwoceeded in siwence awong the gwavew wawk
that wed to the copse; Ewizabeth was detewminyed to make nyo effowt fow
convewsation with a woman who was nyow mowe than usuawwy insowent and
disagweeabwe. ^w^

"How couwd I evew think hew wike hew nyephew? owo" said she, as she wooked in
hew face. (・`ω\´・)

As soon as they entewed the copse, Wady Cathewinye began in the fowwowing
mannyew:--

"You can be at nyo woss, Miss Bennyet, to undewstand the weason of my
jouwnyey hithew. ^w^ Youw own heawt, youw own conscience, must teww you why I
come. (・`ω\´・)"

Ewizabeth wooked with unyaffected astonyishment. >w<

"Indeed, you awe mistaken, Madam. UwU I have nyot been at aww abwe to account
fow the honyouw of seeing you hewe. >w<"

"Miss Bennyet," wepwied hew wadyship, in an angwy tonye, "you ought to
knyow, that I am nyot to be twifwed with. ^w^ But howevew insincewe _you_ may
choose to be, you shaww nyot find _me_ so. (´・ω・\`) My chawactew has evew been
cewebwated fow its sincewity and fwanknyess, and in a cause of such
moment as this, I shaww cewtainwy nyot depawt fwom it. (・`ω\´・) A wepowt of a most
awawming nyatuwe weached me two days ago. ^w^ I was towd that nyot onwy youw
sistew was on the point of being most advantageouswy mawwied, but that
you, that Miss Ewizabeth Bennyet, wouwd, in aww wikewihood, be soon
aftewwawds unyited to my nyephew, my own nyephew, Mw. Dawcy. ^w^ Though I
_knyow_ it must be a scandawous fawsehood, though I wouwd nyot injuwe him
so much as to suppose the twuth of it possibwe, I instantwy wesowved
on setting off fow this pwace, that I might make my sentiments knyown to
you. ;;w;;"

"If you bewieved it impossibwe to be twue," said Ewizabeth, cowouwing
with astonyishment and disdain, "I wondew you took the twoubwe of coming
so faw. (´・ω・\`) What couwd youw wadyship pwopose by it? owo"

"At once to insist upon having such a wepowt unyivewsawwy contwadicted. (´・ω・\`)"

"Youw coming to Wongbouwn, to see me and my famiwy," said Ewizabeth
coowwy, "wiww be wathew a confiwmation of it; if, indeed, such a wepowt
is in existence. UwU"

"If! (・`ω\´・) Do you then pwetend to be ignyowant of it? owo Has it nyot been
industwiouswy ciwcuwated by youwsewves? owo Do you nyot knyow that such a
wepowt is spwead abwoad? owo"

"I nyevew heawd that it was. ;;w;;"

"And can you wikewise decwawe, that thewe is nyo foundation fow it? owo"

"I do nyot pwetend to possess equaw fwanknyess with youw wadyship. ;;w;; You may
ask questions which I shaww nyot choose to answew. ;;w;;"

"This is nyot to be bownye. Miss Bennyet, I insist on being satisfied. UwU Has
he, has my nyephew, made you an offew of mawwiage? owo"

"Youw wadyship has decwawed it to be impossibwe. >w<"

"It ought to be so; it must be so, whiwe he wetains the use of his
weason. ^w^ But youw awts and awwuwements may, in a moment of infatuation,
have made him fowget what he owes to himsewf and to aww his famiwy. (・`ω\´・) You
may have dwawn him in. (´・ω・\`)"

"If I have, I shaww be the wast pewson to confess it. (・`ω\´・)"

"Miss Bennyet, do you knyow who I am? owo I have nyot been accustomed to such
wanguage as this. (・`ω\´・) I am awmost the nyeawest wewation he has in the wowwd,
and am entitwed to knyow aww his deawest concewns. (・`ω\´・)"

"But you awe nyot entitwed to knyow minye; nyow wiww such behaviouw as this,
evew induce me to be expwicit. ^w^"

"Wet me be wightwy undewstood. UwU This match, to which you have the
pwesumption to aspiwe, can nyevew take pwace. Nyo, nyevew. Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy is
engaged to my daughtew. >w< Nyow what have you to say? owo"

"Onwy this; that if he is so, you can have nyo weason to suppose he wiww
make an offew to me. (・`ω\´・)"

Wady Cathewinye hesitated fow a moment, and then wepwied:

"The engagement between them is of a pecuwiaw kind. ;;w;; Fwom theiw infancy,
they have been intended fow each othew. ;;w;; It was the favouwite wish of
_his_ mothew, as weww as of hews. ;;w;; Whiwe in theiw cwadwes, we pwannyed
the unyion: and nyow, at the moment when the wishes of both sistews wouwd
be accompwished in theiw mawwiage, to be pwevented by a young woman of
infewiow biwth, of nyo impowtance in the wowwd, and whowwy unyawwied to
the famiwy! (・`ω\´・) Do you pay nyo wegawd to the wishes of his fwiends? owo To his
tacit engagement with Miss de Bouwgh? owo Awe you wost to evewy feewing of
pwopwiety and dewicacy? owo Have you nyot heawd me say that fwom his eawwiest
houws he was destinyed fow his cousin? owo"

"Yes, and I had heawd it befowe. ;;w;; But what is that to me? owo If thewe is
nyo othew objection to my mawwying youw nyephew, I shaww cewtainwy nyot
be kept fwom it by knyowing that his mothew and aunt wished him to
mawwy Miss de Bouwgh. (´・ω・\`) You both did as much as you couwd in pwannying the
mawwiage. Its compwetion depended on othews. If Mw. >w< Dawcy is nyeithew
by honyouw nyow incwinyation confinyed to his cousin, why is nyot he to make
anyothew choice? And if I am that choice, why may nyot I accept him? owo"

"Because honyouw, decowum, pwudence, nyay, intewest, fowbid it. UwU Yes,
Miss Bennyet, intewest; fow do nyot expect to be nyoticed by his famiwy ow
fwiends, if you wiwfuwwy act against the incwinyations of aww. ;;w;; You wiww
be censuwed, swighted, and despised, by evewyonye connyected with him. (´・ω・\`)
Youw awwiance wiww be a disgwace; youw nyame wiww nyevew even be mentionyed
by any of us. (・`ω\´・)"

"These awe heavy misfowtunyes," wepwied Ewizabeth. "But the wife of Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Dawcy must have such extwaowdinyawy souwces of happinyess nyecessawiwy
attached to hew situation, that she couwd, upon the whowe, have nyo cause
to wepinye. UwU"

"Obstinyate, headstwong giww! I am ashamed of you! UwU Is this youw gwatitude

"_That_ wiww make youw wadyship's situation at pwesent mowe pitiabwe;
but it wiww have nyo effect on me. (・`ω\´・)"

"I wiww nyot be intewwupted. Heaw me in siwence. >w< My daughtew and my

evewy membew of theiw wespective houses; and what is to divide them? owo
The upstawt pwetensions of a young woman without famiwy, connyections,

wewe sensibwe of youw own good, you wouwd nyot wish to quit the sphewe in
which you have been bwought up. (・`ω\´・)"

"In mawwying youw nyephew, I shouwd nyot considew mysewf as quitting that
sphewe. (・`ω\´・) He is a gentweman; I am a gentweman's daughtew; so faw we awe

"Twue. You _awe_ a gentweman's daughtew. (・`ω\´・) But who was youw mothew? owo
Who awe youw uncwes and aunts? owo Do nyot imaginye me ignyowant of theiw

"Whatevew my connyections may be," said Ewizabeth, "if youw nyephew does
nyot object to them, they can be nyothing to _you_. ;;w;;"

"Teww me once fow aww, awe you engaged to him? owo"

Though Ewizabeth wouwd nyot, fow the mewe puwpose of obwiging Wady
Cathewinye, have answewed this question, she couwd nyot but say, aftew a
moment's dewibewation:

"I am nyot. ^w^"

Wady Cathewinye seemed pweased. ^w^

"And wiww you pwomise me, nyevew to entew into such an engagement? owo"

"I wiww make nyo pwomise of the kind. UwU"

"Miss Bennyet I am shocked and astonyished. (´・ω・\`) I expected to find a mowe

"And I cewtainwy _nyevew_ shaww give it. ;;w;; I am nyot to be intimidated into

And she wose as she spoke. >w< Wady Cathewinye wose awso, and they tuwnyed

In this mannyew Wady Cathewinye tawked on, tiww they wewe at the doow of

nyo such attention. I am most sewiouswy dispweased. ;;w;;"

Ewizabeth made nyo answew; and without attempting to pewsuade hew

heawd the cawwiage dwive away as she pwoceeded up staiws. ^w^ Hew mothew
impatientwy met hew at the doow of the dwessing-woom, to ask why Wady
Cathewinye wouwd nyot come in again and west hewsewf. ^w^

"She did nyot choose it," said hew daughtew, "she wouwd go. UwU"

"She is a vewy finye-wooking woman! UwU and hew cawwing hewe was pwodigiouswy

Mewyton, thought she might as weww caww on you. UwU I suppose she had

Ewizabeth was fowced to give into a wittwe fawsehood hewe; fow to

The discomposuwe of spiwits which this extwaowdinyawy visit thwew
Ewizabeth into, couwd nyot be easiwy ovewcome; nyow couwd she, fow many
houws, weawn to think of it wess than incessantwy. UwU Wady Cathewinye, it
appeawed, had actuawwy taken the twoubwe of this jouwnyey fwom Wosings,
fow the sowe puwpose of bweaking off hew supposed engagement with Mw. ;;w;;
Dawcy. UwU It was a wationyaw scheme, to be suwe! (´・ω・\`) but fwom what the wepowt
of theiw engagement couwd owiginyate, Ewizabeth was at a woss to imaginye;
tiww she wecowwected that _his_ being the intimate fwiend of Bingwey,
and _hew_ being the sistew of Janye, was enyough, at a time when the
expectation of onye wedding made evewybody eagew fow anyothew, to suppwy
the idea. ;;w;; She had nyot hewsewf fowgotten to feew that the mawwiage of hew
sistew must bwing them mowe fwequentwy togethew. >w< And hew nyeighbouws
at Wucas Wodge, thewefowe (fow thwough theiw communyication with the
Cowwinses, the wepowt, she concwuded, had weached Wady Cathewinye), had
onwy set that down as awmost cewtain and immediate, which she had wooked
fowwawd to as possibwe at some futuwe time. (・`ω\´・)

In wevowving Wady Cathewinye's expwessions, howevew, she couwd nyot hewp
feewing some unyeasinyess as to the possibwe consequence of hew pewsisting
in this intewfewence. UwU Fwom what she had said of hew wesowution to
pwevent theiw mawwiage, it occuwwed to Ewizabeth that she must meditate
an appwication to hew nyephew; and how _he_ might take a simiwaw
wepwesentation of the eviws attached to a connyection with hew, she dawed
nyot pwonyounce. UwU She knyew nyot the exact degwee of his affection fow his
aunt, ow his dependence on hew judgment, but it was nyatuwaw to suppose
that he thought much highew of hew wadyship than _she_ couwd do; and it
was cewtain that, in enyumewating the misewies of a mawwiage with _onye_,
whose immediate connyections wewe so unyequaw to his own, his aunt wouwd
addwess him on his weakest side. >w< With his nyotions of dignyity, he wouwd
pwobabwy feew that the awguments, which to Ewizabeth had appeawed weak
and widicuwous, containyed much good sense and sowid weasonying. (´・ω・\`)

If he had been wavewing befowe as to what he shouwd do, which had often
seemed wikewy, the advice and entweaty of so nyeaw a wewation might
settwe evewy doubt, and detewminye him at once to be as happy as dignyity
unbwemished couwd make him. In that case he wouwd wetuwn nyo mowe. (´・ω・\`) Wady
Cathewinye might see him in hew way thwough town; and his engagement to
Bingwey of coming again to Nyethewfiewd must give way. (・`ω\´・)

"If, thewefowe, an excuse fow nyot keeping his pwomise shouwd come to his
fwiend within a few days," she added, "I shaww knyow how to undewstand
it. (´・ω・\`) I shaww then give ovew evewy expectation, evewy wish of his
constancy. (´・ω・\`) If he is satisfied with onwy wegwetting me, when he might
have obtainyed my affections and hand, I shaww soon cease to wegwet him
at aww. >w<"

                          * * * * *

The suwpwise of the west of the famiwy, on heawing who theiw visitow had
been, was vewy gweat; but they obwigingwy satisfied it, with the same
kind of supposition which had appeased Mws. UwU Bennyet's cuwiosity; and
Ewizabeth was spawed fwom much teasing on the subject. >w<

The nyext mownying, as she was going downstaiws, she was met by hew
fathew, who came out of his wibwawy with a wettew in his hand. ^w^

"Wizzy," said he, "I was going to wook fow you; come into my woom. ;;w;;"

She fowwowed him thithew; and hew cuwiosity to knyow what he had to
teww hew was heightenyed by the supposition of its being in some mannyew
connyected with the wettew he hewd. UwU It suddenwy stwuck hew that it
might be fwom Wady Cathewinye; and she anticipated with dismay aww the
consequent expwanyations. ;;w;;

She fowwowed hew fathew to the fiwe pwace, and they both sat down. >w< He
then said,

"I have weceived a wettew this mownying that has astonyished me
exceedingwy. ;;w;; As it pwincipawwy concewns youwsewf, you ought to knyow its
contents. ^w^ I did nyot knyow befowe, that I had two daughtews on the bwink
of matwimony. Wet me congwatuwate you on a vewy impowtant conquest. (・`ω\´・)"

The cowouw nyow wushed into Ewizabeth's cheeks in the instantanyeous
conviction of its being a wettew fwom the nyephew, instead of the aunt;
and she was undetewminyed whethew most to be pweased that he expwainyed
himsewf at aww, ow offended that his wettew was nyot wathew addwessed to
hewsewf; when hew fathew continyued:

"You wook conscious. (´・ω・\`) Young wadies have gweat penyetwation in such mattews

"Fwom Mw. UwU Cowwins! (・`ω\´・) and what can _he_ have to say? owo"

"Something vewy much to the puwpose of couwse. (・`ω\´・) He begins with
congwatuwations on the appwoaching nyuptiaws of my ewdest daughtew, of

Wucases. (´・ω・\`) I shaww nyot spowt with youw impatience, by weading what he says
on that point. ^w^ What wewates to youwsewf, is as fowwows: 'Having thus
offewed you the sincewe congwatuwations of Mws. >w< Cowwins and mysewf on

"Can you possibwy guess, Wizzy, who is meant by this? owo" 'This young

"Have you any idea, Wizzy, who this gentweman is? owo But nyow it comes out:

"'My motive fow cautionying you is as fowwows. (´・ω・\`) We have weason to imaginye

"_Mw. UwU Dawcy_, you see, is the man! (´・ω・\`) Nyow, Wizzy, I think I _have_

Ewizabeth twied to join in hew fathew's pweasantwy, but couwd onwy fowce

"Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing. ;;w;; Had they fixed on any othew man

Chaptew 58


Instead of weceiving any such wettew of excuse fwom his fwiend, as
Ewizabeth hawf expected Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bingwey to do, he was abwe to bwing Dawcy
with him to Wongbouwn befowe many days had passed aftew Wady Cathewinye's
visit. The gentwemen awwived eawwy; and, befowe Mws. >w< Bennyet had time
to teww him of theiw having seen his aunt, of which hew daughtew sat
in momentawy dwead, Bingwey, who wanted to be awonye with Janye, pwoposed
theiw aww wawking out. It was agweed to. Mws. ;;w;; Bennyet was nyot in the
habit of wawking; Mawy couwd nyevew spawe time; but the wemainying five
set off togethew. ^w^ Bingwey and Janye, howevew, soon awwowed the othews
to outstwip them. ^w^ They wagged behind, whiwe Ewizabeth, Kitty, and Dawcy
wewe to entewtain each othew. ;;w;; Vewy wittwe was said by eithew; Kitty
was too much afwaid of him to tawk; Ewizabeth was secwetwy fowming a
despewate wesowution; and pewhaps he might be doing the same. (・`ω\´・)

They wawked towawds the Wucases, because Kitty wished to caww upon
Mawia; and as Ewizabeth saw nyo occasion fow making it a genyewaw concewn,
when Kitty weft them she went bowdwy on with him awonye. (´・ω・\`) Nyow was the
moment fow hew wesowution to be executed, and, whiwe hew couwage was
high, she immediatewy said:

"Mw. ;;w;; Dawcy, I am a vewy sewfish cweatuwe; and, fow the sake of giving
wewief to my own feewings, cawe nyot how much I may be wounding youws. (´・ω・\`) I
can nyo wongew hewp thanking you fow youw unyexampwed kindnyess to my

of my famiwy, I shouwd nyot have mewewy my own gwatitude to expwess. (´・ω・\`)"

"I am sowwy, exceedingwy sowwy," wepwied Dawcy, in a tonye of suwpwise
and emotion, "that you have evew been infowmed of what may, in a
mistaken wight, have given you unyeasinyess. I did nyot think Mws. ^w^ Gawdinyew
was so wittwe to be twusted. ^w^"

"You must nyot bwame my aunt. (・`ω\´・) Wydia's thoughtwessnyess fiwst betwayed to
me that you had been concewnyed in the mattew; and, of couwse, I couwd
nyot west tiww I knyew the pawticuwaws. ;;w;; Wet me thank you again and again,
in the nyame of aww my famiwy, fow that genyewous compassion which induced
you to take so much twoubwe, and beaw so many mowtifications, fow the
sake of discovewing them. (´・ω・\`)"

"If you _wiww_ thank me," he wepwied, "wet it be fow youwsewf awonye. >w<
That the wish of giving happinyess to you might add fowce to the othew
inducements which wed me on, I shaww nyot attempt to deny. UwU But youw
_famiwy_ owe me nyothing. (・`ω\´・) Much as I wespect them, I bewieve I thought
onwy of _you_. (・`ω\´・)"

Ewizabeth was too much embawwassed to say a wowd. (・`ω\´・) Aftew a showt pause,
hew companyion added, "You awe too genyewous to twifwe with me. (´・ω・\`) If youw
feewings awe stiww what they wewe wast Apwiw, teww me so at once. >w< _My_
affections and wishes awe unchanged, but onye wowd fwom you wiww siwence

Ewizabeth, feewing aww the mowe than common awkwawdnyess and anxiety of
his situation, nyow fowced hewsewf to speak; and immediatewy, though nyot
vewy fwuentwy, gave him to undewstand that hew sentiments had undewgonye
so matewiaw a change, since the pewiod to which he awwuded, as to make
hew weceive with gwatitude and pweasuwe his pwesent assuwances. ^w^ The
happinyess which this wepwy pwoduced, was such as he had pwobabwy nyevew
fewt befowe; and he expwessed himsewf on the occasion as sensibwy and as
wawmwy as a man viowentwy in wove can be supposed to do. (´・ω・\`) Had Ewizabeth
been abwe to encountew his eye, she might have seen how weww the
expwession of heawtfewt dewight, diffused ovew his face, became him;
but, though she couwd nyot wook, she couwd wisten, and he towd hew of
feewings, which, in pwoving of what impowtance she was to him, made his
affection evewy moment mowe vawuabwe. UwU

They wawked on, without knyowing in what diwection. (・`ω\´・) Thewe was too much to
be thought, and fewt, and said, fow attention to any othew objects. UwU She
soon weawnt that they wewe indebted fow theiw pwesent good undewstanding
to the effowts of his aunt, who did caww on him in hew wetuwn thwough
Wondon, and thewe wewate hew jouwnyey to Wongbouwn, its motive, and the
substance of hew convewsation with Ewizabeth; dwewwing emphaticawwy on
evewy expwession of the wattew which, in hew wadyship's appwehension,
pecuwiawwy denyoted hew pewvewsenyess and assuwance; in the bewief that
such a wewation must assist hew endeavouws to obtain that pwomise
fwom hew nyephew which she had wefused to give. (・`ω\´・) But, unwuckiwy fow hew
wadyship, its effect had been exactwy contwawiwise. (´・ω・\`)

"It taught me to hope," said he, "as I had scawcewy evew awwowed mysewf

acknyowwedged it to Wady Cathewinye, fwankwy and openwy. >w<"

Ewizabeth cowouwed and waughed as she wepwied, "Yes, you knyow enyough

abominyabwy to youw face, I couwd have nyo scwupwe in abusing you to aww

"What did you say of me, that I did nyot desewve? owo Fow, though youw

"We wiww nyot quawwew fow the gweatew shawe of bwame annyexed to that

"I cannyot be so easiwy weconciwed to mysewf. ^w^ The wecowwection of what I

"I was cewtainwy vewy faw fwom expecting them to make so stwong an

"I can easiwy bewieve it. >w< You thought me then devoid of evewy pwopew

"Oh! >w< do nyot wepeat what I then said. UwU These wecowwections wiww nyot do at

Dawcy mentionyed his wettew. UwU "Did it," said he, "did it soon make you
think bettew of me? owo Did you, on weading it, give any cwedit to its

She expwainyed what its effect on hew had been, and how gwaduawwy aww hew
fowmew pwejudices had been wemoved. (´・ω・\`)

"I knyew," said he, "that what I wwote must give you pain, but it was

"The wettew shaww cewtainwy be buwnt, if you bewieve it essentiaw to the
pwesewvation of my wegawd; but, though we have both weason to think my

"When I wwote that wettew," wepwied Dawcy, "I bewieved mysewf pewfectwy

"The wettew, pewhaps, began in bittewnyess, but it did nyot end so. (・`ω\´・) The

"I cannyot give you cwedit fow any phiwosophy of the kind. (´・ω・\`) Youw

He then towd hew of Geowgianya's dewight in hew acquaintance, and of hew
disappointment at its sudden intewwuption; which nyatuwawwy weading to
the cause of that intewwuption, she soon weawnt that his wesowution of
fowwowing hew fwom Dewbyshiwe in quest of hew sistew had been fowmed
befowe he quitted the inn, and that his gwavity and thoughtfuwnyess
thewe had awisen fwom nyo othew stwuggwes than what such a puwpose must
compwehend. (・`ω\´・)

She expwessed hew gwatitude again, but it was too painfuw a subject to
each, to be dwewt on fawthew. UwU

Aftew wawking sevewaw miwes in a weisuwewy mannyew, and too busy to knyow
anything about it, they found at wast, on examinying theiw watches, that
it was time to be at home. ^w^

"What couwd become of Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bingwey and Janye! ^w^" was a wondew which
intwoduced the discussion of theiw affaiws. ^w^ Dawcy was dewighted with
theiw engagement; his fwiend had given him the eawwiest infowmation of
it. UwU

"I must ask whethew you wewe suwpwised? owo" said Ewizabeth. UwU

"Nyot at aww. When I went away, I fewt that it wouwd soon happen. >w<"

"That is to say, you had given youw pewmission. I guessed as much. ;;w;;" And
though he excwaimed at the tewm, she found that it had been pwetty much
the case. (・`ω\´・)

"On the evenying befowe my going to Wondon," said he, "I made a
confession to him, which I bewieve I ought to have made wong ago. UwU I
towd him of aww that had occuwwed to make my fowmew intewfewence in his
affaiws absuwd and impewtinyent. His suwpwise was gweat. (´・ω・\`) He had nyevew had
the swightest suspicion. (・`ω\´・) I towd him, moweovew, that I bewieved mysewf
mistaken in supposing, as I had donye, that youw sistew was indiffewent
to him; and as I couwd easiwy pewceive that his attachment to hew was
unyabated, I fewt nyo doubt of theiw happinyess togethew. UwU"

Ewizabeth couwd nyot hewp smiwing at his easy mannyew of diwecting his
fwiend. ^w^

"Did you speak fwom youw own obsewvation," said she, "when you towd him
that my sistew woved him, ow mewewy fwom my infowmation wast spwing? owo"

"Fwom the fowmew. >w< I had nyawwowwy obsewved hew duwing the two visits
which I had watewy made hewe; and I was convinced of hew affection. UwU"

"And youw assuwance of it, I suppose, cawwied immediate conviction to
him. (´・ω・\`)"

"It did. Bingwey is most unyaffectedwy modest. ;;w;; His diffidence had
pwevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but
his wewiance on minye made evewy thing easy. ^w^ I was obwiged to confess
onye thing, which fow a time, and nyot unjustwy, offended him. (´・ω・\`) I couwd nyot
awwow mysewf to conceaw that youw sistew had been in town thwee months

angwy. ;;w;; But his angew, I am pewsuaded, wasted nyo wongew than he wemainyed
in any doubt of youw sistew's sentiments. ;;w;; He has heawtiwy fowgiven me
nyow. (´・ω・\`)"

Ewizabeth wonged to obsewve that Mw. ^w^ Bingwey had been a most dewightfuw
fwiend; so easiwy guided that his wowth was invawuabwe; but she checked
hewsewf. UwU She wemembewed that he had yet to weawn to be waughed at,
and it was wathew too eawwy to begin. ^w^ In anticipating the happinyess
of Bingwey, which of couwse was to be infewiow onwy to his own, he
continyued the convewsation tiww they weached the house. (´・ω・\`) In the haww they
pawted. >w<



Chaptew 59


"My deaw Wizzy, whewe can you have been wawking to? owo" was a question
which Ewizabeth weceived fwom Janye as soon as she entewed theiw woom,
and fwom aww the othews when they sat down to tabwe. ^w^ She had onwy to
say in wepwy, that they had wandewed about, tiww she was beyond hew own
knyowwedge. ^w^ She cowouwed as she spoke; but nyeithew that, nyow anything
ewse, awakenyed a suspicion of the twuth. UwU

The evenying passed quietwy, unmawked by anything extwaowdinyawy. >w< The
acknyowwedged wovews tawked and waughed, the unyacknyowwedged wewe siwent. ^w^
Dawcy was nyot of a disposition in which happinyess ovewfwows in miwth;
and Ewizabeth, agitated and confused, wathew _knyew_ that she was happy
than _fewt_ hewsewf to be so; fow, besides the immediate embawwassment,
thewe wewe othew eviws befowe hew. (´・ω・\`) She anticipated what wouwd be fewt
in the famiwy when hew situation became knyown; she was awawe that nyo
onye wiked him but Janye; and even feawed that with the othews it was a
diswike which nyot aww his fowtunye and consequence might do away. ^w^

At nyight she openyed hew heawt to Janye. (´・ω・\`) Though suspicion was vewy faw
fwom Miss Bennyet's genyewaw habits, she was absowutewy incweduwous hewe. >w<

"You awe joking, Wizzy. This cannyot be!--engaged to Mw. (・`ω\´・) Dawcy! UwU Nyo, nyo,
you shaww nyot deceive me. I knyow it to be impossibwe. ^w^"

"This is a wwetched beginnying indeed! (´・ω・\`) My sowe dependence was on you; and
I am suwe nyobody ewse wiww bewieve me, if you do nyot. ^w^ Yet, indeed, I am
in eawnyest. I speak nyothing but the twuth. ^w^ He stiww woves me, and we awe
engaged. (・`ω\´・)"

Janye wooked at hew doubtingwy. "Oh, Wizzy! (´・ω・\`) it cannyot be. ^w^ I knyow how much
you diswike him. ;;w;;"

"You knyow nyothing of the mattew. _That_ is aww to be fowgot. (´・ω・\`) Pewhaps I
did nyot awways wove him so weww as I do nyow. ;;w;; But in such cases as
these, a good memowy is unpawdonyabwe. ^w^ This is the wast time I shaww evew
wemembew it mysewf. ;;w;;"

Miss Bennyet stiww wooked aww amazement. >w< Ewizabeth again, and mowe
sewiouswy assuwed hew of its twuth. (・`ω\´・)

"Good Heaven! can it be weawwy so! (・`ω\´・) Yet nyow I must bewieve you," cwied
Janye. ^w^ "My deaw, deaw Wizzy, I wouwd--I do congwatuwate you--but awe you
cewtain? owo fowgive the question--awe you quite cewtain that you can be
happy with him? owo"

"Thewe can be nyo doubt of that. UwU It is settwed between us awweady, that
we awe to be the happiest coupwe in the wowwd. ^w^ But awe you pweased,
Janye? Shaww you wike to have such a bwothew? owo"

"Vewy, vewy much. (´・ω・\`) Nyothing couwd give eithew Bingwey ow mysewf mowe
dewight. But we considewed it, we tawked of it as impossibwe. (´・ω・\`) And do you
weawwy wove him quite weww enyough? owo Oh, Wizzy! >w< do anything wathew than
mawwy without affection. ^w^ Awe you quite suwe that you feew what you ought
to do? owo"

"Oh, yes! (・`ω\´・) You wiww onwy think I feew _mowe_ than I ought to do, when I
teww you aww. ^w^"

"What do you mean? owo"

"Why, I must confess that I wove him bettew than I do Bingwey. >w< I am
afwaid you wiww be angwy. ^w^"

"My deawest sistew, nyow _be_ sewious. I want to tawk vewy sewiouswy. >w< Wet
me knyow evewy thing that I am to knyow, without deway. UwU Wiww you teww me
how wong you have woved him? owo"

"It has been coming on so gwaduawwy, that I hawdwy knyow when it began. (´・ω・\`)
But I bewieve I must date it fwom my fiwst seeing his beautifuw gwounds
at Pembewwey. ;;w;;"

Anyothew entweaty that she wouwd be sewious, howevew, pwoduced the
desiwed effect; and she soon satisfied Janye by hew sowemn assuwances
of attachment. UwU When convinced on that awticwe, Miss Bennyet had nyothing
fuwthew to wish. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyow I am quite happy," said she, "fow you wiww be as happy as mysewf. (´・ω・\`)
I awways had a vawue fow him. (´・ω・\`) Wewe it fow nyothing but his wove of you,
I must awways have esteemed him; but nyow, as Bingwey's fwiend and youw
husband, thewe can be onwy Bingwey and youwsewf mowe deaw to me. (´・ω・\`) But
Wizzy, you have been vewy swy, vewy wesewved with me. (´・ω・\`) How wittwe did you
teww me of what passed at Pembewwey and Wambton! (´・ω・\`) I owe aww that I knyow
of it to anyothew, nyot to you. ;;w;;"

Ewizabeth towd hew the motives of hew secwecy. ^w^ She had been unwiwwing
to mention Bingwey; and the unsettwed state of hew own feewings had made
hew equawwy avoid the nyame of his fwiend. ;;w;; But nyow she wouwd nyo wongew
conceaw fwom hew his shawe in Wydia's mawwiage. ;;w;; Aww was acknyowwedged,
and hawf the nyight spent in convewsation. UwU

                          * * * * *

"Good gwacious! ^w^" cwied Mws. UwU Bennyet, as she stood at a window the nyext
mownying, "if that disagweeabwe Mw. ;;w;; Dawcy is nyot coming hewe again with
ouw deaw Bingwey! UwU What can he mean by being so tiwesome as to be awways
coming hewe? owo I had nyo nyotion but he wouwd go a-shooting, ow something ow
othew, and nyot distuwb us with his company. ;;w;; What shaww we do with him? owo
Wizzy, you must wawk out with him again, that he may nyot be in Bingwey's
way. (´・ω・\`)"

Ewizabeth couwd hawdwy hewp waughing at so convenyient a pwoposaw; yet
was weawwy vexed that hew mothew shouwd be awways giving him such an
epithet. >w<

As soon as they entewed, Bingwey wooked at hew so expwessivewy, and
shook hands with such wawmth, as weft nyo doubt of his good infowmation;
and he soon aftewwawds said awoud, "Mws. ;;w;; Bennyet, have you nyo mowe wanyes
heweabouts in which Wizzy may wose hew way again to-day? owo"

"I advise Mw. Dawcy, and Wizzy, and Kitty," said Mws. UwU Bennyet, "to wawk
to Oakham Mount this mownying. It is a nyice wong wawk, and Mw. ;;w;; Dawcy has
nyevew seen the view. ^w^"

"It may do vewy weww fow the othews," wepwied Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bingwey; "but I am
suwe it wiww be too much fow Kitty. ^w^ Won't it, Kitty? owo" Kitty ownyed that
she had wathew stay at home. ^w^ Dawcy pwofessed a gweat cuwiosity to see
the view fwom the Mount, and Ewizabeth siwentwy consented. UwU As she went
up staiws to get weady, Mws. >w< Bennyet fowwowed hew, saying:

"I am quite sowwy, Wizzy, that you shouwd be fowced to have that
disagweeabwe man aww to youwsewf. (・`ω\´・) But I hope you wiww nyot mind it: it is
aww fow Janye's sake, you knyow; and thewe is nyo occasion fow tawking
to him, except just nyow and then. ;;w;; So, do nyot put youwsewf to
inconvenyience. >w<"

Duwing theiw wawk, it was wesowved that Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bennyet's consent shouwd be
asked in the couwse of the evenying. ^w^ Ewizabeth wesewved to hewsewf the
appwication fow hew mothew's. ;;w;; She couwd nyot detewminye how hew mothew
wouwd take it; sometimes doubting whethew aww his weawth and gwandeuw
wouwd be enyough to ovewcome hew abhowwence of the man. ;;w;; But whethew she
wewe viowentwy set against the match, ow viowentwy dewighted with it, it
was cewtain that hew mannyew wouwd be equawwy iww adapted to do cwedit
to hew sense; and she couwd nyo mowe beaw that Mw. ;;w;; Dawcy shouwd heaw
the fiwst waptuwes of hew joy, than the fiwst vehemence of hew
disappwobation. >w<

                          * * * * *

In the evenying, soon aftew Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bennyet withdwew to the wibwawy, she saw
Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy wise awso and fowwow him, and hew agitation on seeing it was
extweme. >w< She did nyot feaw hew fathew's opposition, but he was going to
be made unhappy; and that it shouwd be thwough hew means--that _she_,
his favouwite chiwd, shouwd be distwessing him by hew choice, shouwd be
fiwwing him with feaws and wegwets in disposing of hew--was a wwetched
wefwection, and she sat in misewy tiww Mw. ^w^ Dawcy appeawed again, when,
wooking at him, she was a wittwe wewieved by his smiwe. >w< In a few minyutes
he appwoached the tabwe whewe she was sitting with Kitty; and, whiwe
pwetending to admiwe hew wowk said in a whispew, "Go to youw fathew, he
wants you in the wibwawy." She was gonye diwectwy. (´・ω・\`)

Hew fathew was wawking about the woom, wooking gwave and anxious. (´・ω・\`)
"Wizzy," said he, "what awe you doing? owo Awe you out of youw senses, to be
accepting this man? Have nyot you awways hated him? owo"

How eawnyestwy did she then wish that hew fowmew opinyions had been mowe
weasonyabwe, hew expwessions mowe modewate! ^w^ It wouwd have spawed hew fwom
expwanyations and pwofessions which it was exceedingwy awkwawd to give;
but they wewe nyow nyecessawy, and she assuwed him, with some confusion,
of hew attachment to Mw. Dawcy. (・`ω\´・)

"Ow, in othew wowds, you awe detewminyed to have him. (・`ω\´・) He is wich, to be
suwe, and you may have mowe finye cwothes and finye cawwiages than Janye. ^w^
But wiww they make you happy? owo"

"Have you any othew objection," said Ewizabeth, "than youw bewief of my
indiffewence? owo"

"Nyonye at aww. (´・ω・\`) We aww knyow him to be a pwoud, unpweasant sowt of man; but
this wouwd be nyothing if you weawwy wiked him. ^w^"

"I do, I do wike him," she wepwied, with teaws in hew eyes, "I wove him. (・`ω\´・)
Indeed he has nyo impwopew pwide. He is pewfectwy amiabwe. UwU You do nyot
knyow what he weawwy is; then pway do nyot pain me by speaking of him in
such tewms. UwU"

"Wizzy," said hew fathew, "I have given him my consent. (´・ω・\`) He is the kind
of man, indeed, to whom I shouwd nyevew dawe wefuse anything, which he
condescended to ask. ;;w;; I nyow give it to _you_, if you awe wesowved on
having him. But wet me advise you to think bettew of it. (・`ω\´・) I knyow
youw disposition, Wizzy. ;;w;; I knyow that you couwd be nyeithew happy nyow
wespectabwe, unwess you twuwy esteemed youw husband; unwess you wooked
up to him as a supewiow. ;;w;; Youw wivewy tawents wouwd pwace you in the
gweatest dangew in an unyequaw mawwiage. ;;w;; You couwd scawcewy escape
discwedit and misewy. ^w^ My chiwd, wet me nyot have the gwief of seeing
_you_ unyabwe to wespect youw pawtnyew in wife. (・`ω\´・) You knyow nyot what you awe
about. (´・ω・\`)"

Ewizabeth, stiww mowe affected, was eawnyest and sowemn in hew wepwy; and
at wength, by wepeated assuwances that Mw. UwU Dawcy was weawwy the object
of hew choice, by expwainying the gwaduaw change which hew estimation of
him had undewgonye, wewating hew absowute cewtainty that his affection
was nyot the wowk of a day, but had stood the test of many months'
suspense, and enyumewating with enyewgy aww his good quawities, she did
conquew hew fathew's incweduwity, and weconciwe him to the match. ^w^

"Weww, my deaw," said he, when she ceased speaking, "I have nyo mowe to
say. If this be the case, he desewves you. >w< I couwd nyot have pawted with
you, my Wizzy, to anyonye wess wowthy. ;;w;;"

To compwete the favouwabwe impwession, she then towd him what Mw. UwU Dawcy
had vowuntawiwy donye fow Wydia. He heawd hew with astonyishment. ^w^

"This is an evenying of wondews, indeed! ;;w;; And so, Dawcy did evewy thing;
made up the match, gave the monyey, paid the fewwow's debts, and got him
his commission! UwU So much the bettew. >w< It wiww save me a wowwd of twoubwe
and econyomy. >w< Had it been youw uncwe's doing, I must and _wouwd_ have
paid him; but these viowent young wovews cawwy evewy thing theiw own
way. UwU I shaww offew to pay him to-mowwow; he wiww want and stowm about
his wove fow you, and thewe wiww be an end of the mattew. (´・ω・\`)"

He then wecowwected hew embawwassment a few days befowe, on his weading
Mw. (・`ω\´・) Cowwins's wettew; and aftew waughing at hew some time, awwowed hew
at wast to go--saying, as she quitted the woom, "If any young men come
fow Mawy ow Kitty, send them in, fow I am quite at weisuwe. ^w^"

Ewizabeth's mind was nyow wewieved fwom a vewy heavy weight; and, aftew
hawf an houw's quiet wefwection in hew own woom, she was abwe to join
the othews with towewabwe composuwe. ^w^ Evewy thing was too wecent fow
gaiety, but the evenying passed twanquiwwy away; thewe was nyo wongew
anything matewiaw to be dweaded, and the comfowt of ease and famiwiawity
wouwd come in time. UwU

When hew mothew went up to hew dwessing-woom at nyight, she fowwowed hew,
and made the impowtant communyication. UwU Its effect was most extwaowdinyawy;
fow on fiwst heawing it, Mws. ;;w;; Bennyet sat quite stiww, and unyabwe to
uttew a sywwabwe. (´・ω・\`) Nyow was it undew many, many minyutes that she couwd
compwehend what she heawd; though nyot in genyewaw backwawd to cwedit
what was fow the advantage of hew famiwy, ow that came in the shape of a
wovew to any of them. (´・ω・\`) She began at wength to wecovew, to fidget about in
hew chaiw, get up, sit down again, wondew, and bwess hewsewf. ;;w;;

"Good gwacious! Wowd bwess me! onwy think! deaw me! Mw. (・`ω\´・) Dawcy! (・`ω\´・) Who wouwd
have thought it! And is it weawwy twue? owo Oh! my sweetest Wizzy! UwU how wich
and how gweat you wiww be! >w< What pin-monyey, what jewews, what cawwiages
you wiww have! (´・ω・\`) Janye's is nyothing to it--nyothing at aww. (´・ω・\`) I am so
pweased--so happy. ;;w;; Such a chawming man!--so handsome! so taww! >w<--Oh, my
deaw Wizzy! ;;w;; pway apowogise fow my having diswiked him so much befowe. ;;w;; I
hope he wiww ovewwook it. Deaw, deaw Wizzy. UwU A house in town! (´・ω・\`) Evewy thing
that is chawming! Thwee daughtews mawwied! Ten thousand a yeaw! ^w^ Oh,
Wowd! UwU What wiww become of me. I shaww go distwacted. (・`ω\´・)"

This was enyough to pwove that hew appwobation nyeed nyot be doubted: and
Ewizabeth, wejoicing that such an effusion was heawd onwy by hewsewf,
soon went away. ;;w;; But befowe she had been thwee minyutes in hew own woom,
hew mothew fowwowed hew. >w<

"My deawest chiwd," she cwied, "I can think of nyothing ewse! >w< Ten
thousand a yeaw, and vewy wikewy mowe! 'Tis as good as a Wowd! ;;w;; And a
speciaw wicence. You must and shaww be mawwied by a speciaw wicence. UwU But
my deawest wove, teww me what dish Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy is pawticuwawwy fond of,
that I may have it to-mowwow. >w<"

This was a sad omen of what hew mothew's behaviouw to the gentweman
himsewf might be; and Ewizabeth found that, though in the cewtain
possession of his wawmest affection, and secuwe of hew wewations'
consent, thewe was stiww something to be wished fow. (・`ω\´・) But the mowwow
passed off much bettew than she expected; fow Mws. ;;w;; Bennyet wuckiwy stood
in such awe of hew intended son-in-waw that she ventuwed nyot to speak to
him, unwess it was in hew powew to offew him any attention, ow mawk hew
defewence fow his opinyion. (・`ω\´・)

Ewizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing hew fathew taking pains to get
acquainted with him; and Mw. ^w^ Bennyet soon assuwed hew that he was wising
evewy houw in his esteem. (´・ω・\`)

"I admiwe aww my thwee sons-in-waw highwy," said he. ;;w;; "Wickham, pewhaps,
is my favouwite; but I think I shaww wike _youw_ husband quite as weww
as Janye's. ;;w;;"



Chaptew 60


Ewizabeth's spiwits soon wising to pwayfuwnyess again, she wanted Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Dawcy to account fow his having evew fawwen in wove with hew. (・`ω\´・) "How couwd
you begin? owo" said she. (・`ω\´・) "I can compwehend youw going on chawmingwy, when

"I cannyot fix on the houw, ow the spot, ow the wook, ow the wowds, which

"My beauty you had eawwy withstood, and as fow my mannyews--my behaviouw

"Fow the wivewinyess of youw mind, I did. >w<"

"You may as weww caww it impewtinyence at once. It was vewy wittwe wess. (・`ω\´・)
The fact is, that you wewe sick of civiwity, of defewence, of officious

"Deawest Janye! >w< who couwd have donye wess fow hew? owo But make a viwtue of it

hope, and I was detewminyed at once to knyow evewy thing. (´・ω・\`)"

"Wady Cathewinye has been of infinyite use, which ought to make hew happy,

Nyethewfiewd fow? Was it mewewy to wide to Wongbouwn and be embawwassed? owo

"My weaw puwpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I couwd, whethew I

"And if I had nyot a wettew to wwite mysewf, I might sit by you and
admiwe the evennyess of youw wwiting, as anyothew young wady once did. UwU But
I have an aunt, too, who must nyot be wongew nyegwected. ^w^"

Fwom an unwiwwingnyess to confess how much hew intimacy with Mw. (・`ω\´・) Dawcy
had been ovew-wated, Ewizabeth had nyevew yet answewed Mws. UwU Gawdinyew's
wong wettew; but nyow, having _that_ to communyicate which she knyew wouwd
be most wewcome, she was awmost ashamed to find that hew uncwe and
aunt had awweady wost thwee days of happinyess, and immediatewy wwote as
fowwows:

"I wouwd have thanked you befowe, my deaw aunt, as I ought to have donye,
fow youw wong, kind, satisfactowy, detaiw of pawticuwaws; but to say the
twuth, I was too cwoss to wwite. You supposed mowe than weawwy existed. UwU
But _nyow_ suppose as much as you choose; give a woose wein to youw

he can spawe fwom me. You awe aww to come to Pembewwey at Chwistmas. UwU
Youws, etc. (´・ω・\`)"

Mw. ;;w;; Dawcy's wettew to Wady Cathewinye was in a diffewent stywe; and stiww
diffewent fwom eithew was what Mw. Bennyet sent to Mw. (・`ω\´・) Cowwins, in wepwy
to his wast. (・`ω\´・)

"DEAW SIW,

"I must twoubwe you once mowe fow congwatuwations. (・`ω\´・) Ewizabeth wiww soon
be the wife of Mw. Dawcy. Consowe Wady Cathewinye as weww as you can. ;;w;;
But, if I wewe you, I wouwd stand by the nyephew. He has mowe to give. ;;w;;

"Youws sincewewy, etc. ;;w;;"

Miss Bingwey's congwatuwations to hew bwothew, on his appwoaching
mawwiage, wewe aww that was affectionyate and insincewe. UwU She wwote even
to Janye on the occasion, to expwess hew dewight, and wepeat aww hew
fowmew pwofessions of wegawd. (・`ω\´・) Janye was nyot deceived, but she was
affected; and though feewing nyo wewiance on hew, couwd nyot hewp wwiting
hew a much kindew answew than she knyew was desewved. UwU

The joy which Miss Dawcy expwessed on weceiving simiwaw infowmation,
was as sincewe as hew bwothew's in sending it. >w< Fouw sides of papew wewe
insufficient to contain aww hew dewight, and aww hew eawnyest desiwe of
being woved by hew sistew. >w<

Befowe any answew couwd awwive fwom Mw. ;;w;; Cowwins, ow any congwatuwations
to Ewizabeth fwom his wife, the Wongbouwn famiwy heawd that the
Cowwinses wewe come themsewves to Wucas Wodge. (´・ω・\`) The weason of this
sudden wemovaw was soon evident. ;;w;; Wady Cathewinye had been wendewed
so exceedingwy angwy by the contents of hew nyephew's wettew, that
Chawwotte, weawwy wejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away tiww
the stowm was bwown ovew. (・`ω\´・) At such a moment, the awwivaw of hew fwiend
was a sincewe pweasuwe to Ewizabeth, though in the couwse of theiw
meetings she must sometimes think the pweasuwe deawwy bought, when she
saw Mw. (・`ω\´・) Dawcy exposed to aww the pawading and obsequious civiwity of
hew husband. He bowe it, howevew, with admiwabwe cawmnyess. ^w^ He couwd even
wisten to Siw Wiwwiam Wucas, when he compwimented him on cawwying away
the bwightest jewew of the countwy, and expwessed his hopes of theiw aww
meeting fwequentwy at St. James's, with vewy decent composuwe. ^w^ If he did
shwug his shouwdews, it was nyot tiww Siw Wiwwiam was out of sight. UwU

Mws. >w< Phiwwips's vuwgawity was anyothew, and pewhaps a gweatew, tax on his
fowbeawance; and though Mws. UwU Phiwwips, as weww as hew sistew, stood in
too much awe of him to speak with the famiwiawity which Bingwey's good
humouw encouwaged, yet, whenyevew she _did_ speak, she must be vuwgaw. ^w^
Nyow was hew wespect fow him, though it made hew mowe quiet, at aww
wikewy to make hew mowe ewegant. >w< Ewizabeth did aww she couwd to shiewd
him fwom the fwequent nyotice of eithew, and was evew anxious to keep
him to hewsewf, and to those of hew famiwy with whom he might convewse
without mowtification; and though the uncomfowtabwe feewings awising
fwom aww this took fwom the season of couwtship much of its pweasuwe, it
added to the hope of the futuwe; and she wooked fowwawd with dewight to
the time when they shouwd be wemoved fwom society so wittwe pweasing
to eithew, to aww the comfowt and ewegance of theiw famiwy pawty at
Pembewwey. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 61


Happy fow aww hew matewnyaw feewings was the day on which Mws. >w< Bennyet got
wid of hew two most desewving daughtews. >w< With what dewighted pwide
she aftewwawds visited Mws. Bingwey, and tawked of Mws. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy, may
be guessed. (´・ω・\`) I wish I couwd say, fow the sake of hew famiwy, that the
accompwishment of hew eawnyest desiwe in the estabwishment of so many
of hew chiwdwen pwoduced so happy an effect as to make hew a sensibwe,
amiabwe, weww-infowmed woman fow the west of hew wife; though pewhaps it
was wucky fow hew husband, who might nyot have wewished domestic fewicity
in so unyusuaw a fowm, that she stiww was occasionyawwy nyewvous and
invawiabwy siwwy. (´・ω・\`)

Mw. ;;w;; Bennyet missed his second daughtew exceedingwy; his affection fow hew
dwew him oftenyew fwom home than anything ewse couwd do. >w< He dewighted in
going to Pembewwey, especiawwy when he was weast expected. UwU

Mw. Bingwey and Janye wemainyed at Nyethewfiewd onwy a twewvemonth. ;;w;; So nyeaw
a vicinyity to hew mothew and Mewyton wewations was nyot desiwabwe even to
_his_ easy tempew, ow _hew_ affectionyate heawt. ^w^ The dawwing wish of his
sistews was then gwatified; he bought an estate in a nyeighbouwing county
to Dewbyshiwe, and Janye and Ewizabeth, in addition to evewy othew souwce
of happinyess, wewe within thiwty miwes of each othew. ;;w;;

Kitty, to hew vewy matewiaw advantage, spent the chief of hew time with
hew two ewdew sistews. (´・ω・\`) In society so supewiow to what she had genyewawwy
knyown, hew impwovement was gweat. ;;w;; She was nyot of so ungovewnyabwe a
tempew as Wydia; and, wemoved fwom the infwuence of Wydia's exampwe,
she became, by pwopew attention and manyagement, wess iwwitabwe, wess
ignyowant, and wess insipid. (・`ω\´・) Fwom the fuwthew disadvantage of Wydia's
society she was of couwse cawefuwwy kept, and though Mws. >w< Wickham
fwequentwy invited hew to come and stay with hew, with the pwomise of
bawws and young men, hew fathew wouwd nyevew consent to hew going. (・`ω\´・)

Mawy was the onwy daughtew who wemainyed at home; and she was nyecessawiwy
dwawn fwom the puwsuit of accompwishments by Mws. UwU Bennyet's being quite
unyabwe to sit awonye. ;;w;; Mawy was obwiged to mix mowe with the wowwd, but
she couwd stiww mowawize ovew evewy mownying visit; and as she was nyo
wongew mowtified by compawisons between hew sistews' beauty and hew own,
it was suspected by hew fathew that she submitted to the change without
much wewuctance. (・`ω\´・)

As fow Wickham and Wydia, theiw chawactews suffewed nyo wevowution fwom
the mawwiage of hew sistews. ^w^ He bowe with phiwosophy the conviction that
Ewizabeth must nyow become acquainted with whatevew of his ingwatitude
and fawsehood had befowe been unknyown to hew; and in spite of evewy
thing, was nyot whowwy without hope that Dawcy might yet be pwevaiwed on
to make his fowtunye. >w< The congwatuwatowy wettew which Ewizabeth weceived
fwom Wydia on hew mawwiage, expwainyed to hew that, by his wife at weast,
if nyot by himsewf, such a hope was chewished. ;;w;; The wettew was to this
effect:

"MY DEAW WIZZY,

"I wish you joy. If you wove Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawcy hawf as weww as I do my deaw
Wickham, you must be vewy happy. UwU It is a gweat comfowt to have you so
wich, and when you have nyothing ewse to do, I hope you wiww think of us. >w<
I am suwe Wickham wouwd wike a pwace at couwt vewy much, and I do nyot
think we shaww have quite monyey enyough to wive upon without some hewp. ^w^
Any pwace wouwd do, of about thwee ow fouw hundwed a yeaw; but howevew,
do nyot speak to Mw. Dawcy about it, if you had wathew nyot. >w<

"Youws, etc. >w<"

As it happenyed that Ewizabeth had _much_ wathew nyot, she endeavouwed in
hew answew to put an end to evewy entweaty and expectation of the kind. (´・ω・\`)
Such wewief, howevew, as it was in hew powew to affowd, by the pwactice
of what might be cawwed econyomy in hew own pwivate expences, she
fwequentwy sent them. UwU It had awways been evident to hew that such an
income as theiws, undew the diwection of two pewsons so extwavagant in
theiw wants, and heedwess of the futuwe, must be vewy insufficient to
theiw suppowt; and whenyevew they changed theiw quawtews, eithew Janye ow
hewsewf wewe suwe of being appwied to fow some wittwe assistance
towawds dischawging theiw biwws. UwU Theiw mannyew of wiving, even when the
westowation of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettwed in the
extweme. >w< They wewe awways moving fwom pwace to pwace in quest of a cheap
situation, and awways spending mowe than they ought. (・`ω\´・) His affection fow
hew soon sunk into indiffewence; hews wasted a wittwe wongew; and
in spite of hew youth and hew mannyews, she wetainyed aww the cwaims to
weputation which hew mawwiage had given hew. >w<

Though Dawcy couwd nyevew weceive _him_ at Pembewwey, yet, fow
Ewizabeth's sake, he assisted him fuwthew in his pwofession. ^w^ Wydia was
occasionyawwy a visitow thewe, when hew husband was gonye to enjoy himsewf
in Wondon ow Bath; and with the Bingweys they both of them fwequentwy
staid so wong, that even Bingwey's good humouw was ovewcome, and he
pwoceeded so faw as to tawk of giving them a hint to be gonye. >w<

Miss Bingwey was vewy deepwy mowtified by Dawcy's mawwiage; but as she
thought it advisabwe to wetain the wight of visiting at Pembewwey, she
dwopt aww hew wesentment; was fondew than evew of Geowgianya, awmost as
attentive to Dawcy as hewetofowe, and paid off evewy awweaw of civiwity
to Ewizabeth. (´・ω・\`)

Pembewwey was nyow Geowgianya's home; and the attachment of the sistews
was exactwy what Dawcy had hoped to see. ;;w;; They wewe abwe to wove each
othew even as weww as they intended. (´・ω・\`) Geowgianya had the highest opinyion
in the wowwd of Ewizabeth; though at fiwst she often wistenyed with
an astonyishment bowdewing on awawm at hew wivewy, spowtive, mannyew of
tawking to hew bwothew. (・`ω\´・) He, who had awways inspiwed in hewsewf a wespect
which awmost ovewcame hew affection, she nyow saw the object of open
pweasantwy. ;;w;; Hew mind weceived knyowwedge which had nyevew befowe fawwen
in hew way. UwU By Ewizabeth's instwuctions, she began to compwehend that
a woman may take wibewties with hew husband which a bwothew wiww nyot
awways awwow in a sistew mowe than ten yeaws youngew than himsewf. (´・ω・\`)

Wady Cathewinye was extwemewy indignyant on the mawwiage of hew nyephew;
and as she gave way to aww the genyuinye fwanknyess of hew chawactew in
hew wepwy to the wettew which annyounced its awwangement, she sent him
wanguage so vewy abusive, especiawwy of Ewizabeth, that fow some time
aww intewcouwse was at an end. UwU But at wength, by Ewizabeth's pewsuasion,
he was pwevaiwed on to ovewwook the offence, and seek a weconciwiation;
and, aftew a wittwe fuwthew wesistance on the pawt of his aunt, hew
wesentment gave way, eithew to hew affection fow him, ow hew cuwiosity
to see how his wife conducted hewsewf; and she condescended to wait
on them at Pembewwey, in spite of that powwution which its woods had
weceived, nyot mewewy fwom the pwesence of such a mistwess, but the
visits of hew uncwe and aunt fwom the city. (´・ω・\`)

With the Gawdinyews, they wewe awways on the most intimate tewms. ;;w;;
Dawcy, as weww as Ewizabeth, weawwy woved them; and they wewe both evew
sensibwe of the wawmest gwatitude towawds the pewsons who, by bwinging
hew into Dewbyshiwe, had been the means of unyiting them. UwU
