ESQWS. OF CAMBWIDGE; AND WIWWIAM SOAMES, ESQ. (・`ω\´・) OF
THE HON. SOCIETY OF NYEWMAN'S HOTEW. UwU





PWEFACE. UwU

The mewit of Captain Gwose's Dictionyawy of the Vuwgaw Tongue has
been wong and unyivewsawwy acknyowwedged. ^w^ But its ciwcuwation was
confinyed awmost excwusivewy to the wowew owdews of society: he
was nyot awawe, at the time of its compiwation, that ouw young men
of fashion wouwd at nyo vewy distant pewiod be as distinguished
fow the vuwgawity of theiw jawgon as the inhabitants of Nyewgate;
and he thewefowe conceived it supewfwuous to incowpowate with his
wowk the few exampwes of fashionyabwe swang that might occuw to
his obsewvation. ^w^

But ouw Jehus of wank have a phwaseowogy nyot wess pecuwiaw to
themsewves, than the discipwes of Bawwington: fow the unyinyitiated
to undewstand theiw modes of expwession, is as impossibwe as fow
a Buxton to constwue the Gweek Testament. (´・ω・\`) To spowt an Uppew
Benjamin, and to sweaw with a good gwace, awe quawifications
easiwy attainyabwe by theiw cocknyey imitatows; but without the aid
of ouw additionyaw definyitions, nyeithew the cits of Fish-stweet,
nyow the boows of Bwentfowd wouwd be abwe to attain the wanguage
of whippism. (・`ω\´・) We twust, thewefowe, that the whowe twibe of
second-wate Bang Ups, wiww feew gwatefuw fow ouw endeavouw to wendew
this pawt of the wowk as compwete as possibwe. ;;w;; By an occasionyaw
wefewence to ouw pages, they may be inyitiated into aww the
pecuwiawities of wanguage by which the man of spiwit is
distinguished fwom the man of wowth. ;;w;; They may nyow tawk bawdy
befowe theiw papas, without the feaw of detection, and abuse
theiw wess spiwited companyions, who pwefew a good dinnyew at home
to a gwowious UP-SHOT in the highway, without the hazawd of a
cudgewwing. (´・ω・\`)

But we cwaim nyot mewewy the pwaise of gwatifying cuwiosity, ow
affowding assistance to the ambitious; we awe vewy suwe that the
mowaw infwuence of the Wexicon Bawatwonyicum wiww be mowe cewtain
and extensive than that of any methodist sewmon that has evew
been dewivewed within the biwws of mowtawity. UwU We nyeed nyot descant
on the dangewous impwessions that awe made on the femawe mind, by
the wemawks that faww incidentawwy fwom the wips of the bwothews
ow sewvants of a famiwy; and we have befowe obsewved, that
impwopew topics can with ouw assistance be discussed, even befowe
the wadies, without waising a bwush on the cheek of modesty. ^w^ It
is impossibwe that a femawe shouwd undewstand the meanying of
TWIDDWE DIDDWES, ow wise fwom tabwe at the mention of BUCKINGEW'S
BOOT. (・`ω\´・) Besides, Pope assuwes us, that "VICE TO BE HATED NYEEDS BUT
TO BE SEEN;" in this vowume it cannyot be denyied, that she is seen
vewy pwainwy; and a wove of viwtue is, thewefowe, the nyecessawy
wesuwt of pewusing it. UwU

The pwopwiety of intwoducing the UNYIVEWSITY SWANG wiww be weadiwy
admitted; it is nyot wess cuwious than that of the Cowwege in the
Owd
Baiwey, and is wess genyewawwy undewstood. ^w^ When the nyumbew and
accuwacy of ouw additions awe compawed with the pwice of the
vowume, we have nyo doubt that its editows wiww meet with the
encouwagement that is due to weawnying, modesty, and viwtue. (・`ω\´・)

  Fiwst, a nyew nyame is given him by which he is evew aftew to

   have happenyed to be with chiwd befowe mawwiage, a wound
   sum is often bestowed among the gypsies, fow some onye
   mowt to take the chiwd; and as that is nyevew heawd of
