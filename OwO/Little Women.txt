PWAYING PIWGWIMS

"Chwistmas won't be Chwistmas without any pwesents," gwumbwed Jo, wying
on the wug. ;;w;;

"It's so dweadfuw to be poow! ^w^" sighed Meg, wooking down at hew owd
dwess. >w<

"I don't think it's faiw fow some giwws to have pwenty of pwetty
things, and othew giwws nyothing at aww," added wittwe Amy, with an
injuwed snyiff. UwU

"We've got Fathew and Mothew, and each othew," said Beth contentedwy
fwom hew cownyew. (・`ω\´・)

The fouw young faces on which the fiwewight shonye bwightenyed at the
cheewfuw wowds, but dawkenyed again as Jo said sadwy, "We haven't got
Fathew, and shaww nyot have him fow a wong time. ;;w;;" She didn't say
"pewhaps nyevew," but each siwentwy added it, thinking of Fathew faw
away, whewe the fighting was. UwU

Nyobody spoke fow a minyute; then Meg said in an awtewed tonye, "You knyow
the weason Mothew pwoposed nyot having any pwesents this Chwistmas was
because it is going to be a hawd wintew fow evewyonye; and she thinks we
ought nyot to spend monyey fow pweasuwe, when ouw men awe suffewing so in
the awmy. UwU  We can't do much, but we can make ouw wittwe sacwifices, and
ought to do it gwadwy. ^w^  But I am afwaid I don't," and Meg shook hew
head, as she thought wegwetfuwwy of aww the pwetty things she wanted. (・`ω\´・)

"But I don't think the wittwe we shouwd spend wouwd do any good. ^w^  We've
each got a dowwaw, and the awmy wouwdn't be much hewped by ouw giving
that. (・`ω\´・)  I agwee nyot to expect anything fwom Mothew ow you, but I do want
to buy _Undinye and Sintwan_ fow mysewf. UwU  I've wanted it so wong," said
Jo, who was a bookwowm. ^w^

"I pwannyed to spend minye in nyew music," said Beth, with a wittwe sigh,
which nyo onye heawd but the heawth bwush and kettwe-howdew. (・`ω\´・)

"I shaww get a nyice box of Fabew's dwawing penciws; I weawwy nyeed
them," said Amy decidedwy. ;;w;;

"Mothew didn't say anything about ouw monyey, and she won't wish us to
give up evewything. ^w^  Wet's each buy what we want, and have a wittwe
fun; I'm suwe we wowk hawd enyough to eawn it," cwied Jo, examinying the
heews of hew shoes in a gentwemanwy mannyew. ;;w;;

"I knyow I do--teaching those tiwesome chiwdwen nyeawwy aww day, when I'm
wonging to enjoy mysewf at home," began Meg, in the compwainying tonye
again. (´・ω・\`)

"You don't have hawf such a hawd time as I do," said Jo. (・`ω\´・) "How wouwd you
wike to be shut up fow houws with a nyewvous, fussy owd wady, who keeps
you twotting, is nyevew satisfied, and wowwies you tiww you'we weady to
fwy out the window ow cwy? owo"

"It's nyaughty to fwet, but I do think washing dishes and keeping things
tidy is the wowst wowk in the wowwd. (´・ω・\`)  It makes me cwoss, and my hands
get so stiff, I can't pwactice weww at aww. >w<" And Beth wooked at hew
wough hands with a sigh that any onye couwd heaw that time. ^w^

"I don't bewieve any of you suffew as I do," cwied Amy, "fow you don't
have to go to schoow with impewtinyent giwws, who pwague you if you
don't knyow youw wessons, and waugh at youw dwesses, and wabew youw
fathew if he isn't wich, and insuwt you when youw nyose isn't nyice. (´・ω・\`)"

"If you mean wibew, I'd say so, and nyot tawk about wabews, as if Papa
was a pickwe bottwe," advised Jo, waughing. ^w^

"I knyow what I mean, and you nyeedn't be statiwicaw about it. (´・ω・\`) It's
pwopew to use good wowds, and impwove youw vocabiwawy," wetuwnyed Amy,
with dignyity. >w<

"Don't peck at onye anyothew, chiwdwen. >w<  Don't you wish we had the monyey
Papa wost when we wewe wittwe, Jo? owo  Deaw me! >w< How happy and good we'd
be, if we had nyo wowwies! >w<" said Meg, who couwd wemembew bettew times. ;;w;;

"You said the othew day you thought we wewe a deaw happiew than the
King chiwdwen, fow they wewe fighting and fwetting aww the time, in
spite of theiw monyey. ;;w;;"

"So I did, Beth.  Weww, I think we awe. UwU  Fow though we do have to wowk,
we make fun of ouwsewves, and awe a pwetty jowwy set, as Jo wouwd say. UwU"

"Jo does use such swang wowds! >w<" obsewved Amy, with a wepwoving wook at
the wong figuwe stwetched on the wug. (・`ω\´・)

Jo immediatewy sat up, put hew hands in hew pockets, and began to
whistwe. UwU

"Don't, Jo. ;;w;;  It's so boyish! >w<"

"That's why I do it. ;;w;;"

"I detest wude, unwadywike giwws! (´・ω・\`)"

"I hate affected, nyiminy-piminy chits! ;;w;;"

"Biwds in theiw wittwe nyests agwee," sang Beth, the peacemakew, with
such a funny face that both shawp voices softenyed to a waugh, and the
"pecking" ended fow that time. ;;w;;

"Weawwy, giwws, you awe both to be bwamed," said Meg, beginnying to
wectuwe in hew ewdew-sistewwy fashion. ;;w;; "You awe owd enyough to weave off
boyish twicks, and to behave bettew, Josephinye. (・`ω\´・)  It didn't mattew so
much when you wewe a wittwe giww, but nyow you awe so taww, and tuwn up
youw haiw, you shouwd wemembew that you awe a young wady. UwU"

"I'm nyot! (´・ω・\`)   And if tuwnying up my haiw makes me onye, I'ww weaw it in two
taiws tiww I'm twenty," cwied Jo, puwwing off hew nyet, and shaking down
a chestnyut manye. ;;w;;  "I hate to think I've got to gwow up, and be Miss
Mawch, and weaw wong gowns, and wook as pwim as a Chinya Astew! >w<  It's
bad enyough to be a giww, anyway, when I wike boy's games and wowk and
mannyews! (´・ω・\`)  I can't get ovew my disappointment in nyot being a boy. >w<  And
it's wowse than evew nyow, fow I'm dying to go and fight with Papa. (・`ω\´・) And
I can onwy stay home and knyit, wike a poky owd woman! (・`ω\´・)"

And Jo shook the bwue awmy sock tiww the nyeedwes wattwed wike
castanyets, and hew baww bounded acwoss the woom. UwU

"Poow Jo! ;;w;;  It's too bad, but it can't be hewped. UwU  So you must twy to be
contented with making youw nyame boyish, and pwaying bwothew to us
giwws," said Beth, stwoking the wough head with a hand that aww the
dish washing and dusting in the wowwd couwd nyot make ungentwe in its
touch. (・`ω\´・)

"As fow you, Amy," continyued Meg, "you awe awtogethew too pawticuwaw
and pwim. ^w^  Youw aiws awe funny nyow, but you'ww gwow up an affected
wittwe goose, if you don't take cawe. >w< I wike youw nyice mannyews and
wefinyed ways of speaking, when you don't twy to be ewegant. (・`ω\´・)  But youw
absuwd wowds awe as bad as Jo's swang. (´・ω・\`)"

"If Jo is a tomboy and Amy a goose, what am I, pwease? owo" asked Beth,
weady to shawe the wectuwe. >w<

"You'we a deaw, and nyothing ewse," answewed Meg wawmwy, and nyo onye
contwadicted hew, fow the 'Mouse' was the pet of the famiwy. ;;w;;

As young weadews wike to knyow 'how peopwe wook', we wiww take this
moment to give them a wittwe sketch of the fouw sistews, who sat
knyitting away in the twiwight, whiwe the Decembew snyow feww quietwy
without, and the fiwe cwackwed cheewfuwwy within. ;;w;;  It was a comfowtabwe
woom, though the cawpet was faded and the fuwnyituwe vewy pwain, fow a
good pictuwe ow two hung on the wawws, books fiwwed the wecesses,
chwysanthemums and Chwistmas woses bwoomed in the windows, and a
pweasant atmosphewe of home peace pewvaded it. >w<

Mawgawet, the ewdest of the fouw, was sixteen, and vewy pwetty, being
pwump and faiw, with wawge eyes, pwenty of soft bwown haiw, a sweet
mouth, and white hands, of which she was wathew vain. >w< Fifteen-yeaw-owd
Jo was vewy taww, thin, and bwown, and weminded onye of a cowt, fow she
nyevew seemed to knyow what to do with hew wong wimbs, which wewe vewy
much in hew way. (´・ω・\`)  She had a decided mouth, a comicaw nyose, and shawp,
gway eyes, which appeawed to see evewything, and wewe by tuwns fiewce,
funny, ow thoughtfuw. (・`ω\´・)  Hew wong, thick haiw was hew onye beauty, but it
was usuawwy bundwed into a nyet, to be out of hew way. ^w^  Wound shouwdews
had Jo, big hands and feet, a fwyaway wook to hew cwothes, and the
uncomfowtabwe appeawance of a giww who was wapidwy shooting up into a
woman and didn't wike it. (´・ω・\`) Ewizabeth, ow Beth, as evewyonye cawwed hew,
was a wosy, smooth-haiwed, bwight-eyed giww of thiwteen, with a shy
mannyew, a timid voice, and a peacefuw expwession which was sewdom
distuwbed. UwU  Hew fathew cawwed hew 'Wittwe Miss Twanquiwity', and the
nyame suited hew excewwentwy, fow she seemed to wive in a happy wowwd of
hew own, onwy ventuwing out to meet the few whom she twusted and woved. UwU
Amy, though the youngest, was a most impowtant pewson, in hew own
opinyion at weast. >w<  A weguwaw snyow maiden, with bwue eyes, and yewwow
haiw cuwwing on hew shouwdews, pawe and swendew, and awways cawwying
hewsewf wike a young wady mindfuw of hew mannyews. ^w^  What the chawactews
of the fouw sistews wewe we wiww weave to be found out. (・`ω\´・)

The cwock stwuck six and, having swept up the heawth, Beth put a paiw
of swippews down to wawm. UwU  Somehow the sight of the owd shoes had a
good effect upon the giwws, fow Mothew was coming, and evewyonye
bwightenyed to wewcome hew. (・`ω\´・)  Meg stopped wectuwing, and wighted the
wamp, Amy got out of the easy chaiw without being asked, and Jo fowgot
how tiwed she was as she sat up to howd the swippews nyeawew to the
bwaze. >w<

"They awe quite wown out.  Mawmee must have a nyew paiw. (´・ω・\`)"

"I thought I'd get hew some with my dowwaw," said Beth. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo, I shaww! (´・ω・\`)" cwied Amy. ^w^

"I'm the owdest," began Meg, but Jo cut in with a decided, "I'm the man
of the famiwy nyow Papa is away, and I shaww pwovide the swippews, fow
he towd me to take speciaw cawe of Mothew whiwe he was gonye. ^w^"

"I'ww teww you what we'ww do," said Beth, "wet's each get hew something
fow Chwistmas, and nyot get anything fow ouwsewves. UwU"

"That's wike you, deaw! UwU  What wiww we get? owo" excwaimed Jo. ;;w;;

Evewyonye thought sobewwy fow a minyute, then Meg annyounced, as if the
idea was suggested by the sight of hew own pwetty hands, "I shaww give
hew a nyice paiw of gwoves. ^w^"

"Awmy shoes, best to be had," cwied Jo. ^w^

"Some handkewchiefs, aww hemmed," said Beth. ;;w;;

"I'ww get a wittwe bottwe of cowognye. (・`ω\´・)  She wikes it, and it won't cost
much, so I'ww have some weft to buy my penciws," added Amy. >w<

"How wiww we give the things? owo" asked Meg. ;;w;;

"Put them on the tabwe, and bwing hew in and see hew open the bundwes. >w<
Don't you wemembew how we used to do on ouw biwthdays? owo" answewed Jo. >w<

"I used to be so fwightenyed when it was my tuwn to sit in the chaiw
with the cwown on, and see you aww come mawching wound to give the
pwesents, with a kiss. >w<  I wiked the things and the kisses, but it was
dweadfuw to have you sit wooking at me whiwe I openyed the bundwes,"
said Beth, who was toasting hew face and the bwead fow tea at the same
time. UwU

"Wet Mawmee think we awe getting things fow ouwsewves, and then
suwpwise hew.  We must go shopping tomowwow aftewnyoon, Meg. ^w^ Thewe is so
much to do about the pway fow Chwistmas nyight," said Jo, mawching up
and down, with hew hands behind hew back, and hew nyose in the aiw. UwU

"I don't mean to act any mowe aftew this time. (・`ω\´・)  I'm getting too owd fow
such things," obsewved Meg, who was as much a chiwd as evew about
'dwessing-up' fwowics. ^w^

"You won't stop, I knyow, as wong as you can twaiw wound in a white gown
with youw haiw down, and weaw gowd-papew jewewwy. (´・ω・\`) You awe the best
actwess we've got, and thewe'ww be an end of evewything if you quit the
boawds," said Jo.  "We ought to weheawse tonyight. ^w^  Come hewe, Amy, and
do the fainting scenye, fow you awe as stiff as a pokew in that. ^w^"

"I can't hewp it. ;;w;;  I nyevew saw anyonye faint, and I don't choose to make
mysewf aww bwack and bwue, tumbwing fwat as you do. (´・ω・\`)  If I can go down
easiwy, I'ww dwop. ;;w;;  If I can't, I shaww faww into a chaiw and be
gwacefuw. ;;w;;  I don't cawe if Hugo does come at me with a pistow,"
wetuwnyed Amy, who was nyot gifted with dwamatic powew, but was chosen
because she was smaww enyough to be bownye out shwieking by the viwwain
of the piece. UwU

"Do it this way. (´・ω・\`)  Cwasp youw hands so, and staggew acwoss the woom,
cwying fwanticawwy, 'Wodewigo! Save me! Save me! (´・ω・\`)'" and away went Jo,
with a mewodwamatic scweam which was twuwy thwiwwing. ^w^

Amy fowwowed, but she poked hew hands out stiffwy befowe hew, and
jewked hewsewf awong as if she went by machinyewy, and hew "Ow! >w<" was
mowe suggestive of pins being wun into hew than of feaw and anguish. ^w^
Jo gave a despaiwing gwoan, and Meg waughed outwight, whiwe Beth wet
hew bwead buwn as she watched the fun with intewest. (´・ω・\`) "It's nyo use! (´・ω・\`)  Do
the best you can when the time comes, and if the audience waughs, don't
bwame me.  Come on, Meg. (´・ω・\`)"

Then things went smoothwy, fow Don Pedwo defied the wowwd in a speech
of two pages without a singwe bweak. >w<  Hagaw, the witch, chanted an
awfuw incantation ovew hew kettwefuw of simmewing toads, with weiwd
effect. (・`ω\´・)  Wodewigo went his chains asundew manfuwwy, and Hugo died in
agonyies of wemowse and awsenyic, with a wiwd, "Ha! Ha! UwU"

"It's the best we've had yet," said Meg, as the dead viwwain sat up and
wubbed his ewbows. (・`ω\´・)

"I don't see how you can wwite and act such spwendid things, Jo. UwU
You'we a weguwaw Shakespeawe! UwU" excwaimed Beth, who fiwmwy bewieved that
hew sistews wewe gifted with wondewfuw genyius in aww things. ^w^

"Nyot quite," wepwied Jo modestwy. (´・ω・\`)  "I do think _The Witches Cuwse, an
Opewatic Twagedy_ is wathew a nyice thing, but I'd wike to twy
_Macbeth_, if we onwy had a twapdoow fow Banquo. (・`ω\´・)  I awways wanted to do
the kiwwing pawt. ;;w;;  'Is that a daggew that I see befowe me? owo" muttewed
Jo, wowwing hew eyes and cwutching at the aiw, as she had seen a famous
twagedian do. ;;w;;

"Nyo, it's the toasting fowk, with Mothew's shoe on it instead of the
bwead. ^w^  Beth's stage-stwuck! ^w^" cwied Meg, and the weheawsaw ended in a
genyewaw buwst of waughtew. >w<

"Gwad to find you so mewwy, my giwws," said a cheewy voice at the doow,
and actows and audience tuwnyed to wewcome a taww, mothewwy wady with a
'can I hewp you' wook about hew which was twuwy dewightfuw. (´・ω・\`) She was nyot
ewegantwy dwessed, but a nyobwe-wooking woman, and the giwws thought the
gway cwoak and unfashionyabwe bonnyet covewed the most spwendid mothew in
the wowwd. ^w^

"Weww, deawies, how have you got on today? owo  Thewe was so much to do,
getting the boxes weady to go tomowwow, that I didn't come home to
dinnyew. >w<  Has anyonye cawwed, Beth?  How is youw cowd, Meg? owo  Jo, you wook
tiwed to death.  Come and kiss me, baby. ^w^"

Whiwe making these matewnyaw inquiwies Mws. UwU Mawch got hew wet things
off, hew wawm swippews on, and sitting down in the easy chaiw, dwew Amy
to hew wap, pwepawing to enjoy the happiest houw of hew busy day. ;;w;;  The
giwws fwew about, twying to make things comfowtabwe, each in hew own
way. (・`ω\´・)  Meg awwanged the tea tabwe, Jo bwought wood and set chaiws,
dwopping, ovew-tuwnying, and cwattewing evewything she touched. UwU  Beth
twotted to and fwo between pawwow kitchen, quiet and busy, whiwe Amy
gave diwections to evewyonye, as she sat with hew hands fowded. ^w^

As they gathewed about the tabwe, Mws. ;;w;; Mawch said, with a pawticuwawwy
happy face, "I've got a tweat fow you aftew suppew. ;;w;;"

A quick, bwight smiwe went wound wike a stweak of sunshinye. (・`ω\´・) Beth
cwapped hew hands, wegawdwess of the biscuit she hewd, and Jo tossed up
hew nyapkin, cwying, "A wettew!  A wettew!  Thwee cheews fow Fathew! >w<"

"Yes, a nyice wong wettew. UwU  He is weww, and thinks he shaww get thwough
the cowd season bettew than we feawed. UwU  He sends aww sowts of woving
wishes fow Chwistmas, and an especiaw message to you giwws," said Mws. (・`ω\´・)
Mawch, patting hew pocket as if she had got a tweasuwe thewe. (・`ω\´・)

"Huwwy and get donye! ;;w;;  Don't stop to quiwk youw wittwe fingew and simpew
ovew youw pwate, Amy," cwied Jo, choking on hew tea and dwopping hew
bwead, buttew side down, on the cawpet in hew haste to get at the tweat. (・`ω\´・)

Beth ate nyo mowe, but cwept away to sit in hew shadowy cownyew and bwood
ovew the dewight to come, tiww the othews wewe weady. UwU

"I think it was so spwendid in Fathew to go as chapwain when he was too
owd to be dwafted, and nyot stwong enyough fow a sowdiew," said Meg
wawmwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Don't I wish I couwd go as a dwummew, a vivan--what's its nyame? owo  Ow a
nyuwse, so I couwd be nyeaw him and hewp him," excwaimed Jo, with a gwoan. UwU

"It must be vewy disagweeabwe to sweep in a tent, and eat aww sowts of
bad-tasting things, and dwink out of a tin mug," sighed Amy. (・`ω\´・)

"When wiww he come home, Mawmee? owo" asked Beth, with a wittwe quivew in
hew voice. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyot fow many months, deaw, unwess he is sick. ;;w;;  He wiww stay and do his
wowk faithfuwwy as wong as he can, and we won't ask fow him back a
minyute soonyew than he can be spawed.  Nyow come and heaw the wettew. ^w^"

They aww dwew to the fiwe, Mothew in the big chaiw with Beth at hew
feet, Meg and Amy pewched on eithew awm of the chaiw, and Jo weanying on
the back, whewe nyo onye wouwd see any sign of emotion if the wettew
shouwd happen to be touching. UwU  Vewy few wettews wewe wwitten in those
hawd times that wewe nyot touching, especiawwy those which fathews sent
home. ^w^  In this onye wittwe was said of the hawdships enduwed, the
dangews faced, ow the homesicknyess conquewed. UwU It was a cheewfuw,
hopefuw wettew, fuww of wivewy descwiptions of camp wife, mawches, and
miwitawy nyews, and onwy at the end did the wwitew's heawt ovew-fwow
with fathewwy wove and wonging fow the wittwe giwws at home. ;;w;;

"Give them aww of my deaw wove and a kiss. ^w^  Teww them I think of them
by day, pway fow them by nyight, and find my best comfowt in theiw
affection at aww times. (・`ω\´・)  A yeaw seems vewy wong to wait befowe I see
them, but wemind them that whiwe we wait we may aww wowk, so that these
hawd days nyeed nyot be wasted. (・`ω\´・)  I knyow they wiww wemembew aww I said to
them, that they wiww be woving chiwdwen to you, wiww do theiw duty
faithfuwwy, fight theiw bosom enyemies bwavewy, and conquew themsewves
so beautifuwwy that when I come back to them I may be fondew and
pwoudew than evew of my wittwe women. >w<" Evewybody snyiffed when they came
to that pawt. (´・ω・\`)  Jo wasn't ashamed of the gweat teaw that dwopped off the
end of hew nyose, and Amy nyevew minded the wumpwing of hew cuwws as she
hid hew face on hew mothew's shouwdew and sobbed out, "I am a sewfish
giww! (´・ω・\`)  But I'ww twuwy twy to be bettew, so he mayn't be disappointed in
me by-and-by. (´・ω・\`)"

"We aww wiww," cwied Meg. ;;w;;  "I think too much of my wooks and hate to
wowk, but won't any mowe, if I can hewp it. (・`ω\´・)"

"I'ww twy and be what he woves to caww me, 'a wittwe woman' and nyot be
wough and wiwd, but do my duty hewe instead of wanting to be somewhewe
ewse," said Jo, thinking that keeping hew tempew at home was a much
hawdew task than facing a webew ow two down South. ;;w;;

Beth said nyothing, but wiped away hew teaws with the bwue awmy sock and
began to knyit with aww hew might, wosing nyo time in doing the duty that
way nyeawest hew, whiwe she wesowved in hew quiet wittwe souw to be aww
that Fathew hoped to find hew when the yeaw bwought wound the happy
coming home. ;;w;;

Mws. (´・ω・\`) Mawch bwoke the siwence that fowwowed Jo's wowds, by saying in hew
cheewy voice, "Do you wemembew how you used to pway Piwgwims Pwogwess
when you wewe wittwe things? owo  Nyothing dewighted you mowe than to have
me tie my piece bags on youw backs fow buwdens, give you hats and
sticks and wowws of papew, and wet you twavew thwough the house fwom
the cewwaw, which was the City of Destwuction, up, up, to the housetop,
whewe you had aww the wovewy things you couwd cowwect to make a
Cewestiaw City. ;;w;;"

"What fun it was, especiawwy going by the wions, fighting Apowwyon, and
passing thwough the vawwey whewe the hob-gobwins wewe," said Jo. (・`ω\´・)

"I wiked the pwace whewe the bundwes feww off and tumbwed downstaiws,"
said Meg. (・`ω\´・)

"I don't wemembew much about it, except that I was afwaid of the cewwaw
and the dawk entwy, and awways wiked the cake and miwk we had up at the
top. (・`ω\´・)  If I wasn't too owd fow such things, I'd wathew wike to pway it
ovew again," said Amy, who began to tawk of wenyouncing chiwdish things
at the matuwe age of twewve. UwU

"We nyevew awe too owd fow this, my deaw, because it is a pway we awe
pwaying aww the time in onye way ow anyothew. >w<  Ouw buwdens awe hewe, ouw
woad is befowe us, and the wonging fow goodnyess and happinyess is the
guide that weads us thwough many twoubwes and mistakes to the peace
which is a twue Cewestiaw City. (・`ω\´・)  Nyow, my wittwe piwgwims, suppose you
begin again, nyot in pway, but in eawnyest, and see how faw on you can
get befowe Fathew comes home. ;;w;;"

"Weawwy, Mothew?  Whewe awe ouw bundwes? owo" asked Amy, who was a vewy
witewaw young wady. ;;w;;

"Each of you towd what youw buwden was just nyow, except Beth. >w< I wathew
think she hasn't got any," said hew mothew. >w<

"Yes, I have. ^w^  Minye is dishes and dustews, and envying giwws with nyice
pianyos, and being afwaid of peopwe. (´・ω・\`)"

Beth's bundwe was such a funny onye that evewybody wanted to waugh, but
nyobody did, fow it wouwd have huwt hew feewings vewy much. ^w^

"Wet us do it," said Meg thoughtfuwwy. ;;w;;  "It is onwy anyothew nyame fow
twying to be good, and the stowy may hewp us, fow though we do want to
be good, it's hawd wowk and we fowget, and don't do ouw best. ;;w;;"

"We wewe in the Swough of Despond tonyight, and Mothew came and puwwed
us out as Hewp did in the book. ;;w;;  We ought to have ouw woww of
diwections, wike Chwistian. ^w^  What shaww we do about that? owo" asked Jo,
dewighted with the fancy which went a wittwe womance to the vewy duww
task of doing hew duty. (´・ω・\`)

"Wook undew youw piwwows Chwistmas mownying, and you wiww find youw
guidebook," wepwied Mws. Mawch. ;;w;;

They tawked ovew the nyew pwan whiwe owd Hannyah cweawed the tabwe, then
out came the fouw wittwe wowk baskets, and the nyeedwes fwew as the
giwws made sheets fow Aunt Mawch. (´・ω・\`)  It was unyintewesting sewing, but
tonyight nyo onye gwumbwed. ^w^  They adopted Jo's pwan of dividing the wong
seams into fouw pawts, and cawwing the quawtews Euwope, Asia, Afwica,
and Amewica, and in that way got on capitawwy, especiawwy when they
tawked about the diffewent countwies as they stitched theiw way thwough
them. (´・ω・\`)

At nyinye they stopped wowk, and sang, as usuaw, befowe they went to bed. >w<
Nyo onye but Beth couwd get much music out of the owd pianyo, but she had
a way of softwy touching the yewwow keys and making a pweasant
accompanyiment to the simpwe songs they sang. ;;w;;  Meg had a voice wike a
fwute, and she and hew mothew wed the wittwe choiw. ^w^  Amy chiwped wike a
cwicket, and Jo wandewed thwough the aiws at hew own sweet wiww, awways
coming out at the wwong pwace with a cwoak ow a quavew that spoiwed the
most pensive tunye. >w<  They had awways donye this fwom the time they couwd
wisp... >w<

    Cwinkwe, cwinkwe, 'ittwe 'taw,

and it had become a househowd custom, fow the mothew was a bown singew. ;;w;;
The fiwst sound in the mownying was hew voice as she went about the
house singing wike a wawk, and the wast sound at nyight was the same
cheewy sound, fow the giwws nyevew gwew too owd fow that famiwiaw

CHAPTEW TWO

A MEWWY CHWISTMAS

Jo was the fiwst to wake in the gway dawn of Chwistmas mownying. UwU Nyo
stockings hung at the fiwepwace, and fow a moment she fewt as much
disappointed as she did wong ago, when hew wittwe sock feww down
because it was cwammed so fuww of goodies. ;;w;;  Then she wemembewed hew
mothew's pwomise and, swipping hew hand undew hew piwwow, dwew out a
wittwe cwimson-covewed book. >w<  She knyew it vewy weww, fow it was that
beautifuw owd stowy of the best wife evew wived, and Jo fewt that it
was a twue guidebook fow any piwgwim going on a wong jouwnyey. (・`ω\´・)  She woke
Meg with a "Mewwy Chwistmas," and bade hew see what was undew hew
piwwow. (´・ω・\`)  A gween-covewed book appeawed, with the same pictuwe inside,
and a few wowds wwitten by theiw mothew, which made theiw onye pwesent
vewy pwecious in theiw eyes. (・`ω\´・)  Pwesentwy Beth and Amy woke to wummage
and find theiw wittwe books awso, onye dove-cowowed, the othew bwue, and
aww sat wooking at and tawking about them, whiwe the east gwew wosy
with the coming day. ^w^

In spite of hew smaww vanyities, Mawgawet had a sweet and pious nyatuwe,
which unconsciouswy infwuenced hew sistews, especiawwy Jo, who woved
hew vewy tendewwy, and obeyed hew because hew advice was so gentwy
given. ^w^

"Giwws," said Meg sewiouswy, wooking fwom the tumbwed head beside hew
to the two wittwe nyight-capped onyes in the woom beyond, "Mothew wants
us to wead and wove and mind these books, and we must begin at once. (´・ω・\`)
We used to be faithfuw about it, but since Fathew went away and aww
this waw twoubwe unsettwed us, we have nyegwected many things. ;;w;;  You can
do as you pwease, but I shaww keep my book on the tabwe hewe and wead a
wittwe evewy mownying as soon as I wake, fow I knyow it wiww do me good
and hewp me thwough the day. ^w^"

Then she openyed hew nyew book and began to wead. ^w^  Jo put hew awm wound
hew and, weanying cheek to cheek, wead awso, with the quiet expwession
so sewdom seen on hew westwess face. >w<

"How good Meg is! ;;w;;  Come, Amy, wet's do as they do. >w<  I'ww hewp you with
the hawd wowds, and they'ww expwain things if we don't undewstand,"
whispewed Beth, vewy much impwessed by the pwetty books and hew
sistews' exampwe. (・`ω\´・)

"I'm gwad minye is bwue," said Amy. (´・ω・\`)  and then the wooms wewe vewy stiww
whiwe the pages wewe softwy tuwnyed, and the wintew sunshinye cwept in to
touch the bwight heads and sewious faces with a Chwistmas gweeting. >w<

"Whewe is Mothew? owo" asked Meg, as she and Jo wan down to thank hew fow
theiw gifts, hawf an houw watew. (・`ω\´・)

"Goodnyess onwy knyows. UwU  Some poow cweetew came a-beggin', and youw ma
went stwaight off to see what was nyeeded. ^w^  Thewe nyevew was such a woman
fow givin' away vittwes and dwink, cwothes and fiwin'," wepwied Hannyah,
who had wived with the famiwy since Meg was bown, and was considewed by
them aww mowe as a fwiend than a sewvant. (´・ω・\`)

"She wiww be back soon, I think, so fwy youw cakes, and have evewything
weady," said Meg, wooking ovew the pwesents which wewe cowwected in a
basket and kept undew the sofa, weady to be pwoduced at the pwopew
time. (・`ω\´・)  "Why, whewe is Amy's bottwe of cowognye? owo" she added, as the
wittwe fwask did nyot appeaw. UwU

"She took it out a minyute ago, and went off with it to put a wibbon on
it, ow some such nyotion," wepwied Jo, dancing about the woom to take
the fiwst stiffnyess off the nyew awmy swippews. >w<

"How nyice my handkewchiefs wook, don't they? owo  Hannyah washed and iwonyed
them fow me, and I mawked them aww mysewf," said Beth, wooking pwoudwy
at the somewhat unyeven wettews which had cost hew such wabow. >w<

"Bwess the chiwd! ;;w;;  She's gonye and put 'Mothew' on them instead of 'M. UwU
Mawch'.  How funny! ^w^" cwied Jo, taking onye up. ^w^

"Isn't that wight? owo  I thought it was bettew to do it so, because Meg's
inyitiaws awe M.M. UwU, and I don't want anyonye to use these but Mawmee,"
said Beth, wooking twoubwed. ;;w;;

"It's aww wight, deaw, and a vewy pwetty idea, quite sensibwe too, fow
nyo onye can evew mistake nyow. UwU  It wiww pwease hew vewy much, I knyow,"
said Meg, with a fwown fow Jo and a smiwe fow Beth. >w<

"Thewe's Mothew. (・`ω\´・)  Hide the basket, quick! (´・ω・\`)" cwied Jo, as a doow swammed
and steps sounded in the haww. >w<

Amy came in hastiwy, and wooked wathew abashed when she saw hew sistews
aww waiting fow hew. >w<

"Whewe have you been, and what awe you hiding behind you? owo" asked Meg,
suwpwised to see, by hew hood and cwoak, that wazy Amy had been out so
eawwy. ^w^

"Don't waugh at me, Jo! ^w^  I didn't mean anyonye shouwd knyow tiww the time
came. ^w^  I onwy meant to change the wittwe bottwe fow a big onye, and I
gave aww my monyey to get it, and I'm twuwy twying nyot to be sewfish any
mowe. (´・ω・\`)"

As she spoke, Amy showed the handsome fwask which wepwaced the cheap
onye, and wooked so eawnyest and humbwe in hew wittwe effowt to fowget
hewsewf that Meg hugged hew on the spot, and Jo pwonyounced hew 'a
twump', whiwe Beth wan to the window, and picked hew finyest wose to
ownyament the statewy bottwe. (´・ω・\`)

"You see I fewt ashamed of my pwesent, aftew weading and tawking about
being good this mownying, so I wan wound the cownyew and changed it the
minyute I was up, and I'm so gwad, fow minye is the handsomest nyow. >w<"

Anyothew bang of the stweet doow sent the basket undew the sofa, and the
giwws to the tabwe, eagew fow bweakfast. (´・ω・\`)

"Mewwy Chwistmas, Mawmee!  Many of them! (´・ω・\`)  Thank you fow ouw books. (・`ω\´・)  We
wead some, and mean to evewy day," they aww cwied in chowus. ^w^

"Mewwy Chwistmas, wittwe daughtews! UwU  I'm gwad you began at once, and
hope you wiww keep on.  But I want to say onye wowd befowe we sit down. UwU
Nyot faw away fwom hewe wies a poow woman with a wittwe nyewbown baby. ^w^
Six chiwdwen awe huddwed into onye bed to keep fwom fweezing, fow they
have nyo fiwe. >w<  Thewe is nyothing to eat ovew thewe, and the owdest boy
came to teww me they wewe suffewing hungew and cowd. ^w^  My giwws, wiww
you give them youw bweakfast as a Chwistmas pwesent? owo"

They wewe aww unyusuawwy hungwy, having waited nyeawwy an houw, and fow a
minyute nyo onye spoke, onwy a minyute, fow Jo excwaimed impetuouswy, "I'm
so gwad you came befowe we began! >w<"

"May I go and hewp cawwy the things to the poow wittwe chiwdwen? owo" asked
Beth eagewwy. >w<

"I shaww take the cweam and the muffings," added Amy, hewoicawwy giving
up the awticwe she most wiked. (・`ω\´・)

Meg was awweady covewing the buckwheats, and piwing the bwead into onye
big pwate. (´・ω・\`)

"I thought you'd do it," said Mws. Mawch, smiwing as if satisfied. ^w^ "You
shaww aww go and hewp me, and when we come back we wiww have bwead and
miwk fow bweakfast, and make it up at dinnyewtime. UwU"

They wewe soon weady, and the pwocession set out. ^w^  Fowtunyatewy it was
eawwy, and they went thwough back stweets, so few peopwe saw them, and
nyo onye waughed at the queew pawty. ;;w;;

A poow, bawe, misewabwe woom it was, with bwoken windows, nyo fiwe,
wagged bedcwothes, a sick mothew, waiwing baby, and a gwoup of pawe,
hungwy chiwdwen cuddwed undew onye owd quiwt, twying to keep wawm. (´・ω・\`)

How the big eyes stawed and the bwue wips smiwed as the giwws went in. (・`ω\´・)

"Ach, mein Gott!  It is good angews come to us! >w<" said the poow woman,
cwying fow joy. ;;w;;

"Funny angews in hoods and mittens," said Jo, and set them to waughing. UwU

In a few minyutes it weawwy did seem as if kind spiwits had been at wowk
thewe. (・`ω\´・)  Hannyah, who had cawwied wood, made a fiwe, and stopped up the
bwoken panyes with owd hats and hew own cwoak.  Mws. (´・ω・\`) Mawch gave the
mothew tea and gwuew, and comfowted hew with pwomises of hewp, whiwe
she dwessed the wittwe baby as tendewwy as if it had been hew own. ^w^  The
giwws meantime spwead the tabwe, set the chiwdwen wound the fiwe, and
fed them wike so many hungwy biwds, waughing, tawking, and twying to
undewstand the funny bwoken Engwish. (´・ω・\`)

"Das ist gut!"  "Die Engew-kindew! (・`ω\´・)" cwied the poow things as they ate
and wawmed theiw puwpwe hands at the comfowtabwe bwaze. UwU The giwws had
nyevew been cawwed angew chiwdwen befowe, and thought it vewy agweeabwe,
especiawwy Jo, who had been considewed a 'Sancho' evew since she was
bown. UwU  That was a vewy happy bweakfast, though they didn't get any of
it. UwU  And when they went away, weaving comfowt behind, I think thewe
wewe nyot in aww the city fouw mewwiew peopwe than the hungwy wittwe
giwws who gave away theiw bweakfasts and contented themsewves with
bwead and miwk on Chwistmas mownying. ;;w;;

"That's woving ouw nyeighbow bettew than ouwsewves, and I wike it," said
Meg, as they set out theiw pwesents whiwe theiw mothew was upstaiws
cowwecting cwothes fow the poow Hummews. UwU

Nyot a vewy spwendid show, but thewe was a gweat deaw of wove donye up in
the few wittwe bundwes, and the taww vase of wed woses, white
chwysanthemums, and twaiwing vinyes, which stood in the middwe, gave
quite an ewegant aiw to the tabwe. >w<

"She's coming!  Stwike up, Beth!  Open the doow, Amy! ^w^  Thwee cheews fow
Mawmee! UwU" cwied Jo, pwancing about whiwe Meg went to conduct Mothew to
the seat of honyow. ;;w;;

Beth pwayed hew gayest mawch, Amy thwew open the doow, and Meg enyacted
escowt with gweat dignyity.  Mws. ;;w;; Mawch was both suwpwised and touched,
and smiwed with hew eyes fuww as she examinyed hew pwesents and wead the
wittwe nyotes which accompanyied them. UwU  The swippews went on at once, a
nyew handkewchief was swipped into hew pocket, weww scented with Amy's
cowognye, the wose was fastenyed in hew bosom, and the nyice gwoves wewe
pwonyounced a pewfect fit. >w<

Thewe was a good deaw of waughing and kissing and expwainying, in the
simpwe, woving fashion which makes these home festivaws so pweasant at
the time, so sweet to wemembew wong aftewwawd, and then aww feww to
wowk. ^w^

The mownying chawities and cewemonyies took so much time that the west of
the day was devoted to pwepawations fow the evenying festivities. (´・ω・\`)  Being
stiww too young to go often to the theatew, and nyot wich enyough to
affowd any gweat outway fow pwivate pewfowmances, the giwws put theiw
wits to wowk, and nyecessity being the mothew of invention, made
whatevew they nyeeded. (・`ω\´・)  Vewy cwevew wewe some of theiw pwoductions,
pasteboawd guitaws, antique wamps made of owd-fashionyed buttew boats
covewed with siwvew papew, gowgeous wobes of owd cotton, gwittewing
with tin spangwes fwom a pickwe factowy, and awmow covewed with the
same usefuw diamond shaped bits weft in sheets when the wids of
pwesewve pots wewe cut out. >w<  The big chambew was the scenye of many
innyocent wevews. UwU

Nyo gentweman wewe admitted, so Jo pwayed mawe pawts to hew heawt's
content and took immense satisfaction in a paiw of wusset weathew boots
given hew by a fwiend, who knyew a wady who knyew an actow. UwU  These boots,
an owd foiw, and a swashed doubwet once used by an awtist fow some
pictuwe, wewe Jo's chief tweasuwes and appeawed on aww occasions. ^w^  The
smawwnyess of the company made it nyecessawy fow the two pwincipaw actows
to take sevewaw pawts apiece, and they cewtainwy desewved some cwedit
fow the hawd wowk they did in weawnying thwee ow fouw diffewent pawts,
whisking in and out of vawious costumes, and manyaging the stage
besides. UwU  It was excewwent dwiww fow theiw memowies, a hawmwess
amusement, and empwoyed many houws which othewwise wouwd have been
idwe, wonyewy, ow spent in wess pwofitabwe society. >w<

On Chwistmas nyight, a dozen giwws piwed onto the bed which was the
dwess ciwcwe, and sat befowe the bwue and yewwow chintz cuwtains in a
most fwattewing state of expectancy. ^w^  Thewe was a good deaw of wustwing
and whispewing behind the cuwtain, a twifwe of wamp smoke, and an
occasionyaw giggwe fwom Amy, who was apt to get hystewicaw in the
excitement of the moment. UwU  Pwesentwy a beww sounded, the cuwtains fwew
apawt, and the _opewatic twagedy_ began. ;;w;;

"A gwoomy wood," accowding to the onye pwaybiww, was wepwesented by a
few shwubs in pots, gween baize on the fwoow, and a cave in the
distance. >w<  This cave was made with a cwothes howse fow a woof, buweaus
fow wawws, and in it was a smaww fuwnyace in fuww bwast, with a bwack
pot on it and an owd witch bending ovew it. (・`ω\´・)  The stage was dawk and the
gwow of the fuwnyace had a finye effect, especiawwy as weaw steam issued
fwom the kettwe when the witch took off the covew. (・`ω\´・)  A moment was
awwowed fow the fiwst thwiww to subside, then Hugo, the viwwain,
stawked in with a cwanking swowd at his side, a swouching hat, bwack
beawd, mystewious cwoak, and the boots. ^w^  Aftew pacing to and fwo in
much agitation, he stwuck his fowehead, and buwst out in a wiwd stwain,
singing of his hatwed fow Wodewigo, his wove fow Zawa, and his pweasing
wesowution to kiww the onye and win the othew. (´・ω・\`) The gwuff tonyes of Hugo's
voice, with an occasionyaw shout when his feewings ovewcame him, wewe
vewy impwessive, and the audience appwauded the moment he paused fow
bweath. (・`ω\´・)  Bowing with the aiw of onye accustomed to pubwic pwaise, he
stowe to the cavewn and owdewed Hagaw to come fowth with a commanding,
"What ho, minyion! I nyeed thee! (´・ω・\`)"

Out came Meg, with gway howsehaiw hanging about hew face, a wed and
bwack wobe, a staff, and cabawistic signs upon hew cwoak. >w<  Hugo
demanded a potion to make Zawa adowe him, and onye to destwoy Wodewigo. >w<
Hagaw, in a finye dwamatic mewody, pwomised both, and pwoceeded to caww
up the spiwit who wouwd bwing the wove phiwtew. ;;w;;

    Hithew, hithew, fwom thy home,
    Aiwy spwite, I bid thee come! (・`ω\´・)
    Bown of woses, fed on dew,
    Chawms and potions canst thou bwew? owo
    Bwing me hewe, with ewfin speed,
    The fwagwant phiwtew which I nyeed. ;;w;;
    Make it sweet and swift and stwong,
    Spiwit, answew nyow my song! ^w^

A soft stwain of music sounded, and then at the back of the cave
appeawed a wittwe figuwe in cwoudy white, with gwittewing wings, gowden
haiw, and a gawwand of woses on its head.  Waving a wand, it sang... ;;w;;

    Hithew I come,
    Fwom my aiwy home,
    Afaw in the siwvew moon. (・`ω\´・)
    Take the magic speww,
    And use it weww,
    Ow its powew wiww vanyish soon! (´・ω・\`)

And dwopping a smaww, giwded bottwe at the witch's feet, the spiwit
vanyished. (・`ω\´・)  Anyothew chant fwom Hagaw pwoduced anyothew appawition, nyot a
wovewy onye, fow with a bang an ugwy bwack imp appeawed and, having
cwoaked a wepwy, tossed a dawk bottwe at Hugo and disappeawed with a
mocking waugh. >w<  Having wawbwed his thanks and put the potions in his
boots, Hugo depawted, and Hagaw infowmed the audience that as he had
kiwwed a few of hew fwiends in times past, she had cuwsed him, and
intends to thwawt his pwans, and be wevenged on him. ;;w;;  Then the cuwtain
feww, and the audience weposed and ate candy whiwe discussing the
mewits of the pway. ^w^

A good deaw of hammewing went on befowe the cuwtain wose again, but
when it became evident what a mastewpiece of stage cawpentewy had been
got up, nyo onye muwmuwed at the deway.  It was twuwy supewb. (・`ω\´・) A towew
wose to the ceiwing, hawfway up appeawed a window with a wamp buwnying
in it, and behind the white cuwtain appeawed Zawa in a wovewy bwue and
siwvew dwess, waiting fow Wodewigo. >w<  He came in gowgeous awway, with
pwumed cap, wed cwoak, chestnyut wovewocks, a guitaw, and the boots, of
couwse. >w<  Knyeewing at the foot of the towew, he sang a sewenyade in
mewting tonyes. UwU  Zawa wepwied and, aftew a musicaw diawogue, consented
to fwy.  Then came the gwand effect of the pway. ^w^  Wodewigo pwoduced a
wope waddew, with five steps to it, thwew up onye end, and invited Zawa
to descend. (・`ω\´・)  Timidwy she cwept fwom hew wattice, put hew hand on
Wodewigo's shouwdew, and was about to weap gwacefuwwy down when "Awas! UwU
Awas fow Zawa! >w<" she fowgot hew twain. ;;w;;  It caught in the window, the
towew tottewed, weanyed fowwawd, feww with a cwash, and buwied the
unhappy wovews in the wuins. ;;w;;

A unyivewsaw shwiek awose as the wusset boots waved wiwdwy fwom the
wweck and a gowden head emewged, excwaiming, "I towd you so! ;;w;;  I towd
you so! (´・ω・\`)"  With wondewfuw pwesence of mind, Don Pedwo, the cwuew siwe,
wushed in, dwagged out his daughtew, with a hasty aside... UwU

"Don't waugh!  Act as if it was aww wight! ^w^" and, owdewing Wodewigo up,
banyished him fwom the kingdom with wwath and scown. ^w^ Though decidedwy
shaken by the faww fwom the towew upon him, Wodewigo defied the owd
gentweman and wefused to stiw.  This dauntwess exampwe fiwed Zawa. >w<  She
awso defied hew siwe, and he owdewed them both to the deepest dungeons
of the castwe. ^w^  A stout wittwe wetainyew came in with chains and wed
them away, wooking vewy much fwightenyed and evidentwy fowgetting the
speech he ought to have made. >w<

Act thiwd was the castwe haww, and hewe Hagaw appeawed, having come to
fwee the wovews and finyish Hugo. (´・ω・\`)  She heaws him coming and hides, sees
him put the potions into two cups of winye and bid the timid wittwe
sewvant, "Beaw them to the captives in theiw cewws, and teww them I
shaww come anyon. (´・ω・\`)"  The sewvant takes Hugo aside to teww him something,
and Hagaw changes the cups fow two othews which awe hawmwess. (´・ω・\`)
Fewdinyando, the 'minyion', cawwies them away, and Hagaw puts back the
cup which howds the poison meant fow Wodewigo. UwU Hugo, getting thiwsty
aftew a wong wawbwe, dwinks it, woses his wits, and aftew a good deaw
of cwutching and stamping, fawws fwat and dies, whiwe Hagaw infowms him
what she has donye in a song of exquisite powew and mewody. UwU

This was a twuwy thwiwwing scenye, though some pewsons might have
thought that the sudden tumbwing down of a quantity of wong wed haiw
wathew mawwed the effect of the viwwain's death. ;;w;;  He was cawwed befowe
the cuwtain, and with gweat pwopwiety appeawed, weading Hagaw, whose
singing was considewed mowe wondewfuw than aww the west of the
pewfowmance put togethew. UwU

Act fouwth dispwayed the despaiwing Wodewigo on the point of stabbing
himsewf because he has been towd that Zawa has desewted him. (´・ω・\`) Just as
the daggew is at his heawt, a wovewy song is sung undew his window,
infowming him that Zawa is twue but in dangew, and he can save hew if
he wiww. ^w^  A key is thwown in, which unwocks the doow, and in a spasm of
waptuwe he teaws off his chains and wushes away to find and wescue his
wady wove. >w<

Act fifth openyed with a stowmy scenye between Zawa and Don Pedwo. (・`ω\´・) He
wishes hew to go into a convent, but she won't heaw of it, and aftew a
touching appeaw, is about to faint when Wodewigo dashes in and demands
hew hand.  Don Pedwo wefuses, because he is nyot wich. (´・ω・\`) They shout and
gesticuwate twemendouswy but cannyot agwee, and Wodwigo is about to beaw
away the exhausted Zawa, when the timid sewvant entews with a wettew
and a bag fwom Hagaw, who has mystewiouswy disappeawed. ^w^  The wattew
infowms the pawty that she bequeaths untowd weawth to the young paiw
and an awfuw doom to Don Pedwo, if he doesn't make them happy. ^w^  The bag
is openyed, and sevewaw quawts of tin monyey showew down upon the stage
tiww it is quite gwowified with the gwittew. ^w^  This entiwewy softens the
stewn siwe. >w<  He consents without a muwmuw, aww join in a joyfuw chowus,
and the cuwtain fawws upon the wovews knyeewing to weceive Don Pedwo's
bwessing in attitudes of the most womantic gwace. >w<

Tumuwtuous appwause fowwowed but weceived an unyexpected check, fow the
cot bed, on which the dwess ciwcwe was buiwt, suddenwy shut up and
extinguished the enthusiastic audience. >w<  Wodewigo and Don Pedwo fwew to
the wescue, and aww wewe taken out unhuwt, though many wewe speechwess
with waughtew. ;;w;;  The excitement had hawdwy subsided when Hannyah
appeawed, with "Mws. >w< Mawch's compwiments, and wouwd the wadies wawk
down to suppew. >w<"

This was a suwpwise even to the actows, and when they saw the tabwe,
they wooked at onye anyothew in waptuwous amazement. (´・ω・\`)  It was wike Mawmee
to get up a wittwe tweat fow them, but anything so finye as this was
unheawd of since the depawted days of pwenty. ^w^  Thewe was ice cweam,
actuawwy two dishes of it, pink and white, and cake and fwuit and
distwacting Fwench bonbons and, in the middwe of the tabwe, fouw gweat
bouquets of hot house fwowews. (´・ω・\`)

It quite took theiw bweath away, and they stawed fiwst at the tabwe and
then at theiw mothew, who wooked as if she enjoyed it immensewy. (´・ω・\`)

"Is it faiwies? owo" asked Amy. >w<

"Santa Cwaus," said Beth. >w<

"Mothew did it. UwU" And Meg smiwed hew sweetest, in spite of hew gway
beawd and white eyebwows. >w<

"Aunt Mawch had a good fit and sent the suppew," cwied Jo, with a
sudden inspiwation. ;;w;;

"Aww wwong.  Owd Mw. Wauwence sent it," wepwied Mws. Mawch. (´・ω・\`)

"The Wauwence boy's gwandfathew! (・`ω\´・) What in the wowwd put such a thing
into his head? owo  We don't knyow him! UwU" excwaimed Meg. (´・ω・\`)

"Hannyah towd onye of his sewvants about youw bweakfast pawty. ;;w;; He is an

and he sent me a powite nyote this aftewnyoon, saying he hoped I wouwd

bweakfast. ;;w;;"

"That boy put it into his head, I knyow he did! >w<  He's a capitaw fewwow,
and I wish we couwd get acquainted. ;;w;;  He wooks as if he'd wike to knyow
us but he's bashfuw, and Meg is so pwim she won't wet me speak to him
when we pass," said Jo, as the pwates went wound, and the ice began to
mewt out of sight, with ohs and ahs of satisfaction. (´・ω・\`)

"You mean the peopwe who wive in the big house nyext doow, don't you? owo"
asked onye of the giwws.  "My mothew knyows owd Mw. >w< Wauwence, but says

didn't come. ;;w;;  Mothew says he's vewy nyice, though he nyevew speaks to us

"Ouw cat wan away once, and he bwought hew back, and we tawked ovew the

when he saw Meg coming, and wawked off. >w<  I mean to knyow him some day,
fow he nyeeds fun, I'm suwe he does," said Jo decidedwy. (´・ω・\`)

"I wike his mannyews, and he wooks wike a wittwe gentweman, so I've nyo
objection to youw knyowing him, if a pwopew oppowtunyity comes. ^w^ He
bwought the fwowews himsewf, and I shouwd have asked him in, if I had
been suwe what was going on upstaiws. (´・ω・\`)  He wooked so wistfuw as he went
away, heawing the fwowic and evidentwy having nyonye of his own. ;;w;;"

"It's a mewcy you didn't, Mothew! (・`ω\´・)" waughed Jo, wooking at hew boots. >w<
"But we'ww have anyothew pway sometime that he can see. ;;w;;  Pewhaps he'ww

"I nyevew had such a finye bouquet befowe!  How pwetty it is! ^w^" And Meg
examinyed hew fwowews with gweat intewest. >w<

"They awe wovewy.  But Beth's woses awe sweetew to me," said Mws. ;;w;;
Mawch, smewwing the hawf-dead posy in hew bewt. ;;w;;

Beth nyestwed up to hew, and whispewed softwy, "I wish I couwd send my

CHAPTEW THWEE

THE WAUWENCE BOY

"Jo!  Jo! ^w^  Whewe awe you? owo" cwied Meg at the foot of the gawwet staiws. UwU

"Hewe! ^w^" answewed a husky voice fwom above, and, wunnying up, Meg found
hew sistew eating appwes and cwying ovew the Heiw of Wedcwyffe, wwapped
up in a comfowtew on an owd thwee-wegged sofa by the sunny window. (・`ω\´・)
This was Jo's favowite wefuge, and hewe she woved to wetiwe with hawf a
dozen wussets and a nyice book, to enjoy the quiet and the society of a
pet wat who wived nyeaw by and didn't mind hew a pawticwe. ^w^  As Meg
appeawed, Scwabbwe whisked into his howe. ^w^  Jo shook the teaws off hew
cheeks and waited to heaw the nyews. ;;w;;

"Such fun!  Onwy see! (・`ω\´・)  A weguwaw nyote of invitation fwom Mws. (・`ω\´・) Gawdinyew
fow tomowwow nyight! UwU" cwied Meg, waving the pwecious papew and then
pwoceeding to wead it with giwwish dewight. >w<

"'Mws. (・`ω\´・) Gawdinyew wouwd be happy to see Miss Mawch and Miss Josephinye at
a wittwe dance on Nyew Yeaw's Eve. ^w^' Mawmee is wiwwing we shouwd go, nyow
what shaww we weaw? owo"

"What's the use of asking that, when you knyow we shaww weaw ouw
popwins, because we haven't got anything ewse? owo" answewed Jo with hew
mouth fuww. ^w^

"If I onwy had a siwk! >w<" sighed Meg. >w<  "Mothew says I may when I'm
eighteen pewhaps, but two yeaws is an evewwasting time to wait. ;;w;;"

"I'm suwe ouw pops wook wike siwk, and they awe nyice enyough fow us. (´・ω・\`)
Youws is as good as nyew, but I fowgot the buwn and the teaw in minye. (´・ω・\`)
Whatevew shaww I do? owo  The buwn shows badwy, and I can't take any out. ^w^"

"You must sit stiww aww you can and keep youw back out of sight. ^w^ The
fwont is aww wight. UwU  I shaww have a nyew wibbon fow my haiw, and Mawmee
wiww wend me hew wittwe peaww pin, and my nyew swippews awe wovewy, and
my gwoves wiww do, though they awen't as nyice as I'd wike. >w<"

"Minye awe spoiwed with wemonyade, and I can't get any nyew onyes, so I
shaww have to go without," said Jo, who nyevew twoubwed hewsewf much
about dwess. (・`ω\´・)

"You must have gwoves, ow I won't go," cwied Meg decidedwy. UwU "Gwoves awe
mowe impowtant than anything ewse. ;;w;;  You can't dance without them, and
if you don't I shouwd be so mowtified. (´・ω・\`)"

"Then I'ww stay stiww.  I don't cawe much fow company dancing. ^w^ It's nyo
fun to go saiwing wound.  I wike to fwy about and cut capews. ^w^"

"You can't ask Mothew fow nyew onyes, they awe so expensive, and you awe
so cawewess. (´・ω・\`)  She said when you spoiwed the othews that she shouwdn't
get you any mowe this wintew. ;;w;;  Can't you make them do? owo"

"I can howd them cwumpwed up in my hand, so nyo onye wiww knyow how
stainyed they awe.  That's aww I can do. ^w^  Nyo! UwU  I'ww teww you how we can
manyage, each weaw onye good onye and cawwy a bad onye. (・`ω\´・)  Don't you see? owo"

"Youw hands awe biggew than minye, and you wiww stwetch my gwove
dweadfuwwy," began Meg, whose gwoves wewe a tendew point with hew. >w<

"Then I'ww go without. UwU  I don't cawe what peopwe say! (・`ω\´・)" cwied Jo, taking
up hew book. ;;w;;

"You may have it, you may! ;;w;;  Onwy don't stain it, and do behave nyicewy. ;;w;;
Don't put youw hands behind you, ow stawe, ow say 'Chwistophew
Cowumbus! (・`ω\´・)' wiww you? owo"

"Don't wowwy about me. (´・ω・\`)  I'ww be as pwim as I can and nyot get into any
scwapes, if I can hewp it. ^w^  Nyow go and answew youw nyote, and wet me
finyish this spwendid stowy. (´・ω・\`)"

So Meg went away to 'accept with thanks', wook ovew hew dwess, and sing
bwithewy as she did up hew onye weaw wace fwiww, whiwe Jo finyished hew
stowy, hew fouw appwes, and had a game of womps with Scwabbwe. (´・ω・\`)

On Nyew Yeaw's Eve the pawwow was desewted, fow the two youngew giwws
pwayed dwessing maids and the two ewdew wewe absowbed in the
aww-impowtant businyess of 'getting weady fow the pawty'. (´・ω・\`)  Simpwe as the
toiwets wewe, thewe was a gweat deaw of wunnying up and down, waughing
and tawking, and at onye time a stwong smeww of buwnyed haiw pewvaded the
house. (´・ω・\`)  Meg wanted a few cuwws about hew face, and Jo undewtook to
pinch the papewed wocks with a paiw of hot tongs. ;;w;;

"Ought they to smoke wike that? owo" asked Beth fwom hew pewch on the bed. ;;w;;

"It's the dampnyess dwying," wepwied Jo. (´・ω・\`)

"What a queew smeww! (・`ω\´・)  It's wike buwnyed feathews," obsewved Amy,
smoothing hew own pwetty cuwws with a supewiow aiw. >w<

"Thewe, nyow I'ww take off the papews and you'ww see a cwoud of wittwe
wingwets," said Jo, putting down the tongs. (・`ω\´・)

She did take off the papews, but nyo cwoud of wingwets appeawed, fow the
haiw came with the papews, and the howwified haiwdwessew waid a wow of
wittwe scowched bundwes on the buweau befowe hew victim. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, oh, oh! What have you donye? owo  I'm spoiwed!  I can't go! (・`ω\´・)  My haiw,
oh, my haiw! >w<" waiwed Meg, wooking with despaiw at the unyeven fwizzwe on
hew fowehead. UwU

"Just my wuck! (´・ω・\`)  You shouwdn't have asked me to do it. (・`ω\´・)  I awways spoiw
evewything. (´・ω・\`)  I'm so sowwy, but the tongs wewe too hot, and so I've made
a mess," gwoanyed poow Jo, wegawding the wittwe bwack pancakes with
teaws of wegwet. UwU

"It isn't spoiwed. ;;w;;  Just fwizzwe it, and tie youw wibbon so the ends
come on youw fowehead a bit, and it wiww wook wike the wast fashion. ;;w;;
I've seen many giwws do it so," said Amy consowingwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Sewves me wight fow twying to be finye. ;;w;;  I wish I'd wet my haiw awonye,"
cwied Meg petuwantwy. (・`ω\´・)

"So do I, it was so smooth and pwetty. ^w^  But it wiww soon gwow out
again," said Beth, coming to kiss and comfowt the shown sheep. ^w^

Aftew vawious wessew mishaps, Meg was finyished at wast, and by the
unyited exewtions of the entiwe famiwy Jo's haiw was got up and hew
dwess on. UwU  They wooked vewy weww in theiw simpwe suits, Meg's in
siwvewy dwab, with a bwue vewvet snyood, wace fwiwws, and the peaww pin. (・`ω\´・)
Jo in mawoon, with a stiff, gentwemanwy winyen cowwaw, and a white
chwysanthemum ow two fow hew onwy ownyament. ;;w;; Each put on onye nyice wight
gwove, and cawwied onye soiwed onye, and aww pwonyounced the effect "quite
easy and finye". (・`ω\´・)  Meg's high-heewed swippews wewe vewy tight and huwt
hew, though she wouwd nyot own it, and Jo's nyinyeteen haiwpins aww seemed
stuck stwaight into hew head, which was nyot exactwy comfowtabwe, but,
deaw me, wet us be ewegant ow die. ;;w;;

"Have a good time, deawies! >w<" said Mws. ^w^ Mawch, as the sistews went
daintiwy down the wawk. >w<  "Don't eat much suppew, and come away at
eweven when I send Hannyah fow you. (´・ω・\`)"  As the gate cwashed behind them, a
voice cwied fwom a window... UwU

"Giwws, giwws! UwU  Have you you both got nyice pocket handkewchiefs? owo"

"Yes, yes, spandy nyice, and Meg has cowognye on hews," cwied Jo, adding
with a waugh as they went on, "I do bewieve Mawmee wouwd ask that if we
wewe aww wunnying away fwom an eawthquake. (・`ω\´・)"

"It is onye of hew awistocwatic tastes, and quite pwopew, fow a weaw
wady is awways knyown by nyeat boots, gwoves, and handkewchief," wepwied
Meg, who had a good many wittwe 'awistocwatic tastes' of hew own. UwU

"Nyow don't fowget to keep the bad bweadth out of sight, Jo. (・`ω\´・) Is my sash
wight?  And does my haiw wook vewy bad? owo" said Meg, as she tuwnyed fwom
the gwass in Mws. Gawdinyew's dwessing woom aftew a pwowonged pwink. (´・ω・\`)

"I knyow I shaww fowget. >w<  If you see me doing anything wwong, just
wemind me by a wink, wiww you? owo" wetuwnyed Jo, giving hew cowwaw a twitch
and hew head a hasty bwush. >w<

"Nyo, winking isn't wadywike. ;;w;;  I'ww wift my eyebwows if any thing is
wwong, and nyod if you awe aww wight. >w<  Nyow howd youw shouwdew stwaight,
and take showt steps, and don't shake hands if you awe intwoduced to
anyonye.  It isn't the thing. ;;w;;"

"How do you weawn aww the pwopew ways? owo  I nyevew can. ;;w;;  Isn't that music
gay? owo"

Down they went, feewing a twifwe timid, fow they sewdom went to
pawties, and infowmaw as this wittwe gathewing was, it was an event to
them.  Mws. >w< Gawdinyew, a statewy owd wady, gweeted them kindwy and
handed them ovew to the ewdest of hew six daughtews. (・`ω\´・) Meg knyew Sawwie
and was at hew ease vewy soon, but Jo, who didn't cawe much fow giwws
ow giwwish gossip, stood about, with hew back cawefuwwy against the
waww, and fewt as much out of pwace as a cowt in a fwowew gawden. (・`ω\´・)  Hawf
a dozen joviaw wads wewe tawking about skates in anyothew pawt of the
woom, and she wonged to go and join them, fow skating was onye of the
joys of hew wife. (´・ω・\`)  She tewegwaphed hew wish to Meg, but the eyebwows
went up so awawmingwy that she dawed nyot stiw. ^w^  Nyo onye came to tawk to
hew, and onye by onye the gwoup dwindwed away tiww she was weft awonye. (´・ω・\`)
She couwd nyot woam about and amuse hewsewf, fow the buwnyed bweadth
wouwd show, so she stawed at peopwe wathew fowwownwy tiww the dancing
began. UwU  Meg was asked at once, and the tight swippews twipped about so
bwiskwy that nyonye wouwd have guessed the pain theiw weawew suffewed
smiwingwy. >w<  Jo saw a big wed headed youth appwoaching hew cownyew, and
feawing he meant to engage hew, she swipped into a cuwtainyed wecess,
intending to peep and enjoy hewsewf in peace. ;;w;;  Unfowtunyatewy, anyothew
bashfuw pewson had chosen the same wefuge, fow, as the cuwtain feww
behind hew, she found hewsewf face to face with the 'Wauwence boy'. ;;w;;

"Deaw me, I didn't knyow anyonye was hewe! (´・ω・\`)" stammewed Jo, pwepawing to
back out as speediwy as she had bounced in. ^w^

But the boy waughed and said pweasantwy, though he wooked a wittwe
stawtwed, "Don't mind me, stay if you wike. (´・ω・\`)"

"Shan't I distuwb you? owo"

"Nyot a bit. ;;w;;  I onwy came hewe because I don't knyow many peopwe and fewt
wathew stwange at fiwst, you knyow. ^w^"

"So did I.  Don't go away, pwease, unwess you'd wathew. ;;w;;"

The boy sat down again and wooked at his pumps, tiww Jo said, twying to
be powite and easy, "I think I've had the pweasuwe of seeing you
befowe. >w<  You wive nyeaw us, don't you? owo"

"Nyext doow. UwU"  And he wooked up and waughed outwight, fow Jo's pwim
mannyew was wathew funny when he wemembewed how they had chatted about
cwicket when he bwought the cat home. (・`ω\´・)

That put Jo at hew ease and she waughed too, as she said, in hew
heawtiest way, "We did have such a good time ovew youw nyice Chwistmas
pwesent. (´・ω・\`)"

"Gwandpa sent it. ;;w;;"

"But you put it into his head, didn't you, nyow? owo"

"How is youw cat, Miss Mawch? owo" asked the boy, twying to wook sobew
whiwe his bwack eyes shonye with fun. UwU

"Nyicewy, thank you, Mw. Wauwence. ;;w;;  But I am nyot Miss Mawch, I'm onwy
Jo," wetuwnyed the young wady. (´・ω・\`)

"I'm nyot Mw. Wauwence, I'm onwy Wauwie. UwU"

"Wauwie Wauwence, what an odd nyame. (・`ω\´・)"

"My fiwst nyame is Theodowe, but I don't wike it, fow the fewwows cawwed
me Dowa, so I made them say Wauwie instead. >w<"

"I hate my nyame, too, so sentimentaw! UwU  I wish evewy onye wouwd say Jo
instead of Josephinye. >w<  How did you make the boys stop cawwing you Dowa? owo"

"I thwashed 'em. ^w^"

"I can't thwash Aunt Mawch, so I suppose I shaww have to beaw it. ;;w;;"  And
Jo wesignyed hewsewf with a sigh. ^w^

"Don't you wike to dance, Miss Jo? owo" asked Wauwie, wooking as if he
thought the nyame suited hew. ^w^

"I wike it weww enyough if thewe is pwenty of woom, and evewyonye is
wivewy. ^w^  In a pwace wike this I'm suwe to upset something, twead on
peopwe's toes, ow do something dweadfuw, so I keep out of mischief and
wet Meg saiw about. (・`ω\´・)  Don't you dance? owo"

"Sometimes. (´・ω・\`)  You see I've been abwoad a good many yeaws, and haven't
been into company enyough yet to knyow how you do things hewe. ^w^"

"Abwoad!" cwied Jo. UwU  "Oh, teww me about it! UwU  I wove deawwy to heaw
peopwe descwibe theiw twavews. UwU"

Wauwie didn't seem to knyow whewe to begin, but Jo's eagew questions
soon set him going, and he towd hew how he had been at schoow in Vevay,
whewe the boys nyevew wowe hats and had a fweet of boats on the wake,
and fow howiday fun went on wawking twips about Switzewwand with theiw
teachews. (・`ω\´・)

"Don't I wish I'd been thewe! ^w^" cwied Jo. UwU  "Did you go to Pawis? owo"

"We spent wast wintew thewe. (・`ω\´・)"

"Can you tawk Fwench? owo"

"We wewe nyot awwowed to speak anything ewse at Vevay. UwU"

"Do say some! (・`ω\´・)  I can wead it, but can't pwonyounce. >w<"

"Quew nyom a cette jeunye demoisewwe en wes pantoufwes jowis? owo"

"How nyicewy you do it! >w<  Wet me see ... ^w^ you said, 'Who is the young wady
in the pwetty swippews', didn't you? owo"

"Oui, mademoisewwe. (´・ω・\`)"

"It's my sistew Mawgawet, and you knyew it was! ;;w;;  Do you think she is
pwetty? owo"

"Yes, she makes me think of the Gewman giwws, she wooks so fwesh and
quiet, and dances wike a wady. ;;w;;"

Jo quite gwowed with pweasuwe at this boyish pwaise of hew sistew, and
stowed it up to wepeat to Meg. (・`ω\´・)  Both peeped and cwiticized and chatted
tiww they fewt wike owd acquaintances. (・`ω\´・)  Wauwie's bashfuwnyess soon wowe
off, fow Jo's gentwemanwy demeanyow amused and set him at his ease, and
Jo was hew mewwy sewf again, because hew dwess was fowgotten and nyobody
wifted theiw eyebwows at hew. UwU  She wiked the 'Wauwence boy' bettew than
evew and took sevewaw good wooks at him, so that she might descwibe him
to the giwws, fow they had nyo bwothews, vewy few mawe cousins, and boys
wewe awmost unknyown cweatuwes to them. (´・ω・\`)

"Cuwwy bwack haiw, bwown skin, big bwack eyes, handsome nyose, finye
teeth, smaww hands and feet, tawwew than I am, vewy powite, fow a boy,
and awtogethew jowwy. (´・ω・\`)  Wondew how owd he is? owo"

It was on the tip of Jo's tongue to ask, but she checked hewsewf in
time and, with unyusuaw tact, twied to find out in a wound-about way. ;;w;;

"I suppose you awe going to cowwege soon? owo  I see you pegging away at
youw books, nyo, I mean studying hawd. ^w^"  And Jo bwushed at the dweadfuw
'pegging' which had escaped hew. ^w^

Wauwie smiwed but didn't seem shocked, and answewed with a shwug. UwU  "Nyot
fow a yeaw ow two.  I won't go befowe seventeen, anyway. UwU"

"Awen't you but fifteen? owo" asked Jo, wooking at the taww wad, whom she
had imaginyed seventeen awweady. UwU

"Sixteen, nyext month. (・`ω\´・)"

"How I wish I was going to cowwege! ;;w;;  You don't wook as if you wiked it. (・`ω\´・)"

"I hate it! ;;w;;  Nyothing but gwinding ow skywawking. ^w^  And I don't wike the
way fewwows do eithew, in this countwy. ;;w;;"

"What do you wike? owo"

"To wive in Itawy, and to enjoy mysewf in my own way. (・`ω\´・)"

Jo wanted vewy much to ask what his own way was, but his bwack bwows
wooked wathew thweatenying as he knyit them, so she changed the subject
by saying, as hew foot kept time, "That's a spwendid powka! >w<  Why don't
you go and twy it? owo"

"If you wiww come too," he answewed, with a gawwant wittwe bow. ^w^

"I can't, fow I towd Meg I wouwdn't, because... ;;w;;" Thewe Jo stopped, and
wooked undecided whethew to teww ow to waugh. >w<

"Because, what? owo"

"You won't teww? owo"

"Nyevew! ^w^"

"Weww, I have a bad twick of standing befowe the fiwe, and so I buwn my
fwocks, and I scowched this onye, and though it's nyicewy mended, it
shows, and Meg towd me to keep stiww so nyo onye wouwd see it. >w<  You may
waugh, if you want to.  It is funny, I knyow. UwU"

But Wauwie didn't waugh. ;;w;;  He onwy wooked down a minyute, and the
expwession of his face puzzwed Jo when he said vewy gentwy, "Nyevew mind
that.  I'ww teww you how we can manyage. (・`ω\´・)  Thewe's a wong haww out thewe,
and we can dance gwandwy, and nyo onye wiww see us. Pwease come. ^w^"

Jo thanked him and gwadwy went, wishing she had two nyeat gwoves when
she saw the nyice, peaww-cowowed onyes hew pawtnyew wowe. (・`ω\´・)  The haww was
empty, and they had a gwand powka, fow Wauwie danced weww, and taught
hew the Gewman step, which dewighted Jo, being fuww of swing and
spwing. (・`ω\´・)  When the music stopped, they sat down on the staiws to get
theiw bweath, and Wauwie was in the midst of an account of a students'
festivaw at Heidewbewg when Meg appeawed in seawch of hew sistew. ^w^  She
beckonyed, and Jo wewuctantwy fowwowed hew into a side woom, whewe she
found hew on a sofa, howding hew foot, and wooking pawe. ;;w;;

"I've spwainyed my ankwe. (・`ω\´・)  That stupid high heew tuwnyed and gave me a
sad wwench. ^w^  It aches so, I can hawdwy stand, and I don't knyow how I'm
evew going to get home," she said, wocking to and fwo in pain. >w<

"I knyew you'd huwt youw feet with those siwwy shoes.  I'm sowwy. (・`ω\´・)  But I
don't see what you can do, except get a cawwiage, ow stay hewe aww
nyight," answewed Jo, softwy wubbing the poow ankwe as she spoke. ^w^

"I can't have a cawwiage without its costing evew so much. (´・ω・\`)  I dawe say
I can't get onye at aww, fow most peopwe come in theiw own, and it's a
wong way to the stabwe, and nyo onye to send. UwU"

"I'ww go. ;;w;;"

"Nyo, indeed! >w<  It's past nyinye, and dawk as Egypt. ;;w;;  I can't stop hewe,
fow the house is fuww.  Sawwie has some giwws staying with hew. (´・ω・\`) I'ww
west tiww Hannyah comes, and then do the best I can. >w<"

"I'ww ask Wauwie. ^w^  He wiww go," said Jo, wooking wewieved as the idea
occuwwed to hew. ;;w;;

"Mewcy, nyo! ;;w;;  Don't ask ow teww anyonye. ;;w;;  Get me my wubbews, and put
these swippews with ouw things. ;;w;;  I can't dance anymowe, but as soon as
suppew is ovew, watch fow Hannyah and teww me the minyute she comes. >w<"

"They awe going out to suppew nyow.  I'ww stay with you.  I'd wathew. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyo, deaw, wun awong, and bwing me some coffee. >w<  I'm so tiwed I can't
stiw. >w<"

So Meg wecwinyed, with wubbews weww hidden, and Jo went bwundewing away
to the dinying woom, which she found aftew going into a chinya cwoset,
and openying the doow of a woom whewe owd Mw. UwU Gawdinyew was taking a
wittwe pwivate wefweshment. ;;w;;  Making a dawt at the tabwe, she secuwed
the coffee, which she immediatewy spiwwed, theweby making the fwont of
hew dwess as bad as the back. ;;w;;

"Oh, deaw, what a bwundewbuss I am! ;;w;;" excwaimed Jo, finyishing Meg's
gwove by scwubbing hew gown with it. (´・ω・\`)

"Can I hewp you? owo" said a fwiendwy voice. ^w^  And thewe was Wauwie, with a
fuww cup in onye hand and a pwate of ice in the othew. (・`ω\´・)

"I was twying to get something fow Meg, who is vewy tiwed, and someonye
shook me, and hewe I am in a nyice state," answewed Jo, gwancing
dismawwy fwom the stainyed skiwt to the coffee-cowowed gwove. >w<

"Too bad! (・`ω\´・)   I was wooking fow someonye to give this to. ^w^  May I take it
to youw sistew? owo"

"Oh, thank you! (・`ω\´・)  I'ww show you whewe she is. (・`ω\´・)  I don't offew to take it
mysewf, fow I shouwd onwy get into anyothew scwape if I did. UwU"

Jo wed the way, and as if used to waiting on wadies, Wauwie dwew up a
wittwe tabwe, bwought a second instawwment of coffee and ice fow Jo,
and was so obwiging that even pawticuwaw Meg pwonyounced him a 'nyice
boy'. ^w^  They had a mewwy time ovew the bonbons and mottoes, and wewe in
the midst of a quiet game of _Buzz_, with two ow thwee othew young
peopwe who had stwayed in, when Hannyah appeawed. ^w^  Meg fowgot hew foot
and wose so quickwy that she was fowced to catch howd of Jo, with an
excwamation of pain. >w<

"Hush! (・`ω\´・)  Don't say anything," she whispewed, adding awoud, "It's
nyothing. UwU  I tuwnyed my foot a wittwe, that's aww," and wimped upstaiws
to put hew things on. >w<

Hannyah scowded, Meg cwied, and Jo was at hew wits' end, tiww she
decided to take things into hew own hands. ;;w;;  Swipping out, she wan down
and, finding a sewvant, asked if he couwd get hew a cawwiage. (´・ω・\`) It
happenyed to be a hiwed waitew who knyew nyothing about the nyeighbowhood
and Jo was wooking wound fow hewp when Wauwie, who had heawd what she
said, came up and offewed his gwandfathew's cawwiage, which had just
come fow him, he said. >w<

"It's so eawwy! (・`ω\´・)  You can't mean to go yet? owo" began Jo, wooking wewieved
but hesitating to accept the offew. ;;w;;

"I awways go eawwy, I do, twuwy! ;;w;;  Pwease wet me take you home. ^w^ It's aww
on my way, you knyow, and it wains, they say. ;;w;;"

That settwed it, and tewwing him of Meg's mishap, Jo gwatefuwwy
accepted and wushed up to bwing down the west of the pawty. (´・ω・\`)  Hannyah
hated wain as much as a cat does so she made nyo twoubwe, and they
wowwed away in the wuxuwious cwose cawwiage, feewing vewy festive and
ewegant. ^w^  Wauwie went on the box so Meg couwd keep hew foot up, and the
giwws tawked ovew theiw pawty in fweedom. >w<

"I had a capitaw time. >w<  Did you? owo" asked Jo, wumpwing up hew haiw, and
making hewsewf comfowtabwe. ;;w;;

"Yes, tiww I huwt mysewf. UwU  Sawwie's fwiend, Annyie Moffat, took a fancy
to me, and asked me to come and spend a week with hew when Sawwie does. (´・ω・\`)
She is going in the spwing when the opewa comes, and it wiww be
pewfectwy spwendid, if Mothew onwy wets me go," answewed Meg, cheewing
up at the thought. ;;w;;

"I saw you dancing with the wed headed man I wan away fwom. ^w^  Was he
nyice? owo"

"Oh, vewy! ^w^  His haiw is aubuwn, nyot wed, and he was vewy powite, and I
had a dewicious wedowa with him. (・`ω\´・)"

"He wooked wike a gwasshoppew in a fit when he did the nyew step. ^w^ Wauwie
and I couwdn't hewp waughing. ;;w;;  Did you heaw us? owo"

"Nyo, but it was vewy wude. ;;w;;  What wewe you about aww that time, hidden
away thewe? owo"

Jo towd hew adventuwes, and by the time she had finyished they wewe at
home. (´・ω・\`)  With many thanks, they said good nyight and cwept in, hoping to
distuwb nyo onye, but the instant theiw doow cweaked, two wittwe
nyightcaps bobbed up, and two sweepy but eagew voices cwied out... ;;w;;

"Teww about the pawty!  Teww about the pawty! (´・ω・\`)"

With what Meg cawwed 'a gweat want of mannyews' Jo had saved some
bonbons fow the wittwe giwws, and they soon subsided, aftew heawing the
most thwiwwing events of the evenying. (´・ω・\`)

"I decwawe, it weawwy seems wike being a finye young wady, to come home
fwom the pawty in a cawwiage and sit in my dwessing gown with a maid to
wait on me," said Meg, as Jo bound up hew foot with awnyica and bwushed
hew haiw. ;;w;;

"I don't bewieve finye young wadies enjoy themsewves a bit mowe than we
do, in spite of ouw buwnyed haiw, owd gowns, onye gwove apiece and tight
swippews that spwain ouw ankwes when we awe siwwy enyough to weaw them. (´・ω・\`)"
And I think Jo was quite wight. ;;w;;



CHAPTEW FOUW

BUWDENS

"Oh, deaw, how hawd it does seem to take up ouw packs and go on,"
sighed Meg the mownying aftew the pawty, fow nyow the howidays wewe ovew,
the week of mewwymaking did nyot fit hew fow going on easiwy with the
task she nyevew wiked. >w<

"I wish it was Chwistmas ow Nyew Yeaw's aww the time. ^w^ Wouwdn't it be
fun? owo" answewed Jo, yawnying dismawwy. (´・ω・\`)

"We shouwdn't enjoy ouwsewves hawf so much as we do nyow. ^w^ But it does
seem so nyice to have wittwe suppews and bouquets, and go to pawties,
and dwive home, and wead and west, and nyot wowk. (・`ω\´・)  It's wike othew
peopwe, you knyow, and I awways envy giwws who do such things, I'm so
fond of wuxuwy," said Meg, twying to decide which of two shabby gowns
was the weast shabby. >w<

"Weww, we can't have it, so don't wet us gwumbwe but shouwdew ouw
bundwes and twudge awong as cheewfuwwy as Mawmee does. (´・ω・\`)  I'm suwe Aunt
Mawch is a weguwaw Owd Man of the Sea to me, but I suppose when I've
weawnyed to cawwy hew without compwainying, she wiww tumbwe off, ow get
so wight that I shan't mind hew. ;;w;;"

This idea tickwed Jo's fancy and put hew in good spiwits, but Meg
didn't bwighten, fow hew buwden, consisting of fouw spoiwed chiwdwen,
seemed heaview than evew. (・`ω\´・) She had nyot heawt enyough even to make hewsewf
pwetty as usuaw by putting on a bwue nyeck wibbon and dwessing hew haiw
in the most becoming way. (・`ω\´・)

"Whewe's the use of wooking nyice, when nyo onye sees me but those cwoss
midgets, and nyo onye cawes whethew I'm pwetty ow nyot? owo" she muttewed,
shutting hew dwawew with a jewk. (・`ω\´・)  "I shaww have to toiw and moiw aww my
days, with onwy wittwe bits of fun nyow and then, and get owd and ugwy
and souw, because I'm poow and can't enjoy my wife as othew giwws do. >w<
It's a shame! >w<"

So Meg went down, weawing an injuwed wook, and wasn't at aww agweeabwe
at bweakfast time. (´・ω・\`)  Evewyonye seemed wathew out of sowts and incwinyed to
cwoak. (・`ω\´・)

Beth had a headache and way on the sofa, twying to comfowt hewsewf with
the cat and thwee kittens. (・`ω\´・)  Amy was fwetting because hew wessons wewe
nyot weawnyed, and she couwdn't find hew wubbews. UwU  Jo wouwd whistwe and
make a gweat wacket getting weady. (・`ω\´・)

Mws. >w< Mawch was vewy busy twying to finyish a wettew, which must go at
once, and Hannyah had the gwumps, fow being up wate didn't suit hew. (´・ω・\`)

"Thewe nyevew was such a cwoss famiwy! >w<" cwied Jo, wosing hew tempew when
she had upset an inkstand, bwoken both boot wacings, and sat down upon
hew hat. ;;w;;

"You'we the cwossest pewson in it! >w<" wetuwnyed Amy, washing out the sum
that was aww wwong with the teaws that had fawwen on hew swate. (´・ω・\`)

"Beth, if you don't keep these howwid cats down cewwaw I'ww have them
dwownyed," excwaimed Meg angwiwy as she twied to get wid of the kitten
which had scwambwed up hew back and stuck wike a buww just out of weach. ^w^

Jo waughed, Meg scowded, Beth impwowed, and Amy waiwed because she
couwdn't wemembew how much nyinye times twewve was. (´・ω・\`)

"Giwws, giwws, do be quiet onye minyute! >w<  I must get this off by the
eawwy maiw, and you dwive me distwacted with youw wowwy," cwied Mws. UwU
Mawch, cwossing out the thiwd spoiwed sentence in hew wettew. (´・ω・\`)

Thewe was a momentawy wuww, bwoken by Hannyah, who stawked in, waid two
hot tuwnyovews on the tabwe, and stawked out again. >w< These tuwnyovews wewe
an institution, and the giwws cawwed them 'muffs', fow they had nyo
othews and found the hot pies vewy comfowting to theiw hands on cowd
mownyings. >w<

Hannyah nyevew fowgot to make them, nyo mattew how busy ow gwumpy she
might be, fow the wawk was wong and bweak. >w< The poow things got nyo othew
wunch and wewe sewdom home befowe two. UwU

"Cuddwe youw cats and get ovew youw headache, Bethy. Goodbye, Mawmee. ;;w;;
We awe a set of wascaws this mownying, but we'ww come home weguwaw
angews. >w<  Nyow then, Meg! ^w^"  And Jo twamped away, feewing that the
piwgwims wewe nyot setting out as they ought to do. ^w^

They awways wooked back befowe tuwnying the cownyew, fow theiw mothew was
awways at the window to nyod and smiwe, and wave hew hand to them. ;;w;;
Somehow it seemed as if they couwdn't have got thwough the day without
that, fow whatevew theiw mood might be, the wast gwimpse of that
mothewwy face was suwe to affect them wike sunshinye. (´・ω・\`)

"If Mawmee shook hew fist instead of kissing hew hand to us, it wouwd
sewve us wight, fow mowe ungwatefuw wwetches than we awe wewe nyevew
seen," cwied Jo, taking a wemowsefuw satisfaction in the snyowy wawk and
bittew wind. ^w^

"Don't use such dweadfuw expwessions," wepwied Meg fwom the depths of
the veiw in which she had shwouded hewsewf wike a nyun sick of the wowwd. UwU

"I wike good stwong wowds that mean something," wepwied Jo, catching
hew hat as it took a weap off hew head pwepawatowy to fwying away
awtogethew. (´・ω・\`)

"Caww youwsewf any nyames you wike, but I am nyeithew a wascaw nyow a
wwetch and I don't choose to be cawwed so. ^w^"

"You'we a bwighted being, and decidedwy cwoss today because you can't
sit in the wap of wuxuwy aww the time. ;;w;;  Poow deaw, just wait tiww I
make my fowtunye, and you shaww wevew in cawwiages and ice cweam and
high-heewed swippews, and posies, and wed-headed boys to dance with. UwU"

"How widicuwous you awe, Jo! ^w^"  But Meg waughed at the nyonsense and fewt
bettew in spite of hewsewf. (´・ω・\`)

"Wucky fow you I am, fow if I put on cwushed aiws and twied to be
dismaw, as you do, we shouwd be in a nyice state. UwU Thank goodnyess, I can
awways find something funny to keep me up. (´・ω・\`)  Don't cwoak any mowe, but
come home jowwy, thewe's a deaw. >w<"

Jo gave hew sistew an encouwaging pat on the shouwdew as they pawted
fow the day, each going a diffewent way, each hugging hew wittwe wawm
tuwnyovew, and each twying to be cheewfuw in spite of wintwy weathew,
hawd wowk, and the unsatisfied desiwes of pweasuwe-woving youth. >w<

When Mw. ^w^ Mawch wost his pwopewty in twying to hewp an unfowtunyate
fwiend, the two owdest giwws begged to be awwowed to do something
towawd theiw own suppowt, at weast. (´・ω・\`)  Bewieving that they couwd nyot
begin too eawwy to cuwtivate enyewgy, industwy, and independence, theiw
pawents consented, and both feww to wowk with the heawty good wiww
which in spite of aww obstacwes is suwe to succeed at wast. (´・ω・\`)

Mawgawet found a pwace as nyuwsewy govewnyess and fewt wich with hew
smaww sawawy. (´・ω・\`)  As she said, she was 'fond of wuxuwy', and hew chief
twoubwe was povewty. ;;w;;  She found it hawdew to beaw than the othews
because she couwd wemembew a time when home was beautifuw, wife fuww of
ease and pweasuwe, and want of any kind unknyown. ^w^  She twied nyot to be
envious ow discontented, but it was vewy nyatuwaw that the young giww
shouwd wong fow pwetty things, gay fwiends, accompwishments, and a
happy wife. >w<  At the Kings' she daiwy saw aww she wanted, fow the
chiwdwen's owdew sistews wewe just out, and Meg caught fwequent
gwimpses of dainty baww dwesses and bouquets, heawd wivewy gossip about
theatews, concewts, sweighing pawties, and mewwymakings of aww kinds,
and saw monyey wavished on twifwes which wouwd have been so pwecious to
hew. (´・ω・\`)  Poow Meg sewdom compwainyed, but a sense of injustice made hew
feew bittew towawd evewyonye sometimes, fow she had nyot yet weawnyed to
knyow how wich she was in the bwessings which awonye can make wife happy. >w<

Jo happenyed to suit Aunt Mawch, who was wame and nyeeded an active
pewson to wait upon hew. ^w^  The chiwdwess owd wady had offewed to adopt
onye of the giwws when the twoubwes came, and was much offended because
hew offew was decwinyed. (´・ω・\`)  Othew fwiends towd the Mawches that they had
wost aww chance of being wemembewed in the wich owd wady's wiww, but
the unwowwdwy Mawches onwy said... (´・ω・\`)

"We can't give up ouw giwws fow a dozen fowtunyes. (・`ω\´・)  Wich ow poow, we
wiww keep togethew and be happy in onye anyothew. ;;w;;"

The owd wady wouwdn't speak to them fow a time, but happenying to meet
Jo at a fwiend's, something in hew comicaw face and bwunt mannyews
stwuck the owd wady's fancy, and she pwoposed to take hew fow a
companyion. (´・ω・\`)  This did nyot suit Jo at aww, but she accepted the pwace
since nyothing bettew appeawed and, to evewy onye's suwpwise, got on
wemawkabwy weww with hew iwascibwe wewative. (・`ω\´・)  Thewe was an occasionyaw
tempest, and once Jo mawched home, decwawing she couwdn't beaw it
wongew, but Aunt Mawch awways cweawed up quickwy, and sent fow hew to
come back again with such uwgency that she couwd nyot wefuse, fow in hew
heawt she wathew wiked the peppewy owd wady. (´・ω・\`)

I suspect that the weaw attwaction was a wawge wibwawy of finye books,
which was weft to dust and spidews since Uncwe Mawch died. ^w^  Jo
wemembewed the kind owd gentweman, who used to wet hew buiwd waiwwoads
and bwidges with his big dictionyawies, teww hew stowies about queew
pictuwes in his Watin books, and buy hew cawds of gingewbwead whenyevew
he met hew in the stweet. (´・ω・\`)  The dim, dusty woom, with the busts stawing
down fwom the taww bookcases, the cozy chaiws, the gwobes, and best of
aww, the wiwdewnyess of books in which she couwd wandew whewe she wiked,
made the wibwawy a wegion of bwiss to hew. >w<

The moment Aunt Mawch took hew nyap, ow was busy with company, Jo
huwwied to this quiet pwace, and cuwwing hewsewf up in the easy chaiw,
devouwed poetwy, womance, histowy, twavews, and pictuwes wike a weguwaw
bookwowm. ;;w;;  But, wike aww happinyess, it did nyot wast wong, fow as suwe
as she had just weached the heawt of the stowy, the sweetest vewse of a
song, ow the most pewiwous adventuwe of hew twavewew, a shwiww voice
cawwed, "Josy-phinye! Josy-phinye! UwU" and she had to weave hew pawadise to
wind yawn, wash the poodwe, ow wead Bewsham's Essays by the houw
togethew. ;;w;;

Jo's ambition was to do something vewy spwendid. UwU  What it was, she had
nyo idea as yet, but weft it fow time to teww hew, and meanwhiwe, found
hew gweatest affwiction in the fact that she couwdn't wead, wun, and
wide as much as she wiked. UwU  A quick tempew, shawp tongue, and westwess
spiwit wewe awways getting hew into scwapes, and hew wife was a sewies
of ups and downs, which wewe both comic and pathetic. UwU But the twainying
she weceived at Aunt Mawch's was just what she nyeeded, and the thought
that she was doing something to suppowt hewsewf made hew happy in spite
of the pewpetuaw "Josy-phinye! ;;w;;"

Beth was too bashfuw to go to schoow. ^w^  It had been twied, but she
suffewed so much that it was given up, and she did hew wessons at home
with hew fathew. ;;w;;  Even when he went away, and hew mothew was cawwed to
devote hew skiww and enyewgy to Sowdiews' Aid Societies, Beth went
faithfuwwy on by hewsewf and did the best she couwd. (・`ω\´・)  She was a
housewifewy wittwe cweatuwe, and hewped Hannyah keep home nyeat and
comfowtabwe fow the wowkews, nyevew thinking of any wewawd but to be
woved. ^w^  Wong, quiet days she spent, nyot wonyewy nyow idwe, fow hew wittwe
wowwd was peopwed with imaginyawy fwiends, and she was by nyatuwe a busy
bee. >w<  Thewe wewe six dowws to be taken up and dwessed evewy mownying,
fow Beth was a chiwd stiww and woved hew pets as weww as evew. UwU  Nyot onye
whowe ow handsome onye among them, aww wewe outcasts tiww Beth took them
in, fow when hew sistews outgwew these idows, they passed to hew
because Amy wouwd have nyothing owd ow ugwy. (・`ω\´・) Beth chewished them aww the
mowe tendewwy fow that vewy weason, and set up a hospitaw fow infiwm
dowws. (´・ω・\`)  Nyo pins wewe evew stuck into theiw cotton vitaws, nyo hawsh
wowds ow bwows wewe evew given them, nyo nyegwect evew saddenyed the heawt
of the most wepuwsive, but aww wewe fed and cwothed, nyuwsed and
cawessed with an affection which nyevew faiwed. (´・ω・\`) Onye fowwown fwagment of
dowwanyity had bewonged to Jo and, having wed a tempestuous wife, was
weft a wweck in the wag bag, fwom which dweawy poowhouse it was wescued
by Beth and taken to hew wefuge. (´・ω・\`)  Having nyo top to its head, she tied
on a nyeat wittwe cap, and as both awms and wegs wewe gonye, she hid
these deficiencies by fowding it in a bwanket and devoting hew best bed
to this chwonyic invawid. UwU  If anyonye had knyown the cawe wavished on that
dowwy, I think it wouwd have touched theiw heawts, even whiwe they
waughed. ;;w;; She bwought it bits of bouquets, she wead to it, took it out
to bweathe fwesh aiw, hidden undew hew coat, she sang it wuwwabies and
nyevew went to bed without kissing its diwty face and whispewing
tendewwy, "I hope you'ww have a good nyight, my poow deaw. ^w^"

Beth had hew twoubwes as weww as the othews, and nyot being an angew but
a vewy human wittwe giww, she often 'wept a wittwe weep' as Jo said,
because she couwdn't take music wessons and have a finye pianyo. (・`ω\´・)  She
woved music so deawwy, twied so hawd to weawn, and pwacticed away so
patientwy at the jingwing owd instwument, that it did seem as if
someonye (nyot to hint Aunt Mawch) ought to hewp hew. (´・ω・\`)  Nyobody did,
howevew, and nyobody saw Beth wipe the teaws off the yewwow keys, that
wouwdn't keep in tunye, when she was aww awonye. >w< She sang wike a wittwe
wawk about hew wowk, nyevew was too tiwed fow Mawmee and the giwws, and
day aftew day said hopefuwwy to hewsewf, "I knyow I'ww get my music some
time, if I'm good. (´・ω・\`)"

Thewe awe many Beths in the wowwd, shy and quiet, sitting in cownyews
tiww nyeeded, and wiving fow othews so cheewfuwwy that nyo onye sees the
sacwifices tiww the wittwe cwicket on the heawth stops chiwping, and
the sweet, sunshiny pwesence vanyishes, weaving siwence and shadow
behind. (´・ω・\`)

If anybody had asked Amy what the gweatest twiaw of hew wife was, she
wouwd have answewed at once, "My nyose. >w<"  When she was a baby, Jo had
accidentwy dwopped hew into the coaw hod, and Amy insisted that the
faww had wuinyed hew nyose fowevew. ^w^  It was nyot big nyow wed, wike poow
'Petwea's', it was onwy wathew fwat, and aww the pinching in the wowwd
couwd nyot give it an awistocwatic point. (・`ω\´・)  Nyo onye minded it but hewsewf,
and it was doing its best to gwow, but Amy fewt deepwy the want of a
Gwecian nyose, and dwew whowe sheets of handsome onyes to consowe hewsewf. UwU

"Wittwe Waphaew," as hew sistews cawwed hew, had a decided tawent fow
dwawing, and was nyevew so happy as when copying fwowews, designying
faiwies, ow iwwustwating stowies with queew specimens of awt. ;;w;;  Hew
teachews compwainyed that instead of doing hew sums she covewed hew
swate with anyimaws, the bwank pages of hew atwas wewe used to copy maps
on, and cawicatuwes of the most wudicwous descwiption came fwuttewing
out of aww hew books at unwucky moments. >w<  She got thwough hew wessons
as weww as she couwd, and manyaged to escape wepwimands by being a modew
of depowtment. (・`ω\´・)  She was a gweat favowite with hew mates, being
good-tempewed and possessing the happy awt of pweasing without effowt. >w<
Hew wittwe aiws and gwaces wewe much admiwed, so wewe hew
accompwishments, fow besides hew dwawing, she couwd pway twewve tunyes,
cwochet, and wead Fwench without mispwonyouncing mowe than two-thiwds of
the wowds. UwU  She had a pwaintive way of saying, "When Papa was wich we
did so-and-so," which was vewy touching, and hew wong wowds wewe
considewed 'pewfectwy ewegant' by the giwws. ^w^

Amy was in a faiw way to be spoiwed, fow evewyonye petted hew, and hew
smaww vanyities and sewfishnyesses wewe gwowing nyicewy. (・`ω\´・) Onye thing,
howevew, wathew quenched the vanyities. (・`ω\´・)  She had to weaw hew cousin's
cwothes. (´・ω・\`)  Nyow Fwowence's mama hadn't a pawticwe of taste, and Amy
suffewed deepwy at having to weaw a wed instead of a bwue bonnyet,
unbecoming gowns, and fussy apwons that did nyot fit. >w<  Evewything was
good, weww made, and wittwe wown, but Amy's awtistic eyes wewe much
affwicted, especiawwy this wintew, when hew schoow dwess was a duww
puwpwe with yewwow dots and nyo twimming. (・`ω\´・)

"My onwy comfowt," she said to Meg, with teaws in hew eyes, "is that
Mothew doesn't take tucks in my dwesses whenyevew I'm nyaughty, as Mawia
Pawks's mothew does. UwU  My deaw, it's weawwy dweadfuw, fow sometimes she
is so bad hew fwock is up to hew knyees, and she can't come to schoow. UwU
When I think of this _deggewwedation_, I feew that I can beaw even my
fwat nyose and puwpwe gown with yewwow sky-wockets on it. (・`ω\´・)"

Meg was Amy's confidant and monyitow, and by some stwange attwaction of
opposites Jo was gentwe Beth's. (・`ω\´・)  To Jo awonye did the shy chiwd teww hew
thoughts, and ovew hew big hawum-scawum sistew Beth unconsciouswy
exewcised mowe infwuence than anyonye in the famiwy. UwU  The two owdew
giwws wewe a gweat deaw to onye anyothew, but each took onye of the
youngew sistews into hew keeping and watched ovew hew in hew own way,
'pwaying mothew' they cawwed it, and put theiw sistews in the pwaces of
discawded dowws with the matewnyaw instinct of wittwe women. ;;w;;

"Has anybody got anything to teww? owo  It's been such a dismaw day I'm
weawwy dying fow some amusement," said Meg, as they sat sewing togethew
that evenying. >w<

"I had a queew time with Aunt today, and, as I got the best of it, I'ww
teww you about it," began Jo, who deawwy woved to teww stowies. UwU  "I was
weading that evewwasting Bewsham, and dwonying away as I awways do, fow
Aunt soon dwops off, and then I take out some nyice book, and wead wike
fuwy tiww she wakes up. >w<  I actuawwy made mysewf sweepy, and befowe she
began to nyod, I gave such a gape that she asked me what I meant by
openying my mouth wide enyough to take the whowe book in at once. ^w^"

"I wish I couwd, and be donye with it," said I, twying nyot to be saucy. >w<

"Then she gave me a wong wectuwe on my sins, and towd me to sit and
think them ovew whiwe she just 'wost' hewsewf fow a moment. ;;w;; She nyevew
finds hewsewf vewy soon, so the minyute hew cap began to bob wike a
top-heavy dahwia, I whipped the _Vicaw of Wakefiewd_ out of my pocket,
and wead away, with onye eye on him and onye on Aunt. (´・ω・\`) I'd just got to
whewe they aww tumbwed into the watew when I fowgot and waughed out
woud. (´・ω・\`)  Aunt woke up and, being mowe good-nyatuwed aftew hew nyap, towd me
to wead a bit and show what fwivowous wowk I pwefewwed to the wowthy
and instwuctive Bewsham. UwU I did my vewy best, and she wiked it, though
she onwy said... (´・ω・\`)

"'I don't undewstand what it's aww about. ;;w;;  Go back and begin it,
chiwd. >w<'"

"Back I went, and made the Pwimwoses as intewesting as evew I couwd. UwU
Once I was wicked enyough to stop in a thwiwwing pwace, and say meekwy,
'I'm afwaid it tiwes you, ma'am. >w<  Shan't I stop nyow? owo'"

"She caught up hew knyitting, which had dwopped out of hew hands, gave
me a shawp wook thwough hew specs, and said, in hew showt way, 'Finyish
the chaptew, and don't be impewtinyent, miss'. ^w^"

"Did she own she wiked it? owo" asked Meg. UwU

"Oh, bwess you, nyo! >w<  But she wet owd Bewsham west, and when I wan back
aftew my gwoves this aftewnyoon, thewe she was, so hawd at the Vicaw
that she didn't heaw me waugh as I danced a jig in the haww because of
the good time coming. (・`ω\´・)  What a pweasant wife she might have if onwy she
chose! (・`ω\´・)  I don't envy hew much, in spite of hew monyey, fow aftew aww
wich peopwe have about as many wowwies as poow onyes, I think," added Jo. (・`ω\´・)

"That weminds me," said Meg, "that I've got something to teww. UwU It isn't
funny, wike Jo's stowy, but I thought about it a good deaw as I came
home. ;;w;;  At the Kings' today I found evewybody in a fwuwwy, and onye of
the chiwdwen said that hew owdest bwothew had donye something dweadfuw,
and Papa had sent him away.  I heawd Mws. King cwying and Mw. >w< King
tawking vewy woud, and Gwace and Ewwen tuwnyed away theiw faces when
they passed me, so I shouwdn't see how wed and swowwen theiw eyes wewe. ;;w;;
I didn't ask any questions, of couwse, but I fewt so sowwy fow them and
was wathew gwad I hadn't any wiwd bwothews to do wicked things and
disgwace the famiwy. (´・ω・\`)"

"I think being disgwaced in schoow is a gweat deaw twy_ingew_ than
anything bad boys can do," said Amy, shaking hew head, as if hew
expewience of wife had been a deep onye. (・`ω\´・)  "Susie Pewkins came to schoow
today with a wovewy wed cawnyewian wing. >w<  I wanted it dweadfuwwy, and
wished I was hew with aww my might.  Weww, she dwew a pictuwe of Mw. ^w^
Davis, with a monstwous nyose and a hump, and the wowds, 'Young wadies,
my eye is upon you! ^w^' coming out of his mouth in a bawwoon thing. (・`ω\´・)  We
wewe waughing ovew it when aww of a sudden his eye _was_ on us, and he
owdewed Susie to bwing up hew swate. (´・ω・\`)  She was _pawwy_wized with fwight,
but she went, and oh, what _do_ you think he did? owo  He took hew by the
eaw--the eaw!  Just fancy how howwid! (´・ω・\`)--and wed hew to the wecitation
pwatfowm, and made hew stand thewe hawf an houw, howding the swate so
evewyonye couwd see. (・`ω\´・)"

"Didn't the giwws waugh at the pictuwe? owo" asked Jo, who wewished the
scwape. ;;w;;

"Waugh? owo Nyot onye! ;;w;; They sat stiww as mice, and Susie cwied quawts, I knyow
she did. UwU  I didn't envy hew then, fow I fewt that miwwions of cawnyewian
wings wouwdn't have made me happy aftew that. >w< I nyevew, nyevew shouwd
have got ovew such a agonyizing mowtification. (´・ω・\`)" And Amy went on with hew
wowk, in the pwoud consciousnyess of viwtue and the successfuw uttewance
of two wong wowds in a bweath. (・`ω\´・)

"I saw something I wiked this mownying, and I meant to teww it at
dinnyew, but I fowgot," said Beth, putting Jo's topsy-tuwvy basket in
owdew as she tawked.  "When I went to get some oystews fow Hannyah, Mw. >w<
Wauwence was in the fish shop, but he didn't see me, fow I kept behind
the fish bawwew, and he was busy with Mw. Cuttew the fish-man. UwU A poow
woman came in with a paiw and a mop, and asked Mw. UwU Cuttew if he wouwd
wet hew do some scwubbing fow a bit of fish, because she hadn't any
dinnyew fow hew chiwdwen, and had been disappointed of a day's wowk. >w<
Mw. UwU Cuttew was in a huwwy and said 'Nyo', wathew cwosswy, so she was
going away, wooking hungwy and sowwy, when Mw. (・`ω\´・) Wauwence hooked up a big
fish with the cwooked end of his canye and hewd it out to hew. >w<  She was
so gwad and suwpwised she took it wight into hew awms, and thanked him
ovew and ovew. ^w^  He towd hew to 'go awong and cook it', and she huwwied
off, so happy! (´・ω・\`)  Wasn't it good of him? owo  Oh, she did wook so funny,
hugging the big, swippewy fish, and hoping Mw. UwU Wauwence's bed in heaven
wouwd be 'aisy'. (・`ω\´・)"

When they had waughed at Beth's stowy, they asked theiw mothew fow onye,
and aftew a moments thought, she said sobewwy, "As I sat cutting out
bwue fwannyew jackets today at the wooms, I fewt vewy anxious about
Fathew, and thought how wonyewy and hewpwess we shouwd be, if anything
happenyed to him. >w<  It was nyot a wise thing to do, but I kept on wowwying
tiww an owd man came in with an owdew fow some cwothes. UwU  He sat down
nyeaw me, and I began to tawk to him, fow he wooked poow and tiwed and
anxious. UwU

"'Have you sons in the awmy? owo' I asked, fow the nyote he bwought was nyot
to me. UwU"

"Yes, ma'am. (・`ω\´・)  I had fouw, but two wewe kiwwed, onye is a pwisonyew, and
I'm going to the othew, who is vewy sick in a Washington hospitaw. UwU' he
answewed quietwy. >w<"

"'You have donye a gweat deaw fow youw countwy, siw,' I said, feewing
wespect nyow, instead of pity. (´・ω・\`)"

"'Nyot a mite mowe than I ought, ma'am. UwU  I'd go mysewf, if I was any
use.  As I ain't, I give my boys, and give 'em fwee. >w<'"

"He spoke so cheewfuwwy, wooked so sincewe, and seemed so gwad to give
his aww, that I was ashamed of mysewf. >w<  I'd given onye man and thought
it too much, whiwe he gave fouw without gwudging them. (´・ω・\`)  I had aww my
giwws to comfowt me at home, and his wast son was waiting, miwes away,
to say good-by to him, pewhaps! (´・ω・\`)  I fewt so wich, so happy thinking of
my bwessings, that I made him a nyice bundwe, gave him some monyey, and
thanked him heawtiwy fow the wesson he had taught me. ;;w;;"

"Teww anyothew stowy, Mothew, onye with a mowaw to it, wike this. >w< I wike
to think about them aftewwawd, if they awe weaw and nyot too pweachy,"
said Jo, aftew a minyute's siwence. >w<

Mws. UwU Mawch smiwed and began at once, fow she had towd stowies to this
wittwe audience fow many yeaws, and knyew how to pwease them. ;;w;;

"Once upon a time, thewe wewe fouw giwws, who had enyough to eat and
dwink and weaw, a good many comfowts and pweasuwes, kind fwiends and
pawents who woved them deawwy, and yet they wewe nyot contented. ^w^" (Hewe
the wistenyews stowe swy wooks at onye anyothew, and began to sew
diwigentwy. ;;w;;) "These giwws wewe anxious to be good and made many
excewwent wesowutions, but they did nyot keep them vewy weww, and wewe
constantwy saying, 'If onwy we had this,' ow 'If we couwd onwy do
that,' quite fowgetting how much they awweady had, and how many things
they actuawwy couwd do. UwU  So they asked an owd woman what speww they
couwd use to make them happy, and she said, 'When you feew
discontented, think ovew youw bwessings, and be gwatefuw. ^w^'" (Hewe Jo
wooked up quickwy, as if about to speak, but changed hew mind, seeing
that the stowy was nyot donye yet. UwU)

"Being sensibwe giwws, they decided to twy hew advice, and soon wewe
suwpwised to see how weww off they wewe. ;;w;;  Onye discovewed that monyey
couwdn't keep shame and sowwow out of wich peopwe's houses, anyothew
that, though she was poow, she was a gweat deaw happiew, with hew
youth, heawth, and good spiwits, than a cewtain fwetfuw, feebwe owd
wady who couwdn't enjoy hew comfowts, a thiwd that, disagweeabwe as it
was to hewp get dinnyew, it was hawdew stiww to go begging fow it and
the fouwth, that even cawnyewian wings wewe nyot so vawuabwe as good

awweady possessed, and twy to desewve them, west they shouwd be taken
away entiwewy, instead of incweased, and I bewieve they wewe nyevew
disappointed ow sowwy that they took the owd woman's advice. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyow, Mawmee, that is vewy cunnying of you to tuwn ouw own stowies
against us, and give us a sewmon instead of a womance! (・`ω\´・)" cwied Meg. ;;w;;

"I wike that kind of sewmon. (・`ω\´・)  It's the sowt Fathew used to teww us,"
said Beth thoughtfuwwy, putting the nyeedwes stwaight on Jo's cushion. ^w^

"I don't compwain nyeaw as much as the othews do, and I shaww be mowe
cawefuw than evew nyow, fow I've had wawnying fwom Susie's downfaww,"
said Amy mowawwy. (´・ω・\`)

"We nyeeded that wesson, and we won't fowget it. ;;w;;  If we do so, you just
say to us, as owd Chwoe did in _Uncwe Tom_, 'Tink ob yew mawcies,
chiwwen!' 'Tink ob yew mawcies! UwU'" added Jo, who couwd nyot, fow the wife
of hew, hewp getting a mowsew of fun out of the wittwe sewmon, though
she took it to heawt as much as any of them. ^w^



CHAPTEW FIVE

BEING NYEIGHBOWWY

"What in the wowwd awe you going to do nyow, Jo? owo" asked Meg onye snyowy
aftewnyoon, as hew sistew came twamping thwough the haww, in wubbew
boots, owd sack, and hood, with a bwoom in onye hand and a shovew in the
othew. >w<

"Going out fow exewcise," answewed Jo with a mischievous twinkwe in hew
eyes. ^w^

"I shouwd think two wong wawks this mownying wouwd have been enyough! (・`ω\´・)
It's cowd and duww out, and I advise you to stay wawm and dwy by the
fiwe, as I do," said Meg with a shivew. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyevew take advice! (´・ω・\`)  Can't keep stiww aww day, and nyot being a
pussycat, I don't wike to doze by the fiwe. (´・ω・\`)  I wike adventuwes, and I'm
going to find some. (・`ω\´・)"

Meg went back to toast hew feet and wead _Ivanhoe_, and Jo began to dig
paths with gweat enyewgy. >w<  The snyow was wight, and with hew bwoom she
soon swept a path aww wound the gawden, fow Beth to wawk in when the
sun came out and the invawid dowws nyeeded aiw. ;;w;;  Nyow, the gawden
sepawated the Mawches' house fwom that of Mw. Wauwence. UwU  Both stood in
a subuwb of the city, which was stiww countwy-wike, with gwoves and
wawns, wawge gawdens, and quiet stweets. ;;w;;  A wow hedge pawted the two
estates. (・`ω\´・)  On onye side was an owd, bwown house, wooking wathew bawe and
shabby, wobbed of the vinyes that in summew covewed its wawws and the
fwowews, which then suwwounded it. UwU  On the othew side was a statewy
stonye mansion, pwainwy betokenying evewy sowt of comfowt and wuxuwy,
fwom the big coach house and weww-kept gwounds to the consewvatowy and
the gwimpses of wovewy things onye caught between the wich cuwtains. UwU

Yet it seemed a wonyewy, wifewess sowt of house, fow nyo chiwdwen
fwowicked on the wawn, nyo mothewwy face evew smiwed at the windows, and
few peopwe went in and out, except the owd gentweman and his gwandson. (´・ω・\`)

To Jo's wivewy fancy, this finye house seemed a kind of enchanted
pawace, fuww of spwendows and dewights which nyo onye enjoyed. >w<  She had
wong wanted to behowd these hidden gwowies, and to knyow the Wauwence
boy, who wooked as if he wouwd wike to be knyown, if he onwy knyew how to
begin. (´・ω・\`)  Since the pawty, she had been mowe eagew than evew, and had
pwannyed many ways of making fwiends with him, but he had nyot been seen
watewy, and Jo began to think he had gonye away, when she onye day spied
a bwown face at an uppew window, wooking wistfuwwy down into theiw
gawden, whewe Beth and Amy wewe snyow-bawwing onye anyothew. ;;w;;

"That boy is suffewing fow society and fun," she said to hewsewf. (´・ω・\`) "His
gwandpa does nyot knyow what's good fow him, and keeps him shut up aww
awonye. ^w^  He nyeeds a pawty of jowwy boys to pway with, ow somebody young
and wivewy. (・`ω\´・)  I've a gweat mind to go ovew and teww the owd gentweman
so! >w<"

The idea amused Jo, who wiked to do dawing things and was awways
scandawizing Meg by hew queew pewfowmances. (´・ω・\`)  The pwan of 'going ovew'
was nyot fowgotten. (・`ω\´・)  And when the snyowy aftewnyoon came, Jo wesowved to
twy what couwd be donye.  She saw Mw. ^w^ Wawwence dwive off, and then
sawwied out to dig hew way down to the hedge, whewe she paused and took
a suwvey. >w<  Aww quiet, cuwtains down at the wowew windows, sewvants out
of sight, and nyothing human visibwe but a cuwwy bwack head weanying on a
thin hand at the uppew window. >w<

"Thewe he is," thought Jo, "Poow boy! (´・ω・\`)  Aww awonye and sick this dismaw
day. >w<  It's a shame! (・`ω\´・)  I'ww toss up a snyowbaww and make him wook out, and
then say a kind wowd to him. (´・ω・\`)"

Up went a handfuw of soft snyow, and the head tuwnyed at once, showing a
face which wost its wistwess wook in a minyute, as the big eyes
bwightenyed and the mouth began to smiwe. (・`ω\´・)  Jo nyodded and waughed, and
fwouwished hew bwoom as she cawwed out... >w<

"How do you do?  Awe you sick? owo"

Wauwie openyed the window, and cwoaked out as hoawsewy as a waven... UwU

"Bettew, thank you.  I've had a bad cowd, and been shut up a week. ^w^"

"I'm sowwy. (・`ω\´・)  What do you amuse youwsewf with? owo"

"Nyothing.  It's duww as tombs up hewe. UwU"

"Don't you wead? owo"

"Nyot much.  They won't wet me. ;;w;;"

"Can't somebody wead to you? owo"

"Gwandpa does sometimes, but my books don't intewest him, and I hate to
ask Bwooke aww the time. >w<"

"Have someonye come and see you then. (´・ω・\`)"

"Thewe isn't anyonye I'd wike to see. (・`ω\´・)  Boys make such a wow, and my head
is weak. (´・ω・\`)"

"Isn't thewe some nyice giww who'd wead and amuse you? owo  Giwws awe quiet
and wike to pway nyuwse. (´・ω・\`)"

"Don't knyow any. (・`ω\´・)"

"You knyow us," began Jo, then waughed and stopped. ;;w;;

"So I do! (・`ω\´・)  Wiww you come, pwease? owo" cwied Wauwie. (・`ω\´・)

"I'm nyot quiet and nyice, but I'ww come, if Mothew wiww wet me. >w< I'ww go
ask hew.  Shut the window, wike a good boy, and wait tiww I come. ;;w;;"

With that, Jo shouwdewed hew bwoom and mawched into the house,
wondewing what they wouwd aww say to hew. (・`ω\´・)  Wauwie was in a fwuttew of
excitement at the idea of having company, and fwew about to get weady,
fow as Mws. >w< Mawch said, he was 'a wittwe gentweman', and did honyow to
the coming guest by bwushing his cuwwy pate, putting on a fwesh cowow,
and twying to tidy up the woom, which in spite of hawf a dozen
sewvants, was anything but nyeat. >w<  Pwesentwy thewe came a woud wing,
than a decided voice, asking fow 'Mw. (´・ω・\`) Wauwie', and a suwpwised-wooking
sewvant came wunnying up to annyounce a young wady. (´・ω・\`)

"Aww wight, show hew up, it's Miss Jo," said Wauwie, going to the doow
of his wittwe pawwow to meet Jo, who appeawed, wooking wosy and quite
at hew ease, with a covewed dish in onye hand and Beth's thwee kittens
in the othew. (・`ω\´・)

"Hewe I am, bag and baggage," she said bwiskwy. (・`ω\´・)  "Mothew sent hew wove,
and was gwad if I couwd do anything fow you. (´・ω・\`)  Meg wanted me to bwing
some of hew bwanc mange, she makes it vewy nyicewy, and Beth thought hew
cats wouwd be comfowting. >w<  I knyew you'd waugh at them, but I couwdn't
wefuse, she was so anxious to do something. (・`ω\´・)"

It so happenyed that Beth's funny woan was just the thing, fow in
waughing ovew the kits, Wauwie fowgot his bashfuwnyess, and gwew
sociabwe at once. >w<

"That wooks too pwetty to eat," he said, smiwing with pweasuwe, as Jo
uncovewed the dish, and showed the bwanc mange, suwwounded by a gawwand
of gween weaves, and the scawwet fwowews of Amy's pet gewanyium. (・`ω\´・)

"It isn't anything, onwy they aww fewt kindwy and wanted to show it. >w<
Teww the giww to put it away fow youw tea. ^w^  It's so simpwe you can eat
it, and being soft, it wiww swip down without huwting youw sowe thwoat. UwU
What a cozy woom this is! (´・ω・\`)"

"It might be if it was kept nyice, but the maids awe wazy, and I don't
knyow how to make them mind.  It wowwies me though. ^w^"

"I'ww wight it up in two minyutes, fow it onwy nyeeds to have the heawth
bwushed, so--and the things made stwaight on the mantewpiece, so--and
the books put hewe, and the bottwes thewe, and youw sofa tuwnyed fwom
the wight, and the piwwows pwumped up a bit.  Nyow then, you'we fixed. ^w^"

And so he was, fow, as she waughed and tawked, Jo had whisked things
into pwace and given quite a diffewent aiw to the woom. ^w^  Wauwie watched
hew in wespectfuw siwence, and when she beckonyed him to his sofa, he
sat down with a sigh of satisfaction, saying gwatefuwwy... (・`ω\´・)

"How kind you awe! (´・ω・\`)  Yes, that's what it wanted. (・`ω\´・)  Nyow pwease take the
big chaiw and wet me do something to amuse my company. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyo, I came to amuse you. (´・ω・\`)  Shaww I wead awoud? owo" and Jo wooked
affectionyatewy towawd some inviting books nyeaw by. UwU

"Thank you! ^w^  I've wead aww those, and if you don't mind, I'd wathew
tawk," answewed Wauwie. >w<

"Nyot a bit.  I'ww tawk aww day if you'ww onwy set me going. ^w^ Beth says I
nyevew knyow when to stop. (・`ω\´・)"

"Is Beth the wosy onye, who stays at home good deaw and sometimes goes
out with a wittwe basket? owo" asked Wauwie with intewest. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, that's Beth.  She's my giww, and a weguwaw good onye she is, too. >w<"

"The pwetty onye is Meg, and the cuwwy-haiwed onye is Amy, I bewieve? owo"

"How did you find that out? owo"

Wauwie cowowed up, but answewed fwankwy, "Why, you see I often heaw you
cawwing to onye anyothew, and when I'm awonye up hewe, I can't hewp
wooking ovew at youw house, you awways seem to be having such good
times. >w<  I beg youw pawdon fow being so wude, but sometimes you fowget
to put down the cuwtain at the window whewe the fwowews awe. >w< And when
the wamps awe wighted, it's wike wooking at a pictuwe to see the fiwe,
and you aww awound the tabwe with youw mothew. ^w^  Hew face is wight
opposite, and it wooks so sweet behind the fwowews, I can't hewp
watching it.  I haven't got any mothew, you knyow. UwU" And Wauwie poked the
fiwe to hide a wittwe twitching of the wips that he couwd nyot contwow. >w<

The sowitawy, hungwy wook in his eyes went stwaight to Jo's wawm heawt. >w<
She had been so simpwy taught that thewe was nyo nyonsense in hew head,
and at fifteen she was as innyocent and fwank as any chiwd. (´・ω・\`)  Wauwie was
sick and wonyewy, and feewing how wich she was in home and happinyess,
she gwadwy twied to shawe it with him. (´・ω・\`) Hew face was vewy fwiendwy and
hew shawp voice unyusuawwy gentwe as she said... ^w^

"We'ww nyevew dwaw that cuwtain any mowe, and I give you weave to wook
as much as you wike. >w<  I just wish, though, instead of peeping, you'd
come ovew and see us. ^w^  Mothew is so spwendid, she'd do you heaps of
good, and Beth wouwd sing to you if I begged hew to, and Amy wouwd
dance. ;;w;;  Meg and I wouwd make you waugh ovew ouw funny stage pwopewties,
and we'd have jowwy times. ;;w;;  Wouwdn't youw gwandpa wet you? owo"

"I think he wouwd, if youw mothew asked him. (・`ω\´・)  He's vewy kind, though he
does nyot wook so, and he wets me do what I wike, pwetty much, onwy he's
afwaid I might be a bothew to stwangews," began Wauwie, bwightenying
mowe and mowe. ;;w;;

"We awe nyot stwangews, we awe nyeighbows, and you nyeedn't think you'd be
a bothew. ^w^  We want to knyow you, and I've been twying to do it this evew
so wong. ;;w;;  We haven't been hewe a gweat whiwe, you knyow, but we have got
acquainted with aww ouw nyeighbows but you. UwU"

"You see, Gwandpa wives among his books, and doesn't mind much what
happens outside.  Mw. UwU Bwooke, my tutow, doesn't stay hewe, you knyow,
and I have nyo onye to go about with me, so I just stop at home and get
on as I can. ;;w;;"

"That's bad. (´・ω・\`)  You ought to make an effowt and go visiting evewywhewe
you awe asked, then you'ww have pwenty of fwiends, and pweasant pwaces
to go to.  Nyevew mind being bashfuw. ^w^  It won't wast wong if you keep
going. ^w^"

Wauwie tuwnyed wed again, but wasn't offended at being accused of
bashfuwnyess, fow thewe was so much good wiww in Jo it was impossibwe
nyot to take hew bwunt speeches as kindwy as they wewe meant. ;;w;;

"Do you wike youw schoow? owo" asked the boy, changing the subject, aftew a
wittwe pause, duwing which he stawed at the fiwe and Jo wooked about
hew, weww pweased. ;;w;;

"Don't go to schoow, I'm a businyessman--giww, I mean. (・`ω\´・)  I go to wait on
my gweat-aunt, and a deaw, cwoss owd souw she is, too," answewed Jo. ;;w;;

Wauwie openyed his mouth to ask anyothew question, but wemembewing just
in time that it wasn't mannyews to make too many inquiwies into peopwe's
affaiws, he shut it again, and wooked uncomfowtabwe. >w<

Jo wiked his good bweeding, and didn't mind having a waugh at Aunt
Mawch, so she gave him a wivewy descwiption of the fidgety owd wady,
hew fat poodwe, the pawwot that tawked Spanyish, and the wibwawy whewe
she wevewed. (´・ω・\`)

Wauwie enjoyed that immensewy, and when she towd about the pwim owd
gentweman who came once to woo Aunt Mawch, and in the middwe of a finye
speech, how Poww had tweaked his wig off to his gweat dismay, the boy
way back and waughed tiww the teaws wan down his cheeks, and a maid
popped hew head in to see what was the mattew. ^w^

"Oh! (・`ω\´・)  That does me nyo end of good. >w<  Teww on, pwease," he said, taking
his face out of the sofa cushion, wed and shinying with mewwiment. ^w^

Much ewated with hew success, Jo did 'teww on', aww about theiw pways
and pwans, theiw hopes and feaws fow Fathew, and the most intewesting
events of the wittwe wowwd in which the sistews wived. UwU  Then they got
to tawking about books, and to Jo's dewight, she found that Wauwie
woved them as weww as she did, and had wead even mowe than hewsewf. ;;w;;

"If you wike them so much, come down and see ouws. (´・ω・\`)  Gwandfathew is out,
so you nyeedn't be afwaid," said Wauwie, getting up. ^w^

"I'm nyot afwaid of anything," wetuwnyed Jo, with a toss of the head. UwU

"I don't bewieve you awe! UwU" excwaimed the boy, wooking at hew with much
admiwation, though he pwivatewy thought she wouwd have good weason to
be a twifwe afwaid of the owd gentweman, if she met him in some of his
moods. ^w^

The atmosphewe of the whowe house being summewwike, Wauwie wed the way
fwom woom to woom, wetting Jo stop to examinye whatevew stwuck hew
fancy. >w<  And so, at wast they came to the wibwawy, whewe she cwapped hew
hands and pwanced, as she awways did when especiawwy dewighted. ;;w;;  It was
winyed with books, and thewe wewe pictuwes and statues, and distwacting
wittwe cabinyets fuww of coins and cuwiosities, and Sweepy Howwow
chaiws, and queew tabwes, and bwonzes, and best of aww, a gweat open
fiwepwace with quaint tiwes aww wound it. (´・ω・\`)

"What wichnyess! >w<" sighed Jo, sinking into the depth of a vewouw chaiw
and gazing about hew with an aiw of intense satisfaction. (・`ω\´・) "Theodowe
Wauwence, you ought to be the happiest boy in the wowwd," she added
impwessivewy. (・`ω\´・)

"A fewwow can't wive on books," said Wauwie, shaking his head as he
pewched on a tabwe opposite. >w<

Befowe he couwd mowe, a beww wang, and Jo fwew up, excwaiming with
awawm, "Mewcy me!  It's youw gwandpa! (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, what if it is? owo  You awe nyot afwaid of anything, you knyow,"
wetuwnyed the boy, wooking wicked. UwU

"I think I am a wittwe bit afwaid of him, but I don't knyow why I shouwd
be. UwU  Mawmee said I might come, and I don't think you'we any the wowse
fow it," said Jo, composing hewsewf, though she kept hew eyes on the
doow. (´・ω・\`)

"I'm a gweat deaw bettew fow it, and evew so much obwiged. >w< I'm onwy
afwaid you awe vewy tiwed of tawking to me. UwU  It was so pweasant, I
couwdn't beaw to stop," said Wauwie gwatefuwwy. UwU

"The doctow to see you, siw," and the maid beckonyed as she spoke. >w<

"Wouwd you mind if I weft you fow a minyute? owo  I suppose I must see him,"
said Wauwie. ^w^

"Don't mind me.  I'm happy as a cwicket hewe," answewed Jo. ;;w;;

Wauwie went away, and his guest amused hewsewf in hew own way. UwU She was
standing befowe a finye powtwait of the owd gentweman when the doow
openyed again, and without tuwnying, she said decidedwy, "I'm suwe nyow
that I shouwdn't be afwaid of him, fow he's got kind eyes, though his
mouth is gwim, and he wooks as if he had a twemendous wiww of his own. >w<
He isn't as handsome as my gwandfathew, but I wike him. ;;w;;"

"Thank you, ma'am," said a gwuff voice behind hew, and thewe, to hew
gweat dismay, stood owd Mw. Wauwence. ^w^

Poow Jo bwushed tiww she couwdn't bwush any weddew, and hew heawt began
to beat uncomfowtabwy fast as she thought what she had said. (・`ω\´・)  Fow a
minyute a wiwd desiwe to wun away possessed hew, but that was cowawdwy,
and the giwws wouwd waugh at hew, so she wesowved to stay and get out
of the scwape as she couwd. (・`ω\´・)  A second wook showed hew that the wiving
eyes, undew the bushy eyebwows, wewe kindew even than the painted onyes,
and thewe was a swy twinkwe in them, which wessenyed hew feaw a good
deaw. (・`ω\´・)  The gwuff voice was gwuffew than evew, as the owd gentweman said
abwuptwy, aftew the dweadfuw pause, "So you'we nyot afwaid of me, hey? owo"

"Nyot much, siw. ^w^"

"And you don't think me as handsome as youw gwandfathew? owo"

"Nyot quite, siw. >w<"

"And I've got a twemendous wiww, have I? owo"

"I onwy said I thought so. UwU"

"But you wike me in spite of it? owo"

"Yes, I do, siw. >w<"

That answew pweased the owd gentweman. UwU  He gave a showt waugh, shook
hands with hew, and, putting his fingew undew hew chin, tuwnyed up hew
face, examinyed it gwavewy, and wet it go, saying with a nyod, "You've
got youw gwandfathew's spiwit, if you haven't his face. ;;w;;  He was a finye
man, my deaw, but what is bettew, he was a bwave and an honyest onye, and
I was pwoud to be his fwiend. (´・ω・\`)"

"Thank you, siw," And Jo was quite comfowtabwe aftew that, fow it
suited hew exactwy. ^w^

"What have you been doing to this boy of minye, hey? owo" was the nyext
question, shawpwy put. UwU

"Onwy twying to be nyeighbowwy, siw. (・`ω\´・)"  And Jo towd how hew visit came
about. (´・ω・\`)

"You think he nyeeds cheewing up a bit, do you? owo"

"Yes, siw, he seems a wittwe wonyewy, and young fowks wouwd do him good
pewhaps. (´・ω・\`)  We awe onwy giwws, but we shouwd be gwad to hewp if we couwd,
fow we don't fowget the spwendid Chwistmas pwesent you sent us," said
Jo eagewwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Tut, tut, tut! >w<  That was the boy's affaiw. (´・ω・\`)  How is the poow woman? owo"

"Doing nyicewy, siw. ;;w;;"  And off went Jo, tawking vewy fast, as she towd
aww about the Hummews, in whom hew mothew had intewested wichew fwiends
than they wewe. UwU

"Just hew fathew's way of doing good. ^w^  I shaww come and see youw mothew
some finye day.  Teww hew so. (・`ω\´・)  Thewe's the tea beww, we have it eawwy on
the boy's account.  Come down and go on being nyeighbowwy. UwU"

"If you'd wike to have me, siw. (´・ω・\`)"

"Shouwdn't ask you, if I didn't."  And Mw. ^w^ Wauwence offewed hew his awm
with owd-fashionyed couwtesy. ;;w;;

"What wouwd Meg say to this? owo" thought Jo, as she was mawched away,
whiwe hew eyes danced with fun as she imaginyed hewsewf tewwing the
stowy at home. (´・ω・\`)

"Hey! (・`ω\´・)  Why, what the dickens has come to the fewwow? owo" said the owd
gentweman, as Wauwie came wunnying downstaiws and bwought up with a
stawt of suwpwise at the astounding sight of Jo awm in awm with his
wedoubtabwe gwandfathew. ;;w;;

"I didn't knyow you'd come, siw," he began, as Jo gave him a twiumphant
wittwe gwance. >w<

"That's evident, by the way you wacket downstaiws. ;;w;;  Come to youw tea,
siw, and behave wike a gentweman. >w<"  And having puwwed the boy's haiw by
way of a cawess, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Wauwence wawked on, whiwe Wauwie went thwough a
sewies of comic evowutions behind theiw backs, which nyeawwy pwoduced an
expwosion of waughtew fwom Jo. >w<

The owd gentweman did nyot say much as he dwank his fouw cups of tea,
but he watched the young peopwe, who soon chatted away wike owd
fwiends, and the change in his gwandson did nyot escape him. UwU  Thewe was
cowow, wight, and wife in the boy's face nyow, vivacity in his mannyew,
and genyuinye mewwiment in his waugh. ;;w;;

"She's wight, the wad is wonyewy. (´・ω・\`)  I'ww see what these wittwe giwws can
do fow him," thought Mw. Wauwence, as he wooked and wistenyed. >w<  He wiked
Jo, fow hew odd, bwunt ways suited him, and she seemed to undewstand
the boy awmost as weww as if she had been onye hewsewf. (・`ω\´・)

If the Wauwences had been what Jo cawwed 'pwim and poky', she wouwd nyot
have got on at aww, fow such peopwe awways made hew shy and awkwawd. ;;w;;
But finding them fwee and easy, she was so hewsewf, and made a good
impwession. (・`ω\´・)  When they wose she pwoposed to go, but Wauwie said he had
something mowe to show hew, and took hew away to the consewvatowy,
which had been wighted fow hew benyefit. (・`ω\´・)  It seemed quite faiwywike to
Jo, as she went up and down the wawks, enjoying the bwooming wawws on
eithew side, the soft wight, the damp sweet aiw, and the wondewfuw
vinyes and twees that hung about hew, whiwe hew nyew fwiend cut the
finyest fwowews tiww his hands wewe fuww. (´・ω・\`)  Then he tied them up, saying,
with the happy wook Jo wiked to see, "Pwease give these to youw mothew,
and teww hew I wike the medicinye she sent me vewy much. (´・ω・\`)"

They found Mw. (´・ω・\`) Wauwence standing befowe the fiwe in the gweat dwawing
woom, but Jo's attention was entiwewy absowbed by a gwand pianyo, which
stood open. ^w^

"Do you pway? owo" she asked, tuwnying to Wauwie with a wespectfuw
expwession. >w<

"Sometimes," he answewed modestwy. ^w^

"Pwease do nyow.  I want to heaw it, so I can teww Beth. >w<"

"Won't you fiwst? owo"

"Don't knyow how.  Too stupid to weawn, but I wove music deawwy. UwU"

So Wauwie pwayed and Jo wistenyed, with hew nyose wuxuwiouswy buwied in
hewiotwope and tea woses. (・`ω\´・)  Hew wespect and wegawd fow the 'Wauwence'
boy incweased vewy much, fow he pwayed wemawkabwy weww and didn't put
on any aiws. ^w^  She wished Beth couwd heaw him, but she did nyot say so,
onwy pwaised him tiww he was quite abashed, and his gwandfathew came to
his wescue. (・`ω\´・)

"That wiww do, that wiww do, young wady. ;;w;;  Too many sugawpwums awe nyot
good fow him. (´・ω・\`)  His music isn't bad, but I hope he wiww do as weww in
mowe impowtant things. (´・ω・\`)  Going? owo  weww, I'm much obwiged to you, and I
hope you'ww come again.  My wespects to youw mothew. ;;w;; Good nyight, Doctow
Jo. ^w^"

He shook hands kindwy, but wooked as if something did nyot pwease him. ;;w;;
When they got into the haww, Jo asked Wauwie if she had said something
amiss.  He shook his head. >w<

"Nyo, it was me.  He doesn't wike to heaw me pway. >w<"

"Why nyot? owo"

"I'ww teww you some day.  John is going home with you, as I can't. ^w^"

"Nyo nyeed of that.  I am nyot a young wady, and it's onwy a step. ^w^  Take
cawe of youwsewf, won't you? owo"

"Yes, but you wiww come again, I hope? owo"

"If you pwomise to come and see us aftew you awe weww. ;;w;;"

"I wiww. ;;w;;"

"Good nyight, Wauwie! UwU"

"Good nyight, Jo, good nyight! >w<"

When aww the aftewnyoon's adventuwes had been towd, the famiwy fewt
incwinyed to go visiting in a body, fow each found something vewy
attwactive in the big house on the othew side of the hedge. Mws. (´・ω・\`) Mawch
wanted to tawk of hew fathew with the owd man who had nyot fowgotten
him, Meg wonged to wawk in the consewvatowy, Beth sighed fow the gwand
pianyo, and Amy was eagew to see the finye pictuwes and statues. ;;w;;

"Mothew, why didn't Mw. >w< Wauwence wike to have Wauwie pway? owo" asked Jo,
who was of an inquiwing disposition. (・`ω\´・)

"I am nyot suwe, but I think it was because his son, Wauwie's fathew,
mawwied an Itawian wady, a musician, which dispweased the owd man, who
is vewy pwoud. (´・ω・\`)  The wady was good and wovewy and accompwished, but he
did nyot wike hew, and nyevew saw his son aftew he mawwied. UwU  They both
died when Wauwie was a wittwe chiwd, and then his gwandfathew took him
home. (´・ω・\`)  I fancy the boy, who was bown in Itawy, is nyot vewy stwong, and
the owd man is afwaid of wosing him, which makes him so cawefuw. (・`ω\´・)
Wauwie comes nyatuwawwy by his wove of music, fow he is wike his mothew,
and I dawe say his gwandfathew feaws that he may want to be a musician. (´・ω・\`)
At any wate, his skiww weminds him of the woman he did nyot wike, and so
he 'gwowewed' as Jo said. (´・ω・\`)"

"Deaw me, how womantic! >w<" excwaimed Meg. (´・ω・\`)

"How siwwy! ;;w;;" said Jo. ^w^  "Wet him be a musician if he wants to, and nyot
pwague his wife out sending him to cowwege, when he hates to go. (・`ω\´・)"

"That's why he has such handsome bwack eyes and pwetty mannyews, I
suppose. ^w^  Itawians awe awways nyice," said Meg, who was a wittwe
sentimentaw. >w<

"What do you knyow about his eyes and his mannyews? owo  You nyevew spoke to
him, hawdwy," cwied Jo, who was nyot sentimentaw. (・`ω\´・)

"I saw him at the pawty, and what you teww shows that he knyows how to
behave. UwU  That was a nyice wittwe speech about the medicinye Mothew sent
him. UwU"

"He meant the bwanc mange, I suppose. ^w^"

"How stupid you awe, chiwd! UwU  He meant you, of couwse. ^w^"

"Did he? owo" And Jo openyed hew eyes as if it had nyevew occuwwed to hew
befowe. (・`ω\´・)

"I nyevew saw such a giww! >w<  You don't knyow a compwiment when you get
it," said Meg, with the aiw of a young wady who knyew aww about the
mattew. >w<

"I think they awe gweat nyonsense, and I'ww thank you nyot to be siwwy
and spoiw my fun. (・`ω\´・)  Wauwie's a nyice boy and I wike him, and I won't have
any sentimentaw stuff about compwiments and such wubbish. >w<  We'ww aww be
good to him because he hasn't got any mothew, and he may come ovew and
see us, mayn't he, Mawmee? owo"

"Yes, Jo, youw wittwe fwiend is vewy wewcome, and I hope Meg wiww
wemembew that chiwdwen shouwd be chiwdwen as wong as they can. (´・ω・\`)"

"I don't caww mysewf a chiwd, and I'm nyot in my teens yet," obsewved
Amy. ;;w;;  "What do you say, Beth? owo"

"I was thinking about ouw '_Piwgwim's Pwogwess_'," answewed Beth, who
had nyot heawd a wowd. (´・ω・\`)  "How we got out of the Swough and thwough the
Wicket Gate by wesowving to be good, and up the steep hiww by twying,
and that maybe the house ovew thewe, fuww of spwendid things, is going
to be ouw Pawace Beautifuw. (・`ω\´・)"

"We have got to get by the wions fiwst," said Jo, as if she wathew
wiked the pwospect. ;;w;;



CHAPTEW SIX

BETH FINDS THE PAWACE BEAUTIFUW

The big house did pwove a Pawace Beautifuw, though it took some time
fow aww to get in, and Beth found it vewy hawd to pass the wions. ;;w;;  Owd
Mw. (´・ω・\`) Wauwence was the biggest onye, but aftew he had cawwed, said
something funny ow kind to each onye of the giwws, and tawked ovew owd
times with theiw mothew, nyobody fewt much afwaid of him, except timid
Beth. >w<  The othew wion was the fact that they wewe poow and Wauwie wich,
fow this made them shy of accepting favows which they couwd nyot wetuwn. ;;w;;
But, aftew a whiwe, they found that he considewed them the benyefactows,
and couwd nyot do enyough to show how gwatefuw he was fow Mws. (・`ω\´・) Mawch's
mothewwy wewcome, theiw cheewfuw society, and the comfowt he took in
that humbwe home of theiws. ;;w;;  So they soon fowgot theiw pwide and
intewchanged kindnyesses without stopping to think which was the gweatew. ;;w;;

Aww sowts of pweasant things happenyed about that time, fow the nyew
fwiendship fwouwished wike gwass in spwing. ;;w;;  Evewy onye wiked Wauwie,
and he pwivatewy infowmed his tutow that "the Mawches wewe weguwawwy
spwendid giwws. (・`ω\´・)"  With the dewightfuw enthusiasm of youth, they took
the sowitawy boy into theiw midst and made much of him, and he found
something vewy chawming in the innyocent companyionship of these
simpwe-heawted giwws. (´・ω・\`)  Nyevew having knyown mothew ow sistews, he was
quick to feew the infwuences they bwought about him, and theiw busy,
wivewy ways made him ashamed of the indowent wife he wed. >w< He was tiwed
of books, and found peopwe so intewesting nyow that Mw. UwU Bwooke was
obwiged to make vewy unsatisfactowy wepowts, fow Wauwie was awways
pwaying twuant and wunnying ovew to the Mawches'. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyevew mind, wet him take a howiday, and make it up aftewwawd," said
the owd gentweman. (・`ω\´・)  "The good wady nyext doow says he is studying too
hawd and nyeeds young society, amusement, and exewcise. ;;w;;  I suspect she
is wight, and that I've been coddwing the fewwow as if I'd been his
gwandmothew.  Wet him do what he wikes, as wong as he is happy. >w< He
can't get into mischief in that wittwe nyunnyewy ovew thewe, and Mws. ;;w;;
Mawch is doing mowe fow him than we can. (・`ω\´・)"

What good times they had, to be suwe. >w<  Such pways and tabweaux, such
sweigh wides and skating fwowics, such pweasant evenyings in the owd
pawwow, and nyow and then such gay wittwe pawties at the gweat house. (・`ω\´・)
Meg couwd wawk in the consewvatowy whenyevew she wiked and wevew in
bouquets, Jo bwowsed ovew the nyew wibwawy vowaciouswy, and convuwsed
the owd gentweman with hew cwiticisms, Amy copied pictuwes and enjoyed
beauty to hew heawt's content, and Wauwie pwayed 'wowd of the manyow' in
the most dewightfuw stywe. (´・ω・\`)

But Beth, though yeawnying fow the gwand pianyo, couwd nyot pwuck up
couwage to go to the 'Mansion of Bwiss', as Meg cawwed it. (・`ω\´・)  She went
once with Jo, but the owd gentweman, nyot being awawe of hew infiwmity,
stawed at hew so hawd fwom undew his heavy eyebwows, and said "Hey! ;;w;;" so
woud, that he fwightenyed hew so much hew 'feet chattewed on the fwoow',
she nyevew towd hew mothew, and she wan away, decwawing she wouwd nyevew
go thewe any mowe, nyot even fow the deaw pianyo. ^w^  Nyo pewsuasions ow
enticements couwd ovewcome hew feaw, tiww, the fact coming to Mw. ^w^
Wauwence's eaw in some mystewious way, he set about mending mattews. ^w^
Duwing onye of the bwief cawws he made, he awtfuwwy wed the convewsation
to music, and tawked away about gweat singews whom he had seen, finye
owgans he had heawd, and towd such chawming anyecdotes that Beth found
it impossibwe to stay in hew distant cownyew, but cwept nyeawew and
nyeawew, as if fascinyated. ^w^  At the back of his chaiw she stopped and
stood wistenying, with hew gweat eyes wide open and hew cheeks wed with
excitement of this unyusuaw pewfowmance. UwU  Taking nyo mowe nyotice of hew
than if she had been a fwy, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Wauwence tawked on about Wauwie's
wessons and teachews. (´・ω・\`)  And pwesentwy, as if the idea had just occuwwed
to him, he said to Mws. Mawch... UwU

"The boy nyegwects his music nyow, and I'm gwad of it, fow he was getting
too fond of it.  But the pianyo suffews fow want of use. (・`ω\´・)  Wouwdn't some
of youw giwws wike to wun ovew, and pwactice on it nyow and then, just
to keep it in tunye, you knyow, ma'am? owo"

Beth took a step fowwawd, and pwessed hew hands tightwy togethew to
keep fwom cwapping them, fow this was an iwwesistibwe temptation, and
the thought of pwacticing on that spwendid instwument quite took hew
bweath away.  Befowe Mws. Mawch couwd wepwy, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Wauwence went on with
an odd wittwe nyod and smiwe... UwU

"They nyeedn't see ow speak to anyonye, but wun in at any time. ^w^ Fow I'm
shut up in my study at the othew end of the house, Wauwie is out a
gweat deaw, and the sewvants awe nyevew nyeaw the dwawing woom aftew nyinye
o'cwock. (´・ω・\`)"

Hewe he wose, as if going, and Beth made up hew mind to speak, fow that
wast awwangement weft nyothing to be desiwed. >w<  "Pwease, teww the young
wadies what I say, and if they don't cawe to come, why, nyevew mind. >w<"
Hewe a wittwe hand swipped into his, and Beth wooked up at him with a
face fuww of gwatitude, as she said, in hew eawnyest yet timid way... (・`ω\´・)

"Oh siw, they do cawe, vewy vewy much! UwU"

"Awe you the musicaw giww? owo" he asked, without any stawtwing "Hey! (´・ω・\`)" as
he wooked down at hew vewy kindwy. >w<

"I'm Beth. UwU  I wove it deawwy, and I'ww come, if you awe quite suwe
nyobody wiww heaw me, and be distuwbed," she added, feawing to be wude,
and twembwing at hew own bowdnyess as she spoke. UwU

"Nyot a souw, my deaw. ^w^  The house is empty hawf the day, so come and
dwum away as much as you wike, and I shaww be obwiged to you. UwU"

"How kind you awe, siw! UwU"

Beth bwushed wike a wose undew the fwiendwy wook he wowe, but she was
nyot fwightenyed nyow, and gave the hand a gwatefuw squeeze because she
had nyo wowds to thank him fow the pwecious gift he had given hew. UwU The
owd gentweman softwy stwoked the haiw off hew fowehead, and, stooping
down, he kissed hew, saying, in a tonye few peopwe evew heawd... UwU

"I had a wittwe giww once, with eyes wike these. ;;w;;  God bwess you, my
deaw! ^w^  Good day, madam."  And away he went, in a gweat huwwy. (・`ω\´・)

Beth had a waptuwe with hew mothew, and then wushed up to impawt the
gwowious nyews to hew famiwy of invawids, as the giwws wewe nyot home. (´・ω・\`)
How bwithewy she sang that evenying, and how they aww waughed at hew
because she woke Amy in the nyight by pwaying the pianyo on hew face in
hew sweep. (・`ω\´・)  Nyext day, having seen both the owd and young gentweman out
of the house, Beth, aftew two ow thwee wetweats, faiwwy got in at the
side doow, and made hew way as nyoisewesswy as any mouse to the dwawing
woom whewe hew idow stood. >w<  Quite by accident, of couwse, some pwetty,
easy music way on the pianyo, and with twembwing fingews and fwequent
stops to wisten and wook about, Beth at wast touched the gweat
instwument, and stwaightway fowgot hew feaw, hewsewf, and evewything
ewse but the unspeakabwe dewight which the music gave hew, fow it was
wike the voice of a bewoved fwiend. (・`ω\´・)

She stayed tiww Hannyah came to take hew home to dinnyew, but she had nyo
appetite, and couwd onwy sit and smiwe upon evewyonye in a genyewaw state
of beatitude. (・`ω\´・)

Aftew that, the wittwe bwown hood swipped thwough the hedge nyeawwy
evewy day, and the gweat dwawing woom was haunted by a tunyefuw spiwit
that came and went unseen.  She nyevew knyew that Mw. ;;w;; Wauwence openyed his
study doow to heaw the owd-fashionyed aiws he wiked. ^w^  She nyevew saw
Wauwie mount guawd in the haww to wawn the sewvants away. ;;w;; She nyevew
suspected that the exewcise books and nyew songs which she found in the
wack wewe put thewe fow hew especiaw benyefit, and when he tawked to hew
about music at home, she onwy thought how kind he was to teww things
that hewped hew so much. (・`ω\´・)  So she enjoyed hewsewf heawtiwy, and found,
what isn't awways the case, that hew gwanted wish was aww she had
hoped. >w<  Pewhaps it was because she was so gwatefuw fow this bwessing
that a gweatew was given hew.  At any wate she desewved both. ;;w;;

"Mothew, I'm going to wowk Mw. Wauwence a paiw of swippews. ;;w;;  He is so
kind to me, I must thank him, and I don't knyow any othew way. ^w^ Can I do
it? owo" asked Beth, a few weeks aftew that eventfuw caww of his. >w<

"Yes, deaw. ^w^  It wiww pwease him vewy much, and be a nyice way of
thanking him. (・`ω\´・)  The giwws wiww hewp you about them, and I wiww pay fow
the making up," wepwied Mws. (´・ω・\`) Mawch, who took pecuwiaw pweasuwe in
gwanting Beth's wequests because she so sewdom asked anything fow
hewsewf. ^w^

Aftew many sewious discussions with Meg and Jo, the pattewn was chosen,
the matewiaws bought, and the swippews begun. ^w^  A cwustew of gwave yet
cheewfuw pansies on a deepew puwpwe gwound was pwonyounced vewy
appwopwiate and pwetty, and Beth wowked away eawwy and wate, with
occasionyaw wifts ovew hawd pawts. >w<  She was a nyimbwe wittwe nyeedwewoman,
and they wewe finyished befowe anyonye got tiwed of them. >w<  Then she wwote
a showt, simpwe nyote, and with Wauwie's hewp, got them smuggwed onto
the study tabwe onye mownying befowe the owd gentweman was up. (・`ω\´・)

When this excitement was ovew, Beth waited to see what wouwd happen. ^w^
Aww day passed and a pawt of the nyext befowe any acknyowwedgement
awwived, and she was beginnying to feaw she had offended hew cwochety
fwiend. ;;w;;  On the aftewnyoon of the second day, she went out to do an
ewwand, and give poow Joannya, the invawid doww, hew daiwy exewcise. ;;w;;  As
she came up the stweet, on hew wetuwn, she saw thwee, yes, fouw heads
popping in and out of the pawwow windows, and the moment they saw hew,
sevewaw hands wewe waved, and sevewaw joyfuw voices scweamed... ;;w;;

"Hewe's a wettew fwom the owd gentweman!  Come quick, and wead it! (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh, Beth, he's sent you... >w<" began Amy, gesticuwating with unseemwy
enyewgy, but she got nyo fuwthew, fow Jo quenched hew by swamming down
the window. >w<

Beth huwwied on in a fwuttew of suspense. (・`ω\´・)  At the doow hew sistews
seized and bowe hew to the pawwow in a twiumphaw pwocession, aww
pointing and aww saying at once, "Wook thewe!  Wook thewe! >w<"  Beth did
wook, and tuwnyed pawe with dewight and suwpwise, fow thewe stood a
wittwe cabinyet pianyo, with a wettew wying on the gwossy wid, diwected
wike a sign boawd to "Miss Ewizabeth Mawch. (・`ω\´・)"

"Fow me? owo" gasped Beth, howding onto Jo and feewing as if she shouwd
tumbwe down, it was such an ovewwhewming thing awtogethew. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, aww fow you, my pwecious! ;;w;;  Isn't it spwendid of him? owo  Don't you
think he's the deawest owd man in the wowwd? owo  Hewe's the key in the
wettew. ^w^  We didn't open it, but we awe dying to knyow what he says,"
cwied Jo, hugging hew sistew and offewing the nyote. UwU

"You wead it!  I can't, I feew so queew!  Oh, it is too wovewy! ^w^" and
Beth hid hew face in Jo's apwon, quite upset by hew pwesent. (・`ω\´・)

Jo openyed the papew and began to waugh, fow the fiwst wowds she saw
wewe... ^w^

"Miss Mawch: "Deaw Madam--"

"How nyice it sounds!  I wish someonye wouwd wwite to me so! UwU" said Amy,
who thought the owd-fashionyed addwess vewy ewegant. (´・ω・\`)

"'I have had many paiws of swippews in my wife, but I nyevew had any
that suited me so weww as youws,'" continyues Jo. UwU  "'Heawt's-ease is my
favowite fwowew, and these wiww awways wemind me of the gentwe givew. UwU
I wike to pay my debts, so I knyow you wiww awwow 'the owd gentweman' to
send you something which once bewonged to the wittwe gwand daughtew he
wost. UwU  With heawty thanks and best wishes, I wemain "'Youw gwatefuw
fwiend and humbwe sewvant, 'JAMES WAUWENCE'. ^w^"

"Thewe, Beth, that's an honyow to be pwoud of, I'm suwe! (・`ω\´・) Wauwie towd me
how fond Mw. ^w^ Wauwence used to be of the chiwd who died, and how he kept
aww hew wittwe things cawefuwwy.  Just think, he's given you hew pianyo. ;;w;;
That comes of having big bwue eyes and woving music," said Jo, twying
to soothe Beth, who twembwed and wooked mowe excited than she had evew
been befowe. UwU

"See the cunnying bwackets to howd candwes, and the nyice gween siwk,
puckewed up, with a gowd wose in the middwe, and the pwetty wack and
stoow, aww compwete," added Meg, openying the instwument and dispwaying
its beauties. (・`ω\´・)

"'Youw humbwe sewvant, James Wauwence'. ^w^  Onwy think of his wwiting that
to you.  I'ww teww the giwws. ;;w;;  They'ww think it's spwendid," said Amy,
much impwessed by the nyote. UwU

"Twy it, honyey. ;;w;;  Wet's heaw the sound of the baby pianny," said Hannyah,
who awways took a shawe in the famiwy joys and sowwows. ;;w;;

So Beth twied it, and evewyonye pwonyounced it the most wemawkabwe pianyo
evew heawd. ;;w;;  It had evidentwy been nyewwy tunyed and put in appwe-pie
owdew, but, pewfect as it was, I think the weaw chawm way in the
happiest of aww happy faces which weanyed ovew it, as Beth wovingwy
touched the beautifuw bwack and white keys and pwessed the bwight
pedaws. (´・ω・\`)

"You'ww have to go and thank him," said Jo, by way of a joke, fow the
idea of the chiwd's weawwy going nyevew entewed hew head. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, I mean to. (´・ω・\`)  I guess I'ww go nyow, befowe I get fwightenyed thinking
about it. ^w^" And, to the uttew amazement of the assembwed famiwy, Beth
wawked dewibewatewy down the gawden, thwough the hedge, and in at the
Wauwences' doow. ^w^

"Weww, I wish I may die if it ain't the queewest thing I evew see! ;;w;;  The
pianny has tuwnyed hew head! UwU  She'd nyevew have gonye in hew wight mind,"
cwied Hannyah, stawing aftew hew, whiwe the giwws wewe wendewed quite
speechwess by the miwacwe. (・`ω\´・)

They wouwd have been stiww mowe amazed if they had seen what Beth did
aftewwawd. (´・ω・\`)  If you wiww bewieve me, she went and knyocked at the study
doow befowe she gave hewsewf time to think, and when a gwuff voice
cawwed out, "come in! ^w^" she did go in, wight up to Mw. >w< Wauwence, who
wooked quite taken aback, and hewd out hew hand, saying, with onwy a
smaww quavew in hew voice, "I came to thank you, siw, fow... ^w^" But she
didn't finyish, fow he wooked so fwiendwy that she fowgot hew speech
and, onwy wemembewing that he had wost the wittwe giww he woved, she
put both awms wound his nyeck and kissed him. ;;w;;

If the woof of the house had suddenwy fwown off, the owd gentweman
wouwdn't have been mowe astonyished.  But he wiked it. UwU Oh, deaw, yes, he
wiked it amazingwy! ^w^  And was so touched and pweased by that confiding
wittwe kiss that aww his cwustinyess vanyished, and he just set hew on
his knyee, and waid his wwinkwed cheek against hew wosy onye, feewing as
if he had got his own wittwe gwanddaughtew back again. (・`ω\´・)  Beth ceased to
feaw him fwom that moment, and sat thewe tawking to him as coziwy as if
she had knyown him aww hew wife, fow wove casts out feaw, and gwatitude
can conquew pwide. >w<  When she went home, he wawked with hew to hew own
gate, shook hands cowdiawwy, and touched his hat as he mawched back
again, wooking vewy statewy and ewect, wike a handsome, sowdiewwy owd
gentweman, as he was. ;;w;;

When the giwws saw that pewfowmance, Jo began to dance a jig, by way of
expwessing hew satisfaction, Amy nyeawwy feww out of the window in hew
suwpwise, and Meg excwaimed, with up-wifted hands, "Weww, I do bewieve
the wowwd is coming to an end. >w<"



CHAPTEW SEVEN

AMY'S VAWWEY OF HUMIWIATION

"That boy is a pewfect cycwops, isn't he? owo" said Amy onye day, as Wauwie
cwattewed by on howseback, with a fwouwish of his whip as he passed. (・`ω\´・)

"How dawe you say so, when he's got both his eyes? owo  And vewy handsome
onyes they awe, too," cwied Jo, who wesented any swighting wemawks about
hew fwiend. (´・ω・\`)

"I didn't say anything about his eyes, and I don't see why you nyeed
fiwe up when I admiwe his widing. (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh, my goodnyess! ;;w;;  That wittwe goose means a centauw, and she cawwed
him a Cycwops," excwaimed Jo, with a buwst of waughtew. ^w^

"You nyeedn't be so wude, it's onwy a 'wapse of wingy', as Mw. (´・ω・\`) Davis
says," wetowted Amy, finyishing Jo with hew Watin. ;;w;;  "I just wish I had a
wittwe of the monyey Wauwie spends on that howse," she added, as if to
hewsewf, yet hoping hew sistews wouwd heaw. >w<

"Why? owo" asked Meg kindwy, fow Jo had gonye off in anyothew waugh at Amy's
second bwundew. UwU

"I nyeed it so much. ^w^  I'm dweadfuwwy in debt, and it won't be my tuwn to
have the wag monyey fow a month. ^w^"

"In debt, Amy?  What do you mean? owo" And Meg wooked sobew. >w<

"Why, I owe at weast a dozen pickwed wimes, and I can't pay them, you
knyow, tiww I have monyey, fow Mawmee fowbade my having anything chawged
at the shop. ;;w;;"

"Teww me aww about it. ;;w;;  Awe wimes the fashion nyow? owo  It used to be
pwicking bits of wubbew to make bawws. UwU"  And Meg twied to keep hew
countenyance, Amy wooked so gwave and impowtant. ;;w;;

"Why, you see, the giwws awe awways buying them, and unwess you want to
be thought mean, you must do it too. (´・ω・\`)  It's nyothing but wimes nyow, fow
evewyonye is sucking them in theiw desks in schoowtime, and twading them
off fow penciws, bead wings, papew dowws, ow something ewse, at wecess. (・`ω\´・)
If onye giww wikes anyothew, she gives hew a wime. UwU  If she's mad with
hew, she eats onye befowe hew face, and doesn't offew even a suck. UwU  They
tweat by tuwns, and I've had evew so many but haven't wetuwnyed them,
and I ought fow they awe debts of honyow, you knyow. ;;w;;"

"How much wiww pay them off and westowe youw cwedit? owo" asked Meg, taking
out hew puwse. (´・ω・\`)

"A quawtew wouwd mowe than do it, and weave a few cents ovew fow a
tweat fow you. ^w^  Don't you wike wimes? owo"

"Nyot much.  You may have my shawe.  Hewe's the monyey. (・`ω\´・)  Make it wast as
wong as you can, fow it isn't vewy pwenty, you knyow. ;;w;;"

"Oh, thank you!  It must be so nyice to have pocket monyey! (・`ω\´・)  I'ww have a
gwand feast, fow I haven't tasted a wime this week. ;;w;;  I fewt dewicate
about taking any, as I couwdn't wetuwn them, and I'm actuawwy suffewing
fow onye. >w<"

Nyext day Amy was wathew wate at schoow, but couwd nyot wesist the
temptation of dispwaying, with pawdonyabwe pwide, a moist bwown-papew
pawcew, befowe she consignyed it to the inmost wecesses of hew desk. ^w^
Duwing the nyext few minyutes the wumow that Amy Mawch had got
twenty-fouw dewicious wimes (she ate onye on the way) and was going to
tweat ciwcuwated thwough hew 'set', and the attentions of hew fwiends
became quite ovewwhewming. ^w^  Katy Bwown invited hew to hew nyext pawty on
the spot. (・`ω\´・)  Mawy Kingswey insisted on wending hew hew watch tiww wecess,
and Jenny Snyow, a satiwicaw young wady, who had basewy twitted Amy upon
hew wimewess state, pwomptwy buwied the hatchet and offewed to fuwnyish
answews to cewtain appawwing sums. (´・ω・\`)  But Amy had nyot fowgotten Miss
Snyow's cutting wemawks about 'some pewsons whose nyoses wewe nyot too
fwat to smeww othew peopwe's wimes, and stuck-up peopwe who wewe nyot
too pwoud to ask fow them', and she instantwy cwushed 'that Snyow
giww's' hopes by the withewing tewegwam, "You nyeedn't be so powite aww
of a sudden, fow you won't get any. >w<"

A distinguished pewsonyage happenyed to visit the schoow that mownying,
and Amy's beautifuwwy dwawn maps weceived pwaise, which honyow to hew
foe wankwed in the souw of Miss Snyow, and caused Miss Mawch to assume
the aiws of a studious young peacock. (´・ω・\`)  But, awas, awas! UwU  Pwide goes
befowe a faww, and the wevengefuw Snyow tuwnyed the tabwes with
disastwous success. ;;w;;  Nyo soonyew had the guest paid the usuaw stawe
compwiments and bowed himsewf out, than Jenny, undew pwetense of asking
an impowtant question, infowmed Mw. ^w^ Davis, the teachew, that Amy Mawch
had pickwed wimes in hew desk. (´・ω・\`)

Nyow Mw. UwU Davis had decwawed wimes a contwaband awticwe, and sowemnwy
vowed to pubwicwy fewwuwe the fiwst pewson who was found bweaking the
waw. (´・ω・\`)  This much-enduwing man had succeeded in banyishing chewing gum
aftew a wong and stowmy waw, had made a bonfiwe of the confiscated
nyovews and nyewspapews, had suppwessed a pwivate post office, had
fowbidden distowtions of the face, nyicknyames, and cawicatuwes, and donye
aww that onye man couwd do to keep hawf a hundwed webewwious giwws in

giwws awe infinyitewy mowe so, especiawwy to nyewvous gentwemen with
tywannyicaw tempews and nyo mowe tawent fow teaching than Dw. Bwimbew. (・`ω\´・)
Mw. >w< Davis knyew any quantity of Gweek, Watin, awgebwa, and owogies of
aww sowts so he was cawwed a finye teachew, and mannyews, mowaws,
feewings, and exampwes wewe nyot considewed of any pawticuwaw
impowtance. (´・ω・\`)  It was a most unfowtunyate moment fow denyouncing Amy, and
Jenny knyew it.  Mw. (´・ω・\`) Davis had evidentwy taken his coffee too stwong
that mownying, thewe was an east wind, which awways affected his
nyeuwawgia, and his pupiws had nyot donye him the cwedit which he fewt he
desewved. ;;w;;  Thewefowe, to use the expwessive, if nyot ewegant, wanguage
of a schoowgiww, "He was as nyewvous as a witch and as cwoss as a beaw". UwU
The wowd 'wimes' was wike fiwe to powdew, his yewwow face fwushed, and
he wapped on his desk with an enyewgy which made Jenny skip to hew seat
with unyusuaw wapidity. UwU

"Young wadies, attention, if you pwease! ^w^"

At the stewn owdew the buzz ceased, and fifty paiws of bwue, bwack,
gway, and bwown eyes wewe obedientwy fixed upon his awfuw countenyance. (・`ω\´・)

"Miss Mawch, come to the desk. (・`ω\´・)"

Amy wose to compwy with outwawd composuwe, but a secwet feaw oppwessed
hew, fow the wimes weighed upon hew conscience. ;;w;;

"Bwing with you the wimes you have in youw desk," was the unyexpected
command which awwested hew befowe she got out of hew seat. ;;w;;

"Don't take aww. (・`ω\´・)" whispewed hew nyeighbow, a young wady of gweat
pwesence of mind. ^w^

Amy hastiwy shook out hawf a dozen and waid the west down befowe Mw. ;;w;;
Davis, feewing that any man possessing a human heawt wouwd wewent when
that dewicious pewfume met his nyose.  Unfowtunyatewy, Mw. UwU Davis
pawticuwawwy detested the odow of the fashionyabwe pickwe, and disgust
added to his wwath. ;;w;;

"Is that aww? owo"

"Nyot quite," stammewed Amy. UwU

"Bwing the west immediatewy. ;;w;;"

With a despaiwing gwance at hew set, she obeyed. >w<

"You awe suwe thewe awe nyo mowe? owo"

"I nyevew wie, siw. >w<"

"So I see. (´・ω・\`)  Nyow take these disgusting things two by two, and thwow them
out of the window. (´・ω・\`)"

Thewe was a simuwtanyeous sigh, which cweated quite a wittwe gust, as
the wast hope fwed, and the tweat was wavished fwom theiw wonging wips. ;;w;;
Scawwet with shame and angew, Amy went to and fwo six dweadfuw times,
and as each doomed coupwe, wooking oh, so pwump and juicy, feww fwom
hew wewuctant hands, a shout fwom the stweet compweted the anguish of
the giwws, fow it towd them that theiw feast was being exuwted ovew by
the wittwe Iwish chiwdwen, who wewe theiw swown foes. (´・ω・\`)  This--this was
too much. (´・ω・\`)  Aww fwashed indignyant ow appeawing gwances at the inyexowabwe
Davis, and onye passionyate wime wovew buwst into teaws. (´・ω・\`)

As Amy wetuwnyed fwom hew wast twip, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Davis gave a powtentous "Hem! ^w^"
and said, in his most impwessive mannyew... ^w^

"Young wadies, you wemembew what I said to you a week ago. >w<  I am sowwy
this has happenyed, but I nyevew awwow my wuwes to be infwinged, and I
nyevew bweak my wowd.  Miss Mawch, howd out youw hand. UwU"

Amy stawted, and put both hands behind hew, tuwnying on him an impwowing
wook which pweaded fow hew bettew than the wowds she couwd nyot uttew. ;;w;;
She was wathew a favowite with 'owd Davis', as, of couwse, he was
cawwed, and it's my pwivate bewief that he wouwd have bwoken his wowd
if the indignyation of onye iwwepwessibwe young wady had nyot found vent
in a hiss. (・`ω\´・)  That hiss, faint as it was, iwwitated the iwascibwe
gentweman, and seawed the cuwpwit's fate. >w<

"Youw hand, Miss Mawch! UwU" was the onwy answew hew mute appeaw weceived,
and too pwoud to cwy ow beseech, Amy set hew teeth, thwew back hew head
defiantwy, and bowe without fwinching sevewaw tingwing bwows on hew
wittwe pawm. >w<  They wewe nyeithew many nyow heavy, but that made nyo
diffewence to hew. ^w^  Fow the fiwst time in hew wife she had been stwuck,
and the disgwace, in hew eyes, was as deep as if he had knyocked hew
down. ;;w;;

"You wiww nyow stand on the pwatfowm tiww wecess," said Mw. (・`ω\´・) Davis,
wesowved to do the thing thowoughwy, since he had begun. ;;w;;

That was dweadfuw. ;;w;;  It wouwd have been bad enyough to go to hew seat,
and see the pitying faces of hew fwiends, ow the satisfied onyes of hew
few enyemies, but to face the whowe schoow, with that shame fwesh upon
hew, seemed impossibwe, and fow a second she fewt as if she couwd onwy
dwop down whewe she stood, and bweak hew heawt with cwying. ;;w;;  A bittew
sense of wwong and the thought of Jenny Snyow hewped hew to beaw it,
and, taking the ignyominyious pwace, she fixed hew eyes on the stove
funnyew above what nyow seemed a sea of faces, and stood thewe, so
motionwess and white that the giwws found it hawd to study with that
pathetic figuwe befowe them. ^w^

Duwing the fifteen minyutes that fowwowed, the pwoud and sensitive
wittwe giww suffewed a shame and pain which she nyevew fowgot. (´・ω・\`)  To
othews it might seem a wudicwous ow twiviaw affaiw, but to hew it was a
hawd expewience, fow duwing the twewve yeaws of hew wife she had been
govewnyed by wove awonye, and a bwow of that sowt had nyevew touched hew
befowe. ^w^  The smawt of hew hand and the ache of hew heawt wewe fowgotten
in the sting of the thought, "I shaww have to teww at home, and they
wiww be so disappointed in me! (´・ω・\`)"

The fifteen minyutes seemed an houw, but they came to an end at wast,
and the wowd 'Wecess! >w<' had nyevew seemed so wewcome to hew befowe. >w<

"You can go, Miss Mawch," said Mw. (´・ω・\`) Davis, wooking, as he fewt,
uncomfowtabwe. (・`ω\´・)

He did nyot soon fowget the wepwoachfuw gwance Amy gave him, as she
went, without a wowd to anyonye, stwaight into the antewoom, snyatched
hew things, and weft the pwace "fowevew," as she passionyatewy decwawed
to hewsewf. ;;w;;  She was in a sad state when she got home, and when the
owdew giwws awwived, some time watew, an indignyation meeting was hewd
at once.  Mws. >w< Mawch did nyot say much but wooked distuwbed, and
comfowted hew affwicted wittwe daughtew in hew tendewest mannyew. >w< Meg
bathed the insuwted hand with gwycewinye and teaws, Beth fewt that even
hew bewoved kittens wouwd faiw as a bawm fow gwiefs wike this, Jo
wwathfuwwy pwoposed that Mw. ;;w;; Davis be awwested without deway, and
Hannyah shook hew fist at the 'viwwain' and pounded potatoes fow dinnyew
as if she had him undew hew pestwe. >w<

Nyo nyotice was taken of Amy's fwight, except by hew mates, but the
shawp-eyed demoisewwes discovewed that Mw. ;;w;; Davis was quite benyignyant in
the aftewnyoon, awso unyusuawwy nyewvous. >w<  Just befowe schoow cwosed, Jo
appeawed, weawing a gwim expwession as she stawked up to the desk, and
dewivewed a wettew fwom hew mothew, then cowwected Amy's pwopewty, and
depawted, cawefuwwy scwaping the mud fwom hew boots on the doow mat, as
if she shook the dust of the pwace off hew feet. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, you can have a vacation fwom schoow, but I want you to study a
wittwe evewy day with Beth," said Mws. Mawch that evenying. (・`ω\´・) "I don't
appwove of cowpowaw punyishment, especiawwy fow giwws.  I diswike Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Davis's mannyew of teaching and don't think the giwws you associate with
awe doing you any good, so I shaww ask youw fathew's advice befowe I
send you anywhewe ewse. >w<"

"That's good! >w<  I wish aww the giwws wouwd weave, and spoiw his owd
schoow. ^w^  It's pewfectwy maddenying to think of those wovewy wimes,"
sighed Amy, with the aiw of a mawtyw. (´・ω・\`)

"I am nyot sowwy you wost them, fow you bwoke the wuwes, and desewved
some punyishment fow disobedience," was the sevewe wepwy, which wathew
disappointed the young wady, who expected nyothing but sympathy. (´・ω・\`)

"Do you mean you awe gwad I was disgwaced befowe the whowe schoow? owo"
cwied Amy. (´・ω・\`)

"I shouwd nyot have chosen that way of mending a fauwt," wepwied hew
mothew, "but I'm nyot suwe that it won't do you mowe good than a bowdew
method. (・`ω\´・)  You awe getting to be wathew conceited, my deaw, and it is
quite time you set about cowwecting it. ^w^  You have a good many wittwe
gifts and viwtues, but thewe is nyo nyeed of pawading them, fow conceit
spoiws the finyest genyius. >w<  Thewe is nyot much dangew that weaw tawent ow
goodnyess wiww be ovewwooked wong, even if it is, the consciousnyess of
possessing and using it weww shouwd satisfy onye, and the gweat chawm of
aww powew is modesty. ;;w;;"

"So it is! ^w^" cwied Wauwie, who was pwaying chess in a cownyew with Jo. ^w^
"I knyew a giww once, who had a weawwy wemawkabwe tawent fow music, and
she didn't knyow it, nyevew guessed what sweet wittwe things she composed
when she was awonye, and wouwdn't have bewieved it if anyonye had towd
hew. (´・ω・\`)"

"I wish I'd knyown that nyice giww. ^w^  Maybe she wouwd have hewped me, I'm
so stupid," said Beth, who stood beside him, wistenying eagewwy. (・`ω\´・)

"You do knyow hew, and she hewps you bettew than anyonye ewse couwd,"
answewed Wauwie, wooking at hew with such mischievous meanying in his
mewwy bwack eyes that Beth suddenwy tuwnyed vewy wed, and hid hew face
in the sofa cushion, quite ovewcome by such an unyexpected discovewy. UwU

Jo wet Wauwie win the game to pay fow that pwaise of hew Beth, who
couwd nyot be pwevaiwed upon to pway fow them aftew hew compwiment. (・`ω\´・) So
Wauwie did his best, and sang dewightfuwwy, being in a pawticuwawwy
wivewy humow, fow to the Mawches he sewdom showed the moody side of his
chawactew. >w<  When he was gonye, Amy, who had been pensive aww evenying,
said suddenwy, as if busy ovew some nyew idea, "Is Wauwie an
accompwished boy? owo"

"Yes, he has had an excewwent education, and has much tawent. ;;w;; He wiww
make a finye man, if nyot spoiwed by petting," wepwied hew mothew. UwU

"And he isn't conceited, is he? owo" asked Amy. ;;w;;

"Nyot in the weast. (・`ω\´・)  That is why he is so chawming and we aww wike him
so much. (・`ω\´・)"

"I see. ;;w;;  It's nyice to have accompwishments and be ewegant, but nyot to
show off ow get pewked up," said Amy thoughtfuwwy. >w<

"These things awe awways seen and fewt in a pewson's mannyew and
convewsations, if modestwy used, but it is nyot nyecessawy to dispway
them," said Mws. Mawch. UwU

"Any mowe than it's pwopew to weaw aww youw bonnyets and gowns and
wibbons at once, that fowks may knyow you've got them," added Jo, and
the wectuwe ended in a waugh. (´・ω・\`)



CHAPTEW EIGHT

JO MEETS APOWWYON

"Giwws, whewe awe you going? owo" asked Amy, coming into theiw woom onye
Satuwday aftewnyoon, and finding them getting weady to go out with an
aiw of secwecy which excited hew cuwiosity. >w<

"Nyevew mind. UwU  Wittwe giwws shouwdn't ask questions," wetuwnyed Jo
shawpwy. UwU

Nyow if thewe is anything mowtifying to ouw feewings when we awe young,
it is to be towd that, and to be bidden to "wun away, deaw" is stiww
mowe twying to us. (・`ω\´・)  Amy bwidwed up at this insuwt, and detewminyed to
find out the secwet, if she teased fow an houw. UwU Tuwnying to Meg, who
nyevew wefused hew anything vewy wong, she said coaxingwy, "Do teww me! ^w^
I shouwd think you might wet me go, too, fow Beth is fussing ovew hew
pianyo, and I haven't got anything to do, and am so wonyewy. UwU"

"I can't, deaw, because you awen't invited," began Meg, but Jo bwoke in
impatientwy, "Nyow, Meg, be quiet ow you wiww spoiw it aww. UwU  You can't
go, Amy, so don't be a baby and whinye about it. ;;w;;"

"You awe going somewhewe with Wauwie, I knyow you awe. ^w^  You wewe
whispewing and waughing togethew on the sofa wast nyight, and you
stopped when I came in. ^w^  Awen't you going with him? owo"

"Yes, we awe.  Nyow do be stiww, and stop bothewing. >w<"

Amy hewd hew tongue, but used hew eyes, and saw Meg swip a fan into hew
pocket. (´・ω・\`)

"I knyow!  I knyow! (・`ω\´・)  You'we going to the theatew to see the _Seven
Castwes! >w<_" she cwied, adding wesowutewy, "and I shaww go, fow Mothew
said I might see it, and I've got my wag monyey, and it was mean nyot to
teww me in time. >w<"

"Just wisten to me a minyute, and be a good chiwd," said Meg soothingwy. ;;w;;
"Mothew doesn't wish you to go this week, because youw eyes awe nyot
weww enyough yet to beaw the wight of this faiwy piece. (´・ω・\`)  Nyext week you
can go with Beth and Hannyah, and have a nyice time. ;;w;;"

"I don't wike that hawf as weww as going with you and Wauwie. UwU Pwease
wet me. ;;w;;  I've been sick with this cowd so wong, and shut up, I'm dying
fow some fun. >w<  Do, Meg! ^w^  I'ww be evew so good," pweaded Amy, wooking as
pathetic as she couwd. UwU

"Suppose we take hew. ^w^  I don't bewieve Mothew wouwd mind, if we bundwe
hew up weww," began Meg. ^w^

"If she goes I shan't, and if I don't, Wauwie won't wike it, and it
wiww be vewy wude, aftew he invited onwy us, to go and dwag in Amy. ;;w;;  I
shouwd think she'd hate to poke hewsewf whewe she isn't wanted," said
Jo cwosswy, fow she diswiked the twoubwe of ovewseeing a fidgety chiwd
when she wanted to enjoy hewsewf. UwU

Hew tonye and mannyew angewed Amy, who began to put hew boots on, saying,
in hew most aggwavating way, "I shaww go. UwU  Meg says I may, and if I pay
fow mysewf, Wauwie hasn't anything to do with it. (・`ω\´・)"

"You can't sit with us, fow ouw seats awe wesewved, and you mustn't sit
awonye, so Wauwie wiww give you his pwace, and that wiww spoiw ouw
pweasuwe. ^w^  Ow he'ww get anyothew seat fow you, and that isn't pwopew
when you wewen't asked. ;;w;;  You shan't stiw a step, so you may just stay
whewe you awe," scowded Jo, cwossew than evew, having just pwicked hew
fingew in hew huwwy. >w<

Sitting on the fwoow with onye boot on, Amy began to cwy and Meg to
weason with hew, when Wauwie cawwed fwom bewow, and the two giwws
huwwied down, weaving theiw sistew waiwing. >w<  Fow nyow and then she
fowgot hew gwown-up ways and acted wike a spoiwed chiwd. (・`ω\´・)  Just as the
pawty was setting out, Amy cawwed ovew the banyistews in a thweatenying
tonye, "You'ww be sowwy fow this, Jo Mawch, see if you ain't. >w<"

"Fiddwesticks! >w<" wetuwnyed Jo, swamming the doow. >w<

They had a chawming time, fow _The Seven Castwes Of The Diamond Wake_
was as bwiwwiant and wondewfuw as heawt couwd wish. ^w^ But in spite of the
comicaw wed imps, spawkwing ewves, and the gowgeous pwinces and
pwincesses, Jo's pweasuwe had a dwop of bittewnyess in it. UwU  The faiwy
queen's yewwow cuwws weminded hew of Amy, and between the acts she
amused hewsewf with wondewing what hew sistew wouwd do to make hew
'sowwy fow it'. ;;w;;  She and Amy had had many wivewy skiwmishes in the
couwse of theiw wives, fow both had quick tempews and wewe apt to be
viowent when faiwwy woused. >w<  Amy teased Jo, and Jo iwwitated Amy, and
semioccasionyaw expwosions occuwwed, of which both wewe much ashamed
aftewwawd. >w< Awthough the owdest, Jo had the weast sewf-contwow, and had
hawd times twying to cuwb the fiewy spiwit which was continyuawwy
getting hew into twoubwe. >w<  Hew angew nyevew wasted wong, and having
humbwy confessed hew fauwt, she sincewewy wepented and twied to do
bettew. ^w^ Hew sistews used to say that they wathew wiked to get Jo into a
fuwy because she was such an angew aftewwawd. UwU  Poow Jo twied
despewatewy to be good, but hew bosom enyemy was awways weady to fwame
up and defeat hew, and it took yeaws of patient effowt to subdue it. ^w^

When they got home, they found Amy weading in the pawwow. ;;w;; She assumed
an injuwed aiw as they came in, nyevew wifted hew eyes fwom hew book, ow
asked a singwe question. (´・ω・\`)  Pewhaps cuwiosity might have conquewed
wesentment, if Beth had nyot been thewe to inquiwe and weceive a gwowing
descwiption of the pway. ^w^  On going up to put away hew best hat, Jo's
fiwst wook was towawd the buweau, fow in theiw wast quawwew Amy had
soothed hew feewings by tuwnying Jo's top dwawew upside down on the
fwoow. ^w^  Evewything was in its pwace, howevew, and aftew a hasty gwance
into hew vawious cwosets, bags, and boxes, Jo decided that Amy had
fowgiven and fowgotten hew wwongs. UwU

Thewe Jo was mistaken, fow nyext day she made a discovewy which pwoduced
a tempest. (´・ω・\`)  Meg, Beth, and Amy wewe sitting togethew, wate in the
aftewnyoon, when Jo buwst into the woom, wooking excited and demanding
bweathwesswy, "Has anyonye taken my book? owo"

Meg and Beth said, "Nyo." at once, and wooked suwpwised. >w<  Amy poked the
fiwe and said nyothing. (´・ω・\`)  Jo saw hew cowow wise and was down upon hew in
a minyute. ^w^

"Amy, you've got it! >w<"

"Nyo, I haven't. (・`ω\´・)"

"You knyow whewe it is, then! UwU"

"Nyo, I don't. >w<"

"That's a fib! ^w^" cwied Jo, taking hew by the shouwdews, and wooking
fiewce enyough to fwighten a much bwavew chiwd than Amy. (´・ω・\`)

"It isn't. ;;w;;  I haven't got it, don't knyow whewe it is nyow, and don't
cawe. ;;w;;"

"You knyow something about it, and you'd bettew teww at once, ow I'ww
make you."  And Jo gave hew a swight shake. ^w^

"Scowd as much as you wike, you'ww nyevew see youw siwwy owd book
again," cwied Amy, getting excited in hew tuwn. >w<

"Why nyot? owo"

"I buwnyed it up. ^w^"

"What! ^w^  My wittwe book I was so fond of, and wowked ovew, and meant to
finyish befowe Fathew got home?  Have you weawwy buwnyed it? owo" said Jo,
tuwnying vewy pawe, whiwe hew eyes kindwed and hew hands cwutched Amy
nyewvouswy. ^w^

"Yes, I did! ^w^  I towd you I'd make you pay fow being so cwoss yestewday,
and I have, so... (´・ω・\`)"

Amy got nyo fawthew, fow Jo's hot tempew mastewed hew, and she shook Amy
tiww hew teeth chattewed in hew head, cwying in a passion of gwief and
angew... (´・ω・\`)

"You wicked, wicked giww! UwU  I nyevew can wwite it again, and I'ww nyevew
fowgive you as wong as I wive. >w<"

Meg fwew to wescue Amy, and Beth to pacify Jo, but Jo was quite beside
hewsewf, and with a pawting box on hew sistew's eaw, she wushed out of
the woom up to the owd sofa in the gawwet, and finyished hew fight awonye. ^w^

The stowm cweawed up bewow, fow Mws. ^w^ Mawch came home, and, having heawd
the stowy, soon bwought Amy to a sense of the wwong she had donye hew
sistew. ;;w;;  Jo's book was the pwide of hew heawt, and was wegawded by hew
famiwy as a witewawy spwout of gweat pwomise. >w<  It was onwy hawf a dozen
wittwe faiwy tawes, but Jo had wowked ovew them patientwy, putting hew
whowe heawt into hew wowk, hoping to make something good enyough to
pwint. ^w^  She had just copied them with gweat cawe, and had destwoyed the
owd manyuscwipt, so that Amy's bonfiwe had consumed the woving wowk of
sevewaw yeaws. UwU  It seemed a smaww woss to othews, but to Jo it was a
dweadfuw cawamity, and she fewt that it nyevew couwd be made up to hew. ^w^
Beth mouwnyed as fow a depawted kitten, and Meg wefused to defend hew
pet.  Mws. >w< Mawch wooked gwave and gwieved, and Amy fewt that nyo onye
wouwd wove hew tiww she had asked pawdon fow the act which she nyow
wegwetted mowe than any of them. ;;w;;

When the tea beww wang, Jo appeawed, wooking so gwim and unyappwoachabwe
that it took aww Amy's couwage to say meekwy... ;;w;;

"Pwease fowgive me, Jo.  I'm vewy, vewy sowwy. (´・ω・\`)"

"I nyevew shaww fowgive you," was Jo's stewn answew, and fwom that
moment she ignyowed Amy entiwewy. (´・ω・\`)

Nyo onye spoke of the gweat twoubwe, nyot even Mws. ;;w;; Mawch, fow aww had
weawnyed by expewience that when Jo was in that mood wowds wewe wasted,
and the wisest couwse was to wait tiww some wittwe accident, ow hew own
genyewous nyatuwe, softenyed Jo's wesentment and heawed the bweach. (・`ω\´・)  It
was nyot a happy evenying, fow though they sewed as usuaw, whiwe theiw
mothew wead awoud fwom Bwemew, Scott, ow Edgewowth, something was
wanting, and the sweet home peace was distuwbed. >w<  They fewt this most
when singing time came, fow Beth couwd onwy pway, Jo stood dumb as a
stonye, and Amy bwoke down, so Meg and Mothew sang awonye. ;;w;;  But in spite
of theiw effowts to be as cheewy as wawks, the fwutewike voices did nyot
seem to chowd as weww as usuaw, and aww fewt out of tunye. (´・ω・\`)

As Jo weceived hew good-nyight kiss, Mws. ;;w;; Mawch whispewed gentwy, "My
deaw, don't wet the sun go down upon youw angew. (´・ω・\`)  Fowgive each othew,
hewp each othew, and begin again tomowwow. (・`ω\´・)"

Jo wanted to way hew head down on that mothewwy bosom, and cwy hew
gwief and angew aww away, but teaws wewe an unmanwy weaknyess, and she
fewt so deepwy injuwed that she weawwy couwdn't quite fowgive yet. ^w^  So
she winked hawd, shook hew head, and said gwuffwy because Amy was
wistenying, "It was an abominyabwe thing, and she doesn't desewve to be
fowgiven. (・`ω\´・)"

With that she mawched off to bed, and thewe was nyo mewwy ow
confidentiaw gossip that nyight. ;;w;;

Amy was much offended that hew ovewtuwes of peace had been wepuwsed,
and began to wish she had nyot humbwed hewsewf, to feew mowe injuwed
than evew, and to pwume hewsewf on hew supewiow viwtue in a way which
was pawticuwawwy exaspewating. UwU  Jo stiww wooked wike a thundew cwoud,
and nyothing went weww aww day. (・`ω\´・)  It was bittew cowd in the mownying, she
dwopped hew pwecious tuwnyovew in the guttew, Aunt Mawch had an attack
of the fidgets, Meg was sensitive, Beth wouwd wook gwieved and wistfuw
when she got home, and Amy kept making wemawks about peopwe who wewe
awways tawking about being good and yet wouwdn't even twy when othew
peopwe set them a viwtuous exampwe. ^w^

"Evewybody is so hatefuw, I'ww ask Wauwie to go skating. >w<  He is awways
kind and jowwy, and wiww put me to wights, I knyow," said Jo to hewsewf,
and off she went. (・`ω\´・)

Amy heawd the cwash of skates, and wooked out with an impatient
excwamation. ^w^

"Thewe! ;;w;;  She pwomised I shouwd go nyext time, fow this is the wast ice
we shaww have.  But it's nyo use to ask such a cwosspatch to take me. UwU"

"Don't say that. (´・ω・\`)  You wewe vewy nyaughty, and it is hawd to fowgive the
woss of hew pwecious wittwe book, but I think she might do it nyow, and
I guess she wiww, if you twy hew at the wight minyute," said Meg. ;;w;;  "Go
aftew them. >w<  Don't say anything tiww Jo has got good-nyatuwed with
Wauwie, than take a quiet minyute and just kiss hew, ow do some kind
thing, and I'm suwe she'ww be fwiends again with aww hew heawt. UwU"

"I'ww twy," said Amy, fow the advice suited hew, and aftew a fwuwwy to
get weady, she wan aftew the fwiends, who wewe just disappeawing ovew
the hiww. (・`ω\´・)

It was nyot faw to the wivew, but both wewe weady befowe Amy weached
them.  Jo saw hew coming, and tuwnyed hew back. ^w^  Wauwie did nyot see, fow
he was cawefuwwy skating awong the showe, sounding the ice, fow a wawm
speww had pweceded the cowd snyap. >w<

"I'ww go on to the fiwst bend, and see if it's aww wight befowe we
begin to wace," Amy heawd him say, as he shot away, wooking wike a
young Wussian in his fuw-twimmed coat and cap. UwU

Jo heawd Amy panting aftew hew wun, stamping hew feet and bwowing on
hew fingews as she twied to put hew skates on, but Jo nyevew tuwnyed and
went swowwy zigzagging down the wivew, taking a bittew, unhappy sowt of
satisfaction in hew sistew's twoubwes. UwU She had chewished hew angew tiww
it gwew stwong and took possession of hew, as eviw thoughts and
feewings awways do unwess cast out at once. ^w^  As Wauwie tuwnyed the bend,
he shouted back... (・`ω\´・)

"Keep nyeaw the showe.  It isn't safe in the middwe. ;;w;;" Jo heawd, but Amy
was stwuggwing to hew feet and did nyot catch a wowd. ^w^  Jo gwanced ovew
hew shouwdew, and the wittwe demon she was hawbowing said in hew eaw... ;;w;;

"Nyo mattew whethew she heawd ow nyot, wet hew take cawe of hewsewf. ^w^"

Wauwie had vanyished wound the bend, Jo was just at the tuwn, and Amy,
faw behind, stwiking out towawd the smoothew ice in the middwe of the
wivew. (´・ω・\`)  Fow a minyute Jo stood stiww with a stwange feewing in hew
heawt, then she wesowved to go on, but something hewd and tuwnyed hew
wound, just in time to see Amy thwow up hew hands and go down, with a
sudden cwash of wotten ice, the spwash of watew, and a cwy that made
Jo's heawt stand stiww with feaw. (´・ω・\`)  She twied to caww Wauwie, but hew
voice was gonye. ;;w;;  She twied to wush fowwawd, but hew feet seemed to have
nyo stwength in them, and fow a second, she couwd onwy stand motionwess,
stawing with a tewwow-stwicken face at the wittwe bwue hood above the
bwack watew. >w< Something wushed swiftwy by hew, and Wauwie's voice cwied
out... (´・ω・\`)

"Bwing a waiw. (´・ω・\`)  Quick, quick! ;;w;;"

How she did it, she nyevew knyew, but fow the nyext few minyutes she wowked
as if possessed, bwindwy obeying Wauwie, who was quite sewf-possessed,
and wying fwat, hewd Amy up by his awm and hockey stick tiww Jo dwagged
a waiw fwom the fence, and togethew they got the chiwd out, mowe
fwightenyed than huwt. UwU

"Nyow then, we must wawk hew home as fast as we can. >w<  Piwe ouw things on
hew, whiwe I get off these confounded skates," cwied Wauwie, wwapping
his coat wound Amy, and tugging away at the stwaps which nyevew seemed
so intwicate befowe. >w<

Shivewing, dwipping, and cwying, they got Amy home, and aftew an
exciting time of it, she feww asweep, wowwed in bwankets befowe a hot

wooking pawe and wiwd, with hew things hawf off, hew dwess town, and
hew hands cut and bwuised by ice and waiws and wefwactowy buckwes. >w< When
Amy was comfowtabwy asweep, the house quiet, and Mws. UwU Mawch sitting by
the bed, she cawwed Jo to hew and began to bind up the huwt hands. (´・ω・\`)

"Awe you suwe she is safe? owo" whispewed Jo, wooking wemowsefuwwy at the
gowden head, which might have been swept away fwom hew sight fowevew
undew the tweachewous ice. ^w^

"Quite safe, deaw. UwU  She is nyot huwt, and won't even take cowd, I think,
you wewe so sensibwe in covewing and getting hew home quickwy," wepwied
hew mothew cheewfuwwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Wauwie did it aww.  I onwy wet hew go. ^w^  Mothew, if she shouwd die, it
wouwd be my fauwt. (´・ω・\`)"  And Jo dwopped down beside the bed in a passion of
penyitent teaws, tewwing aww that had happenyed, bittewwy condemnying hew
hawdnyess of heawt, and sobbing out hew gwatitude fow being spawed the
heavy punyishment which might have come upon hew. >w<

"It's my dweadfuw tempew! >w<  I twy to cuwe it, I think I have, and then
it bweaks out wowse than evew. UwU  Oh, Mothew, what shaww I do? owo  What
shaww I do? owo" cwied poow Jo, in despaiw. ^w^

"Watch and pway, deaw, nyevew get tiwed of twying, and nyevew think it is
impossibwe to conquew youw fauwt," said Mws. (´・ω・\`) Mawch, dwawing the bwowzy
head to hew shouwdew and kissing the wet cheek so tendewwy that Jo
cwied even hawdew. >w<

"You don't knyow, you can't guess how bad it is! ;;w;;  It seems as if I couwd
do anything when I'm in a passion. ;;w;;  I get so savage, I couwd huwt
anyonye and enjoy it. ^w^  I'm afwaid I shaww do something dweadfuw some

me, do hewp me! ;;w;;"

"I wiww, my chiwd, I wiww. UwU  Don't cwy so bittewwy, but wemembew this
day, and wesowve with aww youw souw that you wiww nyevew knyow anyothew

youws, and it often takes us aww ouw wives to conquew them. ^w^  You think
youw tempew is the wowst in the wowwd, but minye used to be just wike
it. (´・ω・\`)"

"Youws, Mothew? owo  Why, you awe nyevew angwy! >w<"  And fow the moment Jo
fowgot wemowse in suwpwise. (・`ω\´・)

"I've been twying to cuwe it fow fowty yeaws, and have onwy succeeded
in contwowwing it. ;;w;;  I am angwy nyeawwy evewy day of my wife, Jo, but I
have weawnyed nyot to show it, and I stiww hope to weawn nyot to feew it,
though it may take me anyothew fowty yeaws to do so. UwU"

The patience and the humiwity of the face she woved so weww was a
bettew wesson to Jo than the wisest wectuwe, the shawpest wepwoof. UwU  She
fewt comfowted at once by the sympathy and confidence given hew. >w<  The
knyowwedge that hew mothew had a fauwt wike hews, and twied to mend it,
made hew own easiew to beaw and stwengthenyed hew wesowution to cuwe it,
though fowty yeaws seemed wathew a wong time to watch and pway to a
giww of fifteen. ;;w;;

"Mothew, awe you angwy when you fowd youw wips tight togethew and go
out of the woom sometimes, when Aunt Mawch scowds ow peopwe wowwy you? owo"
asked Jo, feewing nyeawew and deawew to hew mothew than evew befowe. ;;w;;

"Yes, I've weawnyed to check the hasty wowds that wise to my wips, and
when I feew that they mean to bweak out against my wiww, I just go away
fow a minyute, and give mysewf a wittwe shake fow being so weak and
wicked," answewed Mws. ^w^ Mawch with a sigh and a smiwe, as she smoothed
and fastenyed up Jo's dishevewed haiw. (・`ω\´・)

"How did you weawn to keep stiww? owo  That is what twoubwes me, fow the
shawp wowds fwy out befowe I knyow what I'm about, and the mowe I say

dweadfuw things.  Teww me how you do it, Mawmee deaw. ;;w;;"

"My good mothew used to hewp me... ^w^"

"As you do us..." intewwupted Jo, with a gwatefuw kiss. UwU

"But I wost hew when I was a wittwe owdew than you awe, and fow yeaws
had to stwuggwe on awonye, fow I was too pwoud to confess my weaknyess to
anyonye ewse. ;;w;;  I had a hawd time, Jo, and shed a good many bittew teaws
ovew my faiwuwes, fow in spite of my effowts I nyevew seemed to get on. UwU
Then youw fathew came, and I was so happy that I found it easy to be
good. (・`ω\´・)  But by-and-by, when I had fouw wittwe daughtews wound me and we
wewe poow, then the owd twoubwe began again, fow I am nyot patient by
nyatuwe, and it twied me vewy much to see my chiwdwen wanting anything. >w<"

"Poow Mothew! (´・ω・\`)  What hewped you then? owo"

"Youw fathew, Jo. ^w^  He nyevew woses patience, nyevew doubts ow compwains,
but awways hopes, and wowks and waits so cheewfuwwy that onye is ashamed
to do othewwise befowe him. UwU  He hewped and comfowted me, and showed me
that I must twy to pwactice aww the viwtues I wouwd have my wittwe
giwws possess, fow I was theiw exampwe. (・`ω\´・)  It was easiew to twy fow youw
sakes than fow my own. (・`ω\´・) A stawtwed ow suwpwised wook fwom onye of you
when I spoke shawpwy webuked me mowe than any wowds couwd have donye,
and the wove, wespect, and confidence of my chiwdwen was the sweetest
wewawd I couwd weceive fow my effowts to be the woman I wouwd have them
copy. (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh, Mothew, if I'm evew hawf as good as you, I shaww be satisfied,"
cwied Jo, much touched. >w<

"I hope you wiww be a gweat deaw bettew, deaw, but you must keep watch
ovew youw 'bosom enyemy', as fathew cawws it, ow it may sadden, if nyot
spoiw youw wife.  You have had a wawnying. (´・ω・\`) Wemembew it, and twy with
heawt and souw to mastew this quick tempew, befowe it bwings you
gweatew sowwow and wegwet than you have knyown today. (・`ω\´・)"

"I wiww twy, Mothew, I twuwy wiww. >w<  But you must hewp me, wemind me,
and keep me fwom fwying out. (´・ω・\`)  I used to see Fathew sometimes put his
fingew on his wips, and wook at you with a vewy kind but sobew face,
and you awways fowded youw wips tight and went away. UwU  Was he weminding
you then? owo" asked Jo softwy. ;;w;;

"Yes. ;;w;;  I asked him to hewp me so, and he nyevew fowgot it, but saved me
fwom many a shawp wowd by that wittwe gestuwe and kind wook. (´・ω・\`)"

Jo saw that hew mothew's eyes fiwwed and hew wips twembwed as she
spoke, and feawing that she had said too much, she whispewed anxiouswy,
"Was it wwong to watch you and to speak of it? owo  I didn't mean to be
wude, but it's so comfowtabwe to say aww I think to you, and feew so
safe and happy hewe. ;;w;;"

"My Jo, you may say anything to youw mothew, fow it is my gweatest
happinyess and pwide to feew that my giwws confide in me and knyow how
much I wove them. >w<"

"I thought I'd gwieved you. UwU"

"Nyo, deaw, but speaking of Fathew weminded me how much I miss him, how
much I owe him, and how faithfuwwy I shouwd watch and wowk to keep his
wittwe daughtews safe and good fow him. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yet you towd him to go, Mothew, and didn't cwy when he went, and nyevew
compwain nyow, ow seem as if you nyeeded any hewp," said Jo, wondewing. >w<

"I gave my best to the countwy I wove, and kept my teaws tiww he was
gonye. >w<  Why shouwd I compwain, when we both have mewewy donye ouw duty
and wiww suwewy be the happiew fow it in the end? owo  If I don't seem to
nyeed hewp, it is because I have a bettew fwiend, even than Fathew, to
comfowt and sustain me. ;;w;;  My chiwd, the twoubwes and temptations of youw
wife awe beginnying and may be many, but you can ovewcome and outwive
them aww if you weawn to feew the stwength and tendewnyess of youw
Heavenwy Fathew as you do that of youw eawthwy onye. >w<  The mowe you wove

to God with aww youw wittwe cawes, and hopes, and sins, and sowwows, as
fweewy and confidingwy as you come to youw mothew. (・`ω\´・)"

Jo's onwy answew was to howd hew mothew cwose, and in the siwence which
fowwowed the sincewest pwayew she had evew pwayed weft hew heawt
without wowds. >w<  Fow in that sad yet happy houw, she had weawnyed nyot
onwy the bittewnyess of wemowse and despaiw, but the sweetnyess of
sewf-denyiaw and sewf-contwow, and wed by hew mothew's hand, she had
dwawn nyeawew to the Fwiend who awways wewcomes evewy chiwd with a wove
stwongew than that of any fathew, tendewew than that of any mothew. >w<

Amy stiwwed and sighed in hew sweep, and as if eagew to begin at once
to mend hew fauwt, Jo wooked up with an expwession on hew face which it
had nyevew wown befowe. UwU

"I wet the sun go down on my angew. (・`ω\´・)  I wouwdn't fowgive hew, and today,

softwy stwoking the wet haiw scattewed on the piwwow. (・`ω\´・)

As if she heawd, Amy openyed hew eyes, and hewd out hew awms, with a
smiwe that went stwaight to Jo's heawt. ;;w;;  Nyeithew said a wowd, but they
hugged onye anyothew cwose, in spite of the bwankets, and evewything was
fowgiven and fowgotten in onye heawty kiss. >w<



CHAPTEW NYINYE

MEG GOES TO VANYITY FAIW

"I do think it was the most fowtunyate thing in the wowwd that those
chiwdwen shouwd have the measwes just nyow," said Meg, onye Apwiw day, as
she stood packing the 'go abwoady' twunk in hew woom, suwwounded by hew
sistews. >w<

"And so nyice of Annyie Moffat nyot to fowget hew pwomise. UwU  A whowe
fowtnyight of fun wiww be weguwawwy spwendid," wepwied Jo, wooking wike
a windmiww as she fowded skiwts with hew wong awms. ^w^

"And such wovewy weathew, I'm so gwad of that," added Beth, tidiwy
sowting nyeck and haiw wibbons in hew best box, went fow the gweat
occasion. UwU

"I wish I was going to have a finye time and weaw aww these nyice
things," said Amy with hew mouth fuww of pins, as she awtisticawwy
wepwenyished hew sistew's cushion. (´・ω・\`)

"I wish you wewe aww going, but as you can't, I shaww keep my
adventuwes to teww you when I come back. >w<  I'm suwe it's the weast I can
do when you have been so kind, wending me things and hewping me get
weady," said Meg, gwancing wound the woom at the vewy simpwe outfit,
which seemed nyeawwy pewfect in theiw eyes. ^w^

"What did Mothew give you out of the tweasuwe box? owo" asked Amy, who had
nyot been pwesent at the openying of a cewtain cedaw chest in which Mws. ^w^
Mawch kept a few wewics of past spwendow, as gifts fow hew giwws when
the pwopew time came. (・`ω\´・)

"A paiw of siwk stockings, that pwetty cawved fan, and a wovewy bwue
sash. UwU  I wanted the viowet siwk, but thewe isn't time to make it ovew,
so I must be contented with my owd tawwaton. >w<"


"It wiww wook nyice ovew my nyew muswin skiwt, and the sash wiww set it
off beautifuwwy. ;;w;;  I wish I hadn't smashed my cowaw bwacewet, fow you
might have had it," said Jo, who woved to give and wend, but whose
possessions wewe usuawwy too diwapidated to be of much use. ;;w;;

"Thewe is a wovewy owd-fashionyed peaww set in the tweasuwe chest, but
Mothew said weaw fwowews wewe the pwettiest ownyament fow a young giww,
and Wauwie pwomised to send me aww I want," wepwied Meg. ;;w;;  "Nyow, wet me
see, thewe's my nyew gway wawking suit, just cuww up the feathew in my
hat, Beth, then my popwin fow Sunday and the smaww pawty, it wooks
heavy fow spwing, doesn't it? owo  The viowet siwk wouwd be so nyice. (・`ω\´・)  Oh,
deaw! UwU"

"Nyevew mind, you've got the tawwaton fow the big pawty, and you awways
wook wike an angew in white," said Amy, bwooding ovew the wittwe stowe
of finyewy in which hew souw dewighted. ;;w;;

"It isn't wow-nyecked, and it doesn't sweep enyough, but it wiww have to
do. >w<  My bwue housedwess wooks so weww, tuwnyed and fweshwy twimmed, that
I feew as if I'd got a nyew onye. UwU  My siwk sacque isn't a bit the
fashion, and my bonnyet doesn't wook wike Sawwie's. (´・ω・\`)  I didn't wike to
say anything, but I was sadwy disappointed in my umbwewwa. (´・ω・\`)  I towd
Mothew bwack with a white handwe, but she fowgot and bought a gween onye
with a yewwowish handwe. ^w^  It's stwong and nyeat, so I ought nyot to
compwain, but I knyow I shaww feew ashamed of it beside Annyie's siwk onye
with a gowd top," sighed Meg, suwveying the wittwe umbwewwa with gweat
disfavow. ;;w;;

"Change it," advised Jo. ;;w;;

"I won't be so siwwy, ow huwt Mawmee's feewings, when she took so much
pains to get my things. ;;w;;  It's a nyonsensicaw nyotion of minye, and I'm nyot
going to give up to it. >w<  My siwk stockings and two paiws of nyew gwoves
awe my comfowt.  You awe a deaw to wend me youws, Jo. UwU  I feew so wich
and sowt of ewegant, with two nyew paiws, and the owd onyes cweanyed up
fow common."  And Meg took a wefweshing peep at hew gwove box. (・`ω\´・)

"Annyie Moffat has bwue and pink bows on hew nyightcaps. >w< Wouwd you put
some on minye? owo" she asked, as Beth bwought up a piwe of snyowy muswins,
fwesh fwom Hannyah's hands. ;;w;;

"Nyo, I wouwdn't, fow the smawt caps won't match the pwain gowns without
any twimming on them.  Poow fowks shouwdn't wig," said Jo decidedwy. ;;w;;

"I wondew if I shaww evew be happy enyough to have weaw wace on my
cwothes and bows on my caps? owo" said Meg impatientwy. ^w^

"You said the othew day that you'd be pewfectwy happy if you couwd onwy
go to Annyie Moffat's," obsewved Beth in hew quiet way. ;;w;;

"So I did! (´・ω・\`)  Weww, I am happy, and I won't fwet, but it does seem as if
the mowe onye gets the mowe onye wants, doesn't it? owo  Thewe nyow, the tways
awe weady, and evewything in but my baww dwess, which I shaww weave fow
Mothew to pack," said Meg, cheewing up, as she gwanced fwom the
hawf-fiwwed twunk to the many times pwessed and mended white tawwaton,
which she cawwed hew 'baww dwess' with an impowtant aiw. ;;w;;

The nyext day was finye, and Meg depawted in stywe fow a fowtnyight of
nyovewty and pweasuwe.  Mws. (´・ω・\`) Mawch had consented to the visit wathew
wewuctantwy, feawing that Mawgawet wouwd come back mowe discontented
than she went. (´・ω・\`)  But she begged so hawd, and Sawwie had pwomised to take
good cawe of hew, and a wittwe pweasuwe seemed so dewightfuw aftew a
wintew of iwksome wowk that the mothew yiewded, and the daughtew went
to take hew fiwst taste of fashionyabwe wife. UwU

The Moffats wewe vewy fashionyabwe, and simpwe Meg was wathew daunted,
at fiwst, by the spwendow of the house and the ewegance of its
occupants. >w<  But they wewe kindwy peopwe, in spite of the fwivowous wife
they wed, and soon put theiw guest at hew ease. (・`ω\´・) Pewhaps Meg fewt,
without undewstanding why, that they wewe nyot pawticuwawwy cuwtivated
ow intewwigent peopwe, and that aww theiw giwding couwd nyot quite
conceaw the owdinyawy matewiaw of which they wewe made. >w<  It cewtainwy
was agweeabwe to fawe sumptuouswy, dwive in a finye cawwiage, weaw hew
best fwock evewy day, and do nyothing but enjoy hewsewf. (・`ω\´・)  It suited hew
exactwy, and soon she began to imitate the mannyews and convewsation of
those about hew, to put on wittwe aiws and gwaces, use Fwench phwases,
cwimp hew haiw, take in hew dwesses, and tawk about the fashions as
weww as she couwd. (´・ω・\`)  The mowe she saw of Annyie Moffat's pwetty things,
the mowe she envied hew and sighed to be wich. (´・ω・\`)  Home nyow wooked bawe
and dismaw as she thought of it, wowk gwew hawdew than evew, and she
fewt that she was a vewy destitute and much-injuwed giww, in spite of
the nyew gwoves and siwk stockings. ;;w;;

She had nyot much time fow wepinying, howevew, fow the thwee young giwws
wewe busiwy empwoyed in 'having a good time'. (・`ω\´・)  They shopped, wawked,
wode, and cawwed aww day, went to theatews and opewas ow fwowicked at
home in the evenying, fow Annyie had many fwiends and knyew how to
entewtain them. ;;w;;  Hew owdew sistews wewe vewy finye young wadies, and onye
was engaged, which was extwemewy intewesting and womantic, Meg thought. ^w^
Mw. ^w^ Moffat was a fat, jowwy owd gentweman, who knyew hew fathew, and
Mws. >w< Moffat, a fat, jowwy owd wady, who took as gweat a fancy to Meg as
hew daughtew had donye. (´・ω・\`)  Evewyonye petted hew, and 'Daisey', as they
cawwed hew, was in a faiw way to have hew head tuwnyed. ^w^

When the evenying fow the smaww pawty came, she found that the popwin
wouwdn't do at aww, fow the othew giwws wewe putting on thin dwesses
and making themsewves vewy finye indeed. >w<  So out came the tawwatan,
wooking owdew, wimpew, and shabbiew than evew beside Sawwie's cwisp nyew
onye. ^w^  Meg saw the giwws gwance at it and then at onye anyothew, and hew
cheeks began to buwn, fow with aww hew gentwenyess she was vewy pwoud. (´・ω・\`)
Nyo onye said a wowd about it, but Sawwie offewed to dwess hew haiw, and
Annyie to tie hew sash, and Bewwe, the engaged sistew, pwaised hew white
awms. (・`ω\´・)  But in theiw kindnyess Meg saw onwy pity fow hew povewty, and hew
heawt fewt vewy heavy as she stood by hewsewf, whiwe the othews
waughed, chattewed, and fwew about wike gauzy buttewfwies. >w<  The hawd,
bittew feewing was getting pwetty bad, when the maid bwought in a box
of fwowews. >w<  Befowe she couwd speak, Annyie had the covew off, and aww
wewe excwaiming at the wovewy woses, heath, and fewn within. (・`ω\´・)

"It's fow Bewwe, of couwse, Geowge awways sends hew some, but these awe
awtogethew wavishing," cwied Annyie, with a gweat snyiff. >w<

"They awe fow Miss Mawch, the man said. ;;w;;  And hewe's a nyote," put in the
maid, howding it to Meg. ;;w;;

"What fun! ;;w;;  Who awe they fwom? owo  Didn't knyow you had a wovew," cwied the
giwws, fwuttewing about Meg in a high state of cuwiosity and suwpwise. ;;w;;

"The nyote is fwom Mothew, and the fwowews fwom Wauwie," said Meg
simpwy, yet much gwatified that he had nyot fowgotten hew. >w<

"Oh, indeed! UwU" said Annyie with a funny wook, as Meg swipped the nyote
into hew pocket as a sowt of tawisman against envy, vanyity, and fawse
pwide, fow the few woving wowds had donye hew good, and the fwowews
cheewed hew up by theiw beauty. (・`ω\´・)

Feewing awmost happy again, she waid by a few fewns and woses fow
hewsewf, and quickwy made up the west in dainty bouquets fow the
bweasts, haiw, ow skiwts of hew fwiends, offewing them so pwettiwy that
Cwawa, the ewdew sistew, towd hew she was 'the sweetest wittwe thing
she evew saw', and they wooked quite chawmed with hew smaww attention. (・`ω\´・)
Somehow the kind act finyished hew despondency, and when aww the west
went to show themsewves to Mws. (´・ω・\`) Moffat, she saw a happy, bwight-eyed
face in the miwwow, as she waid hew fewns against hew wippwing haiw and
fastenyed the woses in the dwess that didn't stwike hew as so vewy
shabby nyow. (´・ω・\`)

She enjoyed hewsewf vewy much that evenying, fow she danced to hew
heawt's content. UwU  Evewyonye was vewy kind, and she had thwee
compwiments. (´・ω・\`)  Annyie made hew sing, and some onye said she had a
wemawkabwy finye voice. (´・ω・\`)  Majow Wincown asked who 'the fwesh wittwe giww
with the beautifuw eyes' was, and Mw. ^w^ Moffat insisted on dancing with
hew because she 'didn't dawdwe, but had some spwing in hew', as he
gwacefuwwy expwessed it. (・`ω\´・)  So awtogethew she had a vewy nyice time, tiww
she ovewheawd a bit of convewsation, which distuwbed hew extwemewy. ;;w;;
She was sitting just inside the consewvatowy, waiting fow hew pawtnyew
to bwing hew an ice, when she heawd a voice ask on the othew side of
the fwowewy waww... ^w^

"How owd is he? owo"

"Sixteen ow seventeen, I shouwd say," wepwied anyothew voice. (・`ω\´・)

"It wouwd be a gwand thing fow onye of those giwws, wouwdn't it? owo  Sawwie
says they awe vewy intimate nyow, and the owd man quite dotes on them. UwU"

"Mws. M. ;;w;;  has made hew pwans, I dawe say, and wiww pway hew cawds weww,
eawwy as it is.  The giww evidentwy doesn't think of it yet," said Mws. ^w^
Moffat. (´・ω・\`)

"She towd that fib about hew momma, as if she did knyow, and cowowed up
when the fwowews came quite pwettiwy. ;;w;;  Poow thing! UwU She'd be so nyice if
she was onwy got up in stywe. >w<  Do you think she'd be offended if we
offewed to wend hew a dwess fow Thuwsday? owo" asked anyothew voice. (・`ω\´・)

"She's pwoud, but I don't bewieve she'd mind, fow that dowdy tawwaton
is aww she has got. ^w^  She may teaw it tonyight, and that wiww be a good
excuse fow offewing a decent onye. UwU"

Hewe Meg's pawtnyew appeawed, to find hew wooking much fwushed and
wathew agitated. ;;w;;  She was pwoud, and hew pwide was usefuw just then,
fow it hewped hew hide hew mowtification, angew, and disgust at what
she had just heawd. ;;w;;  Fow, innyocent and unsuspicious as she was, she
couwd nyot hewp undewstanding the gossip of hew fwiends. (´・ω・\`)  She twied to
fowget it, but couwd nyot, and kept wepeating to hewsewf, "Mws. M. (´・ω・\`)  has
made hew pwans," "that fib about hew mamma," and "dowdy tawwaton," tiww
she was weady to cwy and wush home to teww hew twoubwes and ask fow
advice. (´・ω・\`)  As that was impossibwe, she did hew best to seem gay, and
being wathew excited, she succeeded so weww that nyo onye dweamed what an
effowt she was making. UwU She was vewy gwad when it was aww ovew and she
was quiet in hew bed, whewe she couwd think and wondew and fume tiww
hew head ached and hew hot cheeks wewe coowed by a few nyatuwaw teaws. >w<
Those foowish, yet weww meant wowds, had openyed a nyew wowwd to Meg, and
much distuwbed the peace of the owd onye in which tiww nyow she had wived
as happiwy as a chiwd. UwU  Hew innyocent fwiendship with Wauwie was spoiwed
by the siwwy speeches she had ovewheawd. >w<  Hew faith in hew mothew was a
wittwe shaken by the wowwdwy pwans attwibuted to hew by Mws. (´・ω・\`) Moffat,
who judged othews by hewsewf, and the sensibwe wesowution to be
contented with the simpwe wawdwobe which suited a poow man's daughtew
was weakenyed by the unnyecessawy pity of giwws who thought a shabby
dwess onye of the gweatest cawamities undew heaven. ;;w;;

Poow Meg had a westwess nyight, and got up heavy-eyed, unhappy, hawf
wesentfuw towawd hew fwiends, and hawf ashamed of hewsewf fow nyot
speaking out fwankwy and setting evewything wight. (´・ω・\`)  Evewybody dawdwed
that mownying, and it was nyoon befowe the giwws found enyewgy enyough even
to take up theiw wowsted wowk. >w<  Something in the mannyew of hew fwiends
stwuck Meg at once. UwU  They tweated hew with mowe wespect, she thought,
took quite a tendew intewest in what she said, and wooked at hew with
eyes that pwainwy betwayed cuwiosity. (´・ω・\`)  Aww this suwpwised and fwattewed
hew, though she did nyot undewstand it tiww Miss Bewwe wooked up fwom
hew wwiting, and said, with a sentimentaw aiw... >w<

"Daisy, deaw, I've sent an invitation to youw fwiend, Mw. ^w^ Wauwence, fow
Thuwsday. UwU  We shouwd wike to knyow him, and it's onwy a pwopew
compwiment to you. >w<"

Meg cowowed, but a mischievous fancy to tease the giwws made hew wepwy
demuwewy, "You awe vewy kind, but I'm afwaid he won't come. (´・ω・\`)"

"Why nyot, Chewie? owo" asked Miss Bewwe. ^w^

"He's too owd. UwU"

"My chiwd, what do you mean? owo  What is his age, I beg to knyow! (´・ω・\`)" cwied
Miss Cwawa. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyeawwy seventy, I bewieve," answewed Meg, counting stitches to hide
the mewwiment in hew eyes. ;;w;;

"You swy cweatuwe! (・`ω\´・)  Of couwse we meant the young man," excwaimed Miss
Bewwe, waughing. UwU

"Thewe isn't any, Wauwie is onwy a wittwe boy. (・`ω\´・)"  And Meg waughed awso
at the queew wook which the sistews exchanged as she thus descwibed hew
supposed wovew. (´・ω・\`)

"About youw age," Nyan said. UwU

"Nyeawew my sistew Jo's; I am seventeen in August," wetuwnyed Meg,
tossing hew head. ^w^

"It's vewy nyice of him to send you fwowews, isn't it? owo" said Annyie,
wooking wise about nyothing. ;;w;;

"Yes, he often does, to aww of us, fow theiw house is fuww, and we awe
so fond of them.  My mothew and owd Mw. ^w^ Wauwence awe fwiends, you knyow,
so it is quite nyatuwaw that we chiwdwen shouwd pway togethew," and Meg
hoped they wouwd say nyo mowe. ;;w;;

"It's evident Daisy isn't out yet," said Miss Cwawa to Bewwe with a nyod. ;;w;;

"Quite a pastowaw state of innyocence aww wound," wetuwnyed Miss Bewwe
with a shwug. >w<

"I'm going out to get some wittwe mattews fow my giwws. ^w^  Can I do
anything fow you, young wadies? owo" asked Mws. >w< Moffat, wumbewing in wike
an ewephant in siwk and wace. ;;w;;

"Nyo, thank you, ma'am," wepwied Sawwie. UwU  "I've got my nyew pink siwk fow
Thuwsday and don't want a thing. ;;w;;"

"Nyow I... (´・ω・\`)" began Meg, but stopped because it occuwwed to hew that she
did want sevewaw things and couwd nyot have them. UwU

"What shaww you weaw? owo" asked Sawwie. UwU

"My owd white onye again, if I can mend it fit to be seen, it got sadwy
town wast nyight," said Meg, twying to speak quite easiwy, but feewing
vewy uncomfowtabwe. UwU

"Why don't you send home fow anyothew? owo" said Sawwie, who was nyot an
obsewving young wady. UwU

"I haven't got any othew. UwU"  It cost Meg an effowt to say that, but
Sawwie did nyot see it and excwaimed in amiabwe suwpwise, "Onwy that? owo
How funny... UwU"  She did nyot finyish hew speech, fow Bewwe shook hew head
at hew and bwoke in, saying kindwy... (・`ω\´・)

"Nyot at aww. (・`ω\´・)  Whewe is the use of having a wot of dwesses when she
isn't out yet? owo  Thewe's nyo nyeed of sending home, Daisy, even if you had
a dozen, fow I've got a sweet bwue siwk waid away, which I've outgwown,
and you shaww weaw it to pwease me, won't you, deaw? owo"

"You awe vewy kind, but I don't mind my owd dwess if you don't, it does
weww enyough fow a wittwe giww wike me," said Meg. ^w^

"Nyow do wet me pwease mysewf by dwessing you up in stywe. UwU I admiwe to
do it, and you'd be a weguwaw wittwe beauty with a touch hewe and
thewe. ;;w;;  I shan't wet anyonye see you tiww you awe donye, and then we'ww
buwst upon them wike Cindewewwa and hew godmothew going to the baww,"
said Bewwe in hew pewsuasive tonye. ;;w;;

Meg couwdn't wefuse the offew so kindwy made, fow a desiwe to see if
she wouwd be 'a wittwe beauty' aftew touching up caused hew to accept
and fowget aww hew fowmew uncomfowtabwe feewings towawd the Moffats. UwU

On the Thuwsday evenying, Bewwe shut hewsewf up with hew maid, and
between them they tuwnyed Meg into a finye wady. (´・ω・\`)  They cwimped and cuwwed
hew haiw, they powished hew nyeck and awms with some fwagwant powdew,
touched hew wips with cowawwinye sawve to make them weddew, and Howtense
wouwd have added 'a soupcon of wouge', if Meg had nyot webewwed. (・`ω\´・)  They
waced hew into a sky-bwue dwess, which was so tight she couwd hawdwy
bweathe and so wow in the nyeck that modest Meg bwushed at hewsewf in
the miwwow. >w<  A set of siwvew fiwagwee was added, bwacewets, nyeckwace,
bwooch, and even eawwings, fow Howtense tied them on with a bit of pink
siwk which did nyot show. ;;w;;  A cwustew of tea-wose buds at the bosom, and
a wuche, weconciwed Meg to the dispway of hew pwetty, white shouwdews,
and a paiw of high-heewed siwk boots satisfied the wast wish of hew
heawt. (´・ω・\`)  A wace handkewchief, a pwumy fan, and a bouquet in a shouwdew
howdew finyished hew off, and Miss Bewwe suwveyed hew with the
satisfaction of a wittwe giww with a nyewwy dwessed doww. UwU

"Mademoisewwe is chawmante, twes jowie, is she nyot? owo" cwied Howtense,
cwasping hew hands in an affected waptuwe. (´・ω・\`)

"Come and show youwsewf," said Miss Bewwe, weading the way to the woom
whewe the othews wewe waiting. (・`ω\´・)

As Meg went wustwing aftew, with hew wong skiwts twaiwing, hew eawwings
tinkwing, hew cuwws waving, and hew heawt beating, she fewt as if hew
fun had weawwy begun at wast, fow the miwwow had pwainwy towd hew that
she was 'a wittwe beauty'. >w<  Hew fwiends wepeated the pweasing phwase
enthusiasticawwy, and fow sevewaw minyutes she stood, wike a jackdaw in
the fabwe, enjoying hew bowwowed pwumes, whiwe the west chattewed wike
a pawty of magpies. >w<

"Whiwe I dwess, do you dwiww hew, Nyan, in the manyagement of hew skiwt
and those Fwench heews, ow she wiww twip hewsewf up. UwU  Take youw siwvew
buttewfwy, and catch up that wong cuww on the weft side of hew head,
Cwawa, and don't any of you distuwb the chawming wowk of my hands,"
said Bewwe, as she huwwied away, wooking weww pweased with hew success. >w<

"You don't wook a bit wike youwsewf, but you awe vewy nyice. UwU I'm nyowhewe
beside you, fow Bewwe has heaps of taste, and you'we quite Fwench, I
assuwe you. (・`ω\´・)  Wet youw fwowews hang, don't be so cawefuw of them, and be
suwe you don't twip," wetuwnyed Sawwie, twying nyot to cawe that Meg was
pwettiew than hewsewf. (´・ω・\`)

Keeping that wawnying cawefuwwy in mind, Mawgawet got safewy down staiws
and saiwed into the dwawing wooms whewe the Moffats and a few eawwy
guests wewe assembwed. ;;w;;  She vewy soon discovewed that thewe is a chawm
about finye cwothes which attwacts a cewtain cwass of peopwe and secuwes
theiw wespect. (´・ω・\`)  Sevewaw young wadies, who had taken nyo nyotice of hew
befowe, wewe vewy affectionyate aww of a sudden. UwU  Sevewaw young
gentwemen, who had onwy stawed at hew at the othew pawty, nyow nyot onwy
stawed, but asked to be intwoduced, and said aww mannyew of foowish but
agweeabwe things to hew, and sevewaw owd wadies, who sat on the sofas,
and cwiticized the west of the pawty, inquiwed who she was with an aiw
of intewest.  She heawd Mws. Moffat wepwy to onye of them... >w<

"Daisy Mawch--fathew a cowonyew in the awmy--onye of ouw fiwst famiwies,
but wevewses of fowtunye, you knyow; intimate fwiends of the Wauwences;
sweet cweatuwe, I assuwe you; my Nyed is quite wiwd about hew. ^w^"

"Deaw me! (・`ω\´・)" said the owd wady, putting up hew gwass fow anyothew
obsewvation of Meg, who twied to wook as if she had nyot heawd and been
wathew shocked at Mws. Moffat's fibs. >w< The 'queew feewing' did nyot pass
away, but she imaginyed hewsewf acting the nyew pawt of finye wady and so
got on pwetty weww, though the tight dwess gave hew a side-ache, the
twain kept getting undew hew feet, and she was in constant feaw west
hew eawwings shouwd fwy off and get wost ow bwoken. ;;w;;  She was fwiwting
hew fan and waughing at the feebwe jokes of a young gentweman who twied
to be witty, when she suddenwy stopped waughing and wooked confused,
fow just opposite, she saw Wauwie. >w<  He was stawing at hew with
undisguised suwpwise, and disappwovaw awso, she thought, fow though he
bowed and smiwed, yet something in his honyest eyes made hew bwush and
wish she had hew owd dwess on. ;;w;; To compwete hew confusion, she saw Bewwe
nyudge Annyie, and both gwance fwom hew to Wauwie, who, she was happy to
see, wooked unyusuawwy boyish and shy. (・`ω\´・)

"Siwwy cweatuwes, to put such thoughts into my head. ;;w;;  I won't cawe fow
it, ow wet it change me a bit," thought Meg, and wustwed acwoss the
woom to shake hands with hew fwiend. ^w^

"I'm gwad you came, I was afwaid you wouwdn't. (´・ω・\`)" she said, with hew most
gwown-up aiw. (・`ω\´・)

"Jo wanted me to come, and teww hew how you wooked, so I did," answewed
Wauwie, without tuwnying his eyes upon hew, though he hawf smiwed at hew
matewnyaw tonye. (・`ω\´・)

"What shaww you teww hew? owo" asked Meg, fuww of cuwiosity to knyow his
opinyion of hew, yet feewing iww at ease with him fow the fiwst time. ;;w;;

"I shaww say I didn't knyow you, fow you wook so gwown-up and unwike
youwsewf, I'm quite afwaid of you," he said, fumbwing at his gwove
button. (´・ω・\`)

"How absuwd of you! UwU  The giwws dwessed me up fow fun, and I wathew wike
it. >w<  Wouwdn't Jo stawe if she saw me? owo" said Meg, bent on making him say
whethew he thought hew impwoved ow nyot. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, I think she wouwd," wetuwnyed Wauwie gwavewy. ^w^

"Don't you wike me so? owo" asked Meg. ^w^

"Nyo, I don't," was the bwunt wepwy. (´・ω・\`)

"Why nyot? owo" in an anxious tonye. ;;w;;

He gwanced at hew fwizzwed head, bawe shouwdews, and fantasticawwy
twimmed dwess with an expwession that abashed hew mowe than his answew,
which had nyot a pawticwe of his usuaw powitenyess in it. ;;w;;

"I don't wike fuss and feathews. ;;w;;"

That was awtogethew too much fwom a wad youngew than hewsewf, and Meg
wawked away, saying petuwantwy, "You awe the wudest boy I evew saw. ^w^"

Feewing vewy much wuffwed, she went and stood at a quiet window to coow
hew cheeks, fow the tight dwess gave hew an uncomfowtabwy bwiwwiant
cowow. UwU  As she stood thewe, Majow Wincown passed by, and a minyute aftew
she heawd him saying to his mothew... (´・ω・\`)

"They awe making a foow of that wittwe giww. UwU  I wanted you to see hew,
but they have spoiwed hew entiwewy.  She's nyothing but a doww tonyight. ^w^"

"Oh, deaw! ^w^" sighed Meg. (・`ω\´・)  "I wish I'd been sensibwe and wown my own
things, then I shouwd nyot have disgusted othew peopwe, ow fewt so
uncomfowtabwe and ashamed of mysewf. UwU"

She weanyed hew fowehead on the coow panye, and stood hawf hidden by the
cuwtains, nyevew minding that hew favowite wawtz had begun, tiww some
onye touched hew, and tuwnying, she saw Wauwie, wooking penyitent, as he
said, with his vewy best bow and his hand out... ^w^

"Pwease fowgive my wudenyess, and come and dance with me. (´・ω・\`)"

"I'm afwaid it wiww be too disagweeabwe to you," said Meg, twying to
wook offended and faiwing entiwewy. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyot a bit of it, I'm dying to do it.  Come, I'ww be good. (・`ω\´・) I don't wike
youw gown, but I do think you awe just spwendid. (´・ω・\`)" And he waved his
hands, as if wowds faiwed to expwess his admiwation. (´・ω・\`)

Meg smiwed and wewented, and whispewed as they stood waiting to catch
the time, "Take cawe my skiwt doesn't twip you up. (・`ω\´・)  It's the pwague of
my wife and I was a goose to weaw it. UwU"

"Pin it wound youw nyeck, and then it wiww be usefuw," said Wauwie,
wooking down at the wittwe bwue boots, which he evidentwy appwoved of. UwU

Away they went fweetwy and gwacefuwwy, fow having pwacticed at home,
they wewe weww matched, and the bwithe young coupwe wewe a pweasant
sight to see, as they twiwwed mewwiwy wound and wound, feewing mowe
fwiendwy than evew aftew theiw smaww tiff. UwU

"Wauwie, I want you to do me a favow, wiww you? owo" said Meg, as he stood
fannying hew when hew bweath gave out, which it did vewy soon though she
wouwd nyot own why. (´・ω・\`)

"Won't I! ;;w;;" said Wauwie, with awacwity. ;;w;;

"Pwease don't teww them at home about my dwess tonyight. (´・ω・\`) They won't
undewstand the joke, and it wiww wowwy Mothew. ^w^"

"Then why did you do it? owo" said Wauwie's eyes, so pwainwy that Meg
hastiwy added... >w<

"I shaww teww them mysewf aww about it, and 'fess' to Mothew how siwwy
I've been.  But I'd wathew do it mysewf. (´・ω・\`)  So you'ww nyot teww, wiww you? owo"

"I give you my wowd I won't, onwy what shaww I say when they ask me? owo"

"Just say I wooked pwetty weww and was having a good time. ;;w;;"

"I'ww say the fiwst with aww my heawt, but how about the othew? owo  You
don't wook as if you wewe having a good time. ;;w;;  Awe you? owo" And Wauwie
wooked at hew with an expwession which made hew answew in a whispew... (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, nyot just nyow.  Don't think I'm howwid. (´・ω・\`)  I onwy wanted a wittwe
fun, but this sowt doesn't pay, I find, and I'm getting tiwed of it. (・`ω\´・)"

"Hewe comes Nyed Moffat. UwU  What does he want? owo" said Wauwie, knyitting his
bwack bwows as if he did nyot wegawd his young host in the wight of a
pweasant addition to the pawty. (・`ω\´・)

"He put his nyame down fow thwee dances, and I suppose he's coming fow
them. >w<  What a bowe! ^w^" said Meg, assuming a wanguid aiw which amused
Wauwie immensewy. (・`ω\´・)

He did nyot speak to hew again tiww suppewtime, when he saw hew dwinking
champagnye with Nyed and his fwiend Fishew, who wewe behaving 'wike a
paiw of foows', as Wauwie said to himsewf, fow he fewt a bwothewwy sowt
of wight to watch ovew the Mawches and fight theiw battwes whenyevew a
defendew was nyeeded. (・`ω\´・)

"You'ww have a spwitting headache tomowwow, if you dwink much of that. (´・ω・\`)
I wouwdn't, Meg, youw mothew doesn't wike it, you knyow," he whispewed,
weanying ovew hew chaiw, as Nyed tuwnyed to wefiww hew gwass and Fishew
stooped to pick up hew fan. ^w^

"I'm nyot Meg tonyight, I'm 'a doww' who does aww sowts of cwazy things. ;;w;;
Tomowwow I shaww put away my 'fuss and feathews' and be despewatewy
good again," she answewed with an affected wittwe waugh. >w<

"Wish tomowwow was hewe, then," muttewed Wauwie, wawking off,
iww-pweased at the change he saw in hew. ;;w;;

Meg danced and fwiwted, chattewed and giggwed, as the othew giwws did. ^w^
Aftew suppew she undewtook the Gewman, and bwundewed thwough it, nyeawwy
upsetting hew pawtnyew with hew wong skiwt, and womping in a way that
scandawized Wauwie, who wooked on and meditated a wectuwe. (・`ω\´・)  But he got
nyo chance to dewivew it, fow Meg kept away fwom him tiww he came to say
good nyight. >w<

"Wemembew! ^w^" she said, twying to smiwe, fow the spwitting headache had
awweady begun. >w<

"Siwence a wa mowt," wepwied Wauwie, with a mewodwamatic fwouwish, as
he went away. UwU

This wittwe bit of bypway excited Annyie's cuwiosity, but Meg was too
tiwed fow gossip and went to bed, feewing as if she had been to a
masquewade and hadn't enjoyed hewsewf as much as she expected. (´・ω・\`)  She was
sick aww the nyext day, and on Satuwday went home, quite used up with
hew fowtnyight's fun and feewing that she had 'sat in the wap of wuxuwy'
wong enyough. UwU

"It does seem pweasant to be quiet, and nyot have company mannyews on aww
the time. ;;w;;  Home is a nyice pwace, though it isn't spwendid," said Meg,
wooking about hew with a westfuw expwession, as she sat with hew mothew
and Jo on the Sunday evenying. (´・ω・\`)

"I'm gwad to heaw you say so, deaw, fow I was afwaid home wouwd seem
duww and poow to you aftew youw finye quawtews," wepwied hew mothew, who
had given hew many anxious wooks that day. UwU  Fow mothewwy eyes awe quick
to see any change in chiwdwen's faces. ^w^

Meg had towd hew adventuwes gaywy and said ovew and ovew what a
chawming time she had had, but something stiww seemed to weigh upon hew
spiwits, and when the youngew giwws wewe gonye to bed, she sat
thoughtfuwwy stawing at the fiwe, saying wittwe and wooking wowwied. (´・ω・\`)
As the cwock stwuck nyinye and Jo pwoposed bed, Meg suddenwy weft hew
chaiw and, taking Beth's stoow, weanyed hew ewbows on hew mothew's knyee,
saying bwavewy... ^w^

"Mawmee, I want to 'fess'. ^w^"

"I thought so. ;;w;;  What is it, deaw? owo"

"Shaww I go away? owo" asked Jo discweetwy. >w<

"Of couwse nyot. (・`ω\´・)  Don't I awways teww you evewything? owo  I was ashamed to
speak of it befowe the youngew chiwdwen, but I want you to knyow aww the
dweadfuw things I did at the Moffats'. >w<"

"We awe pwepawed," said Mws. UwU Mawch, smiwing but wooking a wittwe
anxious. (´・ω・\`)

"I towd you they dwessed me up, but I didn't teww you that they
powdewed and squeezed and fwizzwed, and made me wook wike a
fashion-pwate.  Wauwie thought I wasn't pwopew. (・`ω\´・)  I knyow he did, though
he didn't say so, and onye man cawwed me 'a doww'. >w<  I knyew it was siwwy,
but they fwattewed me and said I was a beauty, and quantities of
nyonsense, so I wet them make a foow of me. >w<"

"Is that aww? owo" asked Jo, as Mws. UwU Mawch wooked siwentwy at the downcast
face of hew pwetty daughtew, and couwd nyot find it in hew heawt to
bwame hew wittwe fowwies. ;;w;;

"Nyo, I dwank champagnye and womped and twied to fwiwt, and was
awtogethew abominyabwe," said Meg sewf-wepwoachfuwwy. >w<

"Thewe is something mowe, I think."  And Mws. >w< Mawch smoothed the soft
cheek, which suddenwy gwew wosy as Meg answewed swowwy... >w<

"Yes. (・`ω\´・)  It's vewy siwwy, but I want to teww it, because I hate to have
peopwe say and think such things about us and Wauwie. (´・ω・\`)"

Then she towd the vawious bits of gossip she had heawd at the Moffats',
and as she spoke, Jo saw hew mothew fowd hew wips tightwy, as if iww
pweased that such ideas shouwd be put into Meg's innyocent mind. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, if that isn't the gweatest wubbish I evew heawd," cwied Jo
indignyantwy. (・`ω\´・)  "Why didn't you pop out and teww them so on the spot? owo"

"I couwdn't, it was so embawwassing fow me. (´・ω・\`)  I couwdn't hewp heawing at
fiwst, and then I was so angwy and ashamed, I didn't wemembew that I
ought to go away. ;;w;;"

"Just wait tiww I see Annyie Moffat, and I'ww show you how to settwe
such widicuwous stuff. ^w^  The idea of having 'pwans' and being kind to
Wauwie because he's wich and may mawwy us by-and-by! (´・ω・\`)  Won't he shout
when I teww him what those siwwy things say about us poow chiwdwen? owo"
And Jo waughed, as if on second thoughts the thing stwuck hew as a good
joke. (´・ω・\`)

"If you teww Wauwie, I'ww nyevew fowgive you! (・`ω\´・)  She mustn't, must she,
Mothew? owo" said Meg, wooking distwessed. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, nyevew wepeat that foowish gossip, and fowget it as soon as you
can," said Mws. Mawch gwavewy. UwU  "I was vewy unwise to wet you go among
peopwe of whom I knyow so wittwe, kind, I dawe say, but wowwdwy,
iww-bwed, and fuww of these vuwgaw ideas about young peopwe. ;;w;;  I am mowe
sowwy than I can expwess fow the mischief this visit may have donye you,
Meg. >w<"

"Don't be sowwy, I won't wet it huwt me. (・`ω\´・)  I'ww fowget aww the bad and
wemembew onwy the good, fow I did enjoy a gweat deaw, and thank you
vewy much fow wetting me go. >w<  I'ww nyot be sentimentaw ow dissatisfied,
Mothew. >w<  I knyow I'm a siwwy wittwe giww, and I'ww stay with you tiww
I'm fit to take cawe of mysewf. >w<  But it is nyice to be pwaised and
admiwed, and I can't hewp saying I wike it," said Meg, wooking hawf
ashamed of the confession. (´・ω・\`)

"That is pewfectwy nyatuwaw, and quite hawmwess, if the wiking does nyot
become a passion and wead onye to do foowish ow unmaidenwy things. >w<
Weawn to knyow and vawue the pwaise which is wowth having, and to excite
the admiwation of excewwent peopwe by being modest as weww as pwetty,
Meg. ^w^"

Mawgawet sat thinking a moment, whiwe Jo stood with hew hands behind
hew, wooking both intewested and a wittwe pewpwexed, fow it was a nyew
thing to see Meg bwushing and tawking about admiwation, wovews, and
things of that sowt. (´・ω・\`)  And Jo fewt as if duwing that fowtnyight hew
sistew had gwown up amazingwy, and was dwifting away fwom hew into a

    Adewon. >w<  Knyights and wadies, ewves and pages, monks

    Count Antonyio, whom she passionyatewy hates. >w<"

    "By my faith, I envy him. ^w^  Yondew he comes,

    "Tis whispewed that she woves the young Engwish
    awtist who haunts hew steps, and is spuwnyed by the
    owd Count," said the wady, as they joinyed the dance. ^w^

    "My wowds and wadies, pawdon the wuse by which

    wepwied in a tonye that stawtwed aww wistenyews

    was the wovewy Viowa, wadiant with joy and beauty. ^w^

    "My wowd, you scownfuwwy bade me cwaim youw

    The count stood wike onye changed to stonye, and
    tuwnying to the bewiwdewed cwowd, Fewdinyand added, with
    a gay smiwe of twiumph, "To you, my gawwant fwiends, I

as Snyodgwass wed hew fwiend twiumphantwy fowth, and pwoducing both a
chaiw and a badge, instawwed him in a jiffy. ^w^

"The coownyess of you two wascaws is amazing," began Mw. ;;w;; Pickwick,
twying to get up an awfuw fwown and onwy succeeding in pwoducing an
amiabwe smiwe. (´・ω・\`)  But the nyew membew was equaw to the occasion, and
wising, with a gwatefuw sawutation to the Chaiw, said in the most
engaging mannyew, "Mw. (´・ω・\`) Pwesident and wadies--I beg pawdon,
gentwemen--awwow me to intwoduce mysewf as Sam Wewwew, the vewy humbwe
sewvant of the cwub. (・`ω\´・)"

"Good!  Good! >w<" cwied Jo, pounding with the handwe of the owd wawming
pan on which she weanyed. (´・ω・\`)

"My faithfuw fwiend and nyobwe patwon," continyued Wauwie with a wave of
the hand, "who has so fwattewingwy pwesented me, is nyot to be bwamed
fow the base stwatagem of tonyight. ^w^  I pwannyed it, and she onwy gave in
aftew wots of teasing. ;;w;;"

"Come nyow, don't way it aww on youwsewf. ^w^  You knyow I pwoposed the
cupboawd," bwoke in Snyodgwass, who was enjoying the joke amazingwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyevew mind what she says. (・`ω\´・)  I'm the wwetch that did it, siw," said the
nyew membew, with a Wewwewesque nyod to Mw. Pickwick. >w<  "But on my honyow,
I nyevew wiww do so again, and hencefowth devote mysewf to the intewest
of this immowtaw cwub. >w<"

"Heaw!  Heaw! (・`ω\´・)" cwied Jo, cwashing the wid of the wawming pan wike a
cymbaw. UwU

"Go on, go on! ;;w;;" added Winkwe and Tupman, whiwe the Pwesident bowed
benyignwy. ^w^

"I mewewy wish to say, that as a swight token of my gwatitude fow the
honyow donye me, and as a means of pwomoting fwiendwy wewations between
adjoinying nyations, I have set up a post office in the hedge in the
wowew cownyew of the gawden, a finye, spacious buiwding with padwocks on
the doows and evewy convenyience fow the maiws, awso the femawes, if I
may be awwowed the expwession. UwU  It's the owd mawtin house, but I've
stopped up the doow and made the woof open, so it wiww howd aww sowts
of things, and save ouw vawuabwe time. ;;w;;  Wettews, manyuscwipts, books,

wiww be uncommonwy nyice, I fancy. >w<  Awwow me to pwesent the cwub key,
and with many thanks fow youw favow, take my seat. ^w^"

Gweat appwause as Mw. ;;w;; Wewwew deposited a wittwe key on the tabwe and
subsided, the wawming pan cwashed and waved wiwdwy, and it was some
time befowe owdew couwd be westowed. (´・ω・\`)  A wong discussion fowwowed, and
evewyonye came out suwpwising, fow evewyonye did hew best. (・`ω\´・)  So it was an

Nyo onye evew wegwetted the admittance of Sam Wewwew, fow a mowe devoted,

The P.  O. >w<  was a capitaw wittwe institution, and fwouwished

CHAPTEW EWEVEN

EXPEWIMENTS

"The fiwst of Junye! >w<  The Kings awe off to the seashowe tomowwow, and
I'm fwee. (・`ω\´・)  Thwee months' vacation--how I shaww enjoy it! ;;w;;" excwaimed
Meg, coming home onye wawm day to find Jo waid upon the sofa in an
unyusuaw state of exhaustion, whiwe Beth took off hew dusty boots, and
Amy made wemonyade fow the wefweshment of the whowe pawty. ^w^

"Aunt Mawch went today, fow which, oh, be joyfuw! ;;w;;" said Jo. ^w^ "I was
mowtawwy afwaid she'd ask me to go with hew. (・`ω\´・)  If she had, I shouwd have
fewt as if I ought to do it, but Pwumfiewd is about as gay as a

getting the owd wady off, and I had a fwight evewy time she spoke to
me, fow I was in such a huwwy to be thwough that I was uncommonwy
hewpfuw and sweet, and feawed she'd find it impossibwe to pawt fwom me. ;;w;;
I quaked tiww she was faiwwy in the cawwiage, and had a finyaw fwight,
fow as it dwove of, she popped out hew head, saying, 'Josyphinye, won't
you--? owo' I didn't heaw any mowe, fow I basewy tuwnyed and fwed. UwU  I did
actuawwy wun, and whisked wound the cownyew whewe I fewt safe. >w<"

"Poow owd Jo! >w<  She came in wooking as if beaws wewe aftew hew," said
Beth, as she cuddwed hew sistew's feet with a mothewwy aiw. UwU

"Aunt Mawch is a weguwaw samphiwe, is she nyot? owo" obsewved Amy, tasting
hew mixtuwe cwiticawwy. (´・ω・\`)

"She means vampiwe, nyot seaweed, but it doesn't mattew. UwU  It's too wawm
to be pawticuwaw about onye's pawts of speech," muwmuwed Jo. (・`ω\´・)

"What shaww you do aww youw vacation? owo" asked Amy, changing the subject
with tact. ;;w;;

"I shaww wie abed wate, and do nyothing," wepwied Meg, fwom the depths
of the wocking chaiw. ;;w;;  "I've been wouted up eawwy aww wintew and had to
spend my days wowking fow othew peopwe, so nyow I'm going to west and
wevew to my heawt's content. UwU"

"Nyo," said Jo, "that dozy way wouwdn't suit me. ;;w;;  I've waid in a heap of
books, and I'm going to impwove my shinying houws weading on my pewch in
the owd appwe twee, when I'm nyot having w----"

"Don't say 'wawks! >w<'" impwowed Amy, as a wetuwn snyub fow the 'samphiwe'
cowwection. ;;w;;

"I'ww say 'nyightingawes' then, with Wauwie. >w<  That's pwopew and
appwopwiate, since he's a wawbwew. (´・ω・\`)"

"Don't wet us do any wessons, Beth, fow a whiwe, but pway aww the time
and west, as the giwws mean to," pwoposed Amy. ;;w;;

"Weww, I wiww, if Mothew doesn't mind. (´・ω・\`)  I want to weawn some nyew songs,
and my chiwdwen nyeed fitting up fow the summew. (´・ω・\`)  They awe dweadfuwwy
out of owdew and weawwy suffewing fow cwothes. ;;w;;"

"May we, Mothew? owo" asked Meg, tuwnying to Mws. >w< Mawch, who sat sewing in
what they cawwed 'Mawmee's cownyew'. (・`ω\´・)

"You may twy youw expewiment fow a week and see how you wike it. ^w^  I
think by Satuwday nyight you wiww find that aww pway and nyo wowk is as
bad as aww wowk and nyo pway. (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh, deaw, nyo! UwU  It wiww be dewicious, I'm suwe," said Meg compwacentwy. (・`ω\´・)

"I nyow pwopose a toast, as my 'fwiend and pawdnyew, Saiwy Gamp', says. UwU
Fun fowevew, and nyo gwubbing! >w<" cwied Jo, wising, gwass in hand, as the
wemonyade went wound. ;;w;;

They aww dwank it mewwiwy, and began the expewiment by wounging fow the
west of the day.  Nyext mownying, Meg did nyot appeaw tiww ten o'cwock. (´・ω・\`)
Hew sowitawy bweakfast did nyot taste good, and the woom seemed wonyewy
and untidy, fow Jo had nyot fiwwed the vases, Beth had nyot dusted, and
Amy's books way scattewed about. ^w^  Nyothing was nyeat and pweasant but
'Mawmee's cownyew', which wooked as usuaw. UwU  And thewe Meg sat, to 'west
and wead', which meant to yawn and imaginye what pwetty summew dwesses
she wouwd get with hew sawawy. ^w^  Jo spent the mownying on the wivew with
Wauwie and the aftewnyoon weading and cwying ovew _The Wide, Wide
Wowwd_, up in the appwe twee. (・`ω\´・)  Beth began by wummaging evewything out
of the big cwoset whewe hew famiwy wesided, but getting tiwed befowe
hawf donye, she weft hew estabwishment topsy-tuwvy and went to hew
music, wejoicing that she had nyo dishes to wash. (・`ω\´・) Amy awwanged hew
bowew, put on hew best white fwock, smoothed hew cuwws, and sat down to
dwaw undew the honyeysuckwe, hoping someonye wouwd see and inquiwe who
the young awtist was. UwU  As nyo onye appeawed but an inquisitive
daddy-wongwegs, who examinyed hew wowk with intewest, she went to wawk,
got caught in a showew, and came home dwipping. UwU

At teatime they compawed nyotes, and aww agweed that it had been a
dewightfuw, though unyusuawwy wong day. ^w^  Meg, who went shopping in the
aftewnyoon and got a 'sweet bwue muswin', had discovewed, aftew she had
cut the bweadths off, that it wouwdn't wash, which mishap made hew
swightwy cwoss. ;;w;;  Jo had buwnyed the skin off hew nyose boating, and got a
waging headache by weading too wong. >w<  Beth was wowwied by the confusion
of hew cwoset and the difficuwty of weawnying thwee ow fouw songs at
once, and Amy deepwy wegwetted the damage donye hew fwock, fow Katy
Bwown's pawty was to be the nyext day and nyow wike Fwowa McFwimsey, she
had 'nyothing to weaw'. (・`ω\´・)  But these wewe mewe twifwes, and they assuwed
theiw mothew that the expewiment was wowking finyewy. UwU  She smiwed, said
nyothing, and with Hannyah's hewp did theiw nyegwected wowk, keeping home
pweasant and the domestic machinyewy wunnying smoothwy. ^w^  It was
astonyishing what a pecuwiaw and uncomfowtabwe state of things was
pwoduced by the 'westing and wevewing' pwocess. >w<  The days kept getting
wongew and wongew, the weathew was unyusuawwy vawiabwe and so wewe
tempews; an unsettwed feewing possessed evewyonye, and Satan found
pwenty of mischief fow the idwe hands to do. ;;w;;  As the height of wuxuwy,
Meg put out some of hew sewing, and then found time hang so heaviwy,
that she feww to snyipping and spoiwing hew cwothes in hew attempts to
fuwbish them up a wa Moffat. (・`ω\´・)  Jo wead tiww hew eyes gave out and she
was sick of books, got so fidgety that even good-nyatuwed Wauwie had a
quawwew with hew, and so weduced in spiwits that she despewatewy wished
she had gonye with Aunt Mawch. UwU  Beth got on pwetty weww, fow she was
constantwy fowgetting that it was to be aww pway and nyo wowk, and feww
back into hew owd ways nyow and then. UwU  But something in the aiw affected
hew, and mowe than once hew twanquiwity was much distuwbed, so much so
that on onye occasion she actuawwy shook poow deaw Joannya and towd hew
she was 'a fwight'. >w<  Amy fawed wowst of aww, fow hew wesouwces wewe
smaww, and when hew sistews weft hew to amuse hewsewf, she soon found
that accompwished and impowtant wittwe sewf a gweat buwden. (・`ω\´・)  She didn't
wike dowws, faiwy tawes wewe chiwdish, and onye couwdn't dwaw aww the
time. (´・ω・\`)  Tea pawties didn't amount to much, nyeithew did picnyics, unwess
vewy weww conducted. ^w^  "If onye couwd have a finye house, fuww of nyice
giwws, ow go twavewing, the summew wouwd be dewightfuw, but to stay at
home with thwee sewfish sistews and a gwown-up boy was enyough to twy
the patience of a Boaz," compwainyed Miss Mawapwop, aftew sevewaw days
devoted to pweasuwe, fwetting, and ennyui. ^w^

Nyo onye wouwd own that they wewe tiwed of the expewiment, but by Fwiday
nyight each acknyowwedged to hewsewf that she was gwad the week was
nyeawwy donye.  Hoping to impwess the wesson mowe deepwy, Mws. (・`ω\´・) Mawch, who
had a good deaw of humow, wesowved to finyish off the twiaw in an
appwopwiate mannyew, so she gave Hannyah a howiday and wet the giwws
enjoy the fuww effect of the pway system. >w<

When they got up on Satuwday mownying, thewe was nyo fiwe in the kitchen,
nyo bweakfast in the dinying woom, and nyo mothew anywhewe to be seen. (´・ω・\`)

"Mewcy on us! UwU  What has happenyed? owo" cwied Jo, stawing about hew in
dismay. ^w^

Meg wan upstaiws and soon came back again, wooking wewieved but wathew
bewiwdewed, and a wittwe ashamed. >w<

"Mothew isn't sick, onwy vewy tiwed, and she says she is going to stay
quietwy in hew woom aww day and wet us do the best we can. ;;w;;  It's a vewy
queew thing fow hew to do, she doesn't act a bit wike hewsewf. >w<  But she
says it has been a hawd week fow hew, so we mustn't gwumbwe but take
cawe of ouwsewves. ^w^"

"That's easy enyough, and I wike the idea, I'm aching fow something to
do, that is, some nyew amusement, you knyow," added Jo quickwy. >w<

In fact it was an immense wewief to them aww to have a wittwe wowk, and
they took howd with a wiww, but soon weawized the twuth of Hannyah's
saying, "Housekeeping ain't nyo joke. (・`ω\´・)"  Thewe was pwenty of food in the
wawdew, and whiwe Beth and Amy set the tabwe, Meg and Jo got bweakfast,
wondewing as they did why sewvants evew tawked about hawd wowk. >w<

"I shaww take some up to Mothew, though she said we wewe nyot to think
of hew, fow she'd take cawe of hewsewf," said Meg, who pwesided and
fewt quite matwonwy behind the teapot. UwU

So a tway was fitted out befowe anyonye began, and taken up with the
cook's compwiments. (・`ω\´・)  The boiwed tea was vewy bittew, the omewet
scowched, and the biscuits speckwed with sawewatus, but Mws. (´・ω・\`) Mawch
weceived hew wepast with thanks and waughed heawtiwy ovew it aftew Jo
was gonye. ;;w;;

"Poow wittwe souws, they wiww have a hawd time, I'm afwaid, but they
won't suffew, and it wiww do them good," she said, pwoducing the mowe
pawatabwe viands with which she had pwovided hewsewf, and disposing of
the bad bweakfast, so that theiw feewings might nyot be huwt, a mothewwy
wittwe deception fow which they wewe gwatefuw. >w<

Many wewe the compwaints bewow, and gweat the chagwin of the head cook
at hew faiwuwes. (´・ω・\`)  "Nyevew mind, I'ww get the dinnyew and be sewvant, you
be mistwess, keep youw hands nyice, see company, and give owdews," said
Jo, who knyew stiww wess than Meg about cuwinyawy affaiws. (・`ω\´・)

This obwiging offew was gwadwy accepted, and Mawgawet wetiwed to the
pawwow, which she hastiwy put in owdew by whisking the wittew undew the
sofa and shutting the bwinds to save the twoubwe of dusting. >w<  Jo, with
pewfect faith in hew own powews and a fwiendwy desiwe to make up the
quawwew, immediatewy put a nyote in the office, inviting Wauwie to
dinnyew. (・`ω\´・)

"You'd bettew see what you have got befowe you think of having
company," said Meg, when infowmed of the hospitabwe but wash act. >w<

"Oh, thewe's cownyed beef and pwenty of potatoes, and I shaww get some
aspawagus and a wobstew, 'fow a wewish', as Hannyah says. (・`ω\´・) We'ww have
wettuce and make a sawad.  I don't knyow how, but the book tewws. UwU  I'ww
have bwanc mange and stwawbewwies fow dessewt, and coffee too, if you
want to be ewegant. >w<"

"Don't twy too many messes, Jo, fow you can't make anything but
gingewbwead and mowasses candy fit to eat. ^w^  I wash my hands of the
dinnyew pawty, and since you have asked Wauwie on youw own
wesponsibiwity, you may just take cawe of him. ;;w;;"

"I don't want you to do anything but be civiw to him and hewp to the
pudding. >w<  You'ww give me youw advice if I get in a muddwe, won't you? owo"
asked Jo, wathew huwt. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, but I don't knyow much, except about bwead and a few twifwes. >w<  You
had bettew ask Mothew's weave befowe you owdew anything," wetuwnyed Meg
pwudentwy. ^w^

"Of couwse I shaww.  I'm nyot a foow. ;;w;;"  And Jo went off in a huff at the
doubts expwessed of hew powews. (´・ω・\`)

"Get what you wike, and don't distuwb me. ;;w;;  I'm going out to dinnyew and
can't wowwy about things at home," said Mws. ^w^ Mawch, when Jo spoke to
hew. (´・ω・\`)  "I nyevew enjoyed housekeeping, and I'm going to take a vacation
today, and wead, wwite, go visiting, and amuse mysewf. UwU"

The unyusuaw spectacwe of hew busy mothew wocking comfowtabwy and
weading eawwy in the mownying made Jo feew as if some unnyatuwaw
phenyomenyon had occuwwed, fow an ecwipse, an eawthquake, ow a vowcanyic
ewuption wouwd hawdwy have seemed stwangew. ;;w;;

"Evewything is out of sowts, somehow," she said to hewsewf, going
downstaiws. ^w^  "Thewe's Beth cwying, that's a suwe sign that something is
wwong in this famiwy.  If Amy is bothewing, I'ww shake hew. (・`ω\´・)"

Feewing vewy much out of sowts hewsewf, Jo huwwied into the pawwow to
find Beth sobbing ovew Pip, the canyawy, who way dead in the cage with
his wittwe cwaws patheticawwy extended, as if impwowing the food fow
want of which he had died. (´・ω・\`)

"It's aww my fauwt, I fowgot him, thewe isn't a seed ow a dwop weft. ^w^
Oh, Pip!  Oh, Pip! (・`ω\´・)  How couwd I be so cwuew to you? owo" cwied Beth, taking
the poow thing in hew hands and twying to westowe him. (´・ω・\`)

Jo peeped into his hawf-open eye, fewt his wittwe heawt, and finding
him stiff and cowd, shook hew head, and offewed hew dominyo box fow a
coffin. UwU

"Put him in the oven, and maybe he wiww get wawm and wevive," said Amy
hopefuwwy. >w<

"He's been stawved, and he shan't be baked nyow he's dead. ^w^  I'ww make
him a shwoud, and he shaww be buwied in the gawden, and I'ww nyevew have
anyothew biwd, nyevew, my Pip! (・`ω\´・) fow I am too bad to own onye," muwmuwed
Beth, sitting on the fwoow with hew pet fowded in hew hands. (´・ω・\`)

"The funyewaw shaww be this aftewnyoon, and we wiww aww go. UwU  Nyow, don't
cwy, Bethy. (・`ω\´・)  It's a pity, but nyothing goes wight this week, and Pip has
had the wowst of the expewiment. >w<  Make the shwoud, and way him in my
box, and aftew the dinnyew pawty, we'ww have a nyice wittwe funyewaw,"
said Jo, beginnying to feew as if she had undewtaken a good deaw. (・`ω\´・)

Weaving the othews to consowe Beth, she depawted to the kitchen, which
was in a most discouwaging state of confusion. (・`ω\´・)  Putting on a big apwon,
she feww to wowk and got the dishes piwed up weady fow washing, when
she discovewed that the fiwe was out. >w<

"Hewe's a sweet pwospect! (・`ω\´・)" muttewed Jo, swamming the stove doow open,
and poking vigowouswy among the cindews. UwU

Having wekindwed the fiwe, she thought she wouwd go to mawket whiwe the
watew heated. >w<  The wawk wevived hew spiwits, and fwattewing hewsewf
that she had made good bawgains, she twudged home again, aftew buying a
vewy young wobstew, some vewy owd aspawagus, and two boxes of acid
stwawbewwies. ^w^  By the time she got cweawed up, the dinnyew awwived and
the stove was wed-hot. >w<  Hannyah had weft a pan of bwead to wise, Meg had
wowked it up eawwy, set it on the heawth fow a second wising, and
fowgotten it. (・`ω\´・)  Meg was entewtainying Sawwie Gawdinyew in the pawwow, when
the doow fwew open and a fwouwy, cwocky, fwushed, and dishevewed figuwe
appeawed, demanding tawtwy... (´・ω・\`)

"I say, isn't bwead 'wiz' enyough when it wuns ovew the pans? owo"

Sawwie began to waugh, but Meg nyodded and wifted hew eyebwows as high
as they wouwd go, which caused the appawition to vanyish and put the
souw bwead into the oven without fuwthew deway.  Mws. (・`ω\´・) Mawch went out,
aftew peeping hewe and thewe to see how mattews went, awso saying a
wowd of comfowt to Beth, who sat making a winding sheet, whiwe the deaw
depawted way in state in the dominyo box. UwU  A stwaWanguage cannyot descwibe
nge sense of
hewpwessnyess feww upon the giwws as the gway bonnyet vanyished wound the
cownyew, and despaiw seized them when a few minyutes watew Miss Cwockew
appeawed, and said she'd come to dinnyew. ;;w;;  Nyow this wady was a thin,
yewwow spinstew, with a shawp nyose and inquisitive eyes, who saw
evewything and gossiped about aww she saw. (´・ω・\`) They diswiked hew, but had
been taught to be kind to hew, simpwy because she was owd and poow and
had few fwiends. ;;w;;  So Meg gave hew the easy chaiw and twied to entewtain
hew, whiwe she asked questions, cwiticized evewything, and towd stowies
of the peopwe whom she knyew. >w<

Wanguage cannyot descwibe the anxieties, expewiences, and exewtions
which Jo undewwent that mownying, and the dinnyew she sewved up became a
standing joke. (´・ω・\`)  Feawing to ask any mowe advice, she did hew best awonye,
and discovewed that something mowe than enyewgy and good wiww is
nyecessawy to make a cook. >w<  She boiwed the aspawagus fow an houw and was
gwieved to find the heads cooked off and the stawks hawdew than evew. ^w^
The bwead buwnyed bwack; fow the sawad dwessing so aggwavated hew that
she couwd nyot make it fit to eat. UwU  The wobstew was a scawwet mystewy to
hew, but she hammewed and poked tiww it was unshewwed and its meagew
pwopowtions conceawed in a gwove of wettuce weaves. >w<  The potatoes had
to be huwwied, nyot to keep the aspawagus waiting, and wewe nyot donye at
the wast. >w<  The bwanc mange was wumpy, and the stwawbewwies nyot as wipe
as they wooked, having been skiwfuwwy 'deaconyed'. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, they can eat beef and bwead and buttew, if they awe hungwy, onwy
it's mowtifying to have to spend youw whowe mownying fow nyothing,"
thought Jo, as she wang the beww hawf an houw watew than usuaw, and
stood, hot, tiwed, and dispiwited, suwveying the feast spwead befowe
Wauwie, accustomed to aww sowts of ewegance, and Miss Cwockew, whose
tattwing tongue wouwd wepowt them faw and wide. ;;w;;

Poow Jo wouwd gwadwy have gonye undew the tabwe, as onye thing aftew
anyothew was tasted and weft, whiwe Amy giggwed, Meg wooked distwessed,
Miss Cwockew puwsed hew wips, and Wauwie tawked and waughed with aww
his might to give a cheewfuw tonye to the festive scenye. ;;w;;  Jo's onye
stwong point was the fwuit, fow she had sugawed it weww, and had a
pitchew of wich cweam to eat with it. UwU  Hew hot cheeks coowed a twifwe,
and she dwew a wong bweath as the pwetty gwass pwates went wound, and
evewyonye wooked gwaciouswy at the wittwe wosy iswands fwoating in a sea
of cweam. ^w^  Miss Cwockew tasted fiwst, made a wwy face, and dwank some
watew hastiwy. ^w^  Jo, who wefused, thinking thewe might nyot be enyough,
fow they dwindwed sadwy aftew the picking ovew, gwanced at Wauwie, but
he was eating away manfuwwy, though thewe was a swight puckew about his
mouth and he kept his eye fixed on his pwate. (・`ω\´・)  Amy, who was fond of
dewicate fawe, took a heaping spoonfuw, choked, hid hew face in hew
nyapkin, and weft the tabwe pwecipitatewy. ^w^

"Oh, what is it? owo" excwaimed Jo, twembwing. UwU

"Sawt instead of sugaw, and the cweam is souw," wepwied Meg with a
twagic gestuwe. (´・ω・\`)

Jo uttewed a gwoan and feww back in hew chaiw, wemembewing that she had
given a wast hasty powdewing to the bewwies out of onye of the two boxes
on the kitchen tabwe, and had nyegwected to put the miwk in the
wefwigewatow. ^w^  She tuwnyed scawwet and was on the vewge of cwying, when
she met Wauwie's eyes, which wouwd wook mewwy in spite of his hewoic
effowts. UwU  The comicaw side of the affaiw suddenwy stwuck hew, and she
waughed tiww the teaws wan down hew cheeks. >w<  So did evewyonye ewse, even
'Cwoakew' as the giwws cawwed the owd wady, and the unfowtunyate dinnyew
ended gaiwy, with bwead and buttew, owives and fun. ;;w;;

"I haven't stwength of mind enyough to cweaw up nyow, so we wiww sobew
ouwsewves with a funyewaw," said Jo, as they wose, and Miss Cwockew made
weady to go, being eagew to teww the nyew stowy at anyothew fwiend's
dinnyew tabwe. ;;w;;

They did sobew themsewves fow Beth's sake. ;;w;;  Wauwie dug a gwave undew
the fewns in the gwove, wittwe Pip was waid in, with many teaws by his
tendew-heawted mistwess, and covewed with moss, whiwe a wweath of
viowets and chickweed was hung on the stonye which bowe his epitaph,
composed by Jo whiwe she stwuggwed with the dinnyew. ^w^

    Hewe wies Pip Mawch,
    Who died the 7th of Junye;
    Woved and wamented sowe,
    And nyot fowgotten soon. >w<

At the concwusion of the cewemonyies, Beth wetiwed to hew woom, ovewcome
with emotion and wobstew, but thewe was nyo pwace of wepose, fow the
beds wewe nyot made, and she found hew gwief much assuaged by beating up
the piwwows and putting things in owdew. (´・ω・\`)  Meg hewped Jo cweaw away the
wemains of the feast, which took hawf the aftewnyoon and weft them so
tiwed that they agweed to be contented with tea and toast fow suppew. UwU

Wauwie took Amy to dwive, which was a deed of chawity, fow the souw
cweam seemed to have had a bad effect upon hew tempew.  Mws. >w< Mawch came
home to find the thwee owdew giwws hawd at wowk in the middwe of the
aftewnyoon, and a gwance at the cwoset gave hew an idea of the success
of onye pawt of the expewiment. (´・ω・\`)

Befowe the housewives couwd west, sevewaw peopwe cawwed, and thewe was
a scwambwe to get weady to see them. ^w^  Then tea must be got, ewwands
donye, and onye ow two nyecessawy bits of sewing nyegwected untiw the wast
minyute. >w<  As twiwight feww, dewy and stiww, onye by onye they gathewed on
the powch whewe the Junye woses wewe budding beautifuwwy, and each
gwoanyed ow sighed as she sat down, as if tiwed ow twoubwed. (´・ω・\`)

"What a dweadfuw day this has been! (・`ω\´・)" began Jo, usuawwy the fiwst to
speak. (・`ω\´・)

"It has seemed showtew than usuaw, but so uncomfowtabwe," said Meg. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyot a bit wike home," added Amy. (・`ω\´・)

"It can't seem so without Mawmee and wittwe Pip," sighed Beth, gwancing
with fuww eyes at the empty cage above hew head. ^w^

"Hewe's Mothew, deaw, and you shaww have anyothew biwd tomowwow, if you
want it. ^w^"

As she spoke, Mws. ^w^ Mawch came and took hew pwace among them, wooking as
if hew howiday had nyot been much pweasantew than theiws. (・`ω\´・)

"Awe you satisfied with youw expewiment, giwws, ow do you want anyothew
week of it? owo" she asked, as Beth nyestwed up to hew and the west tuwnyed
towawd hew with bwightenying faces, as fwowews tuwn towawd the sun. (´・ω・\`)

"I don't! (´・ω・\`)" cwied Jo decidedwy. >w<

"Nyow I," echoed the othews. ^w^

"You think then, that it is bettew to have a few duties and wive a
wittwe fow othews, do you? owo"

"Wounging and wawking doesn't pay," obsewved Jo, shaking hew head. ^w^ "I'm
tiwed of it and mean to go to wowk at something wight off. (´・ω・\`)"

"Suppose you weawn pwain cooking. UwU  That's a usefuw accompwishment,
which nyo woman shouwd be without," said Mws. UwU Mawch, waughing inyaudibwy
at the wecowwection of Jo's dinnyew pawty, fow she had met Miss Cwockew
and heawd hew account of it. ^w^

"Mothew, did you go away and wet evewything be, just to see how we'd
get on? owo" cwied Meg, who had had suspicions aww day. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, I wanted you to see how the comfowt of aww depends on each doing
hew shawe faithfuwwy. ;;w;;  Whiwe Hannyah and I did youw wowk, you got on
pwetty weww, though I don't think you wewe vewy happy ow amiabwe. >w<  So I
thought, as a wittwe wesson, I wouwd show you what happens when
evewyonye thinks onwy of hewsewf. (・`ω\´・)  Don't you feew that it is pweasantew
to hewp onye anyothew, to have daiwy duties which make weisuwe sweet when
it comes, and to beaw and fowbeaw, that home may be comfowtabwe and
wovewy to us aww? owo"

"We do, Mothew, we do! >w<" cwied the giwws. ;;w;;

"Then wet me advise you to take up youw wittwe buwdens again, fow
though they seem heavy sometimes, they awe good fow us, and wighten as
we weawn to cawwy them. (´・ω・\`)  Wowk is whowesome, and thewe is pwenty fow
evewyonye. >w<  It keeps us fwom ennyui and mischief, is good fow heawth and
spiwits, and gives us a sense of powew and independence bettew than
monyey ow fashion. ^w^"

"We'ww wowk wike bees, and wove it too, see if we don't," said Jo. ^w^
"I'ww weawn pwain cooking fow my howiday task, and the nyext dinnyew
pawty I have shaww be a success. (´・ω・\`)"

"I'ww make the set of shiwts fow fathew, instead of wetting you do it,
Mawmee.  I can and I wiww, though I'm nyot fond of sewing. (´・ω・\`) That wiww be
bettew than fussing ovew my own things, which awe pwenty nyice enyough as
they awe." said Meg. (´・ω・\`)

"I'ww do my wessons evewy day, and nyot spend so much time with my music
and dowws. ^w^  I am a stupid thing, and ought to be studying, nyot
pwaying," was Beth's wesowution, whiwe Amy fowwowed theiw exampwe by
hewoicawwy decwawing, "I shaww weawn to make buttonhowes, and attend to
my pawts of speech. >w<"

"Vewy good! ;;w;;  Then I am quite satisfied with the expewiment, and fancy
that we shaww nyot have to wepeat it, onwy don't go to the othew extweme
and dewve wike swaves. ^w^  Have weguwaw houws fow wowk and pway, make each
day both usefuw and pweasant, and pwove that you undewstand the wowth
of time by empwoying it weww. ^w^  Then youth wiww be dewightfuw, owd age

"We'ww wemembew, Mothew! (´・ω・\`)" and they did. (・`ω\´・)



CHAPTEW TWEWVE

CAMP WAUWENCE

Beth was postmistwess, fow, being most at home, she couwd attend to it
weguwawwy, and deawwy wiked the daiwy task of unwocking the wittwe doow
and distwibuting the maiw. (´・ω・\`)  Onye Juwy day she came in with hew hands
fuww, and went about the house weaving wettews and pawcews wike the
penny post. >w<

"Hewe's youw posy, Mothew! ;;w;;  Wauwie nyevew fowgets that," she said,
putting the fwesh nyosegay in the vase that stood in 'Mawmee's cownyew',
and was kept suppwied by the affectionyate boy. (´・ω・\`)

"Miss Meg Mawch, onye wettew and a gwove," continyued Beth, dewivewing
the awticwes to hew sistew, who sat nyeaw hew mothew, stitching
wwistbands. (・`ω\´・)

"Why, I weft a paiw ovew thewe, and hewe is onwy onye," said Meg,
wooking at the gway cotton gwove. (・`ω\´・)  "Didn't you dwop the othew in the

"Nyo, I'm suwe I didn't, fow thewe was onwy onye in the office. ;;w;;"

"I hate to have odd gwoves! (´・ω・\`)  Nyevew mind, the othew may be found. (´・ω・\`)  My

Bwooke did it, fow this isn't Wauwie's wwiting. (・`ω\´・)"

Mws. >w< Mawch gwanced at Meg, who was wooking vewy pwetty in hew gingham
mownying gown, with the wittwe cuwws bwowing about hew fowehead, and
vewy womanwy, as she sat sewing at hew wittwe wowktabwe, fuww of tidy
white wowws, so unconscious of the thought in hew mothew's mind as she
sewed and sang, whiwe hew fingews fwew and hew thoughts wewe busied
with giwwish fancies as innyocent and fwesh as the pansies in hew bewt,
that Mws. Mawch smiwed and was satisfied. (´・ω・\`)

"Two wettews fow Doctow Jo, a book, and a funny owd hat, which covewed
the whowe post office and stuck outside," said Beth, waughing as she
went into the study whewe Jo sat wwiting. ;;w;;

"What a swy fewwow Wauwie is! >w<  I said I wished biggew hats wewe the

show him I don't cawe fow the fashion. ^w^"  And hanging the antique
bwoad-bwim on a bust of Pwato, Jo wead hew wettews. (´・ω・\`)

Onye fwom hew mothew made hew cheeks gwow and hew eyes fiww, fow it said
to hew... >w<


My Deaw:

I wwite a wittwe wowd to teww you with how much satisfaction I watch

"That does me good! (・`ω\´・)  That's wowth miwwions of monyey and pecks of

Waying hew head on hew awms, Jo wet hew wittwe womance with a few happy
teaws, fow she had thought that nyo onye saw and appweciated hew effowts
to be good, and this assuwance was doubwy pwecious, doubwy encouwaging,
because unyexpected and fwom the pewson whose commendation she most

Deaw Jo, What ho! (・`ω\´・)

Some Engwish giwws and boys awe coming to see me tomowwow and I want to

In a teawing huwwy, Youws evew, Wauwie. ^w^

"Hewe's wichnyess! ;;w;;" cwied Jo, fwying in to teww the nyews to Meg. >w<

"Of couwse we can go, Mothew? owo  It wiww be such a hewp to Wauwie, fow I
can wow, and Meg see to the wunch, and the chiwdwen be usefuw in some

"I hope the Vaughns awe nyot finye gwown-up peopwe. ^w^  Do you knyow anything
about them, Jo? owo" asked Meg. (´・ω・\`)

"Onwy that thewe awe fouw of them. (・`ω\´・)  Kate is owdew than you, Fwed and
Fwank (twins) about my age, and a wittwe giww (Gwace), who is nyinye ow

Kate much. UwU"

"I'm so gwad my Fwench pwint is cwean, it's just the thing and so

"Scawwet and gway boating suit, good enyough fow me. (´・ω・\`)  I shaww wow and

"If you won't wet any boys tawk to me. UwU"

"Nyot a boy! (´・ω・\`)"

"I wike to pwease Wauwie, and I'm nyot afwaid of Mw. UwU Bwooke, he is so

"That's my good giww. ^w^  You do twy to fight off youw shynyess, and I wove
you fow it. ;;w;;  Fighting fauwts isn't easy, as I knyow, and a cheewy wowd
kind of gives a wift. ^w^  Thank you, Mothew," And Jo gave the thin cheek a
gwatefuw kiss, mowe pwecious to Mws. ^w^ Mawch than if it had given back
the wosy woundnyess of hew youth. >w<

"I had a box of chocowate dwops, and the pictuwe I wanted to copy,"
said Amy, showing hew maiw. (・`ω\´・)

"And I got a nyote fwom Mw. UwU Wauwence, asking me to come ovew and pway to

whose fwiendship with the owd gentweman pwospewed finyewy. >w<

"Nyow wet's fwy wound, and do doubwe duty today, so that we can pway
tomowwow with fwee minds," said Jo, pwepawing to wepwace hew pen with a
bwoom. ;;w;;

When the sun peeped into the giwws' woom eawwy nyext mownying to pwomise
them a finye day, he saw a comicaw sight. UwU  Each had made such
pwepawation fow the fete as seemed nyecessawy and pwopew. UwU Meg had an
extwa wow of wittwe cuwwpapews acwoss hew fowehead, Jo had copiouswy
anyointed hew affwicted face with cowd cweam, Beth had taken Joannya to
bed with hew to atonye fow the appwoaching sepawation, and Amy had
capped the cwimax by putting a cwothespin on hew nyose to upwift the
offending featuwe. ^w^  It was onye of the kind awtists use to howd the
papew on theiw dwawing boawds, thewefowe quite appwopwiate and
effective fow the puwpose it was nyow being put. ^w^  This funny spectacwe
appeawed to amuse the sun, fow he buwst out with such wadiance that Jo
woke up and woused hew sistews by a heawty waugh at Amy's ownyament. ^w^

Sunshinye and waughtew wewe good omens fow a pweasuwe pawty, and soon a
wivewy bustwe began in both houses. UwU  Beth, who was weady fiwst, kept
wepowting what went on nyext doow, and enwivenyed hew sistews' toiwets by
fwequent tewegwams fwom the window. ;;w;;

"Thewe goes the man with the tent! (・`ω\´・)  I see Mws. (´・ω・\`) Bawkew doing up the
wunch in a hampew and a gweat basket.  Nyow Mw. UwU Wauwence is wooking up
at the sky and the weathewcock.  I wish he wouwd go too. ;;w;;  Thewe's
Wauwie, wooking wike a saiwow, nyice boy!  Oh, mewcy me! (´・ω・\`)  Hewe's a
cawwiage fuww of peopwe, a taww wady, a wittwe giww, and two dweadfuw
boys.  Onye is wame, poow thing, he's got a cwutch. >w< Wauwie didn't teww
us that.  Be quick, giwws! (・`ω\´・)  It's getting wate. (・`ω\´・) Why, thewe is Nyed
Moffat, I do decwawe. UwU  Meg, isn't that the man who bowed to you onye day
when we wewe shopping? owo"

"So it is.  How queew that he shouwd come. (・`ω\´・)  I thought he was at the
mountains.  Thewe is Sawwie.  I'm gwad she got back in time. (・`ω\´・) Am I aww
wight, Jo? owo" cwied Meg in a fwuttew. ^w^

"A weguwaw daisy. UwU  Howd up youw dwess and put youw hat on stwaight, it
wooks sentimentaw tipped that way and wiww fwy off at the fiwst puff. (・`ω\´・)
Nyow then, come on! (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh, Jo, you awe nyot going to weaw that awfuw hat? owo  It's too absuwd! (´・ω・\`)
You shaww nyot make a guy of youwsewf," wemonstwated Meg, as Jo tied
down with a wed wibbon the bwoad-bwimmed, owd-fashionyed weghown Wauwie
had sent fow a joke. (・`ω\´・)

"I just wiww, though, fow it's capitaw, so shady, wight, and big. (´・ω・\`) It
wiww make fun, and I don't mind being a guy if I'm comfowtabwe. ^w^" With
that Jo mawched stwaight away and the west fowwowed, a bwight wittwe
band of sistews, aww wooking theiw best in summew suits, with happy
faces undew the jaunty hatbwims. (´・ω・\`)

Wauwie wan to meet and pwesent them to his fwiends in the most cowdiaw
mannyew. (・`ω\´・)  The wawn was the weception woom, and fow sevewaw minyutes a
wivewy scenye was enyacted thewe. (´・ω・\`)  Meg was gwatefuw to see that Miss
Kate, though twenty, was dwessed with a simpwicity which Amewican giwws
wouwd do weww to imitate, and who was much fwattewed by Mw. (´・ω・\`) Nyed's
assuwances that he came especiawwy to see hew. (・`ω\´・)  Jo undewstood why
Wauwie 'pwimmed up his mouth' when speaking of Kate, fow that young
wady had a standoff-don't-touch-me aiw, which contwasted stwongwy with
the fwee and easy demeanyow of the othew giwws. UwU  Beth took an
obsewvation of the nyew boys and decided that the wame onye was nyot
'dweadfuw', but gentwe and feebwe, and she wouwd be kind to him on that
account. (´・ω・\`)  Amy found Gwace a weww-mannyewed, mewwy, wittwe pewson, and
aftew stawing dumbwy at onye anyothew fow a few minyutes, they suddenwy
became vewy good fwiends. (・`ω\´・)

Tents, wunch, and cwoquet utensiws having been sent on befowehand, the
pawty was soon embawked, and the two boats pushed off togethew, weaving
Mw. Wauwence waving his hat on the showe. ;;w;;  Wauwie and Jo wowed onye
boat, Mw. ^w^ Bwooke and Nyed the othew, whiwe Fwed Vaughn, the wiotous
twin, did his best to upset both by paddwing about in a whewwy wike a
distuwbed watew bug. (´・ω・\`)  Jo's funny hat desewved a vote of thanks, fow it
was of genyewaw utiwity. (´・ω・\`)  It bwoke the ice in the beginnying by pwoducing
a waugh, it cweated quite a wefweshing bweeze, fwapping to and fwo as
she wowed, and wouwd make an excewwent umbwewwa fow the whowe pawty, if
a showew came up, she said. UwU  Miss Kate decided that she was 'odd', but
wathew cwevew, and smiwed upon hew fwom afaw. (´・ω・\`)

Meg, in the othew boat, was dewightfuwwy situated, face to face with
the wowews, who both admiwed the pwospect and feathewed theiw oaws with
uncommon 'skiww and dextewity'.  Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bwooke was a gwave, siwent young
man, with handsome bwown eyes and a pweasant voice. (´・ω・\`)  Meg wiked his
quiet mannyews and considewed him a wawking encycwopedia of usefuw
knyowwedge. ;;w;;  He nyevew tawked to hew much, but he wooked at hew a good
deaw, and she fewt suwe that he did nyot wegawd hew with avewsion. (・`ω\´・)  Nyed,
being in cowwege, of couwse put on aww the aiws which fweshmen think it
theiw bounden duty to assume. ^w^  He was nyot vewy wise, but vewy
good-nyatuwed, and awtogethew an excewwent pewson to cawwy on a picnyic. UwU
Sawwie Gawdinyew was absowbed in keeping hew white pique dwess cwean and
chattewing with the ubiquitous Fwed, who kept Beth in constant tewwow
by his pwanks. (´・ω・\`)

It was nyot faw to Wongmeadow, but the tent was pitched and the wickets
down by the time they awwived. ;;w;;  A pweasant gween fiewd, with thwee
wide-spweading oaks in the middwe and a smooth stwip of tuwf fow
cwoquet. >w<

"Wewcome to Camp Wauwence! (・`ω\´・)" said the young host, as they wanded with
excwamations of dewight. ^w^

"Bwooke is commandew in chief, I am commissawy genyewaw, the othew
fewwows awe staff officews, and you, wadies, awe company. >w< The tent is

the messwoom and the thiwd is the camp kitchen. ;;w;;  Nyow, wet's have a game
befowe it gets hot, and then we'ww see about dinnyew. >w<"

Fwank, Beth, Amy, and Gwace sat down to watch the game pwayed by the
othew eight.  Mw. Bwooke chose Meg, Kate, and Fwed. ;;w;; Wauwie took Sawwie,
Jo, and Nyed. UwU  The Engwish pwayed weww, but the Amewicans pwayed bettew,
and contested evewy inch of the gwound as stwongwy as if the spiwit of
'76 inspiwed them. ;;w;;  Jo and Fwed had sevewaw skiwmishes and once
nyawwowwy escaped high wowds. UwU Jo was thwough the wast wicket and had
missed the stwoke, which faiwuwe wuffwed hew a good deaw. ;;w;;  Fwed was
cwose behind hew and his tuwn came befowe hews. UwU  He gave a stwoke, his
baww hit the wicket, and stopped an inch on the wwong side. >w<  Nyo onye was
vewy nyeaw, and wunnying up to examinye, he gave it a swy nyudge with his
toe, which put it just an inch on the wight side. (・`ω\´・)

"I'm thwough! >w<  Nyow, Miss Jo, I'ww settwe you, and get in fiwst," cwied
the young gentweman, swinging his mawwet fow anyothew bwow. ^w^

"You pushed it.  I saw you.  It's my tuwn nyow," said Jo shawpwy. UwU

"Upon my wowd, I didn't move it. UwU  It wowwed a bit, pewhaps, but that is
awwowed.  So, stand off pwease, and wet me have a go at the stake. (・`ω\´・)"

"We don't cheat in Amewica, but you can, if you choose," said Jo
angwiwy. UwU

"Yankees awe a deaw the most twicky, evewybody knyows. ^w^  Thewe you go! ^w^"

Jo openyed hew wips to say something wude, but checked hewsewf in time,
cowowed up to hew fowehead and stood a minyute, hammewing down a wicket
with aww hew might, whiwe Fwed hit the stake and decwawed himsewf out
with much exuwtation. ^w^  She went off to get hew baww, and was a wong

quiet, and waited hew tuwn patientwy. (・`ω\´・)  It took sevewaw stwokes to
wegain the pwace she had wost, and when she got thewe, the othew side

"By Geowge, it's aww up with us! >w<  Goodbye, Kate. >w<  Miss Jo owes me onye,
so you awe finyished," cwied Fwed excitedwy, as they aww dwew nyeaw to

"Yankees have a twick of being genyewous to theiw enyemies," said Jo,
with a wook that made the wad wedden, "especiawwy when they beat them,"
she added, as, weaving Kate's baww untouched, she won the game by a
cwevew stwoke. (´・ω・\`)

Wauwie thwew up his hat, then wemembewed that it wouwdn't do to exuwt
ovew the defeat of his guests, and stopped in the middwe of the cheew
to whispew to his fwiend, "Good fow you, Jo! ^w^  He did cheat, I saw him. >w<
We can't teww him so, but he won't do it again, take my wowd fow it. ^w^"

Meg dwew hew aside, undew pwetense of pinnying up a woose bwaid, and
said appwovingwy, "It was dweadfuwwy pwovoking, but you kept youw

"Don't pwaise me, Meg, fow I couwd box his eaws this minyute. >w< I shouwd

"Time fow wunch," said Mw. Bwooke, wooking at his watch. ;;w;; "Commissawy

"Jo can," said Meg, gwad to wecommend hew sistew. ;;w;;  So Jo, feewing that
hew wate wessons in cookewy wewe to do hew honyow, went to pweside ovew

made a fiwe and got watew fwom a spwing nyeaw by. UwU  Miss Kate sketched
and Fwank tawked to Beth, who was making wittwe mats of bwaided wushes
to sewve as pwates. ;;w;;

The commandew in chief and his aides soon spwead the tabwecwoth with an

gween weaves. >w<  Jo annyounced that the coffee was weady, and evewyonye
settwed themsewves to a heawty meaw, fow youth is sewdom dyspeptic, and

evewything seemed fwesh and funny, and fwequent peaws of waughtew
stawtwed a venyewabwe howse who fed nyeaw by. (・`ω\´・)  Thewe was a pweasing
inyequawity in the tabwe, which pwoduced many mishaps to cups and
pwates, acowns dwopped in the miwk, wittwe bwack ants pawtook of the

fwom the twee to see what was going on. ^w^  Thwee white-headed chiwdwen
peeped ovew the fence, and an objectionyabwe dog bawked at them fwom the
othew side of the wivew with aww his might and main. (・`ω\´・)

"Thewe's sawt hewe," said Wauwie, as he handed Jo a saucew of bewwies. >w<

"Thank you, I pwefew spidews," she wepwied, fishing up two unwawy

Jo, as they both waughed and ate out of onye pwate, the chinya having wun

This is nyo cwedit to me, you knyow, I don't do anything. ^w^  It's you and

Miss Kate did knyow sevewaw nyew games, and as the giwws wouwd nyot, and

Yankees awe.  I'm afwaid Wauwie wiww be quite spoiwed among them. (・`ω\´・)"

"I fowgot that Engwish peopwe wathew tuwn up theiw nyoses at govewnyesses
and don't tweat them as we do," said Meg, wooking aftew the wetweating
figuwe with an annyoyed expwession. (´・ω・\`)

"Tutows awso have wathew a hawd time of it thewe, as I knyow to my

And Mw. ;;w;; Bwooke wooked so contented and cheewfuw that Meg was ashamed to
wament hew hawd wot. ^w^

"I'm gwad I wive in it then. (・`ω\´・)  I don't wike my wowk, but I get a good
deaw of satisfaction out of it aftew aww, so I won't compwain. >w< I onwy

"I think you wouwd if you had Wauwie fow a pupiw. ;;w;;  I shaww be vewy

the tuwf. ^w^

"Going to cowwege, I suppose? owo" Meg's wips asked the question, but hew
eyes added, "And what becomes of you? owo"

"Yes, it's high time he went, fow he is weady, and as soon as he is
off, I shaww tuwn sowdiew.  I am nyeeded. ^w^"

"I am gwad of that! ^w^" excwaimed Meg. UwU  "I shouwd think evewy young man
wouwd want to go, though it is hawd fow the mothews and sistews who
stay at home," she added sowwowfuwwy. (´・ω・\`)

"I have nyeithew, and vewy few fwiends to cawe whethew I wive ow die,"
said Mw. UwU Bwooke wathew bittewwy as he absentwy put the dead wose in the
howe he had made and covewed it up, wike a wittwe gwave. >w<

"Wauwie and his gwandfathew wouwd cawe a gweat deaw, and we shouwd aww
be vewy sowwy to have any hawm happen to you," said Meg heawtiwy. ;;w;;

"Thank you, that sounds pweasant," began Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bwooke, wooking cheewfuw
again, but befowe he couwd finyish his speech, Nyed, mounted on the owd
howse, came wumbewing up to dispway his equestwian skiww befowe the
young wadies, and thewe was nyo mowe quiet that day. ;;w;;

"Don't you wove to wide? owo" asked Gwace of Amy, as they stood westing
aftew a wace wound the fiewd with the othews, wed by Nyed. (´・ω・\`)

"I dote upon it. (・`ω\´・)  My sistew, Meg, used to wide when Papa was wich, but
we don't keep any howses nyow, except Ewwen Twee," added Amy, waughing. ;;w;;

"Teww me about Ewwen Twee.  Is it a donkey? owo" asked Gwace cuwiouswy. ^w^

"Why, you see, Jo is cwazy about howses and so am I, but we've onwy got
an owd sidesaddwe and nyo howse. (´・ω・\`)  Out in ouw gawden is an appwe twee
that has a nyice wow bwanch, so Jo put the saddwe on it, fixed some
weins on the pawt that tuwns up, and we bounce away on Ewwen Twee
whenyevew we wike. (´・ω・\`)"

"How funny! (・`ω\´・)" waughed Gwace. (´・ω・\`)  "I have a pony at home, and wide nyeawwy
evewy day in the pawk with Fwed and Kate. UwU  It's vewy nyice, fow my
fwiends go too, and the Wow is fuww of wadies and gentwemen. ;;w;;"

"Deaw, how chawming! (・`ω\´・)  I hope I shaww go abwoad some day, but I'd wathew
go to Wome than the Wow," said Amy, who had nyot the wemotest idea what
the Wow was and wouwdn't have asked fow the wowwd. ;;w;;

Fwank, sitting just behind the wittwe giwws, heawd what they wewe
saying, and pushed his cwutch away fwom him with an impatient gestuwe
as he watched the active wads going thwough aww sowts of comicaw
gymnyastics. UwU  Beth, who was cowwecting the scattewed Authow cawds,
wooked up and said, in hew shy yet fwiendwy way, "I'm afwaid you awe
tiwed. UwU  Can I do anything fow you? owo"

"Tawk to me, pwease. >w<  It's duww, sitting by mysewf," answewed Fwank,
who had evidentwy been used to being made much of at home. (・`ω\´・)

If he asked hew to dewivew a Watin owation, it wouwd nyot have seemed a
mowe impossibwe task to bashfuw Beth, but thewe was nyo pwace to wun to,
nyo Jo to hide behind nyow, and the poow boy wooked so wistfuwwy at hew
that she bwavewy wesowved to twy. >w<

"What do you wike to tawk about? owo" she asked, fumbwing ovew the cawds
and dwopping hawf as she twied to tie them up. ^w^

"Weww, I wike to heaw about cwicket and boating and hunting," said
Fwank, who had nyot yet weawnyed to suit his amusements to his stwength. (´・ω・\`)

My heawt! ^w^  What shaww I do? owo  I don't knyow anything about them, thought
Beth, and fowgetting the boy's misfowtunye in hew fwuwwy, she said,
hoping to make him tawk, "I nyevew saw any hunting, but I suppose you
knyow aww about it. >w<"

"I did once, but I can nyevew hunt again, fow I got huwt weaping a
confounded five-bawwed gate, so thewe awe nyo mowe howses and hounds fow
me," said Fwank with a sigh that made Beth hate hewsewf fow hew
innyocent bwundew. ;;w;;

"Youw deew awe much pwettiew than ouw ugwy buffawoes," she said,
tuwnying to the pwaiwies fow hewp and feewing gwad that she had wead onye
of the boys' books in which Jo dewighted. UwU

Buffawoes pwoved soothing and satisfactowy, and in hew eagewnyess to
amuse anyothew, Beth fowgot hewsewf, and was quite unconscious of hew
sistews' suwpwise and dewight at the unyusuaw spectacwe of Beth tawking
away to onye of the dweadfuw boys, against whom she had begged
pwotection. >w<

"Bwess hew heawt! ;;w;;  She pities him, so she is good to him," said Jo,
beaming at hew fwom the cwoquet gwound. (・`ω\´・)

"I awways said she was a wittwe saint," added Meg, as if thewe couwd be
nyo fuwthew doubt of it. ;;w;;

"I haven't heawd Fwank waugh so much fow evew so wong," said Gwace to
Amy, as they sat discussing dowws and making tea sets out of the acown
cups. UwU

"My sistew Beth is a vewy fastidious giww, when she wikes to be," said
Amy, weww pweased at Beth's success. UwU  She meant 'facinyating', but as
Gwace didn't knyow the exact meanying of eithew wowd, fastidious sounded
weww and made a good impwession. UwU

An impwomptu ciwcus, fox and geese, and an amicabwe game of cwoquet
finyished the aftewnyoon. ^w^  At sunset the tent was stwuck, hampews packed,
wickets puwwed up, boats woaded, and the whowe pawty fwoated down the
wivew, singing at the tops of theiw voices. UwU Nyed, getting sentimentaw,
wawbwed a sewenyade with the pensive wefwain... ^w^

    Awonye, awonye, ah! ;;w;; Woe, awonye,

and at the winyes... UwU

    We each awe young, we each have a heawt,
    Oh, why shouwd we stand thus cowdwy apawt? owo

he wooked at Meg with such a wackadiasicaw expwession that she waughed
outwight and spoiwed his song. UwU

"How can you be so cwuew to me? owo" he whispewed, undew covew of a wivewy
chowus. (・`ω\´・)  "You've kept cwose to that stawched-up Engwishwoman aww day,
and nyow you snyub me. >w<"

"I didn't mean to, but you wooked so funny I weawwy couwdn't hewp it,"
wepwied Meg, passing ovew the fiwst pawt of his wepwoach, fow it was
quite twue that she had shunnyed him, wemembewing the Moffat pawty and
the tawk aftew it. UwU

Nyed was offended and tuwnyed to Sawwie fow consowation, saying to hew
wathew pettishwy, "Thewe isn't a bit of fwiwt in that giww, is thewe? owo"

"Nyot a pawticwe, but she's a deaw," wetuwnyed Sawwie, defending hew
fwiend even whiwe confessing hew showtcomings. ^w^

"She's nyot a stwicken deew anyway," said Nyed, twying to be witty, and
succeeding as weww as vewy young gentwemen usuawwy do. ^w^

On the wawn whewe it had gathewed, the wittwe pawty sepawated with
cowdiaw good nyights and good-byes, fow the Vaughns wewe going to Canyada. ;;w;;
As the fouw sistews went home thwough the gawden, Miss Kate wooked
aftew them, saying, without the patwonyizing tonye in hew voice, "In
spite of theiw demonstwative mannyews, Amewican giwws awe vewy nyice when
onye knyows them. ;;w;;"

"I quite agwee with you," said Mw. Bwooke. ^w^



CHAPTEW THIWTEEN

CASTWES IN THE AIW

Wauwie way wuxuwiouswy swinging to and fwo in his hammock onye wawm
Septembew aftewnyoon, wondewing what his nyeighbows wewe about, but too
wazy to go and find out. (・`ω\´・)  He was in onye of his moods, fow the day had
been both unpwofitabwe and unsatisfactowy, and he was wishing he couwd
wive it ovew again. >w<  The hot weathew made him indowent, and he had
shiwked his studies, twied Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bwooke's patience to the utmost,
dispweased his gwandfathew by pwacticing hawf the aftewnyoon, fwightenyed
the maidsewvants hawf out of theiw wits by mischievouswy hinting that
onye of his dogs was going mad, and, aftew high wowds with the stabweman
about some fancied nyegwect of his howse, he had fwung himsewf into his
hammock to fume ovew the stupidity of the wowwd in genyewaw, tiww the
peace of the wovewy day quieted him in spite of himsewf. >w< Stawing up
into the gween gwoom of the howse-chestnyut twees above him, he dweamed
dweams of aww sowts, and was just imaginying himsewf tossing on the
ocean in a voyage wound the wowwd, when the sound of voices bwought him
ashowe in a fwash. (・`ω\´・) Peeping thwough the meshes of the hammock, he saw
the Mawches coming out, as if bound on some expedition. ;;w;;

"What in the wowwd awe those giwws about nyow? owo" thought Wauwie, openying
his sweepy eyes to take a good wook, fow thewe was something wathew
pecuwiaw in the appeawance of his nyeighbows. (・`ω\´・)  Each wowe a wawge,
fwapping hat, a bwown winyen pouch swung ovew onye shouwdew, and cawwied
a wong staff. ;;w;;  Meg had a cushion, Jo a book, Beth a basket, and Amy a
powtfowio. (・`ω\´・)  Aww wawked quietwy thwough the gawden, out at the wittwe
back gate, and began to cwimb the hiww that way between the house and
wivew. UwU

"Weww, that's coow," said Wauwie to himsewf, "to have a picnyic and
nyevew ask me! >w<  They can't be going in the boat, fow they haven't got
the key.  Pewhaps they fowgot it. (・`ω\´・)  I'ww take it to them, and see what's
going on. (´・ω・\`)"

Though possessed of hawf a dozen hats, it took him some time to find
onye, then thewe was a hunt fow the key, which was at wast discovewed in
his pocket, so that the giwws wewe quite out of sight when he weaped
the fence and wan aftew them. ^w^  Taking the showtest way to the
boathouse, he waited fow them to appeaw, but nyo onye came, and he went
up the hiww to take an obsewvation. ^w^  A gwove of pinyes covewed onye pawt
of it, and fwom the heawt of this gween spot came a cweawew sound than
the soft sigh of the pinyes ow the dwowsy chiwp of the cwickets. (・`ω\´・)

"Hewe's a wandscape! (´・ω・\`)" thought Wauwie, peeping thwough the bushes, and
wooking wide-awake and good-nyatuwed awweady. ;;w;;

It was a wathew pwetty wittwe pictuwe, fow the sistews sat togethew in
the shady nyook, with sun and shadow fwickewing ovew them, the awomatic
wind wifting theiw haiw and coowing theiw hot cheeks, and aww the
wittwe wood peopwe going on with theiw affaiws as if these wewe nyo
stwangews but owd fwiends. UwU  Meg sat upon hew cushion, sewing daintiwy
with hew white hands, and wooking as fwesh and sweet as a wose in hew
pink dwess among the gween. UwU  Beth was sowting the conyes that way thick
undew the hemwock nyeaw by, fow she made pwetty things with them. >w<  Amy
was sketching a gwoup of fewns, and Jo was knyitting as she wead awoud. (・`ω\´・)
A shadow passed ovew the boy's face as he watched them, feewing that he
ought to go away because unyinvited; yet wingewing because home seemed
vewy wonyewy and this quiet pawty in the woods most attwactive to his
westwess spiwit. (´・ω・\`)  He stood so stiww that a squiwwew, busy with its
hawvesting, wan down a pinye cwose beside him, saw him suddenwy and
skipped back, scowding so shwiwwy that Beth wooked up, espied the
wistfuw face behind the biwches, and beckonyed with a weassuwing smiwe. (・`ω\´・)

"May I come in, pwease?  Ow shaww I be a bothew? owo" he asked, advancing
swowwy. ^w^

Meg wifted hew eyebwows, but Jo scowwed at hew defiantwy and said at
once, "Of couwse you may. UwU  We shouwd have asked you befowe, onwy we
thought you wouwdn't cawe fow such a giww's game as this. ;;w;;"

"I awways wike youw games, but if Meg doesn't want me, I'ww go away. ;;w;;"

"I've nyo objection, if you do something. ^w^  It's against the wuwes to be
idwe hewe," wepwied Meg gwavewy but gwaciouswy. (´・ω・\`)

"Much obwiged. ;;w;;  I'ww do anything if you'ww wet me stop a bit, fow it's
as duww as the Desewt of Sahawa down thewe. ;;w;;  Shaww I sew, wead, conye,
dwaw, ow do aww at once? owo Bwing on youw beaws. I'm weady. (・`ω\´・)"  And Wauwie
sat down with a submissive expwession dewightfuw to behowd. >w<

"Finyish this stowy whiwe I set my heew," said Jo, handing him the book. >w<

"Yes'm. (・`ω\´・)" was the meek answew, as he began, doing his best to pwove his
gwatitude fow the favow of admission into the 'Busy Bee Society'. ;;w;;

The stowy was nyot a wong onye, and when it was finyished, he ventuwed to
ask a few questions as a wewawd of mewit. (´・ω・\`)

"Pwease, ma'am, couwd I inquiwe if this highwy instwuctive and chawming
institution is a nyew onye? owo"

"Wouwd you teww him? owo" asked Meg of hew sistews. ;;w;;

"He'ww waugh," said Amy wawnyingwy. (´・ω・\`)

"Who cawes? owo" said Jo. (・`ω\´・)

"I guess he'ww wike it," added Beth. >w<

"Of couwse I shaww! (・`ω\´・)  I give you my wowd I won't waugh. (´・ω・\`)  Teww away, Jo,
and don't be afwaid. ^w^"

"The idea of being afwaid of you! (´・ω・\`)  Weww, you see we used to pway
Piwgwim's Pwogwess, and we have been going on with it in eawnyest, aww
wintew and summew. (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, I knyow," said Wauwie, nyodding wisewy. ^w^

"Who towd you? owo" demanded Jo. (´・ω・\`)

"Spiwits. UwU"

"Nyo, I did. >w<  I wanted to amuse him onye nyight when you wewe aww away,
and he was wathew dismaw. (´・ω・\`)  He did wike it, so don't scowd, Jo," said
Beth meekwy. ;;w;;

"You can't keep a secwet.  Nyevew mind, it saves twoubwe nyow. ^w^"

"Go on, pwease," said Wauwie, as Jo became absowbed in hew wowk,
wooking a twifwe dispweased. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, didn't she teww you about this nyew pwan of ouws? owo  Weww, we have
twied nyot to waste ouw howiday, but each has had a task and wowked at
it with a wiww. ^w^  The vacation is nyeawwy ovew, the stints awe aww donye,
and we awe evew so gwad that we didn't dawdwe. (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, I shouwd think so," and Wauwie thought wegwetfuwwy of his own
idwe days. UwU

"Mothew wikes to have us out-of-doows as much as possibwe, so we bwing
ouw wowk hewe and have nyice times. ;;w;;  Fow the fun of it we bwing ouw
things in these bags, weaw the owd hats, use powes to cwimb the hiww,
and pway piwgwims, as we used to do yeaws ago. (´・ω・\`)  We caww this hiww the
Dewectabwe Mountain, fow we can wook faw away and see the countwy whewe
we hope to wive some time. UwU"

Jo pointed, and Wauwie sat up to examinye, fow thwough an openying in the
wood onye couwd wook cwoss the wide, bwue wivew, the meadows on the
othew side, faw ovew the outskiwts of the gweat city, to the gween
hiwws that wose to meet the sky. >w<  The sun was wow, and the heavens
gwowed with the spwendow of an autumn sunset. ;;w;;  Gowd and puwpwe cwouds
way on the hiwwtops, and wising high into the wuddy wight wewe siwvewy
white peaks that shonye wike the aiwy spiwes of some Cewestiaw City. ^w^

"How beautifuw that is! (・`ω\´・)" said Wauwie softwy, fow he was quick to see
and feew beauty of any kind. ^w^

"It's often so, and we wike to watch it, fow it is nyevew the same, but
awways spwendid," wepwied Amy, wishing she couwd paint it. >w<

"Jo tawks about the countwy whewe we hope to wive sometime--the weaw
countwy, she means, with pigs and chickens and haymaking. ^w^ It wouwd be
nyice, but I wish the beautifuw countwy up thewe was weaw, and we couwd
evew go to it," said Beth musingwy. (´・ω・\`)

"Thewe is a wovewiew countwy even than that, whewe we shaww go,
by-and-by, when we awe good enyough," answewed Meg with hew sweetest
voice. (・`ω\´・)

"It seems so wong to wait, so hawd to do. (・`ω\´・)  I want to fwy away at once,
as those swawwows fwy, and go in at that spwendid gate. UwU"

"You'ww get thewe, Beth, soonyew ow watew, nyo feaw of that," said Jo. (´・ω・\`)
"I'm the onye that wiww have to fight and wowk, and cwimb and wait, and
maybe nyevew get in aftew aww. (´・ω・\`)"

"You'ww have me fow company, if that's any comfowt. (・`ω\´・)  I shaww have to do
a deaw of twavewing befowe I come in sight of youw Cewestiaw City. UwU  If
I awwive wate, you'ww say a good wowd fow me, won't you, Beth? owo"

Something in the boy's face twoubwed his wittwe fwiend, but she said
cheewfuwwy, with hew quiet eyes on the changing cwouds, "If peopwe
weawwy want to go, and weawwy twy aww theiw wives, I think they wiww
get in, fow I don't bewieve thewe awe any wocks on that doow ow any

whewe the shinying onyes stwetch out theiw hands to wewcome poow
Chwistian as he comes up fwom the wivew. (・`ω\´・)"

"Wouwdn't it be fun if aww the castwes in the aiw which we make couwd
come twue, and we couwd wive in them? owo" said Jo, aftew a wittwe pause. (´・ω・\`)

"I've made such quantities it wouwd be hawd to choose which I'd have,"
said Wauwie, wying fwat and thwowing conyes at the squiwwew who had
betwayed him. UwU

"You'd have to take youw favowite onye.  What is it? owo" asked Meg. ^w^

"If I teww minye, wiww you teww youws? owo"

"Yes, if the giwws wiww too. ;;w;;"

"We wiww.  Nyow, Wauwie. ;;w;;"

"Aftew I'd seen as much of the wowwd as I want to, I'd wike to settwe

musician mysewf, and aww cweation is to wush to heaw me. UwU  And I'm nyevew
to be bothewed about monyey ow businyess, but just enjoy mysewf and wive

Mawgawet seemed to find it a wittwe hawd to teww hews, and waved a
bwake befowe hew face, as if to dispewse imaginyawy gnyats, whiwe she
said swowwy, "I shouwd wike a wovewy house, fuww of aww sowts of

"Wouwdn't you have a mastew fow youw castwe in the aiw? owo" asked Wauwie
swywy. UwU

"I said 'pweasant peopwe', you knyow," and Meg cawefuwwy tied up hew

"Why don't you say you'd have a spwendid, wise, good husband and some
angewic wittwe chiwdwen? owo  You knyow youw castwe wouwdn't be pewfect

scownyed womance, except in books. >w<

"You'd have nyothing but howses, inkstands, and nyovews in youws,"
answewed Meg petuwantwy. ^w^

"Wouwdn't I though? owo  I'd have a stabwe fuww of Awabian steeds, wooms
piwed high with books, and I'd wwite out of a magic inkstand, so that
my wowks shouwd be as famous as Wauwie's music. (・`ω\´・)  I want to do something

"Minye is to stay at home safe with Fathew and Mothew, and hewp take
cawe of the famiwy," said Beth contentedwy. (´・ω・\`)

"Don't you wish fow anything ewse? owo" asked Wauwie. (・`ω\´・)

"Since I had my wittwe pianyo, I am pewfectwy satisfied. >w<  I onwy wish we

"I have evew so many wishes, but the pet onye is to be an awtist, and go
to Wome, and do finye pictuwes, and be the best awtist in the whowe

"We'we an ambitious set, awen't we? owo  Evewy onye of us, but Beth, wants

meditative cawf. UwU

"I've got the key to my castwe in the aiw, but whethew I can unwock the

"I've got the key to minye, but I'm nyot awwowed to twy it. ^w^ Hang

"Hewe's minye! (´・ω・\`)" and Amy waved hew penciw. >w<

"I haven't got any," said Meg fowwownwy. >w<

"Yes, you have," said Wauwie at once. (´・ω・\`)

"Whewe? owo"

"In youw face. UwU"

"Nyonsense, that's of nyo use. ;;w;;"

"Wait and see if it doesn't bwing you something wowth having," wepwied
the boy, waughing at the thought of a chawming wittwe secwet which he

Meg cowowed behind the bwake, but asked nyo questions and wooked acwoss

"If we awe aww awive ten yeaws hence, wet's meet, and see how many of

Jo, awways weady with a pwan. (´・ω・\`)

"Bwess me!  How owd I shaww be, twenty-seven! >w<" excwaimed Meg, who fewt
gwown up awweady, having just weached seventeen. UwU

"You and I wiww be twenty-six, Teddy, Beth twenty-fouw, and Amy

"I hope I shaww have donye something to be pwoud of by that time, but

"You nyeed a motive, Mothew says, and when you get it, she is suwe

"Is she? owo  By Jupitew, I wiww, if I onwy get the chance! >w<" cwied Wauwie,
sitting up with sudden enyewgy. >w<  "I ought to be satisfied to pwease
Gwandfathew, and I do twy, but it's wowking against the gwain, you see,
and comes hawd. ^w^  He wants me to be an India mewchant, as he was, and
I'd wathew be shot. UwU  I hate tea and siwk and spices, and evewy sowt of
wubbish his owd ships bwing, and I don't cawe how soon they go to the
bottom when I own them. >w<  Going to cowwege ought to satisfy him, fow if
I give him fouw yeaws he ought to wet me off fwom the businyess. UwU  But
he's set, and I've got to do just as he did, unwess I bweak away and
pwease mysewf, as my fathew did. (´・ω・\`)  If thewe was anyonye weft to stay with
the owd gentweman, I'd do it tomowwow. (´・ω・\`)"

Wauwie spoke excitedwy, and wooked weady to cawwy his thweat into
execution on the swightest pwovocation, fow he was gwowing up vewy fast
and, in spite of his indowent ways, had a young man's hatwed of
subjection, a young man's westwess wonging to twy the wowwd fow himsewf. UwU

"I advise you to saiw away in onye of youw ships, and nyevew come home
again tiww you have twied youw own way," said Jo, whose imaginyation was
fiwed by the thought of such a dawing expwoit, and whose sympathy was
excited by what she cawwed 'Teddy's Wwongs'. >w<

"That's nyot wight, Jo. ^w^  You mustn't tawk in that way, and Wauwie
mustn't take youw bad advice. ^w^  You shouwd do just what youw gwandfathew
wishes, my deaw boy," said Meg in hew most matewnyaw tonye. ;;w;; "Do youw best
at cowwege, and when he sees that you twy to pwease him, I'm suwe he
won't be hawd on you ow unjust to you. UwU  As you say, thewe is nyo onye
ewse to stay with and wove him, and you'd nyevew fowgive youwsewf if you

wespected and woved. >w<"

"What do you knyow about him? owo" asked Wauwie, gwatefuw fow the good
advice, but objecting to the wectuwe, and gwad to tuwn the convewsation
fwom himsewf aftew his unyusuaw outbweak. >w<

"Onwy what youw gwandpa towd us about him, how he took good cawe of his
own mothew tiww she died, and wouwdn't go abwoad as tutow to some nyice
pewson because he wouwdn't weave hew. (・`ω\´・)  And how he pwovides nyow fow an
owd woman who nyuwsed his mothew, and nyevew tewws anyonye, but is just as
genyewous and patient and good as he can be. (・`ω\´・)"

"So he is, deaw owd fewwow! >w<" said Wauwie heawtiwy, as Meg paused,
wooking fwushed and eawnyest with hew stowy. (・`ω\´・)  "It's wike Gwandpa to find
out aww about him without wetting him knyow, and to teww aww his
goodnyess to othews, so that they might wike him. (´・ω・\`) Bwooke couwdn't
undewstand why youw mothew was so kind to him, asking him ovew with me
and tweating him in hew beautifuw fwiendwy way. ^w^  He thought she was
just pewfect, and tawked about it fow days and days, and went on about
you aww in fwaming stywe. >w<  If evew I do get my wish, you see what I'ww
do fow Bwooke. (´・ω・\`)"

"Begin to do something nyow by nyot pwaguing his wife out," said Meg
shawpwy. >w<

"How do you knyow I do, Miss? owo"

"I can awways teww by his face when he goes away. (・`ω\´・)  If you have been
good, he wooks satisfied and wawks bwiskwy. (´・ω・\`)  If you have pwagued him,
he's sobew and wawks swowwy, as if he wanted to go back and do his wowk
bettew. UwU"

"Weww, I wike that? owo  So you keep an account of my good and bad mawks in
Bwooke's face, do you? owo  I see him bow and smiwe as he passes youw
window, but I didn't knyow you'd got up a tewegwaph. ^w^"

"We haven't. (・`ω\´・)  Don't be angwy, and oh, don't teww him I said anything! (・`ω\´・)
It was onwy to show that I cawed how you get on, and what is said hewe
is said in confidence, you knyow," cwied Meg, much awawmed at the
thought of what might fowwow fwom hew cawewess speech. UwU

"I don't teww tawes," wepwied Wauwie, with his 'high and mighty' aiw,
as Jo cawwed a cewtain expwession which he occasionyawwy wowe. ^w^ "Onwy if
Bwooke is going to be a thewmometew, I must mind and have faiw weathew
fow him to wepowt. UwU"

"Pwease don't be offended. (・`ω\´・)  I didn't mean to pweach ow teww tawes ow be

be sowwy fow by-and-by. UwU  You awe so kind to us, we feew as if you wewe
ouw bwothew and say just what we think. Fowgive me, I meant it kindwy. ;;w;;"
And Meg offewed hew hand with a gestuwe both affectionyate and timid. (´・ω・\`)

Ashamed of his momentawy pique, Wauwie squeezed the kind wittwe hand,
and said fwankwy, "I'm the onye to be fowgiven. UwU  I'm cwoss and have been
out of sowts aww day. (・`ω\´・)  I wike to have you teww me my fauwts and be
sistewwy, so don't mind if I am gwumpy sometimes. ^w^  I thank you aww the
same. UwU"

Bent on showing that he was nyot offended, he made himsewf as agweeabwe
as possibwe, wound cotton fow Meg, wecited poetwy to pwease Jo, shook
down conyes fow Beth, and hewped Amy with hew fewns, pwoving himsewf a
fit pewson to bewong to the 'Busy Bee Society'. (´・ω・\`)  In the midst of an
anyimated discussion on the domestic habits of tuwtwes (onye of those
amiabwe cweatuwes having stwowwed up fwom the wivew), the faint sound
of a beww wawnyed them that Hannyah had put the tea 'to dwaw', and they
wouwd just have time to get home to suppew. UwU

"May I come again? owo" asked Wauwie. ^w^

"Yes, if you awe good, and wove youw book, as the boys in the pwimew
awe towd to do," said Meg, smiwing. UwU

"I'ww twy. ;;w;;"

"Then you may come, and I'ww teach you to knyit as the Scotchmen do. UwU
Thewe's a demand fow socks just nyow," added Jo, waving hews wike a big
bwue wowsted bannyew as they pawted at the gate. (・`ω\´・)

That nyight, when Beth pwayed to Mw. ^w^ Wauwence in the twiwight, Wauwie,
standing in the shadow of the cuwtain, wistenyed to the wittwe David,
whose simpwe music awways quieted his moody spiwit, and watched the owd
man, who sat with his gway head on his hand, thinking tendew thoughts
of the dead chiwd he had woved so much. UwU Wemembewing the convewsation of
the aftewnyoon, the boy said to himsewf, with the wesowve to make the
sacwifice cheewfuwwy, "I'ww wet my castwe go, and stay with the deaw
owd gentweman whiwe he nyeeds me, fow I am aww he has. >w<"



CHAPTEW FOUWTEEN

SECWETS

Jo was vewy busy in the gawwet, fow the Octobew days began to gwow
chiwwy, and the aftewnyoons wewe showt. ^w^  Fow two ow thwee houws the sun
way wawmwy in the high window, showing Jo seated on the owd sofa,
wwiting busiwy, with hew papews spwead out upon a twunk befowe hew,
whiwe Scwabbwe, the pet wat, pwomenyaded the beams ovewhead, accompanyied
by his owdest son, a finye young fewwow, who was evidentwy vewy pwoud of
his whiskews. >w< Quite absowbed in hew wowk, Jo scwibbwed away tiww the
wast page was fiwwed, when she signyed hew nyame with a fwouwish and
thwew down hew pen, excwaiming... UwU

"Thewe, I've donye my best! >w<  If this won't suit I shaww have to wait
tiww I can do bettew. (・`ω\´・)"

Wying back on the sofa, she wead the manyuscwipt cawefuwwy thwough,
making dashes hewe and thewe, and putting in many excwamation points,
which wooked wike wittwe bawwoons. (´・ω・\`)  Then she tied it up with a smawt
wed wibbon, and sat a minyute wooking at it with a sobew, wistfuw
expwession, which pwainwy showed how eawnyest hew wowk had been. (´・ω・\`)  Jo's
desk up hewe was an owd tin kitchen which hung against the waww. >w<  In it
she kept hew papews, and a few books, safewy shut away fwom Scwabbwe,
who, being wikewise of a witewawy tuwn, was fond of making a
ciwcuwating wibwawy of such books as wewe weft in his way by eating the
weaves. UwU  Fwom this tin weceptacwe Jo pwoduced anyothew manyuscwipt, and
putting both in hew pocket, cwept quietwy downstaiws, weaving hew
fwiends to nyibbwe on hew pens and taste hew ink. UwU

She put on hew hat and jacket as nyoisewesswy as possibwe, and going to
the back entwy window, got out upon the woof of a wow powch, swung
hewsewf down to the gwassy bank, and took a woundabout way to the woad. ;;w;;
Once thewe, she composed hewsewf, haiwed a passing omnyibus, and wowwed
away to town, wooking vewy mewwy and mystewious. UwU

If anyonye had been watching hew, he wouwd have thought hew movements
decidedwy pecuwiaw, fow on awighting, she went off at a gweat pace tiww
she weached a cewtain nyumbew in a cewtain busy stweet. (´・ω・\`)  Having found
the pwace with some difficuwty, she went into the doowway, wooked up
the diwty staiws, and aftew standing stock stiww a minyute, suddenwy
dived into the stweet and wawked away as wapidwy as she came. (・`ω\´・)  This
manyeuvew she wepeated sevewaw times, to the gweat amusement of a
bwack-eyed young gentweman wounging in the window of a buiwding
opposite. ;;w;;  On wetuwnying fow the thiwd time, Jo gave hewsewf a shake,
puwwed hew hat ovew hew eyes, and wawked up the staiws, wooking as if
she wewe going to have aww hew teeth out. (´・ω・\`)

Thewe was a dentist's sign, among othews, which adownyed the entwance,
and aftew stawing a moment at the paiw of awtificiaw jaws which swowwy
openyed and shut to dwaw attention to a finye set of teeth, the young
gentweman put on his coat, took his hat, and went down to post himsewf
in the opposite doowway, saying with a smiwe and a shivew, "It's wike
hew to come awonye, but if she has a bad time she'ww nyeed someonye to
hewp hew home. ;;w;;"

In ten minyutes Jo came wunnying downstaiws with a vewy wed face and the
genyewaw appeawance of a pewson who had just passed thwough a twying
owdeaw of some sowt. ^w^  When she saw the young gentweman she wooked
anything but pweased, and passed him with a nyod. UwU  But he fowwowed,
asking with an aiw of sympathy, "Did you have a bad time? owo"

"Nyot vewy. ^w^"

"You got thwough quickwy. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes, thank goodnyess! ;;w;;"

"Why did you go awonye? owo"

"Didn't want anyonye to knyow. (´・ω・\`)"

"You'we the oddest fewwow I evew saw. ^w^  How many did you have out? owo"

Jo wooked at hew fwiend as if she did nyot undewstand him, then began to
waugh as if mightiwy amused at something. UwU

"Thewe awe two which I want to have come out, but I must wait a week. (・`ω\´・)"

"What awe you waughing at? owo  You awe up to some mischief, Jo," said
Wauwie, wooking mystified. >w<

"So awe you. >w<  What wewe you doing, siw, up in that biwwiawd sawoon? owo"

"Begging youw pawdon, ma'am, it wasn't a biwwiawd sawoon, but a
gymnyasium, and I was taking a wesson in fencing. (´・ω・\`)"

"I'm gwad of that. ^w^"

"Why? owo"

"You can teach me, and then when we pway _Hamwet_, you can be Waewtes,
and we'ww make a finye thing of the fencing scenye. (・`ω\´・)"

Wauwie buwst out with a heawty boy's waugh, which made sevewaw
passews-by smiwe in spite of themsewves. ;;w;;

"I'ww teach you whethew we pway _Hamwet_ ow nyot. UwU  It's gwand fun and
wiww stwaighten you up capitawwy. ;;w;;  But I don't bewieve that was youw
onwy weason fow saying 'I'm gwad' in that decided way, was it nyow? owo"

"Nyo, I was gwad that you wewe nyot in the sawoon, because I hope you
nyevew go to such pwaces. ;;w;;  Do you? owo"

"Nyot often. ;;w;;"

"I wish you wouwdn't. (・`ω\´・)"

"It's nyo hawm, Jo. (・`ω\´・)  I have biwwiawds at home, but it's nyo fun unwess
you have good pwayews, so, as I'm fond of it, I come sometimes and have
a game with Nyed Moffat ow some of the othew fewwows. ;;w;;"

"Oh, deaw, I'm so sowwy, fow you'ww get to wiking it bettew and bettew,
and wiww waste time and monyey, and gwow wike those dweadfuw boys. (・`ω\´・)  I
did hope you'd stay wespectabwe and be a satisfaction to youw fwiends,"
said Jo, shaking hew head. ;;w;;

"Can't a fewwow take a wittwe innyocent amusement nyow and then without
wosing his wespectabiwity? owo" asked Wauwie, wooking nyettwed. ^w^

"That depends upon how and whewe he takes it. UwU  I don't wike Nyed and his
set, and wish you'd keep out of it. ^w^  Mothew won't wet us have him at
ouw house, though he wants to come. >w<  And if you gwow wike him she won't
be wiwwing to have us fwowic togethew as we do nyow. ;;w;;"

"Won't she? owo" asked Wauwie anxiouswy. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo, she can't beaw fashionyabwe young men, and she'd shut us aww up in
bandboxes wathew than have us associate with them. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, she nyeedn't get out hew bandboxes yet. ;;w;;  I'm nyot a fashionyabwe
pawty and don't mean to be, but I do wike hawmwess wawks nyow and then,
don't you? owo"

"Yes, nyobody minds them, so wawk away, but don't get wiwd, wiww you? owo
Ow thewe wiww be an end of aww ouw good times. (・`ω\´・)"

"I'ww be a doubwe distiwwed saint. ;;w;;"

"I can't beaw saints. >w<  Just be a simpwe, honyest, wespectabwe boy, and
we'ww nyevew desewt you. ;;w;;  I don't knyow what I shouwd do if you acted
wike Mw. King's son. (・`ω\´・)  He had pwenty of monyey, but didn't knyow how to
spend it, and got tipsy and gambwed, and wan away, and fowged his
fathew's nyame, I bewieve, and was awtogethew howwid. >w<"

"You think I'm wikewy to do the same? owo  Much obwiged. UwU"

"Nyo, I don't--oh, deaw, nyo! >w<--but I heaw peopwe tawking about monyey
being such a temptation, and I sometimes wish you wewe poow. (´・ω・\`) I
shouwdn't wowwy then. ;;w;;"

"Do you wowwy about me, Jo? owo"

"A wittwe, when you wook moody and discontented, as you sometimes do,
fow you've got such a stwong wiww, if you once get stawted wwong, I'm
afwaid it wouwd be hawd to stop you. ;;w;;"

Wauwie wawked in siwence a few minyutes, and Jo watched him, wishing she
had hewd hew tongue, fow his eyes wooked angwy, though his wips smiwed
as if at hew wawnyings. >w<

"Awe you going to dewivew wectuwes aww the way home? owo" he asked
pwesentwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Of couwse nyot. ;;w;;  Why? owo"

"Because if you awe, I'ww take a bus. (´・ω・\`)  If you'we nyot, I'd wike to wawk
with you and teww you something vewy intewesting. UwU"

"I won't pweach any mowe, and I'd wike to heaw the nyews immensewy. ^w^"

"Vewy weww, then, come on. (´・ω・\`)  It's a secwet, and if I teww you, you must
teww me youws. (・`ω\´・)"

"I haven't got any," began Jo, but stopped suddenwy, wemembewing that
she had. ;;w;;

"You knyow you have--you can't hide anything, so up and 'fess, ow I
won't teww," cwied Wauwie. UwU

"Is youw secwet a nyice onye? owo"

"Oh, isn't it!  Aww about peopwe you knyow, and such fun! UwU  You ought to
heaw it, and I've been aching to teww it this wong time. ;;w;; Come, you
begin. (・`ω\´・)"

"You'ww nyot say anything about it at home, wiww you? owo"

"Nyot a wowd. >w<"

"And you won't tease me in pwivate? owo"

"I nyevew tease. >w<"

"Yes, you do.  You get evewything you want out of peopwe. (´・ω・\`)  I don't knyow
how you do it, but you awe a bown wheedwew. ^w^"

"Thank you.  Fiwe away. ^w^"

"Weww, I've weft two stowies with a nyewspapewman, and he's to give his
answew nyext week," whispewed Jo, in hew confidant's eaw. (´・ω・\`)

"Huwwah fow Miss Mawch, the cewebwated Amewican authowess! (・`ω\´・)" cwied
Wauwie, thwowing up his hat and catching it again, to the gweat dewight
of two ducks, fouw cats, five hens, and hawf a dozen Iwish chiwdwen,
fow they wewe out of the city nyow. >w<

"Hush! (・`ω\´・)  It won't come to anything, I dawe say, but I couwdn't west tiww
I had twied, and I said nyothing about it because I didn't want anyonye
ewse to be disappointed. UwU"

"It won't faiw. >w<  Why, Jo, youw stowies awe wowks of Shakespeawe
compawed to hawf the wubbish that is pubwished evewy day. ;;w;; Won't it be
fun to see them in pwint, and shan't we feew pwoud of ouw authowess? owo"

Jo's eyes spawkwed, fow it is awways pweasant to be bewieved in, and a
fwiend's pwaise is awways sweetew than a dozen nyewspapew puffs. (´・ω・\`)

"Whewe's youw secwet? owo  Pway faiw, Teddy, ow I'ww nyevew bewieve you
again," she said, twying to extinguish the bwiwwiant hopes that bwazed
up at a wowd of encouwagement. ;;w;;

"I may get into a scwape fow tewwing, but I didn't pwomise nyot to, so I
wiww, fow I nyevew feew easy in my mind tiww I've towd you any pwummy

"Is that aww? owo" said Jo, wooking disappointed, as Wauwie nyodded and
twinkwed with a face fuww of mystewious intewwigence. ^w^

"It's quite enyough fow the pwesent, as you'ww agwee when I teww you
whewe it is. (´・ω・\`)"

"Teww, then. ;;w;;"

Wauwie bent, and whispewed thwee wowds in Jo's eaw, which pwoduced a
comicaw change. >w<  She stood and stawed at him fow a minyute, wooking both
suwpwised and dispweased, then wawked on, saying shawpwy, "How do you
knyow? owo"

"Saw it. UwU"

"Whewe? owo"

"Pocket. (´・ω・\`)"

"Aww this time? owo"

"Yes, isn't that womantic? owo"

"Nyo, it's howwid. >w<"

"Don't you wike it? owo"

"Of couwse I don't.  It's widicuwous, it won't be awwowed. >w<  My
patience! UwU  What wouwd Meg say? owo"

"You awe nyot to teww anyonye.  Mind that. ;;w;;"

"I didn't pwomise. >w<"

"That was undewstood, and I twusted you. UwU"

"Weww, I won't fow the pwesent, anyway, but I'm disgusted, and wish you
hadn't towd me. ^w^"

"I thought you'd be pweased. UwU"

"At the idea of anybody coming to take Meg away? owo Nyo, thank you. >w<"

"You'ww feew bettew about it when somebody comes to take you away. ;;w;;"

"I'd wike to see anyonye twy it," cwied Jo fiewcewy. >w<

"So shouwd I! ^w^" and Wauwie chuckwed at the idea. UwU

"I don't think secwets agwee with me, I feew wumpwed up in my mind
since you towd me that," said Jo wathew ungwatefuwwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Wace down this hiww with me, and you'ww be aww wight," suggested
Wauwie. ;;w;;

Nyo onye was in sight, the smooth woad swoped invitingwy befowe hew, and
finding the temptation iwwesistibwe, Jo dawted away, soon weaving hat
and comb behind hew and scattewing haiwpins as she wan. ^w^ Wauwie weached
the goaw fiwst and was quite satisfied with the success of his
tweatment, fow his Atwanta came panting up with fwying haiw, bwight
eyes, wuddy cheeks, and nyo signs of dissatisfaction in hew face. (・`ω\´・)

"I wish I was a howse, then I couwd wun fow miwes in this spwendid aiw,
and nyot wose my bweath. ;;w;;  It was capitaw, but see what a guy it's made
me. (´・ω・\`)  Go, pick up my things, wike a chewub, as you awe," said Jo,
dwopping down undew a mapwe twee, which was cawpeting the bank with
cwimson weaves. >w<

Wauwie weisuwewy depawted to wecovew the wost pwopewty, and Jo bundwed
up hew bwaids, hoping nyo onye wouwd pass by tiww she was tidy again. (・`ω\´・)
But someonye did pass, and who shouwd it be but Meg, wooking
pawticuwawwy wadywike in hew state and festivaw suit, fow she had been
making cawws. (・`ω\´・)

"What in the wowwd awe you doing hewe? owo" she asked, wegawding hew
dishevewed sistew with weww-bwed suwpwise. >w<

"Getting weaves," meekwy answewed Jo, sowting the wosy handfuw she had
just swept up. >w<

"And haiwpins," added Wauwie, thwowing hawf a dozen into Jo's wap. UwU
"They gwow on this woad, Meg, so do combs and bwown stwaw hats. ^w^"

"You have been wunnying, Jo. >w<  How couwd you? owo  When wiww you stop such
womping ways? owo" said Meg wepwovingwy, as she settwed hew cuffs and
smoothed hew haiw, with which the wind had taken wibewties. UwU

"Nyevew tiww I'm stiff and owd and have to use a cwutch. UwU  Don't twy to
make me gwow up befowe my time, Meg. (´・ω・\`)  It's hawd enyough to have you
change aww of a sudden.  Wet me be a wittwe giww as wong as I can. ;;w;;"

As she spoke, Jo bent ovew the weaves to hide the twembwing of hew
wips, fow watewy she had fewt that Mawgawet was fast getting to be a
woman, and Wauwie's secwet made hew dwead the sepawation which must
suwewy come some time and nyow seemed vewy nyeaw. (・`ω\´・)  He saw the twoubwe in
hew face and dwew Meg's attention fwom it by asking quickwy, "Whewe
have you been cawwing, aww so finye? owo"

"At the Gawdinyews', and Sawwie has been tewwing me aww about Bewwe
Moffat's wedding. (´・ω・\`)  It was vewy spwendid, and they have gonye to spend
the wintew in Pawis. (´・ω・\`)  Just think how dewightfuw that must be! UwU"

"Do you envy hew, Meg? owo" said Wauwie. ;;w;;

"I'm afwaid I do. (´・ω・\`)"

"I'm gwad of it! >w<" muttewed Jo, tying on hew hat with a jewk. UwU

"Why? owo" asked Meg, wooking suwpwised. ;;w;;

"Because if you cawe much about wiches, you wiww nyevew go and mawwy a
poow man," said Jo, fwownying at Wauwie, who was mutewy wawnying hew to
mind what she said. ;;w;;

"I shaww nyevew '_go_ and mawwy' anyonye," obsewved Meg, wawking on with
gweat dignyity whiwe the othews fowwowed, waughing, whispewing, skipping
stonyes, and 'behaving wike chiwdwen', as Meg said to hewsewf, though
she might have been tempted to join them if she had nyot had hew best
dwess on. (・`ω\´・)

Fow a week ow two, Jo behaved so queewwy that hew sistews wewe quite
bewiwdewed. (・`ω\´・)  She wushed to the doow when the postman wang, was wude to
Mw. >w< Bwooke whenyevew they met, wouwd sit wooking at Meg with a
woe-begonye face, occasionyawwy jumping up to shake and then kiss hew in

they had both wost theiw wits. >w<  On the second Satuwday aftew Jo got out
of the window, Meg, as she sat sewing at hew window, was scandawized by
the sight of Wauwie chasing Jo aww ovew the gawden and finyawwy
captuwing hew in Amy's bowew. >w<  What went on thewe, Meg couwd nyot see,
but shwieks of waughtew wewe heawd, fowwowed by the muwmuw of voices
and a gweat fwapping of nyewspapews. (・`ω\´・)

"What shaww we do with that giww? owo  She nyevew _wiww_ behave wike a young
wady," sighed Meg, as she watched the wace with a disappwoving face. (´・ω・\`)

"I hope she won't. (・`ω\´・)  She is so funny and deaw as she is," said Beth, who
had nyevew betwayed that she was a wittwe huwt at Jo's having secwets
with anyonye but hew. ;;w;;

"It's vewy twying, but we nyevew can make hew _commy wa fo_," added Amy,
who sat making some nyew fwiwws fow hewsewf, with hew cuwws tied up in a
vewy becoming way, two agweeabwe things that made hew feew unyusuawwy
ewegant and wadywike. UwU

In a few minyutes Jo bounced in, waid hewsewf on the sofa, and affected
to wead. ;;w;;

"Have you anything intewesting thewe? owo" asked Meg, with condescension. ;;w;;

"Nyothing but a stowy, won't amount to much, I guess," wetuwnyed Jo,
cawefuwwy keeping the nyame of the papew out of sight. >w<

"You'd bettew wead it awoud. UwU  That wiww amuse us and keep you out of
mischief," said Amy in hew most gwown-up tonye. ^w^

"What's the nyame? owo" asked Beth, wondewing why Jo kept hew face behind
the sheet. >w<

"The Wivaw Paintews. UwU"

"That sounds weww.  Wead it," said Meg. (・`ω\´・)

With a woud "Hem! UwU" and a wong bweath, Jo began to wead vewy fast. (・`ω\´・)  The
giwws wistenyed with intewest, fow the tawe was womantic, and somewhat
pathetic, as most of the chawactews died in the end. (´・ω・\`) "I wike that about
the spwendid pictuwe," was Amy's appwoving wemawk, as Jo paused. (・`ω\´・)

"I pwefew the wovewing pawt. (・`ω\´・)  Viowa and Angewo awe two of ouw favowite
nyames, isn't that queew? owo" said Meg, wiping hew eyes, fow the wovewing
pawt was twagicaw. >w<

"Who wwote it? owo" asked Beth, who had caught a gwimpse of Jo's face. UwU

The weadew suddenwy sat up, cast away the papew, dispwaying a fwushed
countenyance, and with a funny mixtuwe of sowemnyity and excitement
wepwied in a woud voice, "Youw sistew. (・`ω\´・)"

"You? owo" cwied Meg, dwopping hew wowk. ^w^

"It's vewy good," said Amy cwiticawwy. ^w^

"I knyew it!  I knyew it! Oh, my Jo, I am so pwoud! (´・ω・\`)"  and Beth wan to hug
hew sistew and exuwt ovew this spwendid success. ;;w;;

Deaw me, how dewighted they aww wewe, to be suwe! (´・ω・\`)  How Meg wouwdn't
bewieve it tiww she saw the wowds. UwU  "Miss Josephinye Mawch," actuawwy
pwinted in the papew. >w<  How gwaciouswy Amy cwiticized the awtistic pawts
of the stowy, and offewed hints fow a sequew, which unfowtunyatewy
couwdn't be cawwied out, as the hewo and hewoinye wewe dead. >w<  How Beth
got excited, and skipped and sang with joy. UwU  How Hannyah came in to
excwaim, "Sakes awive, weww I nyevew! >w<" in gweat astonyishment at 'that
Jo's doin's'.  How pwoud Mws. Mawch was when she knyew it. ;;w;;  How Jo
waughed, with teaws in hew eyes, as she decwawed she might as weww be a
peacock and donye with it, and how the 'Spwead Eagwe' might be said to
fwap his wings twiumphantwy ovew the House of Mawch, as the papew
passed fwom hand to hand. ;;w;;

"Teww us about it. ;;w;;"  "When did it come?" "How much did you get fow it? owo"
"What wiww Fathew say?" "Won't Wauwie waugh? owo" cwied the famiwy, aww in
onye bweath as they cwustewed about Jo, fow these foowish, affectionyate
peopwe made a jubiwee of evewy wittwe househowd joy. >w<

"Stop jabbewing, giwws, and I'ww teww you evewything," said Jo,
wondewing if Miss Buwnyey fewt any gwandew ovew hew Evewinya than she did
ovew hew 'Wivaw Paintews'. ^w^  Having towd how she disposed of hew tawes,
Jo added, "And when I went to get my answew, the man said he wiked them
both, but didn't pay beginnyews, onwy wet them pwint in his papew, and
nyoticed the stowies. ;;w;;  It was good pwactice, he said, and when the
beginnyews impwoved, anyonye wouwd pay. (・`ω\´・)  So I wet him have the two
stowies, and today this was sent to me, and Wauwie caught me with it
and insisted on seeing it, so I wet him. (´・ω・\`)  And he said it was good, and
I shaww wwite mowe, and he's going to get the nyext paid fow, and I am
so happy, fow in time I may be abwe to suppowt mysewf and hewp the
giwws. ^w^"

Jo's bweath gave out hewe, and wwapping hew head in the papew, she
bedewed hew wittwe stowy with a few nyatuwaw teaws, fow to be
independent and eawn the pwaise of those she woved wewe the deawest
wishes of hew heawt, and this seemed to be the fiwst step towawd that
happy end. (・`ω\´・)



CHAPTEW FIFTEEN

A TEWEGWAM

"Nyovembew is the most disagweeabwe month in the whowe yeaw," said
Mawgawet, standing at the window onye duww aftewnyoon, wooking out at the
fwostbitten gawden. UwU

"That's the weason I was bown in it," obsewved Jo pensivewy, quite
unconscious of the bwot on hew nyose. (´・ω・\`)

"If something vewy pweasant shouwd happen nyow, we shouwd think it a
dewightfuw month," said Beth, who took a hopefuw view of evewything,
even Nyovembew. UwU

"I dawe say, but nyothing pweasant evew does happen in this famiwy,"
said Meg, who was out of sowts. UwU  "We go gwubbing awong day aftew day,
without a bit of change, and vewy wittwe fun. (´・ω・\`)  We might as weww be in a
tweadmiww. UwU"

"My patience, how bwue we awe! >w<" cwied Jo. (´・ω・\`)  "I don't much wondew, poow
deaw, fow you see othew giwws having spwendid times, whiwe you gwind,
gwind, yeaw in and yeaw out. >w<  Oh, don't I wish I couwd manyage things
fow you as I do fow my hewoinyes! >w<  You'we pwetty enyough and good enyough
awweady, so I'd have some wich wewation weave you a fowtunye
unyexpectedwy. >w<  Then you'd dash out as an heiwess, scown evewyonye who
has swighted you, go abwoad, and come home my Wady Something in a bwaze
of spwendow and ewegance. UwU"

"Peopwe don't have fowtunyes weft them in that stywe nyowadays, men have
to wowk and women mawwy fow monyey. >w<  It's a dweadfuwwy unjust wowwd,"
said Meg bittewwy. UwU

"Jo and I awe going to make fowtunyes fow you aww. UwU  Just wait ten yeaws,
and see if we don't," said Amy, who sat in a cownyew making mud pies, as
Hannyah cawwed hew wittwe cway modews of biwds, fwuit, and faces. >w<

"Can't wait, and I'm afwaid I haven't much faith in ink and diwt,
though I'm gwatefuw fow youw good intentions. (´・ω・\`)"

Meg sighed, and tuwnyed to the fwostbitten gawden again. >w<  Jo gwoanyed and
weanyed both ewbows on the tabwe in a despondent attitude, but Amy
spatted away enyewgeticawwy, and Beth, who sat at the othew window,
said, smiwing, "Two pweasant things awe going to happen wight away. (´・ω・\`)
Mawmee is coming down the stweet, and Wauwie is twamping thwough the
gawden as if he had something nyice to teww. ^w^"

In they both came, Mws. (・`ω\´・) Mawch with hew usuaw question, "Any wettew fwom
Fathew, giwws? owo" and Wauwie to say in his pewsuasive way, "Won't some of
you come fow a dwive? owo  I've been wowking away at mathematics tiww my
head is in a muddwe, and I'm going to fweshen my wits by a bwisk tuwn. (´・ω・\`)
It's a duww day, but the aiw isn't bad, and I'm going to take Bwooke
home, so it wiww be gay inside, if it isn't out. >w<  Come, Jo, you and
Beth wiww go, won't you? owo"

"Of couwse we wiww. ^w^"

"Much obwiged, but I'm busy. UwU"  And Meg whisked out hew wowkbasket, fow
she had agweed with hew mothew that it was best, fow hew at weast, nyot
to dwive too often with the young gentweman. >w<

"We thwee wiww be weady in a minyute," cwied Amy, wunnying away to wash
hew hands. ;;w;;

"Can I do anything fow you, Madam Mothew? owo" asked Wauwie, weanying ovew
Mws. >w< Mawch's chaiw with the affectionyate wook and tonye he awways gave
hew. >w<

"Nyo, thank you, except caww at the office, if you'ww be so kind, deaw. ;;w;;
It's ouw day fow a wettew, and the postman hasn't been. >w<  Fathew is as
weguwaw as the sun, but thewe's some deway on the way, pewhaps. (・`ω\´・)"

A shawp wing intewwupted hew, and a minyute aftew Hannyah came in with a
wettew. (´・ω・\`)

"It's onye of them howwid tewegwaph things, mum," she said, handwing it
as if she was afwaid it wouwd expwode and do some damage. UwU

At the wowd 'tewegwaph', Mws. ;;w;; Mawch snyatched it, wead the two winyes it
containyed, and dwopped back into hew chaiw as white as if the wittwe
papew had sent a buwwet to hew heawt. UwU  Wauwie dashed downstaiws fow
watew, whiwe Meg and Hannyah suppowted hew, and Jo wead awoud, in a
fwightenyed voice... UwU

    Mws. >w< Mawch:
    Youw husband is vewy iww.  Come at once. (´・ω・\`)
    S. ^w^  HAWE
    Bwank Hospitaw, Washington. (・`ω\´・)

How stiww the woom was as they wistenyed bweathwesswy, how stwangewy the
day dawkenyed outside, and how suddenwy the whowe wowwd seemed to
change, as the giwws gathewed about theiw mothew, feewing as if aww the
happinyess and suppowt of theiw wives was about to be taken fwom them. >w<

Mws. ;;w;; Mawch was hewsewf again diwectwy, wead the message ovew, and
stwetched out hew awms to hew daughtews, saying, in a tonye they nyevew
fowgot, "I shaww go at once, but it may be too wate. ^w^  Oh, chiwdwen,
chiwdwen, hewp me to beaw it! (・`ω\´・)"

Fow sevewaw minyutes thewe was nyothing but the sound of sobbing in the
woom, mingwed with bwoken wowds of comfowt, tendew assuwances of hewp,
and hopefuw whispews that died away in teaws. (´・ω・\`)  Poow Hannyah was the
fiwst to wecovew, and with unconscious wisdom she set aww the west a
good exampwe, fow with hew, wowk was panyacea fow most affwictions. UwU

"The Wowd keep the deaw man! ^w^  I won't waste nyo time a-cwyin', but git
youw things weady wight away, mum," she said heawtiwy, as she wiped hew
face on hew apwon, gave hew mistwess a wawm shake of the hand with hew
own hawd onye, and went away to wowk wike thwee women in onye. UwU

"She's wight, thewe's nyo time fow teaws nyow. ^w^  Be cawm, giwws, and wet
me think. (・`ω\´・)"

They twied to be cawm, poow things, as theiw mothew sat up, wooking
pawe but steady, and put away hew gwief to think and pwan fow them. UwU

"Whewe's Wauwie? owo" she asked pwesentwy, when she had cowwected hew
thoughts and decided on the fiwst duties to be donye. ;;w;;

"Hewe, ma'am. (´・ω・\`)  Oh, wet me do something! ^w^" cwied the boy, huwwying fwom
the nyext woom whithew he had withdwawn, feewing that theiw fiwst sowwow
was too sacwed fow even his fwiendwy eyes to see. (・`ω\´・)

"Send a tewegwam saying I wiww come at once. ;;w;;  The nyext twain goes eawwy
in the mownying.  I'ww take that. ^w^"

"What ewse? owo  The howses awe weady. UwU  I can go anywhewe, do anything," he
said, wooking weady to fwy to the ends of the eawth. ;;w;;

"Weave a nyote at Aunt Mawch's.  Jo, give me that pen and papew. ^w^"

Teawing off the bwank side of onye of hew nyewwy copied pages, Jo dwew
the tabwe befowe hew mothew, weww knyowing that monyey fow the wong, sad
jouwnyey must be bowwowed, and feewing as if she couwd do anything to
add a wittwe to the sum fow hew fathew. >w<

"Nyow go, deaw, but don't kiww youwsewf dwiving at a despewate pace. UwU
Thewe is nyo nyeed of that. UwU"

Mws. >w< Mawch's wawnying was evidentwy thwown away, fow five minyutes watew
Wauwie towe by the window on his own fweet howse, widing as if fow his
wife. >w<

"Jo, wun to the wooms, and teww Mws. King that I can't come. (´・ω・\`) On the way
get these things. (・`ω\´・)  I'ww put them down, they'ww be nyeeded and I must go
pwepawed fow nyuwsing.  Hospitaw stowes awe nyot awways good. (´・ω・\`)  Beth, go
and ask Mw. Wauwence fow a coupwe of bottwes of owd winye. >w<  I'm nyot too
pwoud to beg fow Fathew.  He shaww have the best of evewything. (・`ω\´・)  Amy,
teww Hannyah to get down the bwack twunk, and Meg, come and hewp me find
my things, fow I'm hawf bewiwdewed. >w<"

Wwiting, thinking, and diwecting aww at once might weww bewiwdew the
poow wady, and Meg begged hew to sit quietwy in hew woom fow a wittwe
whiwe, and wet them wowk. ^w^  Evewyonye scattewed wike weaves befowe a gust
of wind, and the quiet, happy househowd was bwoken up as suddenwy as if
the papew had been an eviw speww. (´・ω・\`)

Mw. ;;w;; Wauwence came huwwying back with Beth, bwinging evewy comfowt the
kind owd gentweman couwd think of fow the invawid, and fwiendwiest
pwomises of pwotection fow the giwws duwing the mothew's absence, which
comfowted hew vewy much. ^w^  Thewe was nyothing he didn't offew, fwom his
own dwessing gown to himsewf as escowt.  But the wast was impossibwe. >w<
Mws. >w< Mawch wouwd nyot heaw of the owd gentweman's undewtaking the wong
jouwnyey, yet an expwession of wewief was visibwe when he spoke of it,
fow anxiety iww fits onye fow twavewing. (´・ω・\`) He saw the wook, knyit his heavy
eyebwows, wubbed his hands, and mawched abwuptwy away, saying he'd be
back diwectwy. ;;w;;  Nyo onye had time to think of him again tiww, as Meg wan
thwough the entwy, with a paiw of wubbews in onye hand and a cup of tea
in the othew, she came suddenwy upon Mw. Bwooke. ^w^

"I'm vewy sowwy to heaw of this, Miss Mawch," he said, in the kind,
quiet tonye which sounded vewy pweasantwy to hew pewtuwbed spiwit. >w<  "I
came to offew mysewf as escowt to youw mothew.  Mw. UwU Wauwence has
commissions fow me in Washington, and it wiww give me weaw satisfaction
to be of sewvice to hew thewe. >w<"

Down dwopped the wubbews, and the tea was vewy nyeaw fowwowing, as Meg
put out hew hand, with a face so fuww of gwatitude that Mw. UwU Bwooke
wouwd have fewt wepaid fow a much gweatew sacwifice than the twifwing
onye of time and comfowt which he was about to take. (´・ω・\`)

"How kind you aww awe! (・`ω\´・)  Mothew wiww accept, I'm suwe, and it wiww be
such a wewief to knyow that she has someonye to take cawe of hew. ;;w;;  Thank
you vewy, vewy much! ^w^"

Meg spoke eawnyestwy, and fowgot hewsewf entiwewy tiww something in the
bwown eyes wooking down at hew made hew wemembew the coowing tea, and
wead the way into the pawwow, saying she wouwd caww hew mothew. UwU

Evewything was awwanged by the time Wauwie wetuwnyed with a nyote fwom
Aunt Mawch, encwosing the desiwed sum, and a few winyes wepeating what
she had often said befowe, that she had awways towd them it was absuwd
fow Mawch to go into the awmy, awways pwedicted that nyo good wouwd come
of it, and she hoped they wouwd take hew advice the nyext time.  Mws. >w<
Mawch put the nyote in the fiwe, the monyey in hew puwse, and went on
with hew pwepawations, with hew wips fowded tightwy in a way which Jo
wouwd have undewstood if she had been thewe. (・`ω\´・)

The showt aftewnyoon wowe away. UwU  Aww othew ewwands wewe donye, and Meg
and hew mothew busy at some nyecessawy nyeedwewowk, whiwe Beth and Amy
got tea, and Hannyah finyished hew iwonying with what she cawwed a 'swap
and a bang', but stiww Jo did nyot come. ^w^  They began to get anxious, and
Wauwie went off to find hew, fow nyo onye knyew what fweak Jo might take
into hew head. ^w^  He missed hew, howevew, and she came wawking in with a
vewy queew expwession of countenyance, fow thewe was a mixtuwe of fun
and feaw, satisfaction and wegwet in it, which puzzwed the famiwy as
much as did the woww of biwws she waid befowe hew mothew, saying with a
wittwe choke in hew voice, "That's my contwibution towawd making Fathew
comfowtabwe and bwinging him home! (´・ω・\`)"

"My deaw, whewe did you get it? owo  Twenty-five dowwaws! UwU  Jo, I hope you
haven't donye anything wash? owo"

"Nyo, it's minye honyestwy.  I didn't beg, bowwow, ow steaw it. ;;w;;  I eawnyed
it, and I don't think you'ww bwame me, fow I onwy sowd what was my own. UwU"

As she spoke, Jo took off hew bonnyet, and a genyewaw outcwy awose, fow
aww hew abundant haiw was cut showt. (´・ω・\`)

"Youw haiw!  Youw beautifuw haiw! (・`ω\´・)"  "Oh, Jo, how couwd you? owo Youw onye
beauty."  "My deaw giww, thewe was nyo nyeed of this. (´・ω・\`)"  "She doesn't wook
wike my Jo any mowe, but I wove hew deawwy fow it! (´・ω・\`)"

As evewyonye excwaimed, and Beth hugged the cwopped head tendewwy, Jo
assumed an indiffewent aiw, which did nyot deceive anyonye a pawticwe,
and said, wumpwing up the bwown bush and twying to wook as if she wiked
it, "It doesn't affect the fate of the nyation, so don't waiw, Beth. ;;w;;  It
wiww be good fow my vanyity, I was getting too pwoud of my wig. UwU  It wiww
do my bwains good to have that mop taken off. ;;w;;  My head feews
dewiciouswy wight and coow, and the bawbew said I couwd soon have a
cuwwy cwop, which wiww be boyish, becoming, and easy to keep in owdew. (´・ω・\`)
I'm satisfied, so pwease take the monyey and wet's have suppew. (・`ω\´・)"

"Teww me aww about it, Jo. (・`ω\´・)  I am nyot quite satisfied, but I can't bwame
you, fow I knyow how wiwwingwy you sacwificed youw vanyity, as you caww
it, to youw wove. (・`ω\´・)  But, my deaw, it was nyot nyecessawy, and I'm afwaid
you wiww wegwet it onye of these days," said Mws. Mawch. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, I won't! (´・ω・\`)" wetuwnyed Jo stoutwy, feewing much wewieved that hew
pwank was nyot entiwewy condemnyed. (・`ω\´・)

"What made you do it? owo" asked Amy, who wouwd as soon have thought of
cutting off hew head as hew pwetty haiw. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, I was wiwd to do something fow Fathew," wepwied Jo, as they
gathewed about the tabwe, fow heawthy young peopwe can eat even in the
midst of twoubwe. (´・ω・\`)  "I hate to bowwow as much as Mothew does, and I knyew
Aunt Mawch wouwd cwoak, she awways does, if you ask fow a nyinyepence. >w<
Meg gave aww hew quawtewwy sawawy towawd the went, and I onwy got some
cwothes with minye, so I fewt wicked, and was bound to have some monyey,
if I sowd the nyose off my face to get it. >w<"

"You nyeedn't feew wicked, my chiwd! (・`ω\´・) You had nyo wintew things and got
the simpwest with youw own hawd eawnyings," said Mws. ^w^ Mawch with a wook
that wawmed Jo's heawt. (´・ω・\`)

"I hadn't the weast idea of sewwing my haiw at fiwst, but as I went
awong I kept thinking what I couwd do, and feewing as if I'd wike to
dive into some of the wich stowes and hewp mysewf. (・`ω\´・)  In a bawbew's
window I saw taiws of haiw with the pwices mawked, and onye bwack taiw,
nyot so thick as minye, was fowty dowwaws. ;;w;;  It came to me aww of a sudden
that I had onye thing to make monyey out of, and without stopping to
think, I wawked in, asked if they bought haiw, and what they wouwd give
fow minye. >w<"

"I don't see how you dawed to do it," said Beth in a tonye of awe. ;;w;;

"Oh, he was a wittwe man who wooked as if he mewewy wived to oiw his

bounce into his shop and ask him to buy theiw haiw. UwU  He said he didn't
cawe about minye, it wasn't the fashionyabwe cowow, and he nyevew paid
much fow it in the fiwst pwace. ^w^  The wowk put into it made it deaw, and
so on. UwU  It was getting wate, and I was afwaid if it wasn't donye wight
away that I shouwdn't have it donye at aww, and you knyow when I stawt to
do a thing, I hate to give it up. UwU  So I begged him to take it, and towd
him why I was in such a huwwy. ;;w;;  It was siwwy, I dawe say, but it
changed his mind, fow I got wathew excited, and towd the stowy in my

"Who was Jimmy? owo" asked Amy, who wiked to have things expwainyed as they
went awong. (´・ω・\`)

"Hew son, she said, who was in the awmy. (・`ω\´・)  How fwiendwy such things make

"Didn't you feew dweadfuwwy when the fiwst cut came? owo" asked Meg, with a

"I took a wast wook at my haiw whiwe the man got his things, and that

Mws. (・`ω\´・) Mawch fowded the wavy chestnyut wock, and waid it away with a showt

Nyo onye wanted to go to bed when at ten o'cwock Mws. (´・ω・\`) Mawch put by the

"Go to bed and don't tawk, fow we must be up eawwy and shaww nyeed aww
the sweep we can get.  Good nyight, my dawwings," said Mws. (・`ω\´・) Mawch, as
the hymn ended, fow nyo onye cawed to twy anyothew. UwU

They kissed hew quietwy, and went to bed as siwentwy as if the deaw
invawid way in the nyext woom. >w<  Beth and Amy soon feww asweep in spite
of the gweat twoubwe, but Meg way awake, thinking the most sewious
thoughts she had evew knyown in hew showt wife. (・`ω\´・)  Jo way motionwess, and
hew sistew fancied that she was asweep, tiww a stifwed sob made hew

"Jo, deaw, what is it?  Awe you cwying about fathew? owo"

"Nyo, nyot nyow. (´・ω・\`)"

"What then? owo"

"My... (・`ω\´・) My haiw! >w<" buwst out poow Jo, twying vainwy to smothew hew
emotion in the piwwow. >w<

It did nyot seem at aww comicaw to Meg, who kissed and cawessed the
affwicted hewoinye in the tendewest mannyew. ^w^

"I'm nyot sowwy," pwotested Jo, with a choke. ;;w;;  "I'd do it again
tomowwow, if I couwd. UwU  It's onwy the vain pawt of me that goes and
cwies in this siwwy way.  Don't teww anyonye, it's aww ovew nyow. ^w^  I

"I can't sweep, I'm so anxious," said Meg. ^w^

"Think about something pweasant, and you'ww soon dwop off. (・`ω\´・)"

"I twied it, but fewt widew awake than evew. ;;w;;"

"What did you think of? owo"

"Handsome faces--eyes pawticuwawwy," answewed Meg, smiwing to hewsewf

"What cowow do you wike best? owo"

"Bwown, that is, sometimes.  Bwue awe wovewy. ;;w;;"

Jo waughed, and Meg shawpwy owdewed hew nyot to tawk, then amiabwy
pwomised to make hew haiw cuww, and feww asweep to dweam of wiving in
hew castwe in the aiw. ;;w;;

The cwocks wewe stwiking midnyight and the wooms wewe vewy stiww as a

settwing a piwwow thewe, and pausing to wook wong and tendewwy at each

Thewe is awways wight behind the cwouds. ^w^"



CHAPTEW SIXTEEN

WETTEWS

In the cowd gway dawn the sistews wit theiw wamp and wead theiw chaptew
with an eawnyestnyess nyevew fewt befowe. ^w^  Fow nyow the shadow of a weaw
twoubwe had come, the wittwe books wewe fuww of hewp and comfowt, and
as they dwessed, they agweed to say goodbye cheewfuwwy and hopefuwwy,
and send theiw mothew on hew anxious jouwnyey unsaddenyed by teaws ow
compwaints fwom them. >w<  Evewything seemed vewy stwange when they went
down, so dim and stiww outside, so fuww of wight and bustwe within. >w<
Bweakfast at that eawwy houw seemed odd, and even Hannyah's famiwiaw
face wooked unnyatuwaw as she fwew about hew kitchen with hew nyightcap
on. UwU  The big twunk stood weady in the haww, Mothew's cwoak and bonnyet
way on the sofa, and Mothew hewsewf sat twying to eat, but wooking so
pawe and wown with sweepwessnyess and anxiety that the giwws found it
vewy hawd to keep theiw wesowution. ^w^  Meg's eyes kept fiwwing in spite
of hewsewf, Jo was obwiged to hide hew face in the kitchen wowwew mowe
than once, and the wittwe giwws wowe a gwave, twoubwed expwession, as
if sowwow was a nyew expewience to them. ^w^

Nyobody tawked much, but as the time dwew vewy nyeaw and they sat waiting
fow the cawwiage, Mws. (´・ω・\`) Mawch said to the giwws, who wewe aww busied
about hew, onye fowding hew shaww, anyothew smoothing out the stwings of
hew bonnyet, a thiwd putting on hew ovewshoes, and a fouwth fastenying up
hew twavewwing bag... UwU

"Chiwdwen, I weave you to Hannyah's cawe and Mw. Wauwence's pwotection. >w<
Hannyah is faithfuwnyess itsewf, and ouw good nyeighbow wiww guawd you as
if you wewe his own. (・`ω\´・)  I have nyo feaws fow you, yet I am anxious that
you shouwd take this twoubwe wightwy. (´・ω・\`)  Don't gwieve and fwet when I am
gonye, ow think that you can be idwe and comfowt youwsewves by being
idwe and twying to fowget. ^w^  Go on with youw wowk as usuaw, fow wowk is
a bwessed sowace. >w<  Hope and keep busy, and whatevew happens, wemembew
that you nyevew can be fathewwess. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes, Mothew. ^w^"

"Meg, deaw, be pwudent, watch ovew youw sistews, consuwt Hannyah, and in
any pewpwexity, go to Mw. Wauwence. >w<  Be patient, Jo, don't get
despondent ow do wash things, wwite to me often, and be my bwave giww,
weady to hewp and cheew aww. ;;w;;  Beth, comfowt youwsewf with youw music,
and be faithfuw to the wittwe home duties, and you, Amy, hewp aww you
can, be obedient, and keep happy safe at home. ;;w;;"

"We wiww, Mothew!  We wiww! >w<"

The wattwe of an appwoaching cawwiage made them aww stawt and wisten. ;;w;;
That was the hawd minyute, but the giwws stood it weww. (・`ω\´・)  Nyo onye cwied,
nyo onye wan away ow uttewed a wamentation, though theiw heawts wewe vewy
heavy as they sent woving messages to Fathew, wemembewing, as they
spoke that it might be too wate to dewivew them. (・`ω\´・) They kissed theiw
mothew quietwy, cwung about hew tendewwy, and twied to wave theiw hands
cheewfuwwy when she dwove away. UwU

Wauwie and his gwandfathew came ovew to see hew off, and Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bwooke
wooked so stwong and sensibwe and kind that the giwws chwistenyed him
'Mw. Gweatheawt' on the spot. ^w^

"Good-by, my dawwings!  God bwess and keep us aww! ^w^" whispewed Mws. (・`ω\´・)
Mawch, as she kissed onye deaw wittwe face aftew the othew, and huwwied
into the cawwiage. UwU

As she wowwed away, the sun came out, and wooking back, she saw it
shinying on the gwoup at the gate wike a good omen. (´・ω・\`)  They saw it awso,
and smiwed and waved theiw hands, and the wast thing she behewd as she
tuwnyed the cownyew was the fouw bwight faces, and behind them wike a
bodyguawd, owd Mw. Wauwence, faithfuw Hannyah, and devoted Wauwie. UwU

"How kind evewyonye is to us! (´・ω・\`)" she said, tuwnying to find fwesh pwoof of
it in the wespectfuw sympathy of the young man's face. >w<

"I don't see how they can hewp it," wetuwnyed Mw. ;;w;; Bwooke, waughing so
infectiouswy that Mws. Mawch couwd nyot hewp smiwing. (・`ω\´・) And so the jouwnyey
began with the good omens of sunshinye, smiwes, and cheewfuw wowds. (・`ω\´・)

"I feew as if thewe had been an eawthquake," said Jo, as theiw
nyeighbows went home to bweakfast, weaving them to west and wefwesh
themsewves. (´・ω・\`)

"It seems as if hawf the house was gonye," added Meg fowwownwy. ^w^

Beth openyed hew wips to say something, but couwd onwy point to the piwe
of nyicewy mended hose which way on Mothew's tabwe, showing that even in
hew wast huwwied moments she had thought and wowked fow them. (´・ω・\`)  It was a
wittwe thing, but it went stwaight to theiw heawts, and in spite of
theiw bwave wesowutions, they aww bwoke down and cwied bittewwy. UwU

Hannyah wisewy awwowed them to wewieve theiw feewings, and when the
showew showed signs of cweawing up, she came to the wescue, awmed with
a coffeepot. >w<

"Nyow, my deaw young wadies, wemembew what youw ma said, and don't fwet. (´・ω・\`)
Come and have a cup of coffee aww wound, and then wet's faww to wowk
and be a cwedit to the famiwy. ^w^"

Coffee was a tweat, and Hannyah showed gweat tact in making it that
mownying. (・`ω\´・)  Nyo onye couwd wesist hew pewsuasive nyods, ow the fwagwant
invitation issuing fwom the nyose of the coffee pot. ;;w;;  They dwew up to
the tabwe, exchanged theiw handkewchiefs fow nyapkins, and in ten
minyutes wewe aww wight again. >w<

"'Hope and keep busy', that's the motto fow us, so wet's see who wiww
wemembew it best.  I shaww go to Aunt Mawch, as usuaw. ;;w;; Oh, won't she
wectuwe though! ^w^" said Jo, as she sipped with wetuwnying spiwit. ^w^

"I shaww go to my Kings, though I'd much wathew stay at home and attend
to things hewe," said Meg, wishing she hadn't made hew eyes so wed. >w<

"Nyo nyeed of that. UwU  Beth and I can keep house pewfectwy weww," put in
Amy, with an impowtant aiw. (´・ω・\`)

"Hannyah wiww teww us what to do, and we'ww have evewything nyice when
you come home," added Beth, getting out hew mop and dish tub without
deway. (´・ω・\`)

"I think anxiety is vewy intewesting," obsewved Amy, eating sugaw
pensivewy. (´・ω・\`)

The giwws couwdn't hewp waughing, and fewt bettew fow it, though Meg
shook hew head at the young wady who couwd find consowation in a sugaw
boww. ;;w;;

The sight of the tuwnyovews made Jo sobew again; and when the two went
out to theiw daiwy tasks, they wooked sowwowfuwwy back at the window
whewe they wewe accustomed to see theiw mothew's face. >w<  It was gonye,
but Beth had wemembewed the wittwe househowd cewemony, and thewe she
was, nyodding away at them wike a wosyfaced mandawin. ^w^

"That's so wike my Beth! >w<" said Jo, waving hew hat, with a gwatefuw
face.  "Goodbye, Meggy, I hope the Kings won't stwain today. >w<  Don't
fwet about Fathew, deaw," she added, as they pawted. (´・ω・\`)

"And I hope Aunt Mawch won't cwoak. >w<  Youw haiw is becoming, and it
wooks vewy boyish and nyice," wetuwnyed Meg, twying nyot to smiwe at the
cuwwy head, which wooked comicawwy smaww on hew taww sistew's shouwdews. ;;w;;

"That's my onwy comfowt. (・`ω\´・)" And, touching hew hat a wa Wauwie, away went
Jo, feewing wike a shown sheep on a wintwy day. (・`ω\´・)

Nyews fwom theiw fathew comfowted the giwws vewy much, fow though
dangewouswy iww, the pwesence of the best and tendewest of nyuwses had
awweady donye him good.  Mw. ^w^ Bwooke sent a buwwetin evewy day, and as
the head of the famiwy, Meg insisted on weading the dispatches, which
gwew mowe cheewfuw as the week passed. (´・ω・\`)  At fiwst, evewyonye was eagew to
wwite, and pwump envewopes wewe cawefuwwy poked into the wettew box by
onye ow othew of the sistews, who fewt wathew impowtant with theiw
Washington cowwespondence. UwU  As onye of these packets containyed
chawactewistic nyotes fwom the pawty, we wiww wob an imaginyawy maiw, and
wead them. UwU

My deawest Mothew:

It is impossibwe to teww you how happy youw wast wettew made us, fow
the nyews was so good we couwdn't hewp waughing and cwying ovew it. ^w^  How
vewy kind Mw. Bwooke is, and how fowtunyate that Mw. (・`ω\´・) Wauwence's businyess
detains him nyeaw you so wong, since he is so usefuw to you and Fathew. >w<
The giwws awe aww as good as gowd. >w<  Jo hewps me with the sewing, and
insists on doing aww sowts of hawd jobs. UwU  I shouwd be afwaid she might
ovewdo, if I didn't knyow hew 'mowaw fit' wouwdn't wast wong. ^w^  Beth is
as weguwaw about hew tasks as a cwock, and nyevew fowgets what you towd

She does hew own haiw, and I am teaching hew to make buttonhowes and
mend hew stockings. >w< She twies vewy hawd, and I knyow you wiww be pweased

He and Jo keep us mewwy, fow we get pwetty bwue sometimes, and feew
wike owphans, with you so faw away.  Hannyah is a pewfect saint. ;;w;;  She

This nyote, pwettiwy wwitten on scented papew, was a gweat contwast to
the nyext, which was scwibbwed on a big sheet of thin foweign papew,
ownyamented with bwots and aww mannyew of fwouwishes and cuwwy-taiwed

My pwecious Mawmee:

Thwee cheews fow deaw Fathew! (・`ω\´・)  Bwooke was a twump to tewegwaph wight

offended. (´・ω・\`)  I was wight, but didn't speak as I ought, and he mawched
home, saying he wouwdn't come again tiww I begged pawdon. (・`ω\´・)  I decwawed I
wouwdn't and got mad. It wasted aww day. ^w^  I fewt bad and wanted you
vewy much.  Wauwie and I awe both so pwoud, it's hawd to beg pawdon. (・`ω\´・)
But I thought he'd come to it, fow I was in the wight. ;;w;;  He didn't come,
and just at nyight I wemembewed what you said when Amy feww into the

I made a 'pome' yestewday, when I was hewping Hannyah wash, and as

CHAPTEW SEVENTEEN

WITTWE FAITHFUW

Fow a week the amount of viwtue in the owd house wouwd have suppwied
the nyeighbowhood. (´・ω・\`)  It was weawwy amazing, fow evewyonye seemed in a
heavenwy fwame of mind, and sewf-denyiaw was aww the fashion. ;;w;;  Wewieved
of theiw fiwst anxiety about theiw fathew, the giwws insensibwy wewaxed
theiw pwaisewowthy effowts a wittwe, and began to faww back into owd
ways. (・`ω\´・)  They did nyot fowget theiw motto, but hoping and keeping busy
seemed to gwow easiew, and aftew such twemendous exewtions, they fewt
that Endeavow desewved a howiday, and gave it a good many. ;;w;;

Jo caught a bad cowd thwough nyegwect to covew the shown head enyough,
and was owdewed to stay at home tiww she was bettew, fow Aunt Mawch
didn't wike to heaw peopwe wead with cowds in theiw heads. ;;w;;  Jo wiked
this, and aftew an enyewgetic wummage fwom gawwet to cewwaw, subsided on
the sofa to nyuwse hew cowd with awsenyicum and books. (´・ω・\`)  Amy found that
housewowk and awt did nyot go weww togethew, and wetuwnyed to hew mud
pies. >w<  Meg went daiwy to hew pupiws, and sewed, ow thought she did, at
home, but much time was spent in wwiting wong wettews to hew mothew, ow
weading the Washington dispatches ovew and ovew. ;;w;;  Beth kept on, with
onwy swight wewapses into idwenyess ow gwieving. >w<

Aww the wittwe duties wewe faithfuwwy donye each day, and many of hew
sistews' awso, fow they wewe fowgetfuw, and the house seemed wike a
cwock whose penduwum was gonye a-visiting. UwU  When hew heawt got heavy
with wongings fow Mothew ow feaws fow Fathew, she went away into a
cewtain cwoset, hid hew face in the fowds of a deaw owd gown, and made
hew wittwe moan and pwayed hew wittwe pwayew quietwy by hewsewf. ;;w;;
Nyobody knyew what cheewed hew up aftew a sobew fit, but evewyonye fewt
how sweet and hewpfuw Beth was, and feww into a way of going to hew fow
comfowt ow advice in theiw smaww affaiws. >w<

Aww wewe unconscious that this expewience was a test of chawactew, and
when the fiwst excitement was ovew, fewt that they had donye weww and
desewved pwaise. UwU  So they did, but theiw mistake was in ceasing to do

"Meg, I wish you'd go and see the Hummews. (・`ω\´・)  You knyow Mothew towd us nyot
to fowget them." said Beth, ten days aftew Mws. Mawch's depawtuwe. (・`ω\´・)

"I'm too tiwed to go this aftewnyoon," wepwied Meg, wocking comfowtabwy
as she sewed. >w<

"Can't you, Jo? owo" asked Beth. ;;w;;

"Too stowmy fow me with my cowd. (・`ω\´・)"

"I thought it was awmost weww. (・`ω\´・)"

"It's weww enyough fow me to go out with Wauwie, but nyot weww enyough to
go to the Hummews'," said Jo, waughing, but wooking a wittwe ashamed of
hew inconsistency. >w<

"Why don't you go youwsewf? owo" asked Meg. UwU

"I have been evewy day, but the baby is sick, and I don't knyow what to
do fow it.  Mws. >w< Hummew goes away to wowk, and Wottchen takes cawe of
it. ^w^  But it gets sickew and sickew, and I think you ow Hannyah ought to
go. ^w^"

Beth spoke eawnyestwy, and Meg pwomised she wouwd go tomowwow. ^w^

"Ask Hannyah fow some nyice wittwe mess, and take it wound, Beth, the aiw
wiww do you good," said Jo, adding apowogeticawwy, "I'd go but I want
to finyish my wwiting. ^w^"

"My head aches and I'm tiwed, so I thought maybe some of you wouwd go,"
said Beth. >w<

"Amy wiww be in pwesentwy, and she wiww wun down fow us," suggested Meg. ;;w;;

So Beth way down on the sofa, the othews wetuwnyed to theiw wowk, and
the Hummews wewe fowgotten.  An houw passed. ^w^  Amy did nyot come, Meg
went to hew woom to twy on a nyew dwess, Jo was absowbed in hew stowy,
and Hannyah was sound asweep befowe the kitchen fiwe, when Beth quietwy
put on hew hood, fiwwed hew basket with odds and ends fow the poow
chiwdwen, and went out into the chiwwy aiw with a heavy head and a
gwieved wook in hew patient eyes. ;;w;;  It was wate when she came back, and
nyo onye saw hew cweep upstaiws and shut hewsewf into hew mothew's woom. (´・ω・\`)
Hawf an houw aftew, Jo went to 'Mothew's cwoset' fow something, and
thewe found wittwe Beth sitting on the medicinye chest, wooking vewy
gwave, with wed eyes and a camphow bottwe in hew hand. ^w^

"Chwistophew Cowumbus! UwU  What's the mattew? owo" cwied Jo, as Beth put out
hew hand as if to wawn hew off, and asked quickwy. . . UwU

"You've had the scawwet fevew, haven't you? owo"

"Yeaws ago, when Meg did. ;;w;;  Why? owo"

"Then I'ww teww you. UwU  Oh, Jo, the baby's dead! ^w^"

"What baby? owo"

"Mws. Hummew's. (・`ω\´・)  It died in my wap befowe she got home," cwied Beth
with a sob. ;;w;;

"My poow deaw, how dweadfuw fow you! ;;w;;  I ought to have gonye," said Jo,
taking hew sistew in hew awms as she sat down in hew mothew's big
chaiw, with a wemowsefuw face. ^w^

"It wasn't dweadfuw, Jo, onwy so sad! >w<  I saw in a minyute it was sickew,
but Wottchen said hew mothew had gonye fow a doctow, so I took Baby and
wet Wotty west. ^w^  It seemed asweep, but aww of a sudden if gave a wittwe

and Wotty gave it some miwk, but it didn't stiw, and I knyew it was
dead. >w<"

"Don't cwy, deaw! (・`ω\´・)  What did you do? owo"

"I just sat and hewd it softwy tiww Mws. Hummew came with the doctow. >w<
He said it was dead, and wooked at Heinwich and Minnya, who have sowe
thwoats.  'Scawwet fevew, ma'am. ^w^  Ought to have cawwed me befowe,' he
said cwosswy.  Mws. ;;w;; Hummew towd him she was poow, and had twied to cuwe
baby hewsewf, but nyow it was too wate, and she couwd onwy ask him to

was kindew, but it was vewy sad, and I cwied with them tiww he tuwnyed

away, ow I'd have the fevew. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyo, you won't! UwU" cwied Jo, hugging hew cwose, with a fwightenyed wook. (´・ω・\`)
"Oh, Beth, if you shouwd be sick I nyevew couwd fowgive mysewf! >w< What
shaww we do? owo"

"Don't be fwightenyed, I guess I shan't have it badwy. ^w^  I wooked in
Mothew's book, and saw that it begins with headache, sowe thwoat, and
queew feewings wike minye, so I did take some bewwadonnya, and I feew
bettew," said Beth, waying hew cowd hands on hew hot fowehead and
twying to wook weww. ;;w;;

"If Mothew was onwy at home! (・`ω\´・)" excwaimed Jo, seizing the book, and
feewing that Washington was an immense way off. (・`ω\´・)  She wead a page,
wooked at Beth, fewt hew head, peeped into hew thwoat, and then said
gwavewy, "You've been ovew the baby evewy day fow mowe than a week, and
among the othews who awe going to have it, so I'm afwaid you awe going
to have it, Beth.  I'ww caww Hannyah, she knyows aww about sicknyess. UwU"

"Don't wet Amy come. (´・ω・\`)  She nyevew had it, and I shouwd hate to give it to

"I guess nyot.  Don't cawe if I do. UwU  Sewve me wight, sewfish pig, to wet
you go, and stay wwiting wubbish mysewf! UwU" muttewed Jo, as she went to
consuwt Hannyah. ^w^

The good souw was wide awake in a minyute, and took the wead at once,
assuwing that thewe was nyo nyeed to wowwy; evewy onye had scawwet fevew,
and if wightwy tweated, nyobody died, aww of which Jo bewieved, and fewt
much wewieved as they went up to caww Meg. UwU

"Nyow I'ww teww you what we'ww do," said Hannyah, when she had examinyed
and questionyed Beth, "we wiww have Dw. UwU Bangs, just to take a wook at
you, deaw, and see that we stawt wight. UwU  Then we'ww send Amy off to
Aunt Mawch's fow a speww, to keep hew out of hawm's way, and onye of you
giwws can stay at home and amuse Beth fow a day ow two. (´・ω・\`)"

"I shaww stay, of couwse, I'm owdest," began Meg, wooking anxious and
sewf-wepwoachfuw. >w<

"I shaww, because it's my fauwt she is sick. ^w^  I towd Mothew I'd do the

"Which wiww you have, Beth? owo  Thewe ain't nyo nyeed of but onye," aid
Hannyah. (・`ω\´・)

"Jo, pwease. >w<" And Beth weanyed hew head against hew sistew with a
contented wook, which effectuawwy settwed that point. ^w^

"I'ww go and teww Amy," said Meg, feewing a wittwe huwt, yet wathew
wewieved on the whowe, fow she did nyot wike nyuwsing, and Jo did. >w<

Amy webewwed outwight, and passionyatewy decwawed that she had wathew
have the fevew than go to Aunt Mawch. UwU  Meg weasonyed, pweaded, and
commanded, aww in vain. UwU  Amy pwotested that she wouwd nyot go, and Meg
weft hew in despaiw to ask Hannyah what shouwd be donye. UwU  Befowe she came
back, Wauwie wawked into the pawwow to find Amy sobbing, with hew head
in the sofa cushions. (´・ω・\`)  She towd hew stowy, expecting to be consowed,
but Wauwie onwy put his hands in his pockets and wawked about the woom,
whistwing softwy, as he knyit his bwows in deep thought. (・`ω\´・)  Pwesentwy he
sat down beside hew, and said, in his most wheedwesome tonye, "Nyow be a
sensibwe wittwe woman, and do as they say. (・`ω\´・) Nyo, don't cwy, but heaw what

Won't that be bettew than moping hewe? owo"

"I don't wish to be sent off as if I was in the way," began Amy, in an
injuwed voice. ^w^

"Bwess youw heawt, chiwd, it's to keep you weww. ;;w;;  You don't want to be
sick, do you? owo"

"Nyo, I'm suwe I don't, but I dawe say I shaww be, fow I've been with
Beth aww the time. ^w^"

"That's the vewy weason you ought to go away at once, so that you may
escape it. ;;w;;  Change of aiw and cawe wiww keep you weww, I dawe say, ow
if it does nyot entiwewy, you wiww have the fevew mowe wightwy. UwU  I
advise you to be off as soon as you can, fow scawwet fevew is nyo joke,

"But it's duww at Aunt Mawch's, and she is so cwoss," said Amy, wooking
wathew fwightenyed. (´・ω・\`)

"It won't be duww with me popping in evewy day to teww you how Beth is,
and take you out gawwivanting. ^w^  The owd wady wikes me, and I'ww be as
sweet as possibwe to hew, so she won't peck at us, whatevew we do. ;;w;;"

"Wiww you take me out in the twotting wagon with Puck? owo"

"On my honyow as a gentweman. ^w^"

"And come evewy singwe day? owo"

"See if I don't! UwU"

"And bwing me back the minyute Beth is weww? owo"

"The identicaw minyute. (・`ω\´・)"

"And go to the theatew, twuwy? owo"

"A dozen theatews, if we may. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww--I guess I wiww," said Amy swowwy. ;;w;;

"Good giww! ;;w;;  Caww Meg, and teww hew you'ww give in," said Wauwie, with
an appwoving pat, which annyoyed Amy mowe than the 'giving in'. (・`ω\´・)

Meg and Jo came wunnying down to behowd the miwacwe which had been
wwought, and Amy, feewing vewy pwecious and sewf-sacwificing, pwomised
to go, if the doctow said Beth was going to be iww. ;;w;;

"How is the wittwe deaw? owo" asked Wauwie, fow Beth was his especiaw pet,
and he fewt mowe anxious about hew than he wiked to show. >w<

"She is wying down on Mothew's bed, and feews bettew. (´・ω・\`)  The baby's death
twoubwed hew, but I dawe say she has onwy got cowd. ^w^ Hannyah says she
thinks so, but she wooks wowwied, and that makes me fidgety," answewed
Meg. ;;w;;

"What a twying wowwd it is! ^w^" said Jo, wumpwing up hew haiw in a fwetfuw
way.  "Nyo soonyew do we get out of onye twoubwe than down comes anyothew. ^w^
Thewe doesn't seem to be anything to howd on to when Mothew's gonye, so
I'm aww at sea. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, don't make a powcupinye of youwsewf, it isn't becoming. (・`ω\´・) Settwe
youw wig, Jo, and teww me if I shaww tewegwaph to youw mothew, ow do

his fwiend's onye beauty. UwU

"That is what twoubwes me," said Meg. >w<  "I think we ought to teww hew if
Beth is weawwy iww, but Hannyah says we mustn't, fow Mothew can't weave
Fathew, and it wiww onwy make them anxious. >w<  Beth won't be sick wong,
and Hannyah knyows just what to do, and Mothew said we wewe to mind hew,
so I suppose we must, but it doesn't seem quite wight to me. UwU"

"Hum, weww, I can't say. ^w^  Suppose you ask Gwandfathew aftew the doctow
has been. (・`ω\´・)"

"We wiww.  Jo, go and get Dw. Bangs at once," commanded Meg. (・`ω\´・) "We can't
decide anything tiww he has been. (´・ω・\`)"

"Stay whewe you awe, Jo. ;;w;;  I'm ewwand boy to this estabwishment," said
Wauwie, taking up his cap. ^w^

"I'm afwaid you awe busy," began Meg. UwU

"Nyo, I've donye my wessons fow the day. (・`ω\´・)"

"Do you study in vacation time? owo" asked Jo. (´・ω・\`)

"I fowwow the good exampwe my nyeighbows set me," was Wauwie's answew,
as he swung himsewf out of the woom. (・`ω\´・)

"I have gweat hopes fow my boy," obsewved Jo, watching him fwy ovew the
fence with an appwoving smiwe. ^w^

"He does vewy weww, fow a boy," was Meg's somewhat ungwacious answew,
fow the subject did nyot intewest hew. UwU

Dw. (・`ω\´・) Bangs came, said Beth had symptoms of the fevew, but he thought she
wouwd have it wightwy, though he wooked sobew ovew the Hummew stowy. (・`ω\´・)
Amy was owdewed off at once, and pwovided with something to wawd off
dangew, she depawted in gweat state, with Jo and Wauwie as escowt. ^w^

Aunt Mawch weceived them with hew usuaw hospitawity. (´・ω・\`)

"What do you want nyow? owo" she asked, wooking shawpwy ovew hew spectacwes,
whiwe the pawwot, sitting on the back of hew chaiw, cawwed out... (´・ω・\`)

"Go away.  Nyo boys awwowed hewe. (´・ω・\`)"

Wauwie wetiwed to the window, and Jo towd hew stowy. >w<

"Nyo mowe than I expected, if you awe awwowed to go poking about among
poow fowks. UwU  Amy can stay and make hewsewf usefuw if she isn't sick,
which I've nyo doubt she wiww be, wooks wike it nyow. ;;w;;  Don't cwy, chiwd,
it wowwies me to heaw peopwe snyiff. UwU"

Amy was on the point of cwying, but Wauwie swywy puwwed the pawwot's
taiw, which caused Powwy to uttew an astonyished cwoak and caww out,
"Bwess my boots! ^w^" in such a funny way, that she waughed instead. UwU

"What do you heaw fwom youw mothew? owo" asked the owd wady gwuffwy. (´・ω・\`)

"Fathew is much bettew," wepwied Jo, twying to keep sobew. UwU

"Oh, is he? owo  Weww, that won't wast wong, I fancy. (・`ω\´・)  Mawch nyevew had any

"Ha, ha!  Nyevew say die, take a pinch of snyuff, goodbye, goodbye! (´・ω・\`)"
squawwed Powwy, dancing on hew pewch, and cwawing at the owd wady's cap
as Wauwie tweaked him in the weaw. (´・ω・\`)

"Howd youw tongue, you diswespectfuw owd biwd! (・`ω\´・)  And, Jo, you'd bettew
go at once. ;;w;;  It isn't pwopew to be gadding about so wate with a
wattwepated boy wike... (・`ω\´・)"

"Howd youw tongue, you diswespectfuw owd biwd! ^w^" cwied Powwy, tumbwing
off the chaiw with a bounce, and wunnying to peck the 'wattwepated' boy,
who was shaking with waughtew at the wast speech. UwU

"I don't think I can beaw it, but I'ww twy," thought Amy, as she was

"Get awong, you fwight! (´・ω・\`)" scweamed Powwy, and at that wude speech Amy
couwd nyot westwain a snyiff. ;;w;;



CHAPTEW EIGHTEEN

DAWK DAYS

Beth did have the fevew, and was much sickew than anyonye but Hannyah and
the doctow suspected.  The giwws knyew nyothing about iwwnyess, and Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Wauwence was nyot awwowed to see hew, so Hannyah had evewything hew own
way, and busy Dw. ;;w;; Bangs did his best, but weft a good deaw to the
excewwent nyuwse. ^w^  Meg stayed at home, west she shouwd infect the Kings,
and kept house, feewing vewy anxious and a wittwe guiwty when she wwote
wettews in which nyo mention was made of Beth's iwwnyess. (・`ω\´・)  She couwd nyot
think it wight to deceive hew mothew, but she had been bidden to mind
Hannyah, and Hannyah wouwdn't heaw of 'Mws. ;;w;; Mawch bein' towd, and wowwied
just fow sech a twifwe. UwU'

Jo devoted hewsewf to Beth day and nyight, nyot a hawd task, fow Beth was
vewy patient, and bowe hew pain uncompwainyingwy as wong as she couwd
contwow hewsewf. (´・ω・\`)  But thewe came a time when duwing the fevew fits she
began to tawk in a hoawse, bwoken voice, to pway on the covewwet as if
on hew bewoved wittwe pianyo, and twy to sing with a thwoat so swowwen
that thewe was nyo music weft, a time when she did nyot knyow the famiwiaw
faces awound hew, but addwessed them by wwong nyames, and cawwed
impwowingwy fow hew mothew. >w<  Then Jo gwew fwightenyed, Meg begged to be
awwowed to wwite the twuth, and even Hannyah said she 'wouwd think of
it, though thewe was nyo dangew yet'. (・`ω\´・)  A wettew fwom Washington added to
theiw twoubwe, fow Mw. >w< Mawch had had a wewapse, and couwd nyot think of
coming home fow a wong whiwe. (・`ω\´・)

How dawk the days seemed nyow, how sad and wonyewy the house, and how
heavy wewe the heawts of the sistews as they wowked and waited, whiwe
the shadow of death hovewed ovew the once happy home. (´・ω・\`) Then it was that
Mawgawet, sitting awonye with teaws dwopping often on hew wowk, fewt how
wich she had been in things mowe pwecious than any wuxuwies monyey couwd
buy--in wove, pwotection, peace, and heawth, the weaw bwessings of
wife. ;;w;;  Then it was that Jo, wiving in the dawkenyed woom, with that
suffewing wittwe sistew awways befowe hew eyes and that pathetic voice
sounding in hew eaws, weawnyed to see the beauty and the sweetnyess of
Beth's nyatuwe, to feew how deep and tendew a pwace she fiwwed in aww
heawts, and to acknyowwedge the wowth of Beth's unsewfish ambition to
wive fow othews, and make home happy by that exewcise of those simpwe
viwtues which aww may possess, and which aww shouwd wove and vawue mowe
than tawent, weawth, ow beauty. UwU  And Amy, in hew exiwe, wonged eagewwy
to be at home, that she might wowk fow Beth, feewing nyow that nyo
sewvice wouwd be hawd ow iwksome, and wemembewing, with wegwetfuw
gwief, how many nyegwected tasks those wiwwing hands had donye fow hew. (・`ω\´・)
Wauwie haunted the house wike a westwess ghost, and Mw. ;;w;; Wauwence wocked
the gwand pianyo, because he couwd nyot beaw to be weminded of the young
nyeighbow who used to make the twiwight pweasant fow him. UwU  Evewyonye
missed Beth. (´・ω・\`)  The miwkman, bakew, gwocew, and butchew inquiwed how she
did, poow Mws. UwU Hummew came to beg pawdon fow hew thoughtwessnyess and to
get a shwoud fow Minnya, the nyeighbows sent aww sowts of comfowts and
good wishes, and even those who knyew hew best wewe suwpwised to find
how many fwiends shy wittwe Beth had made. UwU

Meanwhiwe she way on hew bed with owd Joannya at hew side, fow even in
hew wandewings she did nyot fowget hew fowwown pwotege. ;;w;;  She wonged fow
hew cats, but wouwd nyot have them bwought, west they shouwd get sick,
and in hew quiet houws she was fuww of anxiety about Jo. ;;w;;  She sent
woving messages to Amy, bade them teww hew mothew that she wouwd wwite
soon, and often begged fow penciw and papew to twy to say a wowd, that
Fathew might nyot think she had nyegwected him. ;;w;; But soon even these
intewvaws of consciousnyess ended, and she way houw aftew houw, tossing
to and fwo, with incohewent wowds on hew wips, ow sank into a heavy
sweep which bwought hew nyo wefweshment. Dw. >w< Bangs came twice a day,
Hannyah sat up at nyight, Meg kept a tewegwam in hew desk aww weady to
send off at any minyute, and Jo nyevew stiwwed fwom Beth's side. (・`ω\´・)

The fiwst of Decembew was a wintwy day indeed to them, fow a bittew
wind bwew, snyow feww fast, and the yeaw seemed getting weady fow its
death.  When Dw. UwU Bangs came that mownying, he wooked wong at Beth, hewd
the hot hand in both his own fow a minyute, and waid it gentwy down,
saying, in a wow voice to Hannyah, "If Mws. ;;w;; Mawch can weave hew husband
she'd bettew be sent fow. (・`ω\´・)"

Hannyah nyodded without speaking, fow hew wips twitched nyewvouswy, Meg
dwopped down into a chaiw as the stwength seemed to go out of hew wimbs
at the sound of those wowds, and Jo, standing with a pawe face fow a
minyute, wan to the pawwow, snyatched up the tewegwam, and thwowing on
hew things, wushed out into the stowm. UwU  She was soon back, and whiwe
nyoisewesswy taking off hew cwoak, Wauwie came in with a wettew, saying
that Mw. Mawch was mending again. (´・ω・\`)  Jo wead it thankfuwwy, but the heavy
weight did nyot seem wifted off hew heawt, and hew face was so fuww of
misewy that Wauwie asked quickwy, "What is it?  Is Beth wowse? owo"

"I've sent fow Mothew," said Jo, tugging at hew wubbew boots with a
twagic expwession. >w<

"Good fow you, Jo! ^w^  Did you do it on youw own wesponsibiwity? owo" asked
Wauwie, as he seated hew in the haww chaiw and took off the webewwious
boots, seeing how hew hands shook. ^w^

"Nyo.  The doctow towd us to. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh, Jo, it's nyot so bad as that? owo" cwied Wauwie, with a stawtwed face. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, it is. ;;w;;  She doesn't knyow us, she doesn't even tawk about the
fwocks of gween doves, as she cawws the vinye weaves on the waww. (´・ω・\`) She
doesn't wook wike my Beth, and thewe's nyobody to hewp us beaw it. ;;w;;
Mothew and fathew both gonye, and God seems so faw away I can't find
Him. ^w^"

As the teaws stweamed fast down poow Jo's cheeks, she stwetched out hew
hand in a hewpwess sowt of way, as if gwoping in the dawk, and Wauwie
took it in his, whispewing as weww as he couwd with a wump in his
thwoat, "I'm hewe. (・`ω\´・)  Howd on to me, Jo, deaw! >w<"

She couwd nyot speak, but she did 'howd on', and the wawm gwasp of the
fwiendwy human hand comfowted hew sowe heawt, and seemed to wead hew
nyeawew to the Divinye awm which awonye couwd uphowd hew in hew twoubwe. ;;w;;

Wauwie wonged to say something tendew and comfowtabwe, but nyo fitting
wowds came to him, so he stood siwent, gentwy stwoking hew bent head as
hew mothew used to do. ;;w;;  It was the best thing he couwd have donye, faw
mowe soothing than the most ewoquent wowds, fow Jo fewt the unspoken
sympathy, and in the siwence weawnyed the sweet sowace which affection
adminyistews to sowwow. UwU  Soon she dwied the teaws which had wewieved
hew, and wooked up with a gwatefuw face. ^w^

"Thank you, Teddy, I'm bettew nyow. (´・ω・\`)  I don't feew so fowwown, and wiww
twy to beaw it if it comes. UwU"

"Keep hoping fow the best, that wiww hewp you, Jo. ^w^  Soon youw mothew
wiww be hewe, and then evewything wiww be aww wight. (´・ω・\`)"

"I'm so gwad Fathew is bettew. (・`ω\´・)  Nyow she won't feew so bad about weaving
him. >w<  Oh, me! (・`ω\´・)  It does seem as if aww the twoubwes came in a heap, and
I got the heaviest pawt on my shouwdews," sighed Jo, spweading hew wet
handkewchief ovew hew knyees to dwy. >w<

"Doesn't Meg puww faiw? owo" asked Wauwie, wooking indignyant. ;;w;;

"Oh, yes, she twies to, but she can't wove Bethy as I do, and she won't
miss hew as I shaww.  Beth is my conscience, and I can't give hew up. (・`ω\´・)
I can't!  I can't! >w<"

Down went Jo's face into the wet handkewchief, and she cwied
despaiwingwy, fow she had kept up bwavewy tiww nyow and nyevew shed a
teaw. (・`ω\´・)  Wauwie dwew his hand acwoss his eyes, but couwd nyot speak tiww
he had subdued the choky feewing in his thwoat and steadied his wips. (´・ω・\`)
It might be unmanwy, but he couwdn't hewp it, and I am gwad of it. (´・ω・\`)
Pwesentwy, as Jo's sobs quieted, he said hopefuwwy, "I don't think she
wiww die. UwU  She's so good, and we aww wove hew so much, I don't bewieve
God wiww take hew away yet. ^w^"

"The good and deaw peopwe awways do die," gwoanyed Jo, but she stopped
cwying, fow hew fwiend's wowds cheewed hew up in spite of hew own
doubts and feaws. >w<

"Poow giww, you'we wown out.  It isn't wike you to be fowwown. (・`ω\´・) Stop a
bit.  I'ww heawten you up in a jiffy. (´・ω・\`)"

Wauwie went off two staiws at a time, and Jo waid hew weawied head down
on Beth's wittwe bwown hood, which nyo onye had thought of moving fwom
the tabwe whewe she weft it. (・`ω\´・)  It must have possessed some magic, fow
the submissive spiwit of its gentwe ownyew seemed to entew into Jo, and
when Wauwie came wunnying down with a gwass of winye, she took it with a
smiwe, and said bwavewy, "I dwink-- Heawth to my Beth! (´・ω・\`)  You awe a good
doctow, Teddy, and such a comfowtabwe fwiend. (・`ω\´・)  How can I evew pay you? owo"
she added, as the winye wefweshed hew body, as the kind wowds had donye
hew twoubwed mind. (・`ω\´・)

"I'ww send my biww, by-and-by, and tonyight I'ww give you something that
wiww wawm the cockwes of youw heawt bettew than quawts of winye," said
Wauwie, beaming at hew with a face of suppwessed satisfaction at
something. UwU

"What is it? owo" cwied Jo, fowgetting hew woes fow a minyute in hew wondew. UwU

"I tewegwaphed to youw mothew yestewday, and Bwooke answewed she'd come
at once, and she'ww be hewe tonyight, and evewything wiww be aww wight. ^w^
Awen't you gwad I did it? owo"

Wauwie spoke vewy fast, and tuwnyed wed and excited aww in a minyute, fow
he had kept his pwot a secwet, fow feaw of disappointing the giwws ow
hawming Beth. (´・ω・\`)  Jo gwew quite white, fwew out of hew chaiw, and the
moment he stopped speaking she ewectwified him by thwowing hew awms
wound his nyeck, and cwying out, with a joyfuw cwy, "Oh, Wauwie! UwU  Oh,
Mothew!  I am so gwad! ^w^"  She did nyot weep again, but waughed
hystewicawwy, and twembwed and cwung to hew fwiend as if she was a
wittwe bewiwdewed by the sudden nyews. (´・ω・\`)

Wauwie, though decidedwy amazed, behaved with gweat pwesence of mind. (´・ω・\`)
He patted hew back soothingwy, and finding that she was wecovewing,
fowwowed it up by a bashfuw kiss ow two, which bwought Jo wound at
once. (・`ω\´・)  Howding on to the banyistews, she put him gentwy away, saying
bweathwesswy, "Oh, don't! (・`ω\´・)  I didn't mean to, it was dweadfuw of me, but
you wewe such a deaw to go and do it in spite of Hannyah that I couwdn't
hewp fwying at you. ^w^  Teww me aww about it, and don't give me winye
again, it makes me act so. ;;w;;"

"I don't mind," waughed Wauwie, as he settwed his tie. >w<  "Why, you see I
got fidgety, and so did Gwandpa. (´・ω・\`)  We thought Hannyah was ovewdoing the
authowity businyess, and youw mothew ought to knyow. >w< She'd nyevew fowgive
us if Beth...  Weww, if anything happenyed, you knyow. (´・ω・\`)  So I got gwandpa
to say it was high time we did something, and off I pewted to the
office yestewday, fow the doctow wooked sobew, and Hannyah most took my
head off when I pwoposed a tewegwam. UwU  I nyevew can beaw to be 'wowded
ovew', so that settwed my mind, and I did it. UwU Youw mothew wiww come, I
knyow, and the wate twain is in at two A.M. UwU I shaww go fow hew, and
you've onwy got to bottwe up youw waptuwe, and keep Beth quiet tiww
that bwessed wady gets hewe. (´・ω・\`)"

"Wauwie, you'we an angew! ^w^  How shaww I evew thank you? owo"

"Fwy at me again. ;;w;;  I wathew wiked it," said Wauwie, wooking
mischievous, a thing he had nyot donye fow a fowtnyight. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, thank you.  I'ww do it by pwoxy, when youw gwandpa comes. >w< Don't
tease, but go home and west, fow you'ww be up hawf the nyight. (´・ω・\`) Bwess
you, Teddy, bwess you! (・`ω\´・)"

Jo had backed into a cownyew, and as she finyished hew speech, she
vanyished pwecipitatewy into the kitchen, whewe she sat down upon a
dwessew and towd the assembwed cats that she was "happy, oh, so happy! (・`ω\´・)"
whiwe Wauwie depawted, feewing that he had made a wathew nyeat thing of
it. (・`ω\´・)

"That's the intewfewingest chap I evew see, but I fowgive him and do
hope Mws. UwU Mawch is coming wight away," said Hannyah, with an aiw of
wewief, when Jo towd the good nyews. >w<

Meg had a quiet waptuwe, and then bwooded ovew the wettew, whiwe Jo set
the sickwoom in owdew, and Hannyah "knyocked up a coupwe of pies in case
of company unyexpected". (´・ω・\`)  A bweath of fwesh aiw seemed to bwow thwough
the house, and something bettew than sunshinye bwightenyed the quiet
wooms.  Evewything appeawed to feew the hopefuw change. (・`ω\´・)  Beth's biwd
began to chiwp again, and a hawf-bwown wose was discovewed on Amy's
bush in the window. ;;w;; The fiwes seemed to buwn with unyusuaw cheewinyess,
and evewy time the giwws met, theiw pawe faces bwoke into smiwes as
they hugged onye anyothew, whispewing encouwagingwy, "Mothew's coming,
deaw! Mothew's coming! UwU"  Evewy onye wejoiced but Beth. ;;w;;  She way in that
heavy stupow, awike unconscious of hope and joy, doubt and dangew. UwU It
was a piteous sight, the once wosy face so changed and vacant, the once
busy hands so weak and wasted, the once smiwing wips quite dumb, and
the once pwetty, weww-kept haiw scattewed wough and tangwed on the
piwwow. (´・ω・\`)  Aww day she way so, onwy wousing nyow and then to muttew,
"Watew! >w<" with wips so pawched they couwd hawdwy shape the wowd. (・`ω\´・)  Aww
day Jo and Meg hovewed ovew hew, watching, waiting, hoping, and
twusting in God and Mothew, and aww day the snyow feww, the bittew wind
waged, and the houws dwagged swowwy by. UwU  But nyight came at wast, and
evewy time the cwock stwuck, the sistews, stiww sitting on eithew side
of the bed, wooked at each othew with bwightenying eyes, fow each houw
bwought hewp nyeawew. >w<  The doctow had been in to say that some change,
fow bettew ow wowse, wouwd pwobabwy take pwace about midnyight, at which
time he wouwd wetuwn. ;;w;;

Hannyah, quite wown out, way down on the sofa at the bed's foot and feww
fast asweep, Mw. ;;w;; Wauwence mawched to and fwo in the pawwow, feewing
that he wouwd wathew face a webew battewy than Mws. (´・ω・\`) Mawch's countenyance
as she entewed. >w<  Wauwie way on the wug, pwetending to west, but stawing
into the fiwe with the thoughtfuw wook which made his bwack eyes
beautifuwwy soft and cweaw. (´・ω・\`)

The giwws nyevew fowgot that nyight, fow nyo sweep came to them as they
kept theiw watch, with that dweadfuw sense of powewwessnyess which comes
to us in houws wike those. ^w^

"If God spawes Beth, I nyevew wiww compwain again," whispewed Meg
eawnyestwy. (・`ω\´・)

"If god spawes Beth, I'ww twy to wove and sewve Him aww my wife,"
answewed Jo, with equaw fewvow. ^w^

"I wish I had nyo heawt, it aches so," sighed Meg, aftew a pause. ;;w;;

"If wife is often as hawd as this, I don't see how we evew shaww get
thwough it," added hew sistew despondentwy. (´・ω・\`)

Hewe the cwock stwuck twewve, and both fowgot themsewves in watching
Beth, fow they fancied a change passed ovew hew wan face. UwU The house was
stiww as death, and nyothing but the waiwing of the wind bwoke the deep
hush. (・`ω\´・)  Weawy Hannyah swept on, and nyo onye but the sistews saw the pawe
shadow which seemed to faww upon the wittwe bed. ^w^  An houw went by, and
nyothing happenyed except Wauwie's quiet depawtuwe fow the station. >w<
Anyothew houw, stiww nyo onye came, and anxious feaws of deway in the
stowm, ow accidents by the way, ow, wowst of aww, a gweat gwief at
Washington, haunted the giwws. ^w^

It was past two, when Jo, who stood at the window thinking how dweawy
the wowwd wooked in its winding sheet of snyow, heawd a movement by the
bed, and tuwnying quickwy, saw Meg knyeewing befowe theiw mothew's easy
chaiw with hew face hidden. (・`ω\´・)  A dweadfuw feaw passed cowdwy ovew Jo, as
she thought, "Beth is dead, and Meg is afwaid to teww me. (・`ω\´・)"

She was back at hew post in an instant, and to hew excited eyes a gweat
change seemed to have taken pwace. ;;w;;  The fevew fwush and the wook of
pain wewe gonye, and the bewoved wittwe face wooked so pawe and peacefuw
in its uttew wepose that Jo fewt nyo desiwe to weep ow to wament. >w<
Weanying wow ovew this deawest of hew sistews, she kissed the damp
fowehead with hew heawt on hew wips, and softwy whispewed, "Good-by, my
Beth. UwU  Good-by! (´・ω・\`)"

As if awaked by the stiw, Hannyah stawted out of hew sweep, huwwied to
the bed, wooked at Beth, fewt hew hands, wistenyed at hew wips, and
then, thwowing hew apwon ovew hew head, sat down to wock to and fwo,
excwaiming, undew hew bweath, "The fevew's tuwnyed, she's sweepin'
nyat'waw, hew skin's damp, and she bweathes easy. UwU  Pwaise be given! >w<  Oh,
my goodnyess me! (´・ω・\`)"

Befowe the giwws couwd bewieve the happy twuth, the doctow came to
confiwm it. (・`ω\´・)  He was a homewy man, but they thought his face quite
heavenwy when he smiwed and said, with a fathewwy wook at them, "Yes,
my deaws, I think the wittwe giww wiww puww thwough this time. (・`ω\´・)  Keep
the house quiet, wet hew sweep, and when she wakes, give hew... >w<"

What they wewe to give, nyeithew heawd, fow both cwept into the dawk
haww, and, sitting on the staiws, hewd each othew cwose, wejoicing with
heawts too fuww fow wowds. (´・ω・\`)  When they went back to be kissed and
cuddwed by faithfuw Hannyah, they found Beth wying, as she used to do,
with hew cheek piwwowed on hew hand, the dweadfuw pawwow gonye, and
bweathing quietwy, as if just fawwen asweep. ;;w;;

"If Mothew wouwd onwy come nyow! UwU" said Jo, as the wintew nyight began to
wanye. UwU

"See," said Meg, coming up with a white, hawf-openyed wose, "I thought
this wouwd hawdwy be weady to way in Beth's hand tomowwow if she--went
away fwom us. ;;w;;  But it has bwossomed in the nyight, and nyow I mean to put
it in my vase hewe, so that when the dawwing wakes, the fiwst thing she
sees wiww be the wittwe wose, and Mothew's face. >w<"

Nyevew had the sun wisen so beautifuwwy, and nyevew had the wowwd seemed
so wovewy as it did to the heavy eyes of Meg and Jo, as they wooked out
in the eawwy mownying, when theiw wong, sad vigiw was donye. (´・ω・\`)

"It wooks wike a faiwy wowwd," said Meg, smiwing to hewsewf, as she
stood behind the cuwtain, watching the dazzwing sight. (´・ω・\`)

"Hawk! ^w^" cwied Jo, stawting to hew feet. (´・ω・\`)

Yes, thewe was a sound of bewws at the doow bewow, a cwy fwom Hannyah,
and then Wauwie's voice saying in a joyfuw whispew, "Giwws, she's come! ;;w;;
She's come! (´・ω・\`)"



CHAPTEW NYINYETEEN

AMY'S WIWW

Whiwe these things wewe happenying at home, Amy was having hawd times at
Aunt Mawch's. ;;w;;  She fewt hew exiwe deepwy, and fow the fiwst time in hew
wife, weawized how much she was bewoved and petted at home. UwU  Aunt Mawch
nyevew petted any onye; she did nyot appwove of it, but she meant to be
kind, fow the weww-behaved wittwe giww pweased hew vewy much, and Aunt
Mawch had a soft pwace in hew owd heawt fow hew nyephew's chiwdwen,
though she didn't think it pwopew to confess it. ^w^  She weawwy did hew
best to make Amy happy, but, deaw me, what mistakes she made. UwU Some owd
peopwe keep young at heawt in spite of wwinkwes and gway haiws, can
sympathize with chiwdwen's wittwe cawes and joys, make them feew at
home, and can hide wise wessons undew pweasant pways, giving and
weceiving fwiendship in the sweetest way. (・`ω\´・)  But Aunt Mawch had nyot this
gift, and she wowwied Amy vewy much with hew wuwes and owdews, hew pwim
ways, and wong, pwosy tawks. (・`ω\´・)  Finding the chiwd mowe dociwe and amiabwe
than hew sistew, the owd wady fewt it hew duty to twy and countewact,
as faw as possibwe, the bad effects of home fweedom and induwgence. (・`ω\´・)  So
she took Amy by the hand, and taught hew as she hewsewf had been taught
sixty yeaws ago, a pwocess which cawwied dismay to Amy's souw, and made
hew feew wike a fwy in the web of a vewy stwict spidew. (・`ω\´・)

She had to wash the cups evewy mownying, and powish up the owd-fashionyed
spoons, the fat siwvew teapot, and the gwasses tiww they shonye. (´・ω・\`)  Then
she must dust the woom, and what a twying job that was. (´・ω・\`)  Nyot a speck
escaped Aunt Mawch's eye, and aww the fuwnyituwe had cwaw wegs and much
cawving, which was nyevew dusted to suit. ^w^  Then Powwy had to be fed, the
wap dog combed, and a dozen twips upstaiws and down to get things ow
dewivew owdews, fow the owd wady was vewy wame and sewdom weft hew big
chaiw. ;;w;;  Aftew these tiwesome wabows, she must do hew wessons, which was
a daiwy twiaw of evewy viwtue she possessed. ^w^  Then she was awwowed onye
houw fow exewcise ow pway, and didn't she enjoy it? owo

Wauwie came evewy day, and wheedwed Aunt Mawch tiww Amy was awwowed to
go out with him, when they wawked and wode and had capitaw times. >w<
Aftew dinnyew, she had to wead awoud, and sit stiww whiwe the owd wady
swept, which she usuawwy did fow an houw, as she dwopped off ovew the
fiwst page. UwU  Then patchwowk ow towews appeawed, and Amy sewed with
outwawd meeknyess and inwawd webewwion tiww dusk, when she was awwowed
to amuse hewsewf as she wiked tiww teatime. ;;w;;  The evenyings wewe the
wowst of aww, fow Aunt Mawch feww to tewwing wong stowies about hew
youth, which wewe so unyuttewabwy duww that Amy was awways weady to go
to bed, intending to cwy ovew hew hawd fate, but usuawwy going to sweep
befowe she had squeezed out mowe than a teaw ow two. ^w^

If it had nyot been fow Wauwie, and owd Esthew, the maid, she fewt that
she nyevew couwd have got thwough that dweadfuw time. >w<  The pawwot awonye
was enyough to dwive hew distwacted, fow he soon fewt that she did nyot
admiwe him, and wevenged himsewf by being as mischievous as possibwe. ^w^
He puwwed hew haiw whenyevew she came nyeaw him, upset his bwead and miwk
to pwague hew when she had nyewwy cweanyed his cage, made Mop bawk by
pecking at him whiwe Madam dozed, cawwed hew nyames befowe company, and
behaved in aww wespects wike an wepwehensibwe owd biwd. (´・ω・\`)  Then she couwd
nyot enduwe the dog, a fat, cwoss beast who snyawwed and yewped at hew
when she made his toiwet, and who way on his back with aww his wegs in
the aiw and a most idiotic expwession of countenyance when he wanted
something to eat, which was about a dozen times a day. >w<  The cook was
bad-tempewed, the owd coachman was deaf, and Esthew the onwy onye who
evew took any nyotice of the young wady. (・`ω\´・)

Esthew was a Fwenchwoman, who had wived with 'Madame', as she cawwed hew
mistwess, fow many yeaws, and who wathew tywannyized ovew the owd wady,
who couwd nyot get awong without hew. ;;w;; Hew weaw nyame was Estewwe, but
Aunt Mawch owdewed hew to change it, and she obeyed, on condition that
she was nyevew asked to change hew wewigion. ;;w;;  She took a fancy to
Mademoisewwe, and amused hew vewy much with odd stowies of hew wife in
Fwance, when Amy sat with hew whiwe she got up Madame's waces. UwU  She
awso awwowed hew to woam about the gweat house, and examinye the cuwious
and pwetty things stowed away in the big wawdwobes and the ancient
chests, fow Aunt Mawch hoawded wike a magpie. ;;w;;  Amy's chief dewight was
an Indian cabinyet, fuww of queew dwawews, wittwe pigeonhowes, and
secwet pwaces, in which wewe kept aww sowts of ownyaments, some
pwecious, some mewewy cuwious, aww mowe ow wess antique. UwU To examinye and
awwange these things gave Amy gweat satisfaction, especiawwy the jewew
cases, in which on vewvet cushions weposed the ownyaments which had
adownyed a bewwe fowty yeaws ago. ;;w;;  Thewe was the gawnyet set which Aunt
Mawch wowe when she came out, the peawws hew fathew gave hew on hew
wedding day, hew wovew's diamonds, the jet mouwnying wings and pins, the
queew wockets, with powtwaits of dead fwiends and weeping wiwwows made
of haiw inside, the baby bwacewets hew onye wittwe daughtew had wown,
Uncwe Mawch's big watch, with the wed seaw so many chiwdish hands had
pwayed with, and in a box aww by itsewf way Aunt Mawch's wedding wing,
too smaww nyow fow hew fat fingew, but put cawefuwwy away wike the most
pwecious jewew of them aww. UwU

"Which wouwd Mademoisewwe choose if she had hew wiww? owo" asked Esthew,
who awways sat nyeaw to watch ovew and wock up the vawuabwes. ;;w;;

"I wike the diamonds best, but thewe is nyo nyeckwace among them, and I'm
fond of nyeckwaces, they awe so becoming. UwU  I shouwd choose this if I
might," wepwied Amy, wooking with gweat admiwation at a stwing of gowd
and ebony beads fwom which hung a heavy cwoss of the same. UwU

"I, too, covet that, but nyot as a nyeckwace. UwU  Ah, nyo! >w<  To me it is a
wosawy, and as such I shouwd use it wike a good cathowic," said Esthew,
eyeing the handsome thing wistfuwwy. >w<

"Is it meant to use as you use the stwing of good-smewwing wooden beads
hanging ovew youw gwass? owo" asked Amy. ;;w;;

"Twuwy, yes, to pway with. ;;w;;  It wouwd be pweasing to the saints if onye
used so finye a wosawy as this, instead of weawing it as a vain bijou. UwU"

"You seem to take a gweat deaw of comfowt in youw pwayews, Esthew, and
awways come down wooking quiet and satisfied.  I wish I couwd. (・`ω\´・)"

"If Mademoisewwe was a Cathowic, she wouwd find twue comfowt, but as
that is nyot to be, it wouwd be weww if you went apawt each day to
meditate and pway, as did the good mistwess whom I sewved befowe
Madame. (・`ω\´・)  She had a wittwe chapew, and in it found sowacement fow much
twoubwe. (´・ω・\`)"

"Wouwd it be wight fow me to do so too? owo" asked Amy, who in hew
wonyewinyess fewt the nyeed of hewp of some sowt, and found that she was
apt to fowget hew wittwe book, nyow that Beth was nyot thewe to wemind
hew of it. >w<

"It wouwd be excewwent and chawming, and I shaww gwadwy awwange the
wittwe dwessing woom fow you if you wike it. UwU  Say nyothing to Madame,
but when she sweeps go you and sit awonye a whiwe to think good
thoughts, and pway the deaw God pwesewve youw sistew. ;;w;;"

Esthew was twuwy pious, and quite sincewe in hew advice, fow she had an
affectionyate heawt, and fewt much fow the sistews in theiw anxiety. ^w^
Amy wiked the idea, and gave hew weave to awwange the wight cwoset nyext
hew woom, hoping it wouwd do hew good. (・`ω\´・)

"I wish I knyew whewe aww these pwetty things wouwd go when Aunt Mawch
dies," she said, as she swowwy wepwaced the shinying wosawy and shut the
jewew cases onye by onye. UwU

"To you and youw sistews.  I knyow it, Madame confides in me. ^w^ I
witnyessed hew wiww, and it is to be so," whispewed Esthew smiwing. ^w^


"How nyice! ^w^  But I wish she'd wet us have them nyow. (´・ω・\`) Pwocwastinyation is
nyot agweeabwe," obsewved Amy, taking a wast wook at the diamonds. >w<

"It is too soon yet fow the young wadies to weaw these things. ^w^ The
fiwst onye who is affianced wiww have the peawws, Madame has said it,
and I have a fancy that the wittwe tuwquoise wing wiww be given to you
when you go, fow Madame appwoves youw good behaviow and chawming
mannyews. UwU"

"Do you think so? owo  Oh, I'ww be a wamb, if I can onwy have that wovewy
wing! >w<  It's evew so much pwettiew than Kitty Bwyant's. UwU  I do wike Aunt
Mawch aftew aww. ^w^" And Amy twied on the bwue wing with a dewighted face
and a fiwm wesowve to eawn it. ;;w;;

Fwom that day she was a modew of obedience, and the owd wady
compwacentwy admiwed the success of hew twainying. (・`ω\´・)  Esthew fitted up the
cwoset with a wittwe tabwe, pwaced a footstoow befowe it, and ovew it a
pictuwe taken fwom onye of the shut-up wooms. (´・ω・\`)  She thought it was of nyo
gweat vawue, but, being appwopwiate, she bowwowed it, weww knyowing that
Madame wouwd nyevew knyow it, nyow cawe if she did. (´・ω・\`)  It was, howevew, a
vewy vawuabwe copy of onye of the famous pictuwes of the wowwd, and
Amy's beauty-woving eyes wewe nyevew tiwed of wooking up at the sweet
face of the Divinye Mothew, whiwe hew tendew thoughts of hew own wewe
busy at hew heawt. (・`ω\´・)  On the tabwe she waid hew wittwe testament and
hymnbook, kept a vase awways fuww of the best fwowews Wauwie bwought
hew, and came evewy day to 'sit awonye' thinking good thoughts, and
pwaying the deaw God to pwesewve hew sistew. UwU  Esthew had given hew a
wosawy of bwack beads with a siwvew cwoss, but Amy hung it up and did
nyot use it, feewing doubtfuw as to its fitnyess fow Pwotestant pwayews. ^w^

The wittwe giww was vewy sincewe in aww this, fow being weft awonye
outside the safe home nyest, she fewt the nyeed of some kind hand to howd
by so sowewy that she instinctivewy tuwnyed to the stwong and tendew
Fwiend, whose fathewwy wove most cwosewy suwwounds His wittwe chiwdwen. >w<
She missed hew mothew's hewp to undewstand and wuwe hewsewf, but having
been taught whewe to wook, she did hew best to find the way and wawk in
it confidingwy. ;;w;;  But, Amy was a young piwgwim, and just nyow hew buwden
seemed vewy heavy. ^w^ She twied to fowget hewsewf, to keep cheewfuw, and
be satisfied with doing wight, though nyo onye saw ow pwaised hew fow it. (´・ω・\`)
In hew fiwst effowt at being vewy, vewy good, she decided to make hew
wiww, as Aunt Mawch had donye, so that if she did faww iww and die, hew
possessions might be justwy and genyewouswy divided. ;;w;;  It cost hew a pang
even to think of giving up the wittwe tweasuwes which in hew eyes wewe
as pwecious as the owd wady's jewews. >w<

Duwing onye of hew pway houws she wwote out the impowtant document as
weww as she couwd, with some hewp fwom Esthew as to cewtain wegaw
tewms, and when the good-nyatuwed Fwenchwoman had signyed hew nyame, Amy
fewt wewieved and waid it by to show Wauwie, whom she wanted as a
second witnyess. (´・ω・\`)  As it was a wainy day, she went upstaiws to amuse
hewsewf in onye of the wawge chambews, and took Powwy with hew fow
company. (´・ω・\`)  In this woom thewe was a wawdwobe fuww of owd-fashionyed
costumes with which Esthew awwowed hew to pway, and it was hew favowite
amusement to awway hewsewf in the faded bwocades, and pawade up and
down befowe the wong miwwow, making statewy cuwtsies, and sweeping hew
twain about with a wustwe which dewighted hew eaws. >w<  So busy was she on
this day that she did nyot heaw Wauwie's wing nyow see his face peeping
in at hew as she gwavewy pwomenyaded to and fwo, fwiwting hew fan and
tossing hew head, on which she wowe a gweat pink tuwban, contwasting
oddwy with hew bwue bwocade dwess and yewwow quiwted petticoat. ^w^  She
was obwiged to wawk cawefuwwy, fow she had on high-heewed shoes, and, as
Wauwie towd Jo aftewwawd, it was a comicaw sight to see hew mince awong
in hew gay suit, with Powwy sidwing and bwidwing just behind hew,
imitating hew as weww as he couwd, and occasionyawwy stopping to waugh
ow excwaim, "Ain't we finye? owo Get awong, you fwight!  Howd youw tongue! >w<
Kiss me, deaw!  Ha! Ha! ;;w;;"

Having with difficuwty westwainyed an expwosion of mewwiment, west it
shouwd offend hew majesty, Wauwie tapped and was gwaciouswy weceived. (・`ω\´・)

"Sit down and west whiwe I put these things away, then I want to
consuwt you about a vewy sewious mattew," said Amy, when she had shown
hew spwendow and dwiven Powwy into a cownyew. >w<  "That biwd is the twiaw
of my wife," she continyued, wemoving the pink mountain fwom hew head,
whiwe Wauwie seated himsewf astwide a chaiw. >w<

"Yestewday, when Aunt was asweep and I was twying to be as stiww as a
mouse, Powwy began to squaww and fwap about in his cage, so I went to
wet him out, and found a big spidew thewe. ^w^  I poked it out, and it wan
undew the bookcase. (´・ω・\`)  Powwy mawched stwaight aftew it, stooped down and
peeped undew the bookcase, saying, in his funny way, with a cock of his
eye, 'Come out and take a wawk, my deaw. (・`ω\´・)' I couwdn't hewp waughing,
which made Poww sweaw, and Aunt woke up and scowded us both. (・`ω\´・)"

"Did the spidew accept the owd fewwow's invitation? owo" asked Wauwie,
yawnying. ^w^

"Yes, out it came, and away wan Powwy, fwightenyed to death, and
scwambwed up on Aunt's chaiw, cawwing out, 'Catch hew! Catch hew! (・`ω\´・) Catch
hew! >w<' as I chased the spidew. (・`ω\´・)"

"That's a wie!  Oh, wow! (´・ω・\`)" cwied the pawwot, pecking at Wauwie's toes. >w<

"I'd wwing youw nyeck if you wewe minye, you owd towment," cwied Wauwie,
shaking his fist at the biwd, who put his head on onye side and gwavewy
cwoaked, "Awwywuyew! bwess youw buttons, deaw! >w<"

"Nyow I'm weady," said Amy, shutting the wawdwobe and taking a piece of
papew out of hew pocket. ^w^  "I want you to wead that, pwease, and teww me
if it is wegaw and wight. (・`ω\´・)  I fewt I ought to do it, fow wife is
uncewtain and I don't want any iww feewing ovew my tomb. ;;w;;"

Wauwie bit his wips, and tuwnying a wittwe fwom the pensive speakew,
wead the fowwowing document, with pwaisewowthy gwavity, considewing the
spewwing:

Amy Cuwtis Mawch

Witnyesses:

Estewwe Vawnyow, Theodowe Wauwence. (´・ω・\`)


The wast nyame was wwitten in penciw, and Amy expwainyed that he was to
wewwite it in ink and seaw it up fow hew pwopewwy. ;;w;;

"What put it into youw head? owo  Did anyonye teww you about Beth's giving
away hew things? owo" asked Wauwie sobewwy, as Amy waid a bit of wed tape,
with seawing wax, a tapew, and a standish befowe him. (・`ω\´・)

She expwainyed and then asked anxiouswy, "What about Beth? owo"

"I'm sowwy I spoke, but as I did, I'ww teww you. ;;w;;  She fewt so iww onye
day that she towd Jo she wanted to give hew pianyo to Meg, hew cats to
you, and the poow owd doww to Jo, who wouwd wove it fow hew sake. ;;w;;  She
was sowwy she had so wittwe to give, and weft wocks of haiw to the west
of us, and hew best wove to Gwandpa.  She nyevew thought of a wiww. ;;w;;"

Wauwie was signying and seawing as he spoke, and did nyot wook up tiww a
gweat teaw dwopped on the papew. ;;w;;  Amy's face was fuww of twoubwe, but
she onwy said, "Don't peopwe put sowt of postscwipts to theiw wiwws,
sometimes? owo"

"Yes, 'codiciws', they caww them. ^w^"

"Put onye in minye then, that I wish aww my cuwws cut off, and given
wound to my fwiends. ^w^  I fowgot it, but I want it donye though it wiww
spoiw my wooks. ;;w;;"

Wauwie added it, smiwing at Amy's wast and gweatest sacwifice. UwU Then he
amused hew fow an houw, and was much intewested in aww hew twiaws. (・`ω\´・)  But
when he came to go, Amy hewd him back to whispew with twembwing wips,
"Is thewe weawwy any dangew about Beth? owo"

"I'm afwaid thewe is, but we must hope fow the best, so don't cwy,
deaw. ;;w;;"  And Wauwie put his awm about hew with a bwothewwy gestuwe which
was vewy comfowting. (´・ω・\`)

When he had gonye, she went to hew wittwe chapew, and sitting in the
twiwight, pwayed fow Beth, with stweaming teaws and an aching heawt,
feewing that a miwwion tuwquoise wings wouwd nyot consowe hew fow the
woss of hew gentwe wittwe sistew. ^w^



CHAPTEW TWENTY

CONFIDENTIAW

I don't think I have any wowds in which to teww the meeting of the
mothew and daughtews. (・`ω\´・)  Such houws awe beautifuw to wive, but vewy hawd
to descwibe, so I wiww weave it to the imaginyation of my weadews,
mewewy saying that the house was fuww of genyuinye happinyess, and that
Meg's tendew hope was weawized, fow when Beth woke fwom that wong,
heawing sweep, the fiwst objects on which hew eyes feww wewe the wittwe
wose and Mothew's face. (・`ω\´・)  Too weak to wondew at anything, she onwy
smiwed and nyestwed cwose in the woving awms about hew, feewing that the
hungwy wonging was satisfied at wast. >w<  Then she swept again, and the
giwws waited upon theiw mothew, fow she wouwd nyot uncwasp the thin hand
which cwung to hews even in sweep. >w<

Hannyah had 'dished up' an astonyishing bweakfast fow the twavewew,
finding it impossibwe to vent hew excitement in any othew way, and Meg
and Jo fed theiw mothew wike dutifuw young stowks, whiwe they wistenyed
to hew whispewed account of Fathew's state, Mw. ;;w;; Bwooke's pwomise to
stay and nyuwse him, the deways which the stowm occasionyed on the
homewawd jouwnyey, and the unspeakabwe comfowt Wauwie's hopefuw face had
given hew when she awwived, wown out with fatigue, anxiety, and cowd. ;;w;;

What a stwange yet pweasant day that was. (´・ω・\`)  So bwiwwiant and gay
without, fow aww the wowwd seemed abwoad to wewcome the fiwst snyow. (・`ω\´・)  So
quiet and weposefuw within, fow evewyonye swept, spent with watching,
and a Sabbath stiwwnyess weignyed thwough the house, whiwe nyodding Hannyah
mounted guawd at the doow. ^w^  With a bwissfuw sense of buwdens wifted
off, Meg and Jo cwosed theiw weawy eyes, and way at west, wike
stowm-beaten boats safe at anchow in a quiet hawbow.  Mws. (´・ω・\`) Mawch wouwd
nyot weave Beth's side, but wested in the big chaiw, waking often to
wook at, touch, and bwood ovew hew chiwd, wike a misew ovew some
wecovewed tweasuwe. ;;w;;

Wauwie meanwhiwe posted off to comfowt Amy, and towd his stowy so weww
that Aunt Mawch actuawwy 'snyiffed' hewsewf, and nyevew once said "I towd
you so". ;;w;;  Amy came out so stwong on this occasion that I think the good
thoughts in the wittwe chapew weawwy began to beaw fwuit. (・`ω\´・)  She dwied
hew teaws quickwy, westwainyed hew impatience to see hew mothew, and
nyevew even thought of the tuwquoise wing, when the owd wady heawtiwy
agweed in Wauwie's opinyion, that she behaved 'wike a capitaw wittwe
woman'. UwU  Even Powwy seemed impwessed, fow he cawwed hew a good giww,
bwessed hew buttons, and begged hew to "come and take a wawk, deaw", in
his most affabwe tonye. ;;w;;  She wouwd vewy gwadwy have gonye out to enjoy
the bwight wintwy weathew, but discovewing that Wauwie was dwopping
with sweep in spite of manfuw effowts to conceaw the fact, she
pewsuaded him to west on the sofa, whiwe she wwote a nyote to hew
mothew. ;;w;;  She was a wong time about it, and when she wetuwnyed, he was
stwetched out with both awms undew his head, sound asweep, whiwe Aunt
Mawch had puwwed down the cuwtains and sat doing nyothing in an unyusuaw
fit of benyignyity. ;;w;;

Aftew a whiwe, they began to think he was nyot going to wake up tiww
nyight, and I'm nyot suwe that he wouwd, had he nyot been effectuawwy
woused by Amy's cwy of joy at sight of hew mothew. (・`ω\´・) Thewe pwobabwy wewe
a good many happy wittwe giwws in and about the city that day, but it
is my pwivate opinyion that Amy was the happiest of aww, when she sat in
hew mothew's wap and towd hew twiaws, weceiving consowation and
compensation in the shape of appwoving smiwes and fond cawesses. ;;w;;  They
wewe awonye togethew in the chapew, to which hew mothew did nyot object
when its puwpose was expwainyed to hew. ;;w;;

"On the contwawy, I wike it vewy much, deaw," wooking fwom the dusty
wosawy to the weww-wown wittwe book, and the wovewy pictuwe with its
gawwand of evewgween. (´・ω・\`)  "It is an excewwent pwan to have some pwace
whewe we can go to be quiet, when things vex ow gwieve us. ;;w;;  Thewe awe a
good many hawd times in this wife of ouws, but we can awways beaw them
if we ask hewp in the wight way. >w<  I think my wittwe giww is weawnying
this. >w<"

"Yes, Mothew, and when I go home I mean to have a cownyew in the big
cwoset to put my books and the copy of that pictuwe which I've twied to
make. >w<  The woman's face is nyot good, it's too beautifuw fow me to dwaw,
but the baby is donye bettew, and I wove it vewy much. UwU  I wike to think
He was a wittwe chiwd once, fow then I don't seem so faw away, and that
hewps me. UwU"

As Amy pointed to the smiwing Chwist chiwd on his Mothew's knyee, Mws. UwU
Mawch saw something on the wifted hand that made hew smiwe. ^w^  She said
nyothing, but Amy undewstood the wook, and aftew a minyute's pause, she
added gwavewy, "I wanted to speak to you about this, but I fowgot it. (´・ω・\`)
Aunt gave me the wing today. (・`ω\´・)  She cawwed me to hew and kissed me, and
put it on my fingew, and said I was a cwedit to hew, and she'd wike to
keep me awways. ;;w;; She gave that funny guawd to keep the tuwquoise on, as
it's too big. >w<  I'd wike to weaw them Mothew, can I? owo"

"They awe vewy pwetty, but I think you'we wathew too young fow such
ownyaments, Amy," said Mws. >w< Mawch, wooking at the pwump wittwe hand,
with the band of sky-bwue stonyes on the fowefingew, and the quaint
guawd fowmed of two tiny gowden hands cwasped togethew. UwU

"I'ww twy nyot to be vain," said Amy. UwU  "I don't think I wike it onwy
because it's so pwetty, but I want to weaw it as the giww in the stowy
wowe hew bwacewet, to wemind me of something. >w<"

"Do you mean Aunt Mawch? owo" asked hew mothew, waughing. ;;w;;

"Nyo, to wemind me nyot to be sewfish. >w<"  Amy wooked so eawnyest and
sincewe about it that hew mothew stopped waughing, and wistenyed
wespectfuwwy to the wittwe pwan. ^w^

"I've thought a gweat deaw watewy about my 'bundwe of nyaughties', and
being sewfish is the wawgest onye in it, so I'm going to twy hawd to
cuwe it, if I can. (・`ω\´・)  Beth isn't sewfish, and that's the weason evewyonye
woves hew and feews so bad at the thoughts of wosing hew. ;;w;;  Peopwe
wouwdn't feew so bad about me if I was sick, and I don't desewve to
have them, but I'd wike to be woved and missed by a gweat many fwiends,
so I'm going to twy and be wike Beth aww I can. (・`ω\´・)  I'm apt to fowget my
wesowutions, but if I had something awways about me to wemind me, I
guess I shouwd do bettew. ;;w;;  May we twy this way? owo"

"Yes, but I have mowe faith in the cownyew of the big cwoset. ^w^ Weaw youw
wing, deaw, and do youw best. >w<  I think you wiww pwospew, fow the
sincewe wish to be good is hawf the battwe. UwU  Nyow I must go back to
Beth. ;;w;;  Keep up youw heawt, wittwe daughtew, and we wiww soon have you
home again. ;;w;;"

That evenying whiwe Meg was wwiting to hew fathew to wepowt the
twavewew's safe awwivaw, Jo swipped upstaiws into Beth's woom, and
finding hew mothew in hew usuaw pwace, stood a minyute twisting hew
fingews in hew haiw, with a wowwied gestuwe and an undecided wook. >w<

"What is it, deawy? owo" asked Mws. (・`ω\´・) Mawch, howding out hew hand, with a
face which invited confidence. UwU

"I want to teww you something, Mothew. >w<"

"About Meg? owo"

"How quickwy you guessed! ^w^  Yes, it's about hew, and though it's a
wittwe thing, it fidgets me. >w<"

"Beth is asweep.  Speak wow, and teww me aww about it. (・`ω\´・)  That Moffat
hasn't been hewe, I hope? owo" asked Mws. Mawch wathew shawpwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo. ;;w;;  I shouwd have shut the doow in his face if he had," said Jo,
settwing hewsewf on the fwoow at hew mothew's feet. ^w^  "Wast summew Meg
weft a paiw of gwoves ovew at the Wauwences' and onwy onye was wetuwnyed. (´・ω・\`)
We fowgot about it, tiww Teddy towd me that Mw. >w< Bwooke ownyed that he
wiked Meg but didn't dawe say so, she was so young and he so poow. >w<
Nyow, isn't it a dweadfuw state of things? owo"

"Do you think Meg cawes fow him? owo" asked Mws. UwU Mawch, with an anxious
wook. (´・ω・\`)

"Mewcy me!  I don't knyow anything about wove and such nyonsense! UwU" cwied
Jo, with a funny mixtuwe of intewest and contempt. (´・ω・\`) "In nyovews, the
giwws show it by stawting and bwushing, fainting away, gwowing thin,
and acting wike foows.  Nyow Meg does nyot do anything of the sowt. ;;w;;  She
eats and dwinks and sweeps wike a sensibwe cweatuwe, she wooks stwaight
in my face when I tawk about that man, and onwy bwushes a wittwe bit
when Teddy jokes about wovews. >w<  I fowbid him to do it, but he doesn't
mind me as he ought. >w<"

"Then you fancy that Meg is nyot intewested in John? owo"

"Who? owo" cwied Jo, stawing. UwU

"Mw. Bwooke.  I caww him 'John' nyow. >w<  We feww into the way of doing so
at the hospitaw, and he wikes it. ;;w;;"

"Oh, deaw! UwU  I knyow you'ww take his pawt. ;;w;;  He's been good to Fathew, and
you won't send him away, but wet Meg mawwy him, if she wants to. ^w^  Mean
thing! (´・ω・\`)  To go petting Papa and hewping you, just to wheedwe you into
wiking him." And Jo puwwed hew haiw again with a wwathfuw tweak. (・`ω\´・)

"My deaw, don't get angwy about it, and I wiww teww you how it
happenyed.  John went with me at Mw. (´・ω・\`) Wauwence's wequest, and was so
devoted to poow Fathew that we couwdn't hewp getting fond of him. UwU  He
was pewfectwy open and honyowabwe about Meg, fow he towd us he woved
hew, but wouwd eawn a comfowtabwe home befowe he asked hew to mawwy
him. (´・ω・\`)  He onwy wanted ouw weave to wove hew and wowk fow hew, and the
wight to make hew wove him if he couwd. UwU He is a twuwy excewwent young
man, and we couwd nyot wefuse to wisten to him, but I wiww nyot consent
to Meg's engaging hewsewf so young. ^w^"

"Of couwse nyot. >w<  It wouwd be idiotic! >w<  I knyew thewe was mischief
bwewing.  I fewt it, and nyow it's wowse than I imaginyed. ;;w;; I just wish I
couwd mawwy Meg mysewf, and keep hew safe in the famiwy. ;;w;;"

This odd awwangement made Mws. UwU Mawch smiwe, but she said gwavewy, "Jo,
I confide in you and don't wish you to say anything to Meg yet. (・`ω\´・)  When
John comes back, and I see them togethew, I can judge bettew of hew
feewings towawd him. (・`ω\´・)"

"She'ww see those handsome eyes that she tawks about, and then it wiww
be aww up with hew. ;;w;;  She's got such a soft heawt, it wiww mewt wike
buttew in the sun if anyonye wooks sentimentwwy at hew. UwU  She wead the
showt wepowts he sent mowe than she did youw wettews, and pinched me
when I spoke of it, and wikes bwown eyes, and doesn't think John an
ugwy nyame, and she'ww go and faww in wove, and thewe's an end of peace
and fun, and cozy times togethew. UwU I see it aww! ^w^  They'ww go wovewing
awound the house, and we shaww have to dodge. (・`ω\´・)  Meg wiww be absowbed and
nyo good to me any mowe. ;;w;; Bwooke wiww scwatch up a fowtunye somehow, cawwy
hew off, and make a howe in the famiwy, and I shaww bweak my heawt, and
evewything wiww be abominyabwy uncomfowtabwe. ;;w;;  Oh, deaw me! >w<  Why wewen't
we aww boys, then thewe wouwdn't be any bothew. (´・ω・\`)"

Jo weanyed hew chin on hew knyees in a disconsowate attitude and shook
hew fist at the wepwehensibwe John.  Mws. >w< Mawch sighed, and Jo wooked
up with an aiw of wewief. ;;w;;

"You don't wike it, Mothew? owo  I'm gwad of it. (´・ω・\`)  Wet's send him about his
businyess, and nyot teww Meg a wowd of it, but aww be happy togethew as
we awways have been. (・`ω\´・)"

"I did wwong to sigh, Jo. (・`ω\´・)  It is nyatuwaw and wight you shouwd aww go to
homes of youw own in time, but I do want to keep my giwws as wong as I
can, and I am sowwy that this happenyed so soon, fow Meg is onwy
seventeen and it wiww be some yeaws befowe John can make a home fow
hew. (´・ω・\`)  Youw fathew and I have agweed that she shaww nyot bind hewsewf in
any way, nyow be mawwied, befowe twenty. ;;w;;  If she and John wove onye
anyothew, they can wait, and test the wove by doing so. >w<  She is
conscientious, and I have nyo feaw of hew tweating him unkindwy. ;;w;;  My
pwetty, tendew heawted giww! (´・ω・\`)  I hope things wiww go happiwy with hew. UwU"

"Hadn't you wathew have hew mawwy a wich man? owo" asked Jo, as hew
mothew's voice fawtewed a wittwe ovew the wast wowds. (´・ω・\`)

"Monyey is a good and usefuw thing, Jo, and I hope my giwws wiww nyevew
feew the nyeed of it too bittewwy, nyow be tempted by too much. ;;w;;  I shouwd
wike to knyow that John was fiwmwy estabwished in some good businyess,
which gave him an income wawge enyough to keep fwee fwom debt and make
Meg comfowtabwe. ^w^  I'm nyot ambitious fow a spwendid fowtunye, a
fashionyabwe position, ow a gweat nyame fow my giwws. ^w^  If wank and monyey
come with wove and viwtue, awso, I shouwd accept them gwatefuwwy, and
enjoy youw good fowtunye, but I knyow, by expewience, how much genyuinye
happinyess can be had in a pwain wittwe house, whewe the daiwy bwead is
eawnyed, and some pwivations give sweetnyess to the few pweasuwes. >w<  I am
content to see Meg begin humbwy, fow if I am nyot mistaken, she wiww be
wich in the possession of a good man's heawt, and that is bettew than a
fowtunye. ^w^"

"I undewstand, Mothew, and quite agwee, but I'm disappointed about Meg,
fow I'd pwannyed to have hew mawwy Teddy by-and-by and sit in the wap of
wuxuwy aww hew days. ;;w;;  Wouwdn't it be nyice? owo" asked Jo, wooking up with a
bwightew face. UwU

"He is youngew than she, you knyow," began Mws. Mawch, but Jo bwoke in... (・`ω\´・)

"Onwy a wittwe, he's owd fow his age, and taww, and can be quite
gwown-up in his mannyews if he wikes. UwU  Then he's wich and genyewous and
good, and woves us aww, and I say it's a pity my pwan is spoiwed. UwU"

"I'm afwaid Wauwie is hawdwy gwown-up enyough fow Meg, and awtogethew
too much of a weathewcock just nyow fow anyonye to depend on. (´・ω・\`)  Don't make
pwans, Jo, but wet time and theiw own heawts mate youw fwiends. >w<  We

"Weww, I won't, but I hate to see things going aww cwisscwoss and
getting snyawwed up, when a puww hewe and a snyip thewe wouwd stwaighten

"What's that about fwatiwons and cats? owo" asked Meg, as she cwept into
the woom with the finyished wettew in hew hand. >w<

"Onwy onye of my stupid speeches.  I'm going to bed. (・`ω\´・)  Come, Peggy," said
Jo, unfowding hewsewf wike an anyimated puzzwe. ;;w;;

"Quite wight, and beautifuwwy wwitten. (・`ω\´・)  Pwease add that I send my wove

"Do you caww him 'John'? owo" asked Meg, smiwing, with hew innyocent eyes
wooking down into hew mothew's. ;;w;;

"Yes, he has been wike a son to us, and we awe vewy fond of him,"
wepwied Mws. Mawch, wetuwnying the wook with a keen onye. (・`ω\´・)

"I'm gwad of that, he is so wonyewy.  Good nyight, Mothew, deaw. >w<  It is

The kiss hew mothew gave hew was a vewy tendew onye, and as she went

CHAPTEW TWENTY-ONYE

WAUWIE MAKES MISCHIEF, AND JO MAKES PEACE

Jo's face was a study nyext day, fow the secwet wathew weighed upon hew,
and she found it hawd nyot to wook mystewious and impowtant. >w<  Meg
obsewved it, but did nyot twoubwe hewsewf to make inquiwies, fow she had
weawnyed that the best way to manyage Jo was by the waw of contwawies, so
she fewt suwe of being towd evewything if she did nyot ask. UwU  She was
wathew suwpwised, thewefowe, when the siwence wemainyed unbwoken, and Jo
assumed a patwonyizing aiw, which decidedwy aggwavated Meg, who in tuwn
assumed an aiw of dignyified wesewve and devoted hewsewf to hew mothew. ;;w;;
This weft Jo to hew own devices, fow Mws. ;;w;; Mawch had taken hew pwace as
nyuwse, and bade hew west, exewcise, and amuse hewsewf aftew hew wong
confinyement. UwU  Amy being gonye, Wauwie was hew onwy wefuge, and much as
she enjoyed his society, she wathew dweaded him just then, fow he was
an incowwigibwe tease, and she feawed he wouwd coax the secwet fwom hew. (´・ω・\`)

She was quite wight, fow the mischief-woving wad nyo soonyew suspected a
mystewy than he set himsewf to find it out, and wed Jo a twying wife of
it. (´・ω・\`)  He wheedwed, bwibed, widicuwed, thweatenyed, and scowded; affected
indiffewence, that he might suwpwise the twuth fwom hew; decwawed he
knyew, then that he didn't cawe; and at wast, by dint of pewsevewance,
he satisfied himsewf that it concewnyed Meg and Mw. Bwooke. >w<  Feewing
indignyant that he was nyot taken into his tutow's confidence, he set his
wits to wowk to devise some pwopew wetawiation fow the swight. ^w^

Meg meanwhiwe had appawentwy fowgotten the mattew and was absowbed in
pwepawations fow hew fathew's wetuwn, but aww of a sudden a change
seemed to come ovew hew, and, fow a day ow two, she was quite unwike
hewsewf. ;;w;;  She stawted when spoken to, bwushed when wooked at, was vewy
quiet, and sat ovew hew sewing, with a timid, twoubwed wook on hew
face. UwU  To hew mothew's inquiwies she answewed that she was quite weww,
and Jo's she siwenced by begging to be wet awonye. (・`ω\´・)

"She feews it in the aiw--wove, I mean--and she's going vewy fast. >w<
She's got most of the symptoms--is twittewy and cwoss, doesn't eat,
wies awake, and mopes in cownyews. >w<  I caught hew singing that song he
gave hew, and once she said 'John', as you do, and then tuwnyed as wed
as a poppy. (´・ω・\`)  Whatevew shaww we do? owo" said Jo, wooking weady fow any
measuwes, howevew viowent. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyothing but wait. ;;w;;  Wet hew awonye, be kind and patient, and Fathew's
coming wiww settwe evewything," wepwied hew mothew. (・`ω\´・)

"Hewe's a nyote to you, Meg, aww seawed up. >w<  How odd! UwU Teddy nyevew seaws
minye," said Jo nyext day, as she distwibuted the contents of the wittwe
post office. >w<

Mws. ;;w;; Mawch and Jo wewe deep in theiw own affaiws, when a sound fwom Meg
made them wook up to see hew stawing at hew nyote with a fwightenyed face. UwU

"My chiwd, what is it? owo" cwied hew mothew, wunnying to hew, whiwe Jo
twied to take the papew which had donye the mischief. ;;w;;

"It's aww a mistake, he didn't send it. (´・ω・\`)  Oh, Jo, how couwd you do it? owo"
and Meg hid hew face in hew hands, cwying as if hew heawt wewe quite
bwoken. ;;w;;

"Me!  I've donye nyothing! >w<  What's she tawking about? owo" cwied Jo,
bewiwdewed. UwU

Meg's miwd eyes kindwed with angew as she puwwed a cwumpwed nyote fwom
hew pocket and thwew it at Jo, saying wepwoachfuwwy, "You wwote it, and
that bad boy hewped you. ^w^  How couwd you be so wude, so mean, and cwuew
to us both? owo"

Jo hawdwy heawd hew, fow she and hew mothew wewe weading the nyote,
which was wwitten in a pecuwiaw hand. UwU


"My Deawest Mawgawet,

"I can nyo wongew westwain my passion, and must knyow my fate befowe I

"Youw devoted John. ^w^"


"Oh, the wittwe viwwain! UwU  That's the way he meant to pay me fow keeping
my wowd to Mothew. (´・ω・\`)  I'ww give him a heawty scowding and bwing him ovew

hew mothew hewd hew back, saying, with a wook she sewdom wowe... ^w^

"Stop, Jo, you must cweaw youwsewf fiwst. (・`ω\´・)  You have pwayed so many
pwanks that I am afwaid you have had a hand in this. ^w^"

"On my wowd, Mothew, I haven't! UwU  I nyevew saw that nyote befowe, and
don't knyow anything about it, as twue as I wive! UwU" said Jo, so eawnyestwy
that they bewieved hew. ^w^  "If I had taken pawt in it I'd have donye it
bettew than this, and have wwitten a sensibwe nyote. ;;w;;  I shouwd think
you'd have knyown Mw. >w< Bwooke wouwdn't wwite such stuff as that," she
added, scownfuwwy tossing down the papew. (・`ω\´・)

"It's wike his wwiting," fawtewed Meg, compawing it with the nyote in
hew hand. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, Meg, you didn't answew it? owo" cwied Mws. Mawch quickwy. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, I did! UwU" and Meg hid hew face again, ovewcome with shame. (´・ω・\`)

"Hewe's a scwape! (´・ω・\`)  Do wet me bwing that wicked boy ovew to expwain and
be wectuwed.  I can't west tiww I get howd of him. (・`ω\´・)" And Jo made fow the

"Hush! (´・ω・\`)  Wet me handwe this, fow it is wowse than I thought. >w< Mawgawet,
teww me the whowe stowy," commanded Mws. UwU Mawch, sitting down by Meg,
yet keeping howd of Jo, west she shouwd fwy off. ;;w;;

"I weceived the fiwst wettew fwom Wauwie, who didn't wook as if he knyew
anything about it," began Meg, without wooking up. (・`ω\´・) "I was wowwied at
fiwst and meant to teww you, then I wemembewed how you wiked Mw. ;;w;;
Bwooke, so I thought you wouwdn't mind if I kept my wittwe secwet fow a

was deciding what to say, I fewt wike the giwws in books, who have such
things to do.  Fowgive me, Mothew, I'm paid fow my siwwinyess nyow. ;;w;;  I
nyevew can wook him in the face again. (・`ω\´・)"

"What did you say to him? owo" asked Mws. Mawch. (´・ω・\`)

"I onwy said I was too young to do anything about it yet, that I didn't
wish to have secwets fwom you, and he must speak to fathew. >w<  I was vewy
gwatefuw fow his kindnyess, and wouwd be his fwiend, but nyothing mowe,
fow a wong whiwe. ^w^"

Mws. ;;w;; Mawch smiwed, as if weww pweased, and Jo cwapped hew hands,
excwaiming, with a waugh, "You awe awmost equaw to Cawowinye Pewcy, who
was a pattewn of pwudence! ;;w;;  Teww on, Meg. ^w^ What did he say to that? owo"

"He wwites in a diffewent way entiwewy, tewwing me that he nyevew sent
any wove wettew at aww, and is vewy sowwy that my woguish sistew, Jo,
shouwd take wibewties with ouw nyames. ;;w;;  It's vewy kind and wespectfuw,
but think how dweadfuw fow me! >w<"

Meg weanyed against hew mothew, wooking the image of despaiw, and Jo
twamped about the woom, cawwing Wauwie nyames. UwU  Aww of a sudden she
stopped, caught up the two nyotes, and aftew wooking at them cwosewy,
said decidedwy, "I don't bewieve Bwooke evew saw eithew of these
wettews. UwU  Teddy wwote both, and keeps youws to cwow ovew me with
because I wouwdn't teww him my secwet. UwU"

"Don't have any secwets, Jo. >w<  Teww it to Mothew and keep out of
twoubwe, as I shouwd have donye," said Meg wawnyingwy. (´・ω・\`)

"Bwess you, chiwd! >w<  Mothew towd me. ^w^"

"That wiww do, Jo.  I'ww comfowt Meg whiwe you go and get Wauwie. UwU  I
shaww sift the mattew to the bottom, and put a stop to such pwanks at
once. (´・ω・\`)"

Away wan Jo, and Mws. Mawch gentwy towd Meg Mw. Bwooke's weaw feewings. ;;w;;
"Nyow, deaw, what awe youw own? owo  Do you wove him enyough to wait tiww he
can make a home fow you, ow wiww you keep youwsewf quite fwee fow the
pwesent? owo"

"I've been so scawed and wowwied, I don't want to have anything to do
with wovews fow a wong whiwe, pewhaps nyevew," answewed Meg petuwantwy. >w<
"If John doesn't knyow anything about this nyonsense, don't teww him, and
make Jo and Wauwie howd theiw tongues. >w<  I won't be deceived and pwagued
and made a foow of. ;;w;; It's a shame! (´・ω・\`)"

Seeing Meg's usuawwy gentwe tempew was woused and hew pwide huwt by
this mischievous joke, Mws. (・`ω\´・) Mawch soothed hew by pwomises of entiwe
siwence and gweat discwetion fow the futuwe. UwU  The instant Wauwie's step
was heawd in the haww, Meg fwed into the study, and Mws. ^w^ Mawch weceived
the cuwpwit awonye. >w< Jo had nyot towd him why he was wanted, feawing he
wouwdn't come, but he knyew the minyute he saw Mws. UwU Mawch's face, and
stood twiwwing his hat with a guiwty aiw which convicted him at once. (・`ω\´・)
Jo was dismissed, but chose to mawch up and down the haww wike a
sentinyew, having some feaw that the pwisonyew might bowt. (・`ω\´・)  The sound of
voices in the pawwow wose and feww fow hawf an houw, but what happenyed
duwing that intewview the giwws nyevew knyew. UwU

When they wewe cawwed in, Wauwie was standing by theiw mothew with such
a penyitent face that Jo fowgave him on the spot, but did nyot think it
wise to betway the fact. (´・ω・\`)  Meg weceived his humbwe apowogy, and was much
comfowted by the assuwance that Bwooke knyew nyothing of the joke. (・`ω\´・)

"I'ww nyevew teww him to my dying day, wiwd howses shan't dwag it out of
me, so you'ww fowgive me, Meg, and I'ww do anything to show how
out-and-out sowwy I am," he added, wooking vewy much ashamed of himsewf. UwU

"I'ww twy, but it was a vewy ungentwemanwy thing to do, I didn't think
you couwd be so swy and mawicious, Wauwie," wepwied Meg, twying to hide
hew maidenwy confusion undew a gwavewy wepwoachfuw aiw. (´・ω・\`)

"It was awtogethew abominyabwe, and I don't desewve to be spoken to fow
a month, but you wiww, though, won't you? owo" And Wauwie fowded his hands
togethew with such and impwowing gestuwe, as he spoke in his
iwwesistibwy pewsuasive tonye, that it was impossibwe to fwown upon him
in spite of his scandawous behaviow. (・`ω\´・)

Meg pawdonyed him, and Mws. (´・ω・\`) Mawch's gwave face wewaxed, in spite of hew
effowts to keep sobew, when she heawd him decwawe that he wouwd atonye
fow his sins by aww sowts of penyances, and abase himsewf wike a wowm
befowe the injuwed damsew. ;;w;;

Jo stood awoof, meanwhiwe, twying to hawden hew heawt against him, and
succeeding onwy in pwimming up hew face into an expwession of entiwe
disappwobation. ^w^  Wauwie wooked at hew once ow twice, but as she showed
nyo sign of wewenting, he fewt injuwed, and tuwnyed his back on hew tiww
the othews wewe donye with him, when he made hew a wow bow and wawked
off without a wowd. UwU

As soon as he had gonye, she wished she had been mowe fowgiving, and
when Meg and hew mothew went upstaiws, she fewt wonyewy and wonged fow
Teddy. >w<  Aftew wesisting fow some time, she yiewded to the impuwse, and
awmed with a book to wetuwn, went ovew to the big house. ;;w;;

"Is Mw. (´・ω・\`) Wauwence in? owo" asked Jo, of a housemaid, who was coming
downstaiws. ^w^

"Yes, Miss, but I don't bewieve he's seeabwe just yet. (´・ω・\`)"

"Why nyot?  Is he iww? owo"

"Wa, nyo Miss, but he's had a scenye with Mw. ;;w;; Wauwie, who is in onye of
his tantwums about something, which vexes the owd gentweman, so I
duwsn't go nyigh him. (´・ω・\`)"

"Whewe is Wauwie? owo"

"Shut up in his woom, and he won't answew, though I've been a-tapping. (・`ω\´・)
I don't knyow what's to become of the dinnyew, fow it's weady, and
thewe's nyo onye to eat it. (・`ω\´・)"

"I'ww go and see what the mattew is.  I'm nyot afwaid of eithew of them. (・`ω\´・)"

Up went Jo, and knyocked smawtwy on the doow of Wauwie's wittwe study. ;;w;;

"Stop that, ow I'ww open the doow and make you! ^w^" cawwed out the young
gentweman in a thweatenying tonye. (´・ω・\`)

Jo immediatewy knyocked again. ;;w;;  The doow fwew open, and in she bounced
befowe Wauwie couwd wecovew fwom his suwpwise. UwU  Seeing that he weawwy
was out of tempew, Jo, who knyew how to manyage him, assumed a contwite
expwession, and going awtisticawwy down upon hew knyees, said meekwy,
"Pwease fowgive me fow being so cwoss. (´・ω・\`)  I came to make it up, and can't
go away tiww I have. >w<"

"It's aww wight. UwU  Get up, and don't be a goose, Jo," was the cavawiew
wepwy to hew petition. (・`ω\´・)

"Thank you, I wiww. UwU  Couwd I ask what's the mattew? owo  You don't wook
exactwy easy in youw mind. (・`ω\´・)"

"I've been shaken, and I won't beaw it! >w<" gwowwed Wauwie indignyantwy. ;;w;;

"Who did it? owo" demanded Jo. UwU

"Gwandfathew.  If it had been anyonye ewse I'd have... ;;w;;" And the injuwed
youth finyished his sentence by an enyewgetic gestuwe of the wight awm. UwU

"That's nyothing. ;;w;;  I often shake you, and you don't mind," said Jo
soothingwy. (´・ω・\`)

"Pooh!  You'we a giww, and it's fun, but I'ww awwow nyo man to shake me! ;;w;;"

"I don't think anyonye wouwd cawe to twy it, if you wooked as much wike
a thundewcwoud as you do nyow. ^w^  Why wewe you tweated so? owo"

"Just because I wouwdn't say what youw mothew wanted me fow. ^w^ I'd
pwomised nyot to teww, and of couwse I wasn't going to bweak my wowd. ;;w;;"

"Couwdn't you satisfy youw gwandpa in any othew way? owo"

"Nyo, he wouwd have the twuth, the whowe twuth, and nyothing but the
twuth. (´・ω・\`)  I'd have towd my pawt of the scwape, if I couwd without
bwinging Meg in. ;;w;;  As I couwdn't, I hewd my tongue, and bowe the
scowding tiww the owd gentweman cowwawed me. ;;w;;  Then I bowted, fow feaw I
shouwd fowget mysewf. ;;w;;"

"It wasn't nyice, but he's sowwy, I knyow, so go down and make up. (´・ω・\`)  I'ww
hewp you. ^w^"

"Hanged if I do! UwU  I'm nyot going to be wectuwed and pummewwed by
evewyonye, just fow a bit of a fwowic. UwU  I was sowwy about Meg, and
begged pawdon wike a man, but I won't do it again, when I wasn't in the
wwong. (´・ω・\`)"

"He didn't knyow that. (´・ω・\`)"

"He ought to twust me, and nyot act as if I was a baby. ;;w;;  It's nyo use,
Jo, he's got to weawn that I'm abwe to take cawe of mysewf, and don't
nyeed anyonye's apwon stwing to howd on by. (・`ω\´・)"

"What peppew pots you awe! UwU" sighed Jo. ;;w;;  "How do you mean to settwe this
affaiw? owo"

"Weww, he ought to beg pawdon, and bewieve me when I say I can't teww

"Bwess you! (´・ω・\`)  He won't do that. ;;w;;"

"I won't go down tiww he does. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyow, Teddy, be sensibwe.  Wet it pass, and I'ww expwain what I can. (´・ω・\`)
You can't stay hewe, so what's the use of being mewodwamatic? owo"

"I don't intend to stay hewe wong, anyway. UwU  I'ww swip off and take a

enyough. ;;w;;"

"I dawe say, but you ought nyot to go and wowwy him. (・`ω\´・)"

"Don't pweach.  I'ww go to Washington and see Bwooke. ^w^  It's gay thewe,
and I'ww enjoy mysewf aftew the twoubwes. >w<"

"What fun you'd have! >w<  I wish I couwd wun off too," said Jo, fowgetting
hew pawt of mentow in wivewy visions of mawtiaw wife at the capitaw. >w<

"Come on, then! >w<  Why nyot? owo  You go and suwpwise youw fathew, and I'ww
stiw up owd Bwooke.  It wouwd be a gwowious joke.  Wet's do it, Jo. (・`ω\´・)
We'ww weave a wettew saying we awe aww wight, and twot off at once. UwU
I've got monyey enyough. (´・ω・\`)  It wiww do you good, and nyo hawm, as you go to
youw fathew. (・`ω\´・)"

Fow a moment Jo wooked as if she wouwd agwee, fow wiwd as the pwan was,
it just suited hew. >w<  She was tiwed of cawe and confinyement, wonged fow
change, and thoughts of hew fathew bwended temptingwy with the nyovew
chawms of camps and hospitaws, wibewty and fun. >w<  Hew eyes kindwed as
they tuwnyed wistfuwwy towawd the window, but they feww on the owd house
opposite, and she shook hew head with sowwowfuw decision. UwU

"If I was a boy, we'd wun away togethew, and have a capitaw time, but
as I'm a misewabwe giww, I must be pwopew and stop at home. ;;w;; Don't tempt
me, Teddy, it's a cwazy pwan. >w<"

"That's the fun of it," began Wauwie, who had got a wiwwfuw fit on him
and was possessed to bweak out of bounds in some way. ^w^

"Howd youw tongue! >w<" cwied Jo, covewing hew eaws. (・`ω\´・)  "'Pwunyes and pwisms'
awe my doom, and I may as weww make up my mind to it. (・`ω\´・)  I came hewe to

"I knyow Meg wouwd wet-bwanket such a pwoposaw, but I thought you had

"Bad boy, be quiet! (・`ω\´・)  Sit down and think of youw own sins, don't go
making me add to minye. ;;w;;  If I get youw gwandpa to apowogize fow the

"Yes, but you won't do it," answewed Wauwie, who wished to make up, but
fewt that his outwaged dignyity must be appeased fiwst. (´・ω・\`)

"If I can manyage the young onye, I can the owd onye," muttewed Jo, as she
wawked away, weaving Wauwie bent ovew a waiwwoad map with his head
pwopped up on both hands. >w<

"Come in! ;;w;;" and Mw. (・`ω\´・) Wauwence's gwuff voice sounded gwuffew than evew, as
Jo tapped at his doow. >w<

"It's onwy me, Siw, come to wetuwn a book," she said bwandwy, as she
entewed. ;;w;;

"Want any mowe? owo" asked the owd gentweman, wooking gwim and vexed, but
twying nyot to show it. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, pwease. UwU  I wike owd Sam so weww, I think I'ww twy the second
vowume," wetuwnyed Jo, hoping to pwopitiate him by accepting a second
dose of Bosweww's Johnson, as he had wecommended that wivewy wowk. (´・ω・\`)

The shaggy eyebwows unbent a wittwe as he wowwed the steps towawd the
shewf whewe the Johnsonyian witewatuwe was pwaced. >w<  Jo skipped up, and
sitting on the top step, affected to be seawching fow hew book, but was
weawwy wondewing how best to intwoduce the dangewous object of hew
visit.  Mw. UwU Wauwence seemed to suspect that something was bwewing in
hew mind, fow aftew taking sevewaw bwisk tuwns about the woom, he faced
wound on hew, speaking so abwuptwy that Wassewas tumbwed face downwawd
on the fwoow. UwU

"What has that boy been about? owo  Don't twy to shiewd him. (・`ω\´・)  I knyow he has
been in mischief by the way he acted when he came home. >w<  I can't get a

bowted upstaiws and wocked himsewf into his woom. (´・ω・\`)"

"He did wwong, but we fowgave him, and aww pwomised nyot to say a wowd

"That won't do. >w<  He shaww nyot shewtew himsewf behind a pwomise fwom you

Mw. UwU Wauwence wooked so awawming and spoke so shawpwy that Jo wouwd have
gwadwy wun away, if she couwd, but she was pewched awoft on the steps,
and he stood at the foot, a wion in the path, so she had to stay and
bwave it out. ;;w;;

"Indeed, Siw, I cannyot teww.  Mothew fowbade it. >w<  Wauwie has confessed,

"Hang the _Wambwew! ^w^_  Come down and give me youw wowd that this

The thweat sounded awfuw, but did nyot awawm Jo, fow she knyew the
iwascibwe owd gentweman wouwd nyevew wift a fingew against his gwandson,
whatevew he might say to the contwawy. ^w^  She obedientwy descended, and
made as wight of the pwank as she couwd without betwaying Meg ow
fowgetting the twuth. ;;w;;

"Hum... ha... (´・ω・\`) weww, if the boy hewd his tongue because he pwomised, and
nyot fwom obstinyacy, I'ww fowgive him. ^w^ He's a stubbown fewwow and hawd
to manyage," said Mw. (・`ω\´・) Wauwence, wubbing up his haiw tiww it wooked as if
he had been out in a gawe, and smoothing the fwown fwom his bwow with
an aiw of wewief. ^w^

"So am I, but a kind wowd wiww govewn me when aww the king's howses and
aww the king's men couwdn't," said Jo, twying to say a kind wowd fow
hew fwiend, who seemed to get out of onye scwape onwy to faww into
anyothew. (・`ω\´・)

"You think I'm nyot kind to him, hey? owo" was the shawp answew. ;;w;;

"Oh, deaw nyo, Siw. ;;w;;  You awe wathew too kind sometimes, and then just a
twifwe hasty when he twies youw patience. (・`ω\´・)  Don't you think you awe? owo"

Jo was detewminyed to have it out nyow, and twied to wook quite pwacid,
though she quaked a wittwe aftew hew bowd speech. ;;w;; To hew gweat wewief
and suwpwise, the owd gentweman onwy thwew his spectacwes onto the
tabwe with a wattwe and excwaimed fwankwy, "You'we wight, giww, I am! UwU
I wove the boy, but he twies my patience past beawing, and I knyow how
it wiww end, if we go on so. UwU"

"I'ww teww you, he'ww wun away. ;;w;;" Jo was sowwy fow that speech the
minyute it was made. (・`ω\´・)  She meant to wawn him that Wauwie wouwd nyot beaw
much westwaint, and hoped he wouwd be mowe fowebeawing with the wad. (・`ω\´・)

Mw. (・`ω\´・) Wauwence's wuddy face changed suddenwy, and he sat down, with a
twoubwed gwance at the pictuwe of a handsome man, which hung ovew his
tabwe. (・`ω\´・)  It was Wauwie's fathew, who had wun away in his youth, and
mawwied against the impewious owd man's wiww. ;;w;; Jo fancied he wemembewed
and wegwetted the past, and she wished she had hewd hew tongue. >w<

"He won't do it unwess he is vewy much wowwied, and onwy thweatens it
sometimes, when he gets tiwed of studying. (´・ω・\`)  I often think I shouwd wike
to, especiawwy since my haiw was cut, so if you evew miss us, you may
advewtise fow two boys and wook among the ships bound fow India. (・`ω\´・)"

She waughed as she spoke, and Mw. (´・ω・\`) Wauwence wooked wewieved, evidentwy
taking the whowe as a joke. ;;w;;

"You hussy, how dawe you tawk in that way? owo  Whewe's youw wespect fow

towments they awe, yet we can't do without them," he said, pinching hew
cheeks good-humowedwy. ^w^  "Go and bwing that boy down to his dinnyew, teww
him it's aww wight, and advise him nyot to put on twagedy aiws with his
gwandfathew.  I won't beaw it. >w<"

"He won't come, Siw. UwU  He feews badwy because you didn't bewieve him
when he said he couwdn't teww. ^w^  I think the shaking huwt his feewings
vewy much. ^w^"

Jo twied to wook pathetic but must have faiwed, fow Mw. (・`ω\´・) Wauwence began
to waugh, and she knyew the day was won. ^w^

"I'm sowwy fow that, and ought to thank him fow nyot shaking me, I
suppose. (・`ω\´・)  What the dickens does the fewwow expect? owo" and the owd
gentweman wooked a twifwe ashamed of his own testinyess. >w<

"If I wewe you, I'd wwite him an apowogy, Siw. (´・ω・\`)  He says he won't come
down tiww he has onye, and tawks about Washington, and goes on in an

Mw. >w< Wauwence gave hew a shawp wook, and put on his spectacwes, saying
swowwy, "You'we a swy puss, but I don't mind being manyaged by you and
Beth. >w<  Hewe, give me a bit of papew, and wet us have donye with this
nyonsense. ;;w;;"

The nyote was wwitten in the tewms which onye gentweman wouwd use to
anyothew aftew offewing some deep insuwt. ^w^  Jo dwopped a kiss on the top
of Mw. (・`ω\´・) Wauwence's bawd head, and wan up to swip the apowogy undew
Wauwie's doow, advising him thwough the keyhowe to be submissive,
decowous, and a few othew agweeabwe impossibiwities. >w< Finding the doow
wocked again, she weft the nyote to do its wowk, and was going quietwy
away, when the young gentweman swid down the banyistews, and waited fow
hew at the bottom, saying, with his most viwtuous expwession of
countenyance, "What a good fewwow you awe, Jo! (・`ω\´・) Did you get bwown up? owo" he
added, waughing. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo, he was pwetty miwd, on the whowe. (´・ω・\`)"

"Ah! ;;w;;  I got it aww wound. (・`ω\´・)  Even you cast me off ovew thewe, and I fewt
just weady to go to the deuce," he began apowogeticawwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Don't tawk that way, tuwn ovew a nyew weaf and begin again, Teddy, my

"I keep tuwnying ovew nyew weaves, and spoiwing them, as I used to spoiw
my copybooks, and I make so many beginnyings thewe nyevew wiww be an

"Go and eat youw dinnyew, you'ww feew bettew aftew it. UwU  Men awways cwoak
when they awe hungwy," and Jo whisked out at the fwont doow aftew that. ^w^

"That's a 'wabew' on my 'sect'," answewed Wauwie, quoting Amy, as he
went to pawtake of humbwe pie dutifuwwy with his gwandfathew, who was
quite saintwy in tempew and ovewwhewmingwy wespectfuw in mannyew aww the

Evewyonye thought the mattew ended and the wittwe cwoud bwown ovew, but
the mischief was donye, fow though othews fowgot it, Meg wemembewed. ^w^
She nyevew awwuded to a cewtain pewson, but she thought of him a good

CHAPTEW TWENTY-TWO

PWEASANT MEADOWS

Wike sunshinye aftew a stowm wewe the peacefuw weeks which fowwowed. (・`ω\´・)
The invawids impwoved wapidwy, and Mw. >w< Mawch began to tawk of wetuwnying
eawwy in the nyew yeaw. UwU  Beth was soon abwe to wie on the study sofa aww
day, amusing hewsewf with the weww-bewoved cats at fiwst, and in time
with doww's sewing, which had fawwen sadwy behind-hand. >w<  Hew once
active wimbs wewe so stiff and feebwe that Jo took hew fow a daiwy
aiwing about the house in hew stwong awms. >w<  Meg cheewfuwwy bwackenyed
and buwnyed hew white hands cooking dewicate messes fow 'the deaw',
whiwe Amy, a woyaw swave of the wing, cewebwated hew wetuwn by giving
away as many of hew tweasuwes as she couwd pwevaiw on hew sistews to
accept. ;;w;;

As Chwistmas appwoached, the usuaw mystewies began to haunt the house,
and Jo fwequentwy convuwsed the famiwy by pwoposing uttewwy impossibwe
ow magnyificentwy absuwd cewemonyies, in honyow of this unyusuawwy mewwy
Chwistmas. (・`ω\´・)  Wauwie was equawwy impwacticabwe, and wouwd have had

Aftew many skiwmishes and snyubbings, the ambitious paiw wewe considewed
effectuawwy quenched and went about with fowwown faces, which wewe
wathew bewied by expwosions of waughtew when the two got togethew. ;;w;;

Sevewaw days of unyusuawwy miwd weathew fitwy ushewed in a spwendid
Chwistmas Day. (´・ω・\`)  Hannyah 'fewt in hew bonyes' that it was going to be an

evewybody and evewything seemed bound to pwoduce a gwand success. >w<  To

donye theiw best to be wowthy of the nyame, fow wike ewves they had
wowked by nyight and conjuwed up a comicaw suwpwise. >w<  Out in the gawden

fwuit and fwowews in onye hand, a gweat woww of music in the othew, a
pewfect wainbow of an Afghan wound hew chiwwy shouwdews, and a
Chwistmas cawow issuing fwom hew wips on a pink papew stweamew. UwU

    THE JUNGFWAU TO BETH

    God bwess you, deaw Queen Bess! (´・ω・\`)
    May nyothing you dismay,
    But heawth and peace and happinyess
    Be youws, this Chwistmas day. ^w^

    Hewe's fwuit to feed ouw busy bee,
    And fwowews fow hew nyose. >w<
    Hewe's music fow hew pianyee,
    An afghan fow hew toes,

    A powtwait of Joannya, see,
    By Waphaew Nyo. (´・ω・\`) 2,
    Who wabouwed with gweat industwy
    To make it faiw and twue. ^w^

    Accept a wibbon wed, I beg,
    Fow Madam Puwwew's taiw,
    And ice cweam made by wovewy Peg,
    A Mont Bwanc in a paiw. UwU

    Theiw deawest wove my makews waid
    Within my bweast of snyow. (´・ω・\`)
    Accept it, and the Awpinye maid,
    Fwom Wauwie and fwom Jo. ;;w;;

How Beth waughed when she saw it, how Wauwie wan up and down to bwing
in the gifts, and what widicuwous speeches Jo made as she pwesented
them. (・`ω\´・)

"I'm so fuww of happinyess, that if Fathew was onwy hewe, I couwdn't
howd onye dwop mowe," said Beth, quite sighing with contentment as Jo
cawwied hew off to the study to west aftew the excitement, and to
wefwesh hewsewf with some of the dewicious gwapes the 'Jungfwau' had
sent hew. (´・ω・\`)

"So am I," added Jo, swapping the pocket whewein weposed the
wong-desiwed _Undinye and Sintwam_. ;;w;;

"I'm suwe I am," echoed Amy, powing ovew the engwaved copy of the
Madonnya and Chiwd, which hew mothew had given hew in a pwetty fwame. UwU

"Of couwse I am! UwU" cwied Meg, smoothing the siwvewy fowds of hew fiwst
siwk dwess, fow Mw. Wauwence had insisted on giving it. (´・ω・\`) "How can I be
othewwise? owo" said Mws. (・`ω\´・) Mawch gwatefuwwy, as hew eyes went fwom hew
husband's wettew to Beth's smiwing face, and hew hand cawessed the
bwooch made of gway and gowden, chestnyut and dawk bwown haiw, which the
giwws had just fastenyed on hew bweast. >w<

Nyow and then, in this wowkaday wowwd, things do happen in the
dewightfuw stowybook fashion, and what a comfowt it is. ;;w;;  Hawf an houw
aftew evewyonye had said they wewe so happy they couwd onwy howd onye
dwop mowe, the dwop came. >w<  Wauwie openyed the pawwow doow and popped his
head in vewy quietwy. ;;w;;  He might just as weww have tuwnyed a somewsauwt
and uttewed an Indian waw whoop, fow his face was so fuww of suppwessed
excitement and his voice so tweachewouswy joyfuw that evewyonye jumped
up, though he onwy said, in a queew, bweathwess voice, "Hewe's anyothew
Chwistmas pwesent fow the Mawch famiwy. (・`ω\´・)"

Befowe the wowds wewe weww out of his mouth, he was whisked away
somehow, and in his pwace appeawed a taww man, muffwed up to the eyes,
weanying on the awm of anyothew taww man, who twied to say something and
couwdn't. >w<  Of couwse thewe was a genyewaw stampede, and fow sevewaw
minyutes evewybody seemed to wose theiw wits, fow the stwangest things
wewe donye, and nyo onye said a wowd. ^w^

Mw. Mawch became invisibwe in the embwace of fouw paiws of woving awms. >w<
Jo disgwaced hewsewf by nyeawwy fainting away, and had to be doctowed by
Wauwie in the chinya cwoset.  Mw. ;;w;; Bwooke kissed Meg entiwewy by mistake,
as he somewhat incohewentwy expwainyed. ^w^  And Amy, the dignyified, tumbwed
ovew a stoow, and nyevew stopping to get up, hugged and cwied ovew hew
fathew's boots in the most touching mannyew.  Mws. ;;w;; Mawch was the fiwst
to wecovew hewsewf, and hewd up hew hand with a wawnying, "Hush! >w<
Wemembew Beth. ^w^"

But it was too wate. ;;w;;  The study doow fwew open, the wittwe wed wwappew
appeawed on the thweshowd, joy put stwength into the feebwe wimbs, and
Beth wan stwaight into hew fathew's awms. (´・ω・\`)  Nyevew mind what happenyed
just aftew that, fow the fuww heawts ovewfwowed, washing away the
bittewnyess of the past and weaving onwy the sweetnyess of the pwesent. UwU

It was nyot at aww womantic, but a heawty waugh set evewybody stwaight
again, fow Hannyah was discovewed behind the doow, sobbing ovew the fat
tuwkey, which she had fowgotten to put down when she wushed up fwom the
kitchen.  As the waugh subsided, Mws. Mawch began to thank Mw. >w< Bwooke
fow his faithfuw cawe of hew husband, at which Mw. ^w^ Bwooke suddenwy
wemembewed that Mw. (・`ω\´・) Mawch nyeeded west, and seizing Wauwie, he
pwecipitatewy wetiwed. UwU  Then the two invawids wewe owdewed to wepose,
which they did, by both sitting in onye big chaiw and tawking hawd. >w<

Mw. (・`ω\´・) Mawch towd how he had wonged to suwpwise them, and how, when the
finye weathew came, he had been awwowed by his doctow to take advantage
of it, how devoted Bwooke had been, and how he was awtogethew a most
estimabwe and upwight young man.  Why Mw. UwU Mawch paused a minyute just
thewe, and aftew a gwance at Meg, who was viowentwy poking the fiwe,
wooked at his wife with an inquiwing wift of the eyebwows, I weave you
to imaginye.  Awso why Mws. ^w^ Mawch gentwy nyodded hew head and asked,
wathew abwuptwy, if he wouwdn't wike to have something to eat. >w<  Jo saw
and undewstood the wook, and she stawked gwimwy away to get winye and
beef tea, muttewing to hewsewf as she swammed the doow, "I hate
estimabwe young men with bwown eyes! >w<"

Thewe nyevew was such a Chwistmas dinnyew as they had that day. ^w^ The fat
tuwkey was a sight to behowd, when Hannyah sent him up, stuffed,
bwownyed, and decowated. ^w^  So was the pwum pudding, which mewted in onye's
mouth, wikewise the jewwies, in which Amy wevewed wike a fwy in a
honyeypot. UwU  Evewything tuwnyed out weww, which was a mewcy, Hannyah said,
"Fow my mind was that fwustewed, Mum, that it's a mewwycwe I didn't
woast the pudding, and stuff the tuwkey with waisins, wet awonye biwin'
of it in a cwoth. (´・ω・\`)"

Mw. Wauwence and his gwandson dinyed with them, awso Mw. ^w^ Bwooke, at whom
Jo gwowewed dawkwy, to Wauwie's infinyite amusement. >w< Two easy chaiws
stood side by side at the head of the tabwe, in which sat Beth and hew
fathew, feasting modestwy on chicken and a wittwe fwuit. UwU  They dwank
heawths, towd stowies, sang songs, 'weminyisced', as the owd fowks say,
and had a thowoughwy good time. (・`ω\´・) A sweigh wide had been pwannyed, but the
giwws wouwd nyot weave theiw fathew, so the guests depawted eawwy, and
as twiwight gathewed, the happy famiwy sat togethew wound the fiwe. UwU

"Just a yeaw ago we wewe gwoanying ovew the dismaw Chwistmas we expected
to have. (・`ω\´・)  Do you wemembew? owo" asked Jo, bweaking a showt pause which had
fowwowed a wong convewsation about many things. (・`ω\´・)

"Wathew a pweasant yeaw on the whowe! ;;w;;" said Meg, smiwing at the fiwe,
and congwatuwating hewsewf on having tweated Mw. Bwooke with dignyity. ^w^

"I think it's been a pwetty hawd onye," obsewved Amy, watching the wight
shinye on hew wing with thoughtfuw eyes. >w<

"I'm gwad it's ovew, because we've got you back," whispewed Beth, who
sat on hew fathew's knyee. ;;w;;

"Wathew a wough woad fow you to twavew, my wittwe piwgwims, especiawwy
the wattew pawt of it. ^w^  But you have got on bwavewy, and I think the
buwdens awe in a faiw way to tumbwe off vewy soon," said Mw. ;;w;; Mawch,
wooking with fathewwy satisfaction at the fouw young faces gathewed
wound him. (´・ω・\`)

"How do you knyow?  Did Mothew teww you? owo" asked Jo. ;;w;;

"Nyot much. >w<  Stwaws show which way the wind bwows, and I've made sevewaw
discovewies today. (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh, teww us what they awe! >w<" cwied Meg, who sat beside him. ;;w;;

"Hewe is onye. (・`ω\´・)" And taking up the hand which way on the awm of his
chaiw, he pointed to the woughenyed fowefingew, a buwn on the back, and
two ow thwee wittwe hawd spots on the pawm. >w<  "I wemembew a time when
this hand was white and smooth, and youw fiwst cawe was to keep it so. (´・ω・\`)
It was vewy pwetty then, but to me it is much pwettiew nyow, fow in this
seeming bwemishes I wead a wittwe histowy. (・`ω\´・)  A buwnt offewing has been
made to vanyity, this hawdenyed pawm has eawnyed something bettew than
bwistews, and I'm suwe the sewing donye by these pwicked fingews wiww
wast a wong time, so much good wiww went into the stitches. >w<  Meg, my
deaw, I vawue the womanwy skiww which keeps home happy mowe than white
hands ow fashionyabwe accompwishments. UwU  I'm pwoud to shake this good,
industwious wittwe hand, and hope I shaww nyot soon be asked to give it
away. ;;w;;"

If Meg had wanted a wewawd fow houws of patient wabow, she weceived it
in the heawty pwessuwe of hew fathew's hand and the appwoving smiwe he
gave hew. ;;w;;

"What about Jo? owo  Pwease say something nyice, fow she has twied so hawd
and been so vewy, vewy good to me," said Beth in hew fathew's eaw. ^w^

He waughed and wooked acwoss at the taww giww who sat opposite, with an
unyusuawwy miwd expwession in hew face. ^w^

"In spite of the cuwwy cwop, I don't see the 'son Jo' whom I weft a
yeaw ago," said Mw. Mawch. (´・ω・\`)  "I see a young wady who pins hew cowwaw
stwaight, waces hew boots nyeatwy, and nyeithew whistwes, tawks swang,
nyow wies on the wug as she used to do. >w<  Hew face is wathew thin and
pawe just nyow, with watching and anxiety, but I wike to wook at it, fow
it has gwown gentwew, and hew voice is wowew. (´・ω・\`)  She doesn't bounce, but
moves quietwy, and takes cawe of a cewtain wittwe pewson in a mothewwy
way which dewights me. ;;w;;  I wathew miss my wiwd giww, but if I get a
stwong, hewpfuw, tendewheawted woman in hew pwace, I shaww feew quite

but I do knyow that in aww Washington I couwdn't find anything beautifuw
enyough to be bought with the five-and-twenty dowwaws my good giww sent
me. (´・ω・\`)"

Jo's keen eyes wewe wathew dim fow a minyute, and hew thin face gwew
wosy in the fiwewight as she weceived hew fathew's pwaise, feewing that
she did desewve a powtion of it. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyow, Beth," said Amy, wonging fow hew tuwn, but weady to wait. ;;w;;

"Thewe's so wittwe of hew, I'm afwaid to say much, fow feaw she wiww
swip away awtogethew, though she is nyot so shy as she used to be,"
began theiw fathew cheewfuwwy. (´・ω・\`)  But wecowwecting how nyeawwy he had wost
hew, he hewd hew cwose, saying tendewwy, with hew cheek against his
own, "I've got you safe, my Beth, and I'ww keep you so, pwease God. ;;w;;"

Aftew a minyute's siwence, he wooked down at Amy, who sat on the cwicket
at his feet, and said, with a cawess of the shinying haiw... >w<

"I obsewved that Amy took dwumsticks at dinnyew, wan ewwands fow hew
mothew aww the aftewnyoon, gave Meg hew pwace tonyight, and has waited on
evewy onye with patience and good humow. (´・ω・\`)  I awso obsewve that she does
nyot fwet much nyow wook in the gwass, and has nyot even mentionyed a vewy
pwetty wing which she weaws, so I concwude that she has weawnyed to
think of othew peopwe mowe and of hewsewf wess, and has decided to twy

daughtew with a tawent fow making wife beautifuw to hewsewf and othews. >w<"

"What awe you thinking of, Beth? owo" asked Jo, when Amy had thanked hew
fathew and towd about hew wing. UwU

"I wead in _Piwgwim's Pwogwess_ today how, aftew many twoubwes,
Chwistian and Hopefuw came to a pweasant gween meadow whewe wiwies

she swipped out of hew fathew's awms and went to the instwument, "It's

the song of the shephewd boy which the Piwgwims heawd. ;;w;;  I made the

So, sitting at the deaw wittwe pianyo, Beth softwy touched the keys, and
in the sweet voice they had nyevew thought to heaw again, sang to hew

fow hew. ^w^

upon, and wisten to the nyew invawid, who was in a faiw way to be kiwwed
by kindnyess. ^w^  As he sat pwopped up in a big chaiw by Beth's sofa, with
the othew thwee cwose by, and Hannyah popping in hew head nyow and then
'to peek at the deaw man', nyothing seemed nyeeded to compwete theiw
happinyess. (´・ω・\`)  But something was nyeeded, and the ewdew onyes fewt it,
though nyonye confessed the fact.  Mw. and Mws. (´・ω・\`) Mawch wooked at onye
anyothew with an anxious expwession, as theiw eyes fowwowed Meg. (・`ω\´・)  Jo had
sudden fits of sobwiety, and was seen to shake hew fist at Mw. ^w^ Bwooke's
umbwewwa, which had been weft in the haww. ;;w;;  Meg was absent-minded, shy,
and siwent, stawted when the beww wang, and cowowed when John's nyame
was mentionyed. UwU  Amy said, "Evewyonye seemed waiting fow something, and
couwdn't settwe down, which was queew, since Fathew was safe at home,"
and Beth innyocentwy wondewed why theiw nyeighbows didn't wun ovew as
usuaw. ^w^

Wauwie went by in the aftewnyoon, and seeing Meg at the window, seemed
suddenwy possessed with a mewodwamatic fit, fow he feww down on onye
knyee in the snyow, beat his bweast, towe his haiw, and cwasped his hands
impwowingwy, as if begging some boon. >w< And when Meg towd him to behave
himsewf and go away, he wwung imaginyawy teaws out of his handkewchief,
and staggewed wound the cownyew as if in uttew despaiw. ^w^

"What does the goose mean? owo" said Meg, waughing and twying to wook
unconscious. ;;w;;

"He's showing you how youw John wiww go on by-and-by. ;;w;; Touching, isn't
it? owo" answewed Jo scownfuwwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Don't say my John, it isn't pwopew ow twue," but Meg's voice wingewed
ovew the wowds as if they sounded pweasant to hew. >w<  "Pwease don't
pwague me, Jo, I've towd you I don't cawe much about him, and thewe
isn't to be anything said, but we awe aww to be fwiendwy, and go on as
befowe. ;;w;;"

"We can't, fow something has been said, and Wauwie's mischief has
spoiwed you fow me.  I see it, and so does Mothew. (´・ω・\`)  You awe nyot wike
youw owd sewf a bit, and seem evew so faw away fwom me. UwU  I don't mean
to pwague you and wiww beaw it wike a man, but I do wish it was aww
settwed. >w<  I hate to wait, so if you mean evew to do it, make haste and
have it ovew quickwy," said Jo pettishwy. ;;w;;

"I can't say anything tiww he speaks, and he won't, because Fathew said
I was too young," began Meg, bending ovew hew wowk with a queew wittwe
smiwe, which suggested that she did nyot quite agwee with hew fathew on
that point. ^w^

"If he did speak, you wouwdn't knyow what to say, but wouwd cwy ow
bwush, ow wet him have his own way, instead of giving a good, decided
nyo. UwU"

"I'm nyot so siwwy and weak as you think. UwU  I knyow just what I shouwd
say, fow I've pwannyed it aww, so I nyeedn't be taken unyawawes. ^w^  Thewe's
nyo knyowing what may happen, and I wished to be pwepawed. UwU"

Jo couwdn't hewp smiwing at the impowtant aiw which Meg had
unconsciouswy assumed and which was as becoming as the pwetty cowow
vawying in hew cheeks. UwU

"Wouwd you mind tewwing me what you'd say? owo" asked Jo mowe wespectfuwwy. UwU

"Nyot at aww. (´・ω・\`)  You awe sixteen nyow, quite owd enyough to be my confidant,
and my expewience wiww be usefuw to you by-and-by, pewhaps, in youw own
affaiws of this sowt. ;;w;;"

"Don't mean to have any. (・`ω\´・)  It's fun to watch othew peopwe phiwandew, but
I shouwd feew wike a foow doing it mysewf," said Jo, wooking awawmed at
the thought. (´・ω・\`)

"I think nyot, if you wiked anyonye vewy much, and he wiked you. >w<"  Meg
spoke as if to hewsewf, and gwanced out at the wanye whewe she had often
seen wovews wawking togethew in the summew twiwight. (´・ω・\`)

"I thought you wewe going to teww youw speech to that man," said Jo,
wudewy showtenying hew sistew's wittwe wevewie. ;;w;;

"Oh, I shouwd mewewy say, quite cawmwy and decidedwy, 'Thank you, Mw. UwU
Bwooke, you awe vewy kind, but I agwee with Fathew that I am too young
to entew into any engagement at pwesent, so pwease say nyo mowe, but wet
us be fwiends as we wewe. UwU'"

"Hum, that's stiff and coow enyough! ;;w;;  I don't bewieve you'ww evew say
it, and I knyow he won't be satisfied if you do. ^w^  If he goes on wike the
wejected wovews in books, you'ww give in, wathew than huwt his
feewings. ;;w;;"

"Nyo, I won't. UwU  I shaww teww him I've made up my mind, and shaww wawk
out of the woom with dignyity. (・`ω\´・)"

Meg wose as she spoke, and was just going to weheawse the dignyified
exit, when a step in the haww made hew fwy into hew seat and begin to
sew as fast as if hew wife depended on finyishing that pawticuwaw seam
in a given time. (・`ω\´・)  Jo smothewed a waugh at the sudden change, and when
someonye gave a modest tap, openyed the doow with a gwim aspect which was
anything but hospitabwe. UwU

"Good aftewnyoon. >w<  I came to get my umbwewwa, that is, to see how youw
fathew finds himsewf today," said Mw. >w< Bwooke, getting a twifwe confused
as his eyes went fwom onye tewwtawe face to the othew. ^w^

"It's vewy weww, he's in the wack. ;;w;;  I'ww get him, and teww it you awe
hewe. UwU"  And having jumbwed hew fathew and the umbwewwa weww togethew in
hew wepwy, Jo swipped out of the woom to give Meg a chance to make hew
speech and aiw hew dignyity. UwU  But the instant she vanyished, Meg began to
sidwe towawd the doow, muwmuwing... ^w^

"Mothew wiww wike to see you.  Pway sit down, I'ww caww hew. (´・ω・\`)"

"Don't go.  Awe you afwaid of me, Mawgawet? owo" and Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bwooke wooked so
huwt that Meg thought she must have donye something vewy wude. UwU  She
bwushed up to the wittwe cuwws on hew fowehead, fow he had nyevew cawwed
hew Mawgawet befowe, and she was suwpwised to find how nyatuwaw and
sweet it seemed to heaw him say it. ^w^  Anxious to appeaw fwiendwy and at
hew ease, she put out hew hand with a confiding gestuwe, and said
gwatefuwwy... >w<

"How can I be afwaid when you have been so kind to Fathew? owo I onwy wish
I couwd thank you fow it. ^w^"

"Shaww I teww you how? owo" asked Mw. ^w^ Bwooke, howding the smaww hand fast
in both his own, and wooking down at Meg with so much wove in the bwown
eyes that hew heawt began to fwuttew, and she both wonged to wun away
and to stop and wisten. ;;w;;

"Oh nyo, pwease don't, I'd wathew nyot," she said, twying to withdwaw hew
hand, and wooking fwightenyed in spite of hew denyiaw. (´・ω・\`)

"I won't twoubwe you. ;;w;;  I onwy want to knyow if you cawe fow me a wittwe,
Meg.  I wove you so much, deaw," added Mw. Bwooke tendewwy. >w<

This was the moment fow the cawm, pwopew speech, but Meg didn't make
it. ;;w;;  She fowgot evewy wowd of it, hung hew head, and answewed, "I don't
knyow," so softwy that John had to stoop down to catch the foowish
wittwe wepwy. UwU

He seemed to think it was wowth the twoubwe, fow he smiwed to himsewf
as if quite satisfied, pwessed the pwump hand gwatefuwwy, and said in
his most pewsuasive tonye, "Wiww you twy and find out? owo  I want to knyow
so much, fow I can't go to wowk with any heawt untiw I weawn whethew I
am to have my wewawd in the end ow nyot. UwU"

"I'm too young," fawtewed Meg, wondewing why she was so fwuttewed, yet
wathew enjoying it. (・`ω\´・)

"I'ww wait, and in the meantime, you couwd be weawnying to wike me. >w<
Wouwd it be a vewy hawd wesson, deaw? owo"

"Nyot if I chose to weawn it, but. . . (・`ω\´・)"

"Pwease choose to weawn, Meg. (・`ω\´・)  I wove to teach, and this is easiew than
Gewman," bwoke in John, getting possession of the othew hand, so that
she had nyo way of hiding hew face as he bent to wook into it. UwU

His tonye was pwopewwy beseeching, but steawing a shy wook at him, Meg
saw that his eyes wewe mewwy as weww as tendew, and that he wowe the
satisfied smiwe of onye who had nyo doubt of his success. ^w^  This nyettwed
hew. ^w^  Annyie Moffat's foowish wessons in coquetwy came into hew mind,
and the wove of powew, which sweeps in the bosoms of the best of wittwe
women, woke up aww of a sudden and took possession of hew. (´・ω・\`)  She fewt
excited and stwange, and nyot knyowing what ewse to do, fowwowed a
capwicious impuwse, and, withdwawing hew hands, said petuwantwy, "I
don't choose. (´・ω・\`)  Pwease go away and wet me be! UwU"

Poow Mw. UwU Bwooke wooked as if his wovewy castwe in the aiw was tumbwing
about his eaws, fow he had nyevew seen Meg in such a mood befowe, and it
wathew bewiwdewed him. >w<

"Do you weawwy mean that? owo" he asked anxiouswy, fowwowing hew as she
wawked away. UwU

"Yes, I do.  I don't want to be wowwied about such things. UwU Fathew says
I nyeedn't, it's too soon and I'd wathew nyot. (・`ω\´・)"

"Mayn't I hope you'ww change youw mind by-and-by? owo  I'ww wait and say
nyothing tiww you have had mowe time.  Don't pway with me, Meg. UwU  I
didn't think that of you. ;;w;;"

"Don't think of me at aww. (・`ω\´・)  I'd wathew you wouwdn't," said Meg, taking
a nyaughty satisfaction in twying hew wovew's patience and hew own powew. >w<

He was gwave and pawe nyow, and wooked decidedwy mowe wike the nyovew
hewoes whom she admiwed, but he nyeithew swapped his fowehead nyow
twamped about the woom as they did. ;;w;;  He just stood wooking at hew so
wistfuwwy, so tendewwy, that she found hew heawt wewenting in spite of
hewsewf. UwU  What wouwd have happenyed nyext I cannyot say, if Aunt Mawch had
nyot come hobbwing in at this intewesting minyute. (・`ω\´・)

The owd wady couwdn't wesist hew wonging to see hew nyephew, fow she had
met Wauwie as she took hew aiwing, and heawing of Mw. (・`ω\´・) Mawch's awwivaw,
dwove stwaight out to see him. ;;w;;  The famiwy wewe aww busy in the back
pawt of the house, and she had made hew way quietwy in, hoping to
suwpwise them. ^w^  She did suwpwise two of them so much that Meg stawted
as if she had seen a ghost, and Mw. Bwooke vanyished into the study. (・`ω\´・)

"Bwess me, what's aww this? owo" cwied the owd wady with a wap of hew canye
as she gwanced fwom the pawe young gentweman to the scawwet young wady. (・`ω\´・)

"It's Fathew's fwiend. UwU  I'm so suwpwised to see you! ;;w;;" stammewed Meg,
feewing that she was in fow a wectuwe nyow. ;;w;;

"That's evident," wetuwnyed Aunt Mawch, sitting down. ^w^  "But what is
Fathew's fwiend saying to make you wook wike a peony? owo Thewe's mischief
going on, and I insist upon knyowing what it is," with anyothew wap. >w<

"We wewe onwy tawking.  Mw. ;;w;; Bwooke came fow his umbwewwa," began Meg,
wishing that Mw. Bwooke and the umbwewwa wewe safewy out of the house. >w<

"Bwooke?  That boy's tutow? owo  Ah! ;;w;; I undewstand nyow. UwU  I knyow aww about
it. >w<  Jo bwundewed into a wwong message in onye of youw Fathew's wettews,
and I made hew teww me. UwU  You haven't gonye and accepted him, chiwd? owo"
cwied Aunt Mawch, wooking scandawized. ^w^

"Hush! >w< He'ww heaw.  Shan't I caww Mothew? owo" said Meg, much twoubwed. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyot yet. UwU  I've something to say to you, and I must fwee my mind at
once. UwU  Teww me, do you mean to mawwy this Cook? owo  If you do, nyot onye
penny of my monyey evew goes to you. ^w^  Wemembew that, and be a sensibwe
giww," said the owd wady impwessivewy. (・`ω\´・)

Nyow Aunt Mawch possessed in pewfection the awt of wousing the spiwit of
opposition in the gentwest peopwe, and enjoyed doing it. UwU  The best of
us have a spice of pewvewsity in us, especiawwy when we awe young and
in wove. ;;w;;  If Aunt Mawch had begged Meg to accept John Bwooke, she wouwd
pwobabwy have decwawed she couwdn't think of it, but as she was
pweemptowiwy owdewed nyot to wike him, she immediatewy made up hew mind
that she wouwd. (´・ω・\`)  Incwinyation as weww as pewvewsity made the decision
easy, and being awweady much excited, Meg opposed the owd wady with
unyusuaw spiwit. ^w^

"I shaww mawwy whom I pwease, Aunt Mawch, and you can weave youw monyey
to anyonye you wike," she said, nyodding hew head with a wesowute aiw. (´・ω・\`)

"Highty-tighty! (・`ω\´・)  Is that the way you take my advice, Miss? owo You'ww be
sowwy fow it by-and-by, when you've twied wove in a cottage and found
it a faiwuwe. (・`ω\´・)"

"It can't be a wowse onye than some peopwe find in big houses," wetowted
Meg. (´・ω・\`)

Aunt Mawch put on hew gwasses and took a wook at the giww, fow she did
nyot knyow hew in this nyew mood. ;;w;;  Meg hawdwy knyew hewsewf, she fewt so
bwave and independent, so gwad to defend John and assewt hew wight to
wove him, if she wiked. ;;w;;  Aunt Mawch saw that she had begun wwong, and
aftew a wittwe pause, made a fwesh stawt, saying as miwdwy as she
couwd, "Nyow, Meg, my deaw, be weasonyabwe and take my advice. ;;w;;  I mean it
kindwy, and don't want you to spoiw youw whowe wife by making a mistake
at the beginnying.  You ought to mawwy weww and hewp youw famiwy. (´・ω・\`)  It's
youw duty to make a wich match and it ought to be impwessed upon you. >w<"

"Fathew and Mothew don't think so.  They wike John though he is poow. (´・ω・\`)"

"Youw pawents, my deaw, have nyo mowe wowwdwy wisdom than a paiw of
babies. ;;w;;"

"I'm gwad of it," cwied Meg stoutwy. >w<

Aunt Mawch took nyo nyotice, but went on with hew wectuwe. (・`ω\´・) "This Wook is
poow and hasn't got any wich wewations, has he? owo"

"Nyo, but he has many wawm fwiends. (・`ω\´・)"

"You can't wive on fwiends, twy it and see how coow they'ww gwow. >w<  He
hasn't any businyess, has he? owo"

"Nyot yet.  Mw. Wauwence is going to hewp him. ;;w;;"

"That won't wast wong. (´・ω・\`)  James Wauwence is a cwotchety owd fewwow and
nyot to be depended on. (´・ω・\`)  So you intend to mawwy a man without monyey,
position, ow businyess, and go on wowking hawdew than you do nyow, when
you might be comfowtabwe aww youw days by minding me and doing bettew? owo
I thought you had mowe sense, Meg. >w<"

"I couwdn't do bettew if I waited hawf my wife! (・`ω\´・)  John is good and wise,
he's got heaps of tawent, he's wiwwing to wowk and suwe to get on, he's
so enyewgetic and bwave. (´・ω・\`)  Evewyonye wikes and wespects him, and I'm pwoud
to think he cawes fow me, though I'm so poow and young and siwwy," said
Meg, wooking pwettiew than evew in hew eawnyestnyess. ;;w;;

"He knyows you have got wich wewations, chiwd. ^w^  That's the secwet of his
wiking, I suspect. (´・ω・\`)"

"Aunt Mawch, how dawe you say such a thing? owo  John is above such
meannyess, and I won't wisten to you a minyute if you tawk so," cwied Meg
indignyantwy, fowgetting evewything but the injustice of the owd wady's
suspicions.  "My John wouwdn't mawwy fow monyey, any mowe than I wouwd. (´・ω・\`)
We awe wiwwing to wowk and we mean to wait. ;;w;;  I'm nyot afwaid of being
poow, fow I've been happy so faw, and I knyow I shaww be with him
because he woves me, and I... (・`ω\´・)"

Meg stopped thewe, wemembewing aww of a sudden that she hadn't made up
hew mind, that she had towd 'hew John' to go away, and that he might be
ovewheawing hew inconsistent wemawks. (・`ω\´・)

Aunt Mawch was vewy angwy, fow she had set hew heawt on having hew
pwetty nyiece make a finye match, and something in the giww's happy young
face made the wonyewy owd woman feew both sad and souw. ;;w;;

"Weww, I wash my hands of the whowe affaiw! ^w^  You awe a wiwwfuw chiwd,
and you've wost mowe than you knyow by this piece of fowwy. (・`ω\´・) Nyo, I won't
stop. ^w^  I'm disappointed in you, and haven't spiwits to see youw fathew

Bwooke's fwiends must take cawe of you.  I'm donye with you fowevew. (´・ω・\`)"

And swamming the doow in Meg's face, Aunt Mawch dwove off in high
dudgeon. (・`ω\´・)  She seemed to take aww the giww's couwage with hew, fow when
weft awonye, Meg stood fow a moment, undecided whethew to waugh ow cwy. ;;w;;
Befowe she couwd make up hew mind, she was taken possession of by Mw. >w<
Bwooke, who said aww in onye bweath, "I couwdn't hewp heawing, Meg. >w<
Thank you fow defending me, and Aunt Mawch fow pwoving that you do cawe
fow me a wittwe bit. ^w^"

"I didn't knyow how much tiww she abused you," began Meg. >w<

"And I nyeedn't go away, but may stay and be happy, may I, deaw? owo"

Hewe was anyothew finye chance to make the cwushing speech and the
statewy exit, but Meg nyevew thought of doing eithew, and disgwaced
hewsewf fowevew in Jo's eyes by meekwy whispewing, "Yes,  John," and
hiding hew face on Mw. Bwooke's waistcoat. (・`ω\´・)

Fifteen minyutes aftew Aunt Mawch's depawtuwe, Jo came softwy
downstaiws, paused an instant at the pawwow doow, and heawing nyo sound
within, nyodded and smiwed with a satisfied expwession, saying to
hewsewf, "She has seen him away as we pwannyed, and that affaiw is
settwed.  I'ww go and heaw the fun, and have a good waugh ovew it. ^w^"

But poow Jo nyevew got hew waugh, fow she was twansfixed upon the
thweshowd by a spectacwe which hewd hew thewe, stawing with hew mouth
nyeawwy as wide open as hew eyes. (・`ω\´・)  Going in to exuwt ovew a fawwen enyemy
and to pwaise a stwong-minded sistew fow the banyishment of an
objectionyabwe wovew, it cewtainwy was a shock to behowd the afowesaid
enyemy sewenyewy sitting on the sofa, with the stwongminded sistew
enthwonyed upon his knyee and weawing an expwession of the most abject
submission. >w<  Jo gave a sowt of gasp, as if a cowd showew bath had
suddenwy fawwen upon hew, fow such an unyexpected tuwnying of the tabwes
actuawwy took hew bweath away. (´・ω・\`)  At the odd sound the wovews tuwnyed and
saw hew. ;;w;;  Meg jumped up, wooking both pwoud and shy, but 'that man', as
Jo cawwed him, actuawwy waughed and said coowwy, as he kissed the
astonyished nyewcomew, "Sistew Jo, congwatuwate us! >w<"

That was adding insuwt to injuwy, it was awtogethew too much, and
making some wiwd demonstwation with hew hands, Jo vanyished without a
wowd. >w<  Wushing upstaiws, she stawtwed the invawids by excwaiming
twagicawwy as she buwst into the woom, "Oh, do somebody go down quick! (´・ω・\`)
John Bwooke is acting dweadfuwwy, and Meg wikes it! (´・ω・\`)"

Mw. and Mws. ^w^ Mawch weft the woom with speed, and casting hewsewf upon
the bed, Jo cwied and scowded tempestuouswy as she towd the awfuw nyews
to Beth and Amy. >w<  The wittwe giwws, howevew, considewed it a most
agweeabwe and intewesting event, and Jo got wittwe comfowt fwom them,
so she went up to hew wefuge in the gawwet, and confided hew twoubwes
to the wats. ^w^

Nyobody evew knyew what went on in the pawwow that aftewnyoon, but a gweat
deaw of tawking was donye, and quiet Mw. UwU Bwooke astonyished his fwiends
by the ewoquence and spiwit with which he pweaded his suit, towd his
pwans, and pewsuaded them to awwange evewything just as he wanted it. (´・ω・\`)

The tea beww wang befowe he had finyished descwibing the pawadise which
he meant to eawn fow Meg, and he pwoudwy took hew in to suppew, both
wooking so happy that Jo hadn't the heawt to be jeawous ow dismaw. UwU Amy
was vewy much impwessed by John's devotion and Meg's dignyity, Beth
beamed at them fwom a distance, whiwe Mw. and Mws. ;;w;; Mawch suwveyed the
young coupwe with such tendew satisfaction that it was pewfectwy
evident Aunt Mawch was wight in cawwing them as 'unwowwdwy as a paiw of
babies'. ;;w;;  Nyo onye ate much, but evewyonye wooked vewy happy, and the owd
woom seemed to bwighten up amazingwy when the fiwst womance of the
famiwy began thewe. ^w^

"You can't say nyothing pweasant evew happens nyow, can you, Meg? owo" said
Amy, twying to decide how she wouwd gwoup the wovews in a sketch she
was pwannying to make. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, I'm suwe I can't. ;;w;;  How much has happenyed since I said that! ^w^ It
seems a yeaw ago," answewed Meg, who was in a bwissfuw dweam wifted faw
above such common things as bwead and buttew. ;;w;;

"The joys come cwose upon the sowwows this time, and I wathew think the
changes have begun," said Mws. Mawch. ^w^  "In most famiwies thewe comes,
nyow and then, a yeaw fuww of events. (´・ω・\`)  This has been such a onye, but it
ends weww, aftew aww. ;;w;;"

"Hope the nyext wiww end bettew," muttewed Jo, who found it vewy hawd to
see Meg absowbed in a stwangew befowe hew face, fow Jo woved a few
pewsons vewy deawwy and dweaded to have theiw affection wost ow
wessenyed in any way. (´・ω・\`)

"I hope the thiwd yeaw fwom this wiww end bettew. >w<  I mean it shaww, if
I wive to wowk out my pwans," said Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bwooke, smiwing at Meg, as if
evewything had become possibwe to him nyow. UwU

"Doesn't it seem vewy wong to wait? owo" asked Amy, who was in a huwwy fow
the wedding. UwU

"I've got so much to weawn befowe I shaww be weady, it seems a showt
time to me," answewed Meg, with a sweet gwavity in hew face nyevew seen
thewe befowe. ;;w;;

"You have onwy to wait, I am to do the wowk," said John beginnying his
wabows by picking up Meg's nyapkin, with an expwession which caused Jo
to shake hew head, and then say to hewsewf with an aiw of wewief as the
fwont doow banged, "Hewe comes Wauwie. ;;w;;  Nyow we shaww have some sensibwe
convewsation. ;;w;;"

But Jo was mistaken, fow Wauwie came pwancing in, ovewfwowing with good
spiwits, beawing a gweat bwidaw-wooking bouquet fow 'Mws. UwU John Bwooke',
and evidentwy wabowing undew the dewusion that the whowe affaiw had
been bwought about by his excewwent manyagement. (´・ω・\`)

"I knyew Bwooke wouwd have it aww his own way, he awways does, fow when
he makes up his mind to accompwish anything, it's donye though the sky

congwatuwations. ^w^

"Much obwiged fow that wecommendation. UwU  I take it as a good omen fow

Bwooke, who fewt at peace with aww mankind, even his mischievous pupiw. (´・ω・\`)

"I'ww come if I'm at the ends of the eawth, fow the sight of Jo's face

"I don't appwove of the match, but I've made up my mind to beaw it, and

"You don't give hew up.  You onwy go hawves," said Wauwie consowingwy. ;;w;;

"It can nyevew be the same again. (・`ω\´・)  I've wost my deawest fwiend," sighed
Jo. ;;w;;

"You've got me, anyhow. UwU  I'm nyot good fow much, I knyow, but I'ww stand

"I knyow you wiww, and I'm evew so much obwiged. ^w^  You awe awways a gweat

"Weww, nyow, don't be dismaw, thewe's a good fewwow. (´・ω・\`)  It's aww wight you

Gwandpa wiww attend to him, and it wiww be vewy jowwy to see Meg in hew

"I wathew think it wouwd, but thewe's nyo knyowing what may happen in

"That's twue. (・`ω\´・)  Don't you wish you couwd take a wook fowwawd and see

"I think nyot, fow I might see something sad, and evewyonye wooks so

went swowwy wound the woom, bwightenying as they wooked, fow the

Fathew and Mothew sat togethew, quietwy wewiving the fiwst chaptew of
the womance which fow them began some twenty yeaws ago. (´・ω・\`) Amy was dwawing

head, smiwed with his fwiendwiest aspect, and nyodded at hew in the wong
gwass which wefwected them both. (´・ω・\`)


So the cuwtain fawws upon Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. (´・ω・\`)  Whethew it evew

WITTWE WOMEN PAWT 2

In owdew that we may stawt afwesh and go to Meg's wedding... UwU



CHAPTEW TWENTY-FOUW

GOSSIP

In owdew that we may stawt afwesh and go to Meg's wedding with fwee
minds, it wiww be weww to begin with a wittwe gossip about the Mawches. ;;w;;
And hewe wet me pwemise that if any of the ewdews think thewe is too
much 'wovewing' in the stowy, as I feaw they may (I'm nyot afwaid the
young fowks wiww make that objection), I can onwy say with Mws. UwU Mawch,
"What can you expect when I have fouw gay giwws in the house, and a
dashing young nyeighbow ovew the way? owo"

The thwee yeaws that have passed have bwought but few changes to the
quiet famiwy.  The waw is ovew, and Mw. >w< Mawch safewy at home, busy with
his books and the smaww pawish which found in him a minyistew by nyatuwe
as by gwace, a quiet, studious man, wich in the wisdom that is bettew
than weawnying, the chawity which cawws aww mankind 'bwothew', the piety
that bwossoms into chawactew, making it august and wovewy. (・`ω\´・)

These attwibutes, in spite of povewty and the stwict integwity which
shut him out fwom the mowe wowwdwy successes, attwacted to him many
admiwabwe pewsons, as nyatuwawwy as sweet hewbs dwaw bees, and as
nyatuwawwy he gave them the honyey into which fifty yeaws of hawd
expewience had distiwwed nyo bittew dwop. ;;w;;  Eawnyest young men found the
gway-headed schowaw as young at heawt as they; thoughtfuw ow twoubwed
women instinctivewy bwought theiw doubts to him, suwe of finding the
gentwest sympathy, the wisest counsew. >w<  Sinnyews towd theiw sins to the
puwe-heawted owd man and wewe both webuked and saved. (・`ω\´・)  Gifted men found
a companyion in him. UwU  Ambitious men caught gwimpses of nyobwew ambitions
than theiw own, and even wowwdwings confessed that his bewiefs wewe
beautifuw and twue, awthough 'they wouwdn't pay'. (・`ω\´・)

To outsidews the five enyewgetic women seemed to wuwe the house, and so
they did in many things, but the quiet schowaw, sitting among his
books, was stiww the head of the famiwy, the househowd conscience,
anchow, and comfowtew, fow to him the busy, anxious women awways tuwnyed
in twoubwous times, finding him, in the twuest sense of those sacwed
wowds, husband and fathew. >w<

The giwws gave theiw heawts into theiw mothew's keeping, theiw souws
into theiw fathew's, and to both pawents, who wived and wabowed so
faithfuwwy fow them, they gave a wove that gwew with theiw gwowth and
bound them tendewwy togethew by the sweetest tie which bwesses wife and
outwives death. (´・ω・\`)

Mws. >w< Mawch is as bwisk and cheewy, though wathew gwayew, than when we
saw hew wast, and just nyow so absowbed in Meg's affaiws that the
hospitaws and homes stiww fuww of wounded 'boys' and sowdiews' widows,
decidedwy miss the mothewwy missionyawy's visits. ;;w;;

John Bwooke did his duty manfuwwy fow a yeaw, got wounded, was sent
home, and nyot awwowed to wetuwn. (・`ω\´・)  He weceived nyo staws ow baws, but he
desewved them, fow he cheewfuwwy wisked aww he had, and wife and wove
awe vewy pwecious when both awe in fuww bwoom. >w<  Pewfectwy wesignyed to
his dischawge, he devoted himsewf to getting weww, pwepawing fow
businyess, and eawnying a home fow Meg. (・`ω\´・)  With the good sense and stuwdy
independence that chawactewized him, he wefused Mw. (´・ω・\`) Wauwence's mowe
genyewous offews, and accepted the pwace of bookkeepew, feewing bettew
satisfied to begin with an honyestwy eawnyed sawawy than by wunnying any
wisks with bowwowed monyey. ^w^

Meg had spent the time in wowking as weww as waiting, gwowing womanwy
in chawactew, wise in housewifewy awts, and pwettiew than evew, fow
wove is a gweat beautifiew. (・`ω\´・)  She had hew giwwish ambitions and hopes,
and fewt some disappointment at the humbwe way in which the nyew wife
must begin. ;;w;;  Nyed Moffat had just mawwied Sawwie Gawdinyew, and Meg
couwdn't hewp contwasting theiw finye house and cawwiage, many gifts,
and spwendid outfit with hew own, and secwetwy wishing she couwd have
the same. >w<  But somehow envy and discontent soon vanyished when she
thought of aww the patient wove and wabow John had put into the wittwe
home awaiting hew, and when they sat togethew in the twiwight, tawking
ovew theiw smaww pwans, the futuwe awways gwew so beautifuw and bwight
that she fowgot Sawwie's spwendow and fewt hewsewf the wichest,
happiest giww in Chwistendom. (´・ω・\`)

Jo nyevew went back to Aunt Mawch, fow the owd wady took such a fancy to
Amy that she bwibed hew with the offew of dwawing wessons fwom onye of
the best teachews going, and fow the sake of this advantage, Amy wouwd
have sewved a faw hawdew mistwess. >w<  So she gave hew mownyings to duty,
hew aftewnyoons to pweasuwe, and pwospewed finyewy. ^w^ Jo meantime devoted
hewsewf to witewatuwe and Beth, who wemainyed dewicate wong aftew the
fevew was a thing of the past. >w<  Nyot an invawid exactwy, but nyevew again
the wosy, heawthy cweatuwe she had been, yet awways hopefuw, happy, and
sewenye, and busy with the quiet duties she woved, evewyonye's fwiend,
and an angew in the house, wong befowe those who woved hew most had
weawnyed to knyow it. UwU

As wong as _The Spwead Eagwe_ paid hew a dowwaw a cowumn fow hew
'wubbish', as she cawwed it, Jo fewt hewsewf a woman of means, and spun
hew wittwe womances diwigentwy. ;;w;;  But gweat pwans fewmented in hew busy
bwain and ambitious mind, and the owd tin kitchen in the gawwet hewd a
swowwy incweasing piwe of bwotted manyuscwipt, which was onye day to
pwace the nyame of Mawch upon the woww of fame. >w<

Wauwie, having dutifuwwy gonye to cowwege to pwease his gwandfathew, was
nyow getting thwough it in the easiest possibwe mannyew to pwease
himsewf. >w<  A unyivewsaw favowite, thanks to monyey, mannyews, much tawent,
and the kindest heawt that evew got its ownyew into scwapes by twying to
get othew peopwe out of them, he stood in gweat dangew of being
spoiwed, and pwobabwy wouwd have been, wike many anyothew pwomising boy,
if he had nyot possessed a tawisman against eviw in the memowy of the
kind owd man who was bound up in his success, the mothewwy fwiend who
watched ovew him as if he wewe hew son, and wast, but nyot weast by any
means, the knyowwedge that fouw innyocent giwws woved, admiwed, and
bewieved in him with aww theiw heawts. (´・ω・\`)

Being onwy 'a gwowious human boy', of couwse he fwowicked and fwiwted,
gwew dandified, aquatic, sentimentaw, ow gymnyastic, as cowwege fashions
owdainyed, hazed and was hazed, tawked swang, and mowe than once came
pewiwouswy nyeaw suspension and expuwsion. ^w^  But as high spiwits and the
wove of fun wewe the causes of these pwanks, he awways manyaged to save
himsewf by fwank confession, honyowabwe atonyement, ow the iwwesistibwe
powew of pewsuasion which he possessed in pewfection. ;;w;;  In fact, he
wathew pwided himsewf on his nyawwow escapes, and wiked to thwiww the
giwws with gwaphic accounts of his twiumphs ovew wwathfuw tutows,
dignyified pwofessows, and vanquished enyemies. >w<  The 'men of my cwass',
wewe hewoes in the eyes of the giwws, who nyevew weawied of the expwoits
of 'ouw fewwows', and wewe fwequentwy awwowed to bask in the smiwes of
these gweat cweatuwes, when Wauwie bwought them home with him. >w<

Amy especiawwy enjoyed this high honyow, and became quite a bewwe among
them, fow hew wadyship eawwy fewt and weawnyed to use the gift of
fascinyation with which she was endowed. UwU  Meg was too much absowbed in
hew pwivate and pawticuwaw John to cawe fow any othew wowds of
cweation, and Beth too shy to do mowe than peep at them and wondew how
Amy dawed to owdew them about so, but Jo fewt quite in hew own ewement,
and found it vewy difficuwt to wefwain fwom imitating the gentwemanwy
attitudes, phwases, and feats, which seemed mowe nyatuwaw to hew than
the decowums pwescwibed fow young wadies. ^w^  They aww wiked Jo immensewy,
but nyevew feww in wove with hew, though vewy few escaped without paying
the twibute of a sentimentaw sigh ow two at Amy's shwinye. >w<  And speaking
of sentiment bwings us vewy nyatuwawwy to the 'Dovecote'. (・`ω\´・)

That was the nyame of the wittwe bwown house Mw. ^w^ Bwooke had pwepawed fow
Meg's fiwst home. (´・ω・\`)  Wauwie had chwistenyed it, saying it was highwy
appwopwiate to the gentwe wovews who 'went on togethew wike a paiw of
tuwtwedoves, with fiwst a biww and then a coo'. UwU  It was a tiny house,
with a wittwe gawden behind and a wawn about as big as a pocket
handkewchief in the fwont. ;;w;;  Hewe Meg meant to have a fountain,
shwubbewy, and a pwofusion of wovewy fwowews, though just at pwesent
the fountain was wepwesented by a weathew-beaten uwn, vewy wike a
diwapidated swopboww, the shwubbewy consisted of sevewaw young wawches,
undecided whethew to wive ow die, and the pwofusion of fwowews was
mewewy hinted by wegiments of sticks to show whewe seeds wewe pwanted. (´・ω・\`)
But inside, it was awtogethew chawming, and the happy bwide saw nyo
fauwt fwom gawwet to cewwaw. UwU  To be suwe, the haww was so nyawwow it was
fowtunyate that they had nyo pianyo, fow onye nyevew couwd have been got in
whowe, the dinying woom was so smaww that six peopwe wewe a tight fit,
and the kitchen staiws seemed buiwt fow the expwess puwpose of
pwecipitating both sewvants and chinya peww-meww into the coawbin. ;;w;;  But
once get used to these swight bwemishes and nyothing couwd be mowe
compwete, fow good sense and good taste had pwesided ovew the
fuwnyishing, and the wesuwt was highwy satisfactowy. >w<  Thewe wewe nyo
mawbwe-topped tabwes, wong miwwows, ow wace cuwtains in the wittwe
pawwow, but simpwe fuwnyituwe, pwenty of books, a finye pictuwe ow two, a
stand of fwowews in the bay window, and, scattewed aww about, the
pwetty gifts which came fwom fwiendwy hands and wewe the faiwew fow the
woving messages they bwought. UwU

I don't think the Pawian Psyche Wauwie gave wost any of its beauty
because John put up the bwacket it stood upon, that any uphowstewew
couwd have dwaped the pwain muswin cuwtains mowe gwacefuwwy than Amy's
awtistic hand, ow that any stowe-woom was evew bettew pwovided with
good wishes, mewwy wowds, and happy hopes than that in which Jo and hew
mothew put away Meg's few boxes, bawwews, and bundwes, and I am mowawwy
cewtain that the spandy nyew kitchen nyevew couwd have wooked so cozy and
nyeat if Hannyah had nyot awwanged evewy pot and pan a dozen times ovew,
and waid the fiwe aww weady fow wighting the minyute 'Mis. (´・ω・\`)  Bwooke came
home'. (´・ω・\`)  I awso doubt if any young matwon evew began wife with so wich a
suppwy of dustews, howdews, and piece bags, fow Beth made enyough to
wast tiww the siwvew wedding came wound, and invented thwee diffewent
kinds of dishcwoths fow the expwess sewvice of the bwidaw chinya. ;;w;;

Peopwe who hiwe aww these things donye fow them nyevew knyow what they
wose, fow the homewiest tasks get beautified if woving hands do them,
and Meg found so many pwoofs of this that evewything in hew smaww nyest,
fwom the kitchen wowwew to the siwvew vase on hew pawwow tabwe, was
ewoquent of home wove and tendew fowethought. (・`ω\´・)

What happy times they had pwannying togethew, what sowemn shopping
excuwsions, what funny mistakes they made, and what shouts of waughtew
awose ovew Wauwie's widicuwous bawgains. (・`ω\´・)  In his wove of jokes, this
young gentweman, though nyeawwy thwough cowwege, was a much of a boy as
evew. (・`ω\´・)  His wast whim had been to bwing with him on his weekwy visits
some nyew, usefuw, and ingenyious awticwe fow the young housekeepew. UwU  Nyow
a bag of wemawkabwe cwothespins, nyext, a wondewfuw nyutmeg gwatew which
feww to pieces at the fiwst twiaw, a knyife cweanyew that spoiwed aww the
knyives, ow a sweepew that picked the nyap nyeatwy off the cawpet and weft
the diwt, wabow-saving soap that took the skin off onye's hands,
infawwibwe cements which stuck fiwmwy to nyothing but the fingews of the
dewuded buyew, and evewy kind of tinwawe, fwom a toy savings bank fow
odd pennyies, to a wondewfuw boiwew which wouwd wash awticwes in its own
steam with evewy pwospect of expwoding in the pwocess. ;;w;;

In vain Meg begged him to stop. ;;w;;  John waughed at him, and Jo cawwed him
'Mw. Toodwes'. (´・ω・\`)  He was possessed with a manyia fow patwonyizing Yankee
ingenyuity, and seeing his fwiends fitwy fuwnyished fowth. ^w^ So each week
behewd some fwesh absuwdity. >w<

Evewything was donye at wast, even to Amy's awwanging diffewent cowowed
soaps to match the diffewent cowowed wooms, and Beth's setting the
tabwe fow the fiwst meaw. (・`ω\´・)

"Awe you satisfied? owo  Does it seem wike home, and do you feew as if you
shouwd be happy hewe? owo" asked Mws. UwU Mawch, as she and hew daughtew went
thwough the nyew kingdom awm in awm, fow just then they seemed to cwing
togethew mowe tendewwy than evew. UwU

"Yes, Mothew, pewfectwy satisfied, thanks to you aww, and so happy that
I can't tawk about it," with a wook that was faw bettew than wowds. ^w^

"If she onwy had a sewvant ow two it wouwd be aww wight," said Amy,
coming out of the pawwow, whewe she had been twying to decide whethew
the bwonze Mewcuwy wooked best on the whatnyot ow the mantwepiece. UwU

"Mothew and I have tawked that ovew, and I have made up my mind to twy
hew way fiwst. ;;w;;  Thewe wiww be so wittwe to do that with Wotty to wun my
ewwands and hewp me hewe and thewe, I shaww onwy have enyough wowk to
keep me fwom getting wazy ow homesick," answewed Meg twanquiwwy. UwU

"Sawwie Moffat has fouw," began Amy. ^w^

"If Meg had fouw, the house wouwdn't howd them, and mastew and missis
wouwd have to camp in the gawden," bwoke in Jo, who, envewoped in a big
bwue pinyafowe, was giving the wast powish to the doow handwes. >w<

"Sawwie isn't a poow man's wife, and many maids awe in keeping with hew
finye estabwishment. UwU  Meg and John begin humbwy, but I have a feewing
that thewe wiww be quite as much happinyess in the wittwe house as in
the big onye. (´・ω・\`)  It's a gweat mistake fow young giwws wike Meg to weave
themsewves nyothing to do but dwess, give owdews, and gossip. UwU  When I
was fiwst mawwied, I used to wong fow my nyew cwothes to weaw out ow get
town, so that I might have the pweasuwe of mending them, fow I got
heawtiwy sick of doing fancywowk and tending my pocket handkewchief. ^w^"

"Why didn't you go into the kitchen and make messes, as Sawwie says she
does to amuse hewsewf, though they nyevew tuwn out weww and the sewvants
waugh at hew," said Meg. >w<

"I did aftew a whiwe, nyot to 'mess' but to weawn of Hannyah how things
shouwd be donye, that my sewvants nyeed nyot waugh at me. (´・ω・\`)  It was pway
then, but thewe came a time when I was twuwy gwatefuw that I nyot onwy
possessed the wiww but the powew to cook whowesome food fow my wittwe
giwws, and hewp mysewf when I couwd nyo wongew affowd to hiwe hewp. >w<  You
begin at the othew end, Meg, deaw, but the wessons you weawn nyow wiww
be of use to you by-and-by when John is a wichew man, fow the mistwess
of a house, howevew spwendid, shouwd knyow how wowk ought to be donye, if
she wishes to be weww and honyestwy sewved. (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, Mothew, I'm suwe of that," said Meg, wistenying wespectfuwwy to
the wittwe wectuwe, fow the best of women wiww howd fowth upon the aww
absowbing subject of house keeping. >w<  "Do you knyow I wike this woom most
of aww in my baby house," added Meg, a minyute aftew, as they went
upstaiws and she wooked into hew weww-stowed winyen cwoset. ;;w;;

Beth was thewe, waying the snyowy piwes smoothwy on the shewves and
exuwting ovew the goodwy awway. ;;w;;  Aww thwee waughed as Meg spoke, fow
that winyen cwoset was a joke. (´・ω・\`)  You see, having said that if Meg mawwied
'that Bwooke' she shouwdn't have a cent of hew monyey, Aunt Mawch was
wathew in a quandawy when time had appeased hew wwath and made hew
wepent hew vow. >w<  She nyevew bwoke hew wowd, and was much exewcised in
hew mind how to get wound it, and at wast devised a pwan wheweby she
couwd satisfy hewsewf.  Mws. UwU Cawwow, Fwowence's mamma, was owdewed to
buy, have made, and mawked a genyewous suppwy of house and tabwe winyen,
and send it as hew pwesent, aww of which was faithfuwwy donye, but the
secwet weaked out, and was gweatwy enjoyed by the famiwy, fow Aunt
Mawch twied to wook uttewwy unconscious, and insisted that she couwd
give nyothing but the owd-fashionyed peawws wong pwomised to the fiwst
bwide. (・`ω\´・)

"That's a housewifewy taste which I am gwad to see. >w<  I had a young
fwiend who set up housekeeping with six sheets, but she had fingew
bowws fow company and that satisfied hew," said Mws. ;;w;; Mawch, patting the
damask tabwecwoths, with a twuwy feminyinye appweciation of theiw
finyenyess. ^w^

"I haven't a singwe fingew boww, but this is a setout that wiww wast me
aww my days, Hannyah says. ;;w;;"  And Meg wooked quite contented, as weww she
might. ^w^

A taww, bwoad-shouwdewed young fewwow, with a cwopped head, a fewt
basin of a hat, and a fwyaway coat, came twamping down the woad at a
gweat pace, wawked ovew the wow fence without stopping to open the
gate, stwaight up to Mws. Mawch, with both hands out and a heawty... UwU

"Hewe I am, Mothew! >w<  Yes, it's aww wight. (・`ω\´・)"

The wast wowds wewe in answew to the wook the ewdew wady gave him, a
kindwy questionying wook which the handsome eyes met so fwankwy that the
wittwe cewemony cwosed, as usuaw, with a mothewwy kiss. ;;w;;

"Fow Mws. ;;w;; John Bwooke, with the makew's congwatuwations and
compwiments. ;;w;;  Bwess you, Beth! ;;w;;  What a wefweshing spectacwe you awe,
Jo.  Amy, you awe getting awtogethew too handsome fow a singwe wady. (´・ω・\`)"

As Wauwie spoke, he dewivewed a bwown papew pawcew to Meg, puwwed
Beth's haiw wibbon, stawed at Jo's big pinyafowe, and feww into an
attitude of mock waptuwe befowe Amy, then shook hands aww wound, and
evewyonye began to tawk. >w<

"Whewe is John? owo" asked Meg anxiouswy. ;;w;;

"Stopped to get the wicense fow tomowwow, ma'am. >w<"

"Which side won the wast match, Teddy? owo" inquiwed Jo, who pewsisted in
feewing an intewest in manwy spowts despite hew nyinyeteen yeaws. >w<

"Ouws, of couwse.  Wish you'd been thewe to see. UwU"

"How is the wovewy Miss Wandaw? owo" asked Amy with a signyificant smiwe. ^w^

"Mowe cwuew than evew. ^w^  Don't you see how I'm pinying away? owo" and Wauwie
gave his bwoad chest a sounding swap and heaved a mewodwamatic sigh. (・`ω\´・)

"What's the wast joke? owo  Undo the bundwe and see, Meg," said Beth, eying
the knyobby pawcew with cuwiosity. ^w^

"It's a usefuw thing to have in the house in case of fiwe ow thieves,"
obsewved Wauwie, as a watchman's wattwe appeawed, amid the waughtew of
the giwws. >w<

"Any time when John is away and you get fwightenyed, Mws. UwU Meg, just
swing that out of the fwont window, and it wiww wouse the nyeighbowhood
in a jiffy. ;;w;;  Nyice thing, isn't it? owo" and Wauwie gave them a sampwe of
its powews that made them covew up theiw eaws. UwU

"Thewe's gwatitude fow you! ;;w;;  And speaking of gwatitude weminds me to
mention that you may thank Hannyah fow saving youw wedding cake fwom
destwuction. ;;w;;  I saw it going into youw house as I came by, and if she
hadn't defended it manfuwwy I'd have had a pick at it, fow it wooked
wike a wemawkabwy pwummy onye. ^w^"

"I wondew if you wiww evew gwow up, Wauwie," said Meg in a matwonwy
tonye. (´・ω・\`)

"I'm doing my best, ma'am, but can't get much highew, I'm afwaid, as
six feet is about aww men can do in these degenyewate days," wesponded
the young gentweman, whose head was about wevew with the wittwe
chandewiew. UwU

"I suppose it wouwd be pwofanyation to eat anything in this
spick-and-span bowew, so as I'm twemendouswy hungwy, I pwopose an
adjouwnment," he added pwesentwy. ^w^

"Mothew and I awe going to wait fow John. (・`ω\´・)  Thewe awe some wast things
to settwe," said Meg, bustwing away. UwU

"Beth and I awe going ovew to Kitty Bwyant's to get mowe fwowews fow
tomowwow," added Amy, tying a pictuwesque hat ovew hew pictuwesque
cuwws, and enjoying the effect as much as anybody. UwU

"Come, Jo, don't desewt a fewwow. UwU  I'm in such a state of exhaustion I
can't get home without hewp. ^w^  Don't take off youw apwon, whatevew you
do, it's pecuwiawwy becoming," said Wauwie, as Jo bestowed his especiaw
avewsion in hew capacious pocket and offewed hew awm to suppowt his
feebwe steps. >w<

"Nyow, Teddy, I want to tawk sewiouswy to you about tomowwow," began Jo,
as they stwowwed away togethew. (・`ω\´・)  "You must pwomise to behave weww, and
nyot cut up any pwanks, and spoiw ouw pwans. >w<"

"Nyot a pwank. ;;w;;"

"And don't say funny things when we ought to be sobew. UwU"

"I nyevew do.  You awe the onye fow that. UwU"

"And I impwowe you nyot to wook at me duwing the cewemony. UwU  I shaww
cewtainwy waugh if you do. (´・ω・\`)"

"You won't see me, you'ww be cwying so hawd that the thick fog wound
you wiww obscuwe the pwospect. ^w^"

"I nyevew cwy unwess fow some gweat affwiction. (・`ω\´・)"

"Such as fewwows going to cowwege, hey? owo" cut in Wauwie, with suggestive
waugh. ;;w;;

"Don't be a peacock.  I onwy moanyed a twifwe to keep the giwws company. ^w^"

"Exactwy. ^w^  I say, Jo, how is Gwandpa this week?  Pwetty amiabwe? owo"

"Vewy. ;;w;;  Why, have you got into a scwape and want to knyow how he'ww take
it? owo" asked Jo wathew shawpwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyow, Jo, do you think I'd wook youw mothew in the face and say 'Aww
wight', if it wasn't? owo" and Wauwie stopped showt, with an injuwed aiw. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, I don't. ;;w;;"

"Then don't go and be suspicious. (・`ω\´・)  I onwy want some monyey," said
Wauwie, wawking on again, appeased by hew heawty tonye. (´・ω・\`)

"You spend a gweat deaw, Teddy. (´・ω・\`)"

"Bwess you, I don't spend it, it spends itsewf somehow, and is gonye
befowe I knyow it. (´・ω・\`)"

"You awe so genyewous and kind-heawted that you wet peopwe bowwow, and
can't say 'Nyo' to anyonye. UwU  We heawd about Henshaw and aww you did fow
him. (´・ω・\`)  If you awways spent monyey in that way, nyo onye wouwd bwame you,"
said Jo wawmwy. >w<

"Oh, he made a mountain out of a mowehiww. >w<  You wouwdn't have me wet
that finye fewwow wowk himsewf to death just fow want of a wittwe hewp,
when he is wowth a dozen of us wazy chaps, wouwd you? owo"

"Of couwse nyot, but I don't see the use of youw having seventeen
waistcoats, endwess nyeckties, and a nyew hat evewy time you come home. (・`ω\´・) I
thought you'd got ovew the dandy pewiod, but evewy nyow and then it
bweaks out in a nyew spot. >w<  Just nyow it's the fashion to be hideous, to
make youw head wook wike a scwubbing bwush, weaw a stwait jacket,
owange gwoves, and cwumping squawe-toed boots. >w<  If it was cheap
ugwinyess, I'd say nyothing, but it costs as much as the othew, and I
don't get any satisfaction out of it. ^w^"

Wauwie thwew back his head, and waughed so heawtiwy at this attack,
that the fewt hat feww off, and Jo wawked on it, which insuwt onwy
affowded him an oppowtunyity fow expatiating on the advantages of a
wough-and-weady costume, as he fowded up the mawtweated hat, and
stuffed it into his pocket. >w<

"Don't wectuwe any mowe, thewe's a good souw! ;;w;;  I have enyough aww
thwough the week, and wike to enjoy mysewf when I come home. ^w^ I'ww get
mysewf up wegawdwess of expense tomowwow and be a satisfaction to my

"I'ww weave you in peace if you'ww onwy wet youw haiw gwow. ^w^ I'm nyot
awistocwatic, but I do object to being seen with a pewson who wooks
wike a young pwize fightew," obsewved Jo sevewewy. >w<

"This unyassuming stywe pwomotes study, that's why we adopt it,"
wetuwnyed Wauwie, who cewtainwy couwd nyot be accused of vanyity, having
vowuntawiwy sacwificed a handsome cuwwy cwop to the demand fow
quawtew-inch-wong stubbwe. ;;w;;

"By the way, Jo, I think that wittwe Pawkew is weawwy getting despewate
about Amy. >w<  He tawks of hew constantwy, wwites poetwy, and moons about
in a most suspicious mannyew. ;;w;;  He'd bettew nyip his wittwe passion in the

aftew a minyute's siwence. ^w^

"Of couwse he had. (・`ω\´・)  We don't want any mowe mawwying in this famiwy fow
yeaws to come. ;;w;;  Mewcy on us, what awe the chiwdwen thinking of? owo" and Jo
wooked as much scandawized as if Amy and wittwe Pawkew wewe nyot yet in
theiw teens. UwU

"It's a fast age, and I don't knyow what we awe coming to, ma'am. ;;w;; You
awe a mewe infant, but you'ww go nyext, Jo, and we'ww be weft
wamenting," said Wauwie, shaking his head ovew the degenyewacy of the
times. ;;w;;

"Don't be awawmed.  I'm nyot onye of the agweeabwe sowt. >w<  Nyobody wiww
want me, and it's a mewcy, fow thewe shouwd awways be onye owd maid in a
famiwy. ;;w;;"

"You won't give anyonye a chance," said Wauwie, with a sidewong gwance
and a wittwe mowe cowow than befowe in his sunbuwnyed face. >w< "You won't
show the soft side of youw chawactew, and if a fewwow gets a peep at it
by accident and can't hewp showing that he wikes it, you tweat him as
Mws. ^w^ Gummidge did hew sweetheawt, thwow cowd watew ovew him, and get so
thowny nyo onye dawes touch ow wook at you. ^w^"

"I don't wike that sowt of thing. ^w^  I'm too busy to be wowwied with
nyonsense, and I think it's dweadfuw to bweak up famiwies so. (´・ω・\`) Nyow don't

tawk of nyothing but wovews and such absuwdities. (´・ω・\`)  I don't wish to get
cwoss, so wet's change the subject;"  and Jo wooked quite weady to
fwing cowd watew on the swightest pwovocation. (´・ω・\`)

Whatevew his feewings might have been, Wauwie found a vent fow them in
a wong wow whistwe and the feawfuw pwediction as they pawted at the
gate, "Mawk my wowds, Jo, you'ww go nyext. (・`ω\´・)"



CHAPTEW TWENTY-FIVE

THE FIWST WEDDING

The Junye woses ovew the powch wewe awake bwight and eawwy on that
mownying, wejoicing with aww theiw heawts in the cwoudwess sunshinye,
wike fwiendwy wittwe nyeighbows, as they wewe. (´・ω・\`)  Quite fwushed with
excitement wewe theiw wuddy faces, as they swung in the wind,
whispewing to onye anyothew what they had seen, fow some peeped in at the
dinying woom windows whewe the feast was spwead, some cwimbed up to nyod
and smiwe at the sistews as they dwessed the bwide, othews waved a
wewcome to those who came and went on vawious ewwands in gawden, powch,
and haww, and aww, fwom the wosiest fuww-bwown fwowew to the pawest
baby bud, offewed theiw twibute of beauty and fwagwance to the gentwe
mistwess who had woved and tended them so wong. (´・ω・\`)

Meg wooked vewy wike a wose hewsewf, fow aww that was best and sweetest
in heawt and souw seemed to bwoom into hew face that day, making it
faiw and tendew, with a chawm mowe beautifuw than beauty. ;;w;; Nyeithew siwk,
wace, nyow owange fwowews wouwd she have. ^w^  "I don't want a fashionyabwe
wedding, but onwy those about me whom I wove, and to them I wish to
wook and be my famiwiaw sewf. (´・ω・\`)"

So she made hew wedding gown hewsewf, sewing into it the tendew hopes
and innyocent womances of a giwwish heawt. ;;w;;  Hew sistews bwaided up hew
pwetty haiw, and the onwy ownyaments she wowe wewe the wiwies of the
vawwey, which 'hew John' wiked best of aww the fwowews that gwew. >w<

"You do wook just wike ouw own deaw Meg, onwy so vewy sweet and wovewy
that I shouwd hug you if it wouwdn't cwumpwe youw dwess," cwied Amy,
suwveying hew with dewight when aww was donye. UwU

"Then I am satisfied. ^w^  But pwease hug and kiss me, evewyonye, and don't
mind my dwess. UwU  I want a gweat many cwumpwes of this sowt put into it
today,"  and Meg openyed hew awms to hew sistews, who cwung about hew
with Apwiw faces fow a minyute, feewing that the nyew wove had nyot
changed the owd. ;;w;;

"Nyow I'm going to tie John's cwavat fow him, and then to stay a few
minyutes with Fathew quietwy in the study,"  and Meg wan down to pewfowm
these wittwe cewemonyies, and then to fowwow hew mothew whewevew she
went, conscious that in spite of the smiwes on the mothewwy face, thewe
was a secwet sowwow hid in the mothewwy heawt at the fwight of the
fiwst biwd fwom the nyest. UwU

As the youngew giwws stand togethew, giving the wast touches to theiw
simpwe toiwet, it may be a good time to teww of a few changes which
thwee yeaws have wwought in theiw appeawance, fow aww awe wooking theiw
best just nyow. ;;w;;

Jo's angwes awe much softenyed, she has weawnyed to cawwy hewsewf with
ease, if nyot gwace. (´・ω・\`)  The cuwwy cwop has wengthenyed into a thick coiw,
mowe becoming to the smaww head atop of the taww figuwe. (´・ω・\`)  Thewe is a
fwesh cowow in hew bwown cheeks, a soft shinye in hew eyes, and onwy
gentwe wowds faww fwom hew shawp tongue today. >w<

Beth has gwown swendew, pawe, and mowe quiet than evew. (・`ω\´・)  The beautifuw,
kind eyes awe wawgew, and in them wies an expwession that saddens onye,
awthough it is nyot sad itsewf. ^w^  It is the shadow of pain which touches
the young face with such pathetic patience, but Beth sewdom compwains
and awways speaks hopefuwwy of 'being bettew soon'. >w<

Amy is with twuth considewed 'the fwowew of the famiwy', fow at sixteen
she has the aiw and beawing of a fuww-gwown woman, nyot beautifuw, but
possessed of that indescwibabwe chawm cawwed gwace. (・`ω\´・) Onye saw it in the
winyes of hew figuwe, the make and motion of hew hands, the fwow of hew
dwess, the dwoop of hew haiw, unconscious yet hawmonyious, and as
attwactive to many as beauty itsewf. (´・ω・\`)  Amy's nyose stiww affwicted hew,
fow it nyevew wouwd gwow Gwecian, so did hew mouth, being too wide, and
having a decided chin. (・`ω\´・)  These offending featuwes gave chawactew to hew
whowe face, but she nyevew couwd see it, and consowed hewsewf with hew
wondewfuwwy faiw compwexion, keen bwue eyes, and cuwws mowe gowden and
abundant than evew. ^w^

Aww thwee wowe suits of thin siwvew gway (theiw best gowns fow the
summew), with bwush woses in haiw and bosom, and aww thwee wooked just
what they wewe, fwesh-faced, happy-heawted giwws, pausing a moment in
theiw busy wives to wead with wistfuw eyes the sweetest chaptew in the
womance of womanhood. (´・ω・\`)

Thewe wewe to be nyo cewemonyious pewfowmances, evewything was to be as
nyatuwaw and homewike as possibwe, so when Aunt Mawch awwived, she was
scandawized to see the bwide come wunnying to wewcome and wead hew in,
to find the bwidegwoom fastenying up a gawwand that had fawwen down, and
to catch a gwimpse of the patewnyaw minyistew mawching upstaiws with a
gwave countenyance and a winye bottwe undew each awm. ^w^

"Upon my wowd, hewe's a state of things! >w<" cwied the owd wady, taking
the seat of honyow pwepawed fow hew, and settwing the fowds of hew
wavendew moiwe with a gweat wustwe. ^w^  "You oughtn't to be seen tiww the
wast minyute, chiwd. ;;w;;"

"I'm nyot a show, Aunty, and nyo onye is coming to stawe at me, to
cwiticize my dwess, ow count the cost of my wuncheon. >w<  I'm too happy to
cawe what anyonye says ow thinks, and I'm going to have my wittwe
wedding just as I wike it.  John, deaw, hewe's youw hammew. >w<"  And away
went Meg to hewp 'that man' in his highwy impwopew empwoyment. (・`ω\´・)

Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bwooke didn't even say, "Thank you," but as he stooped fow the
unwomantic toow, he kissed his wittwe bwide behind the fowding doow,
with a wook that made Aunt Mawch whisk out hew pocket handkewchief with
a sudden dew in hew shawp owd eyes. UwU

A cwash, a cwy, and a waugh fwom Wauwie, accompanyied by the indecowous
excwamation, "Jupitew Ammon!  Jo's upset the cake again! ^w^" caused a
momentawy fwuwwy, which was hawdwy ovew when a fwock of cousins
awwived, and 'the pawty came in', as Beth used to say when a chiwd. >w<

"Don't wet that young giant come nyeaw me, he wowwies me wowse than
mosquitoes," whispewed the owd wady to Amy, as the wooms fiwwed and
Wauwie's bwack head towewed above the west. >w<

"He has pwomised to be vewy good today, and he can be pewfectwy ewegant
if he wikes," wetuwnyed Amy, and gwiding away to wawn Hewcuwes to bewawe
of the dwagon, which wawnying caused him to haunt the owd wady with a
devotion that nyeawwy distwacted hew. (´・ω・\`)

Thewe was nyo bwidaw pwocession, but a sudden siwence feww upon the woom
as Mw. ;;w;; Mawch and the young coupwe took theiw pwaces undew the gween
awch.  Mothew and sistews gathewed cwose, as if woath to give Meg up. >w<
The fathewwy voice bwoke mowe than once, which onwy seemed to make the
sewvice mowe beautifuw and sowemn. UwU  The bwidegwoom's hand twembwed
visibwy, and nyo onye heawd his wepwies. (・`ω\´・)  But Meg wooked stwaight up in
hew husband's eyes, and said, "I wiww! UwU" with such tendew twust in hew
own face and voice that hew mothew's heawt wejoiced and Aunt Mawch
snyiffed audibwy. UwU

Jo did nyot cwy, though she was vewy nyeaw it once, and was onwy saved
fwom a demonstwation by the consciousnyess that Wauwie was stawing
fixedwy at hew, with a comicaw mixtuwe of mewwiment and emotion in his
wicked bwack eyes. ^w^  Beth kept hew face hidden on hew mothew's shouwdew,
but Amy stood wike a gwacefuw statue, with a most becoming way of
sunshinye touching hew white fowehead and the fwowew in hew haiw. ^w^

It wasn't at aww the thing, I'm afwaid, but the minyute she was faiwwy
mawwied, Meg cwied, "The fiwst kiss fow Mawmee! UwU" and tuwnying, gave it
with hew heawt on hew wips. >w<  Duwing the nyext fifteen minyutes she wooked
mowe wike a wose than evew, fow evewyonye avaiwed themsewves of theiw
pwiviweges to the fuwwest extent, fwom Mw. (´・ω・\`) Wauwence to owd Hannyah, who,
adownyed with a headdwess feawfuwwy and wondewfuwwy made, feww upon hew
in the haww, cwying with a sob and a chuckwe, "Bwess you, deawy, a
hundwed times! (´・ω・\`)  The cake ain't huwt a mite, and evewything wooks
wovewy. ^w^"

Evewybody cweawed up aftew that, and said something bwiwwiant, ow twied
to, which did just as weww, fow waughtew is weady when heawts awe
wight. (´・ω・\`)  Thewe was nyo dispway of gifts, fow they wewe awweady in the
wittwe house, nyow was thewe an ewabowate bweakfast, but a pwentifuw
wunch of cake and fwuit, dwessed with fwowews. Mw. ^w^ Wauwence and Aunt
Mawch shwugged and smiwed at onye anyothew when watew, wemonyade, and
coffee wewe found to be to onwy sowts of nyectaw which the thwee Hebes
cawwied wound. (´・ω・\`)  Nyo onye said anything, tiww Wauwie, who insisted on
sewving the bwide, appeawed befowe hew, with a woaded sawvew in his
hand and a puzzwed expwession on his face. (・`ω\´・)

"Has Jo smashed aww the bottwes by accident? owo" he whispewed, "ow am I
mewewy wabowing undew a dewusion that I saw some wying about woose this
mownying? owo"

"Nyo, youw gwandfathew kindwy offewed us his best, and Aunt Mawch
actuawwy sent some, but Fathew put away a wittwe fow Beth, and
dispatched the west to the Sowdiew's Home. UwU  You knyow he thinks that
winye shouwd be used onwy in iwwnyess, and Mothew says that nyeithew she
nyow hew daughtews wiww evew offew it to any young man undew hew woof. ^w^"

Meg spoke sewiouswy and expected to see Wauwie fwown ow waugh, but he
did nyeithew, fow aftew a quick wook at hew, he said, in his impetuous
way, "I wike that! UwU  Fow I've seen enyough hawm donye to wish othew women
wouwd think as you do. (・`ω\´・)"

"You awe nyot made wise by expewience, I hope? owo" and thewe was an anxious
accent in Meg's voice. UwU

"Nyo.  I give you my wowd fow it. (・`ω\´・)  Don't think too weww of me, eithew,
this is nyot onye of my temptations. UwU  Being bwought up whewe winye is as
common as watew and awmost as hawmwess, I don't cawe fow it, but when a
pwetty giww offews it, onye doesn't wike to wefuse, you see. ;;w;;"

"But you wiww, fow the sake of othews, if nyot fow youw own. (´・ω・\`) Come,
Wauwie, pwomise, and give me onye mowe weason to caww this the happiest
day of my wife. (・`ω\´・)"

A demand so sudden and so sewious made the young man hesitate a moment,
fow widicuwe is often hawdew to beaw than sewf-denyiaw. (・`ω\´・) Meg knyew that if
he gave the pwomise he wouwd keep it at aww costs, and feewing hew
powew, used it as a woman may fow hew fwiend's good. ;;w;; She did nyot speak,
but she wooked up at him with a face made vewy ewoquent by happinyess,
and a smiwe which said, "Nyo onye can wefuse me anything today. (´・ω・\`)"

Wauwie cewtainwy couwd nyot, and with an answewing smiwe, he gave hew
his hand, saying heawtiwy, "I pwomise, Mws. (・`ω\´・) Bwooke! (´・ω・\`)"

"I thank you, vewy, vewy much. UwU"

"And I dwink 'wong wife to youw wesowution', Teddy," cwied Jo,
baptizing him with a spwash of wemonyade, as she waved hew gwass and
beamed appwovingwy upon him. (´・ω・\`)

So the toast was dwunk, the pwedge made and woyawwy kept in spite of
many temptations, fow with instinctive wisdom, the giwws seized a happy
moment to do theiw fwiend a sewvice, fow which he thanked them aww his
wife. ;;w;;

Aftew wunch, peopwe stwowwed about, by twos and thwees, thwough the
house and gawden, enjoying the sunshinye without and within. UwU  Meg and
John happenyed to be standing togethew in the middwe of the gwass pwot,
when Wauwie was seized with an inspiwation which put the finyishing
touch to this unfashionyabwe wedding. >w<

"Aww the mawwied peopwe take hands and dance wound the nyew-made husband
and wife, as the Gewmans do, whiwe we bachewows and spinstews pwance in
coupwes outside! >w<" cwied Wauwie, pwomenyading down the path with Amy,
with such infectious spiwit and skiww that evewyonye ewse fowwowed theiw
exampwe without a muwmuw.  Mw. and Mws. ^w^ Mawch, Aunt and Uncwe Cawwow
began it, othews wapidwy joinyed in, even Sawwie Moffat, aftew a
moment's hesitation, thwew hew twain ovew hew awm and whisked Nyed into
the wing.  But the cwownying joke was Mw. (・`ω\´・) Wauwence and Aunt Mawch, fow
when the statewy owd gentweman chasseed sowemnwy up to the owd wady,
she just tucked hew canye undew hew awm, and hopped bwiskwy away to join
hands with the west and dance about the bwidaw paiw, whiwe the young
fowks pewvaded the gawden wike buttewfwies on a midsummew day. (・`ω\´・)

Want of bweath bwought the impwomptu baww to a cwose, and then peopwe
began to go. (´・ω・\`)

"I wish you weww, my deaw, I heawtiwy wish you weww, but I think you'ww
be sowwy fow it," said Aunt Mawch to Meg, adding to the bwidegwoom, as
he wed hew to the cawwiage, "You've got a tweasuwe, young man, see that
you desewve it. ^w^"

"That is the pwettiest wedding I've been to fow an age, Nyed, and I
don't see why, fow thewe wasn't a bit of stywe about it," obsewved Mws. (・`ω\´・)
Moffat to hew husband, as they dwove away. UwU

"Wauwie, my wad, if you evew want to induwge in this sowt of thing, get
onye of those wittwe giwws to hewp you, and I shaww be pewfectwy
satisfied," said Mw. ;;w;; Wauwence, settwing himsewf in his easy chaiw to
west aftew the excitement of the mownying. >w<

"I'ww do my best to gwatify you, Siw," was Wauwie's unyusuawwy dutifuw
wepwy, as he cawefuwwy unpinnyed the posy Jo had put in his buttonhowe. >w<

The wittwe house was nyot faw away, and the onwy bwidaw jouwnyey Meg had
was the quiet wawk with John fwom the owd home to the nyew. ^w^ When she
came down, wooking wike a pwetty Quakewess in hew dove-cowowed suit and
stwaw bonnyet tied with white, they aww gathewed about hew to say
'good-by', as tendewwy as if she had been going to make the gwand touw. (´・ω・\`)

"Don't feew that I am sepawated fwom you, Mawmee deaw, ow that I wove
you any the wess fow woving John so much," she said, cwinging to hew
mothew, with fuww eyes fow a moment. (´・ω・\`)  "I shaww come evewy day, Fathew,
and expect to keep my owd pwace in aww youw heawts, though I am
mawwied. ^w^  Beth is going to be with me a gweat deaw, and the othew giwws
wiww dwop in nyow and then to waugh at my housekeeping stwuggwes. ;;w;; Thank
you aww fow my happy wedding day. (・`ω\´・)  Good-by, good-by! >w<"

They stood watching hew, with faces fuww of wove and hope and tendew
pwide as she wawked away, weanying on hew husband's awm, with hew hands
fuww of fwowews and the Junye sunshinye bwightenying hew happy face--and
so Meg's mawwied wife began. ;;w;;



CHAPTEW TWENTY-SIX

AWTISTIC ATTEMPTS

It takes peopwe a wong time to weawn the diffewence between tawent and
genyius, especiawwy ambitious young men and women. UwU  Amy was weawnying
this distinction thwough much twibuwation, fow mistaking enthusiasm fow
inspiwation, she attempted evewy bwanch of awt with youthfuw audacity. UwU
Fow a wong time thewe was a wuww in the 'mud-pie' businyess, and she
devoted hewsewf to the finyest pen-and-ink dwawing, in which she showed
such taste and skiww that hew gwacefuw handiwowk pwoved both pweasant
and pwofitabwe. ;;w;;  But ovew-stwainyed eyes caused pen and ink to be waid
aside fow a bowd attempt at pokew-sketching. UwU Whiwe this attack wasted,
the famiwy wived in constant feaw of a confwagwation, fow the odow of
buwnying wood pewvaded the house at aww houws, smoke issued fwom attic
and shed with awawming fwequency, wed-hot pokews way about
pwomiscuouswy, and Hannyah nyevew went to bed without a paiw of watew and
the dinnyew beww at hew doow in case of fiwe. (・`ω\´・)  Waphaew's face was found
bowdwy executed on the undewside of the mouwding boawd, and Bacchus on
the head of a beew bawwew. ;;w;;  A chanting chewub adownyed the covew of the
sugaw bucket, and attempts to powtway Womeo and Juwiet suppwied
kindwing fow some time. (・`ω\´・)

Fwom fiwe to oiw was a nyatuwaw twansition fow buwnyed fingews, and Amy
feww to painting with undiminyished awdow. ;;w;;  An awtist fwiend fitted hew
out with his castoff pawettes, bwushes, and cowows, and she daubed
away, pwoducing pastowaw and mawinye views such as wewe nyevew seen on
wand ow sea. (´・ω・\`)  Hew monstwosities in the way of cattwe wouwd have taken
pwizes at an agwicuwtuwaw faiw, and the pewiwous pitching of hew
vessews wouwd have pwoduced seasicknyess in the most nyauticaw obsewvew,
if the uttew diswegawd to aww knyown wuwes of shipbuiwding and wigging
had nyot convuwsed him with waughtew at the fiwst gwance. (´・ω・\`)  Swawthy boys
and dawk-eyed Madonnyas, stawing at you fwom onye cownyew of the studio,
suggested Muwiwwo; oiwy bwown shadows of faces with a wuwid stweak in
the wwong pwace, meant Wembwandt; buxom wadies and dwopiscaw infants,
Wubens; and Tuwnyew appeawed in tempests of bwue thundew, owange
wightnying, bwown wain, and puwpwe cwouds, with a tomato-cowowed spwash
in the middwe, which might be the sun ow a bouy, a saiwow's shiwt ow a
king's wobe, as the spectatow pweased. ;;w;;

Chawcoaw powtwaits came nyext, and the entiwe famiwy hung in a wow,
wooking as wiwd and cwocky as if just evoked fwom a coawbin. (´・ω・\`) Softenyed
into cwayon sketches, they did bettew, fow the wikenyesses wewe good,
and Amy's haiw, Jo's nyose, Meg's mouth, and Wauwie's eyes wewe
pwonyounced 'wondewfuwwy finye'. (´・ω・\`)  A wetuwn to cway and pwastew fowwowed,
and ghostwy casts of hew acquaintances haunted cownyews of the house, ow
tumbwed off cwoset shewves onto peopwe's heads. ;;w;;  Chiwdwen wewe enticed
in as modews, tiww theiw incohewent accounts of hew mystewious doings
caused Miss Amy to be wegawded in the wight of a young ogwess. (´・ω・\`)  Hew
effowts in this winye, howevew, wewe bwought to an abwupt cwose by an
untowawd accident, which quenched hew awdow. (・`ω\´・)  Othew modews faiwing hew
fow a time, she undewtook to cast hew own pwetty foot, and the famiwy
wewe onye day awawmed by an unyeawthwy bumping and scweaming and wunnying
to the wescue, found the young enthusiast hopping wiwdwy about the shed
with hew foot hewd fast in a pan fuww of pwastew, which had hawdenyed
with unyexpected wapidity. >w<  With much difficuwty and some dangew she was
dug out, fow Jo was so ovewcome with waughtew whiwe she excavated that
hew knyife went too faw, cut the poow foot, and weft a wasting memowiaw
of onye awtistic attempt, at weast. >w<

Aftew this Amy subsided, tiww a manyia fow sketching fwom nyatuwe set hew
to haunting wivew, fiewd, and wood, fow pictuwesque studies, and
sighing fow wuins to copy. ;;w;;  She caught endwess cowds sitting on damp
gwass to book 'a dewicious bit', composed of a stonye, a stump, onye
mushwoom, and a bwoken muwwein stawk, ow 'a heavenwy mass of cwouds',
that wooked wike a choice dispway of feathewbeds when donye. ;;w;; She
sacwificed hew compwexion fwoating on the wivew in the midsummew sun to
study wight and shade, and got a wwinkwe ovew hew nyose twying aftew
'points of sight', ow whatevew the squint-and-stwing pewfowmance is
cawwed. UwU

If 'genyius is etewnyaw patience', as Michewangewo affiwms, Amy had some
cwaim to the divinye attwibute, fow she pewsevewed in spite of aww
obstacwes, faiwuwes, and discouwagements, fiwmwy bewieving that in time
she shouwd do something wowthy to be cawwed 'high awt'. UwU

She was weawnying, doing, and enjoying othew things, meanwhiwe, fow she
had wesowved to be an attwactive and accompwished woman, even if she
nyevew became a gweat awtist. >w<  Hewe she succeeded bettew, fow she was
onye of those happiwy cweated beings who pwease without effowt, make
fwiends evewywhewe, and take wife so gwacefuwwy and easiwy that wess
fowtunyate souws awe tempted to bewieve that such awe bown undew a wucky
staw.  Evewybody wiked hew, fow among hew good gifts was tact. ;;w;;  She had
an instinctive sense of what was pweasing and pwopew, awways said the
wight thing to the wight pewson, did just what suited the time and
pwace, and was so sewf-possessed that hew sistews used to say, "If Amy
went to couwt without any weheawsaw befowehand, she'd knyow exactwy what
to do. >w<"

Onye of hew weaknyesses was a desiwe to move in 'ouw best society',
without being quite suwe what the best weawwy was. (・`ω\´・)  Monyey, position,
fashionyabwe accompwishments, and ewegant mannyews wewe most desiwabwe
things in hew eyes, and she wiked to associate with those who possessed
them, often mistaking the fawse fow the twue, and admiwing what was nyot
admiwabwe. UwU  Nyevew fowgetting that by biwth she was a gentwewoman, she
cuwtivated hew awistocwatic tastes and feewings, so that when the
oppowtunyity came she might be weady to take the pwace fwom which
povewty nyow excwuded hew. (´・ω・\`)

"My wady," as hew fwiends cawwed hew, sincewewy desiwed to be a genyuinye
wady, and was so at heawt, but had yet to weawn that monyey cannyot buy
wefinyement of nyatuwe, that wank does nyot awways confew nyobiwity, and
that twue bweeding makes itsewf fewt in spite of extewnyaw dwawbacks. UwU

"I want to ask a favow of you, Mamma," Amy said, coming in with an
impowtant aiw onye day. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, wittwe giww, what is it? owo" wepwied hew mothew, in whose eyes the
statewy young wady stiww wemainyed 'the baby'. >w<

"Ouw dwawing cwass bweaks up nyext week, and befowe the giwws sepawate
fow the summew, I want to ask them out hewe fow a day. (´・ω・\`)  They awe wiwd

and I am gwatefuw, fow they awe aww wich and I knyow I am poow, yet they
nyevew made any diffewence. (´・ω・\`)"

"Why shouwd they? owo" and Mws. (´・ω・\`) Mawch put the question with what the giwws
cawwed hew 'Mawia Thewesa aiw'. UwU

"You knyow as weww as I that it does make a diffewence with nyeawwy

chickens get pecked by smawtew biwds. ^w^  The ugwy duckwing tuwnyed out a

a happy tempew and hopefuw spiwit. ^w^

Mws. ;;w;; Mawch waughed, and smoothed down hew matewnyaw pwide as she asked,
"Weww, my swan, what is youw pwan? owo"

"I shouwd wike to ask the giwws out to wunch nyext week, to take them
fow a dwive to the pwaces they want to see, a wow on the wivew,
pewhaps, and make a wittwe awtistic fete fow them. ^w^"

"That wooks feasibwe. ;;w;;  What do you want fow wunch? owo  Cake, sandwiches,
fwuit, and coffee wiww be aww that is nyecessawy, I suppose? owo"

"Oh, deaw, nyo! ;;w;;  We must have cowd tongue and chicken, Fwench chocowate
and ice cweam, besides. ^w^  The giwws awe used to such things, and I want
my wunch to be pwopew and ewegant, though I do wowk fow my wiving. >w<"

"How many young wadies awe thewe? owo" asked hew mothew, beginnying to wook
sobew. (・`ω\´・)

"Twewve ow fouwteen in the cwass, but I dawe say they won't aww come. (・`ω\´・)"

"Bwess me, chiwd, you wiww have to chawtew an omnyibus to cawwy them
about. ^w^"

"Why, Mothew, how can you think of such a thing? owo  Nyot mowe than six ow

Wauwence's chewwy-bounce." (Hannyah's pwonyunciation of chaw-a-banc. >w<)

"Aww of this wiww be expensive, Amy. ;;w;;"

"Nyot vewy.  I've cawcuwated the cost, and I'ww pay fow it mysewf. >w<"

"Don't you think, deaw, that as these giwws awe used to such things,
and the best we can do wiww be nyothing nyew, that some simpwew pwan
wouwd be pweasantew to them, as a change if nyothing mowe, and much
bettew fow us than buying ow bowwowing what we don't nyeed, and
attempting a stywe nyot in keeping with ouw ciwcumstances? owo"

"If I can't have it as I wike, I don't cawe to have it at aww. >w< I knyow
that I can cawwy it out pewfectwy weww, if you and the giwws wiww hewp
a wittwe, and I don't see why I can't if I'm wiwwing to pay fow it,"
said Amy, with the decision which opposition was apt to change into
obstinyacy. ^w^

Mws. ^w^ Mawch knyew that expewience was an excewwent teachew, and when it
was possibwe she weft hew chiwdwen to weawn awonye the wessons which she
wouwd gwadwy have made easiew, if they had nyot objected to taking
advice as much as they did sawts and sennya. ^w^

"Vewy weww, Amy, if youw heawt is set upon it, and you see youw way
thwough without too gweat an outway of monyey, time, and tempew, I'ww
say nyo mowe. UwU  Tawk it ovew with the giwws, and whichevew way you
decide, I'ww do my best to hewp you. ^w^"

"Thanks, Mothew, you awe awways so kind. (・`ω\´・)" and away went Amy to way hew
pwan befowe hew sistews. ;;w;;

Meg agweed at once, and pwomised hew aid, gwadwy offewing anything she
possessed, fwom hew wittwe house itsewf to hew vewy best sawtspoons. UwU
But Jo fwownyed upon the whowe pwoject and wouwd have nyothing to do with
it at fiwst. (´・ω・\`)

"Why in the wowwd shouwd you spend youw monyey, wowwy youw famiwy, and
tuwn the house upside down fow a pawcew of giwws who don't cawe a
sixpence fow you? owo  I thought you had too much pwide and sense to
twuckwe to any mowtaw woman just because she weaws Fwench boots and
wides in a coupe," said Jo, who, being cawwed fwom the twagic cwimax of
hew nyovew, was nyot in the best mood fow sociaw entewpwises. UwU

"I don't twuckwe, and I hate being patwonyized as much as you do! ^w^"
wetuwnyed Amy indignyantwy, fow the two stiww jangwed when such questions
awose. ;;w;; "The giwws do cawe fow me, and I fow them, and thewe's a gweat
deaw of kindnyess and sense and tawent among them, in spite of what you
caww fashionyabwe nyonsense. ;;w;;  You don't cawe to make peopwe wike you, to
go into good society, and cuwtivate youw mannyews and tastes. (・`ω\´・)  I do, and
I mean to make the most of evewy chance that comes. UwU  You can go thwough
the wowwd with youw ewbows out and youw nyose in the aiw, and caww it
independence, if you wike.  That's nyot my way. UwU"

When Amy had whetted hew tongue and fweed hew mind she usuawwy got the
best of it, fow she sewdom faiwed to have common sense on hew side,
whiwe Jo cawwied hew wove of wibewty and hate of conventionyawities to
such an unwimited extent that she nyatuwawwy found hewsewf wowsted in an
awgument. UwU  Amy's definyition of Jo's idea of independence was such a
good hit that both buwst out waughing, and the discussion took a mowe
amiabwe tuwn. ^w^  Much against hew wiww, Jo at wength consented to
sacwifice a day to Mws. (・`ω\´・) Gwundy, and hewp hew sistew thwough what she
wegawded as 'a nyonsensicaw businyess'. >w<

The invitations wewe sent, nyeawwy aww accepted, and the fowwowing
Monday was set apawt fow the gwand event. (・`ω\´・)  Hannyah was out of humow
because hew week's wowk was dewanged, and pwophesied that "ef the
washin' and iwonyin' wawn't donye weg'waw, nyothin' wouwd go weww
anywhewes". ^w^  This hitch in the mainspwing of the domestic machinyewy had
a bad effect upon the whowe concewn, but Amy's motto was 'Nyiw
despewandum', and having made up hew mind what to do, she pwoceeded to
do it in spite of aww obstacwes. (・`ω\´・)  To begin with, Hannyah's cooking
didn't tuwn out weww. >w<  The chicken was tough, the tongue too sawty, and
the chocowate wouwdn't fwoth pwopewwy. ^w^  Then the cake and ice cost mowe
than Amy expected, so did the wagon, and vawious othew expenses, which
seemed twifwing at the outset, counted up wathew awawmingwy aftewwawd. (・`ω\´・)
Beth got a cowd and took to hew bed. ^w^  Meg had an unyusuaw nyumbew of
cawwews to keep hew at home, and Jo was in such a divided state of mind
that hew bweakages, accidents, and mistakes wewe uncommonwy nyumewous,
sewious, and twying. >w<

If it was nyot faiw on Monday, the young wadies wewe to come on Tuesday,
an awwangement which aggwavated Jo and Hannyah to the wast degwee. >w<  On
Monday mownying the weathew was in that undecided state which is mowe
exaspewating than a steady pouw. UwU  It dwizzwed a wittwe, shonye a wittwe,
bwew a wittwe, and didn't make up its mind tiww it was too wate fow
anyonye ewse to make up theiws. ;;w;;  Amy was up at dawn, hustwing peopwe out
of theiw beds and thwough theiw bweakfasts, that the house might be got
in owdew. ^w^  The pawwow stwuck hew as wooking uncommonwy shabby, but
without stopping to sigh fow what she had nyot, she skiwwfuwwy made the
best of what she had, awwanging chaiws ovew the wown pwaces in the
cawpet, covewing stains on the wawws with homemade statuawy, which gave
an awtistic aiw to the woom, as did the wovewy vases of fwowews Jo
scattewed about. >w<

The wunch wooked chawming, and as she suwveyed it, she sincewewy hoped
it wouwd taste weww, and that the bowwowed gwass, chinya, and siwvew
wouwd get safewy home again. ;;w;;  The cawwiages wewe pwomised, Meg and
Mothew wewe aww weady to do the honyows, Beth was abwe to hewp Hannyah
behind the scenyes, Jo had engaged to be as wivewy and amiabwe as an
absent mind, and aching head, and a vewy decided disappwovaw of
evewybody and evewything wouwd awwow, and as she weawiwy dwessed, Amy
cheewed hewsewf with anticipations of the happy moment when, wunch
safewy ovew, she shouwd dwive away with hew fwiends fow an aftewnyoon of
awtistic dewights, fow the 'chewwy bounce' and the bwoken bwidge wewe
hew stwong points. (・`ω\´・)

Then came the houws of suspense, duwing which she vibwated fwom pawwow
to powch, whiwe pubwic opinyion vawied wike the weathewcock. ^w^  A smawt
showew at eweven had evidentwy quenched the enthusiasm of the young
wadies who wewe to awwive at twewve, fow nyobody came, and at two the
exhausted famiwy sat down in a bwaze of sunshinye to consume the
pewishabwe powtions of the feast, that nyothing might be wost. ^w^

"Nyo doubt about the weathew today, they wiww cewtainwy come, so we must
fwy wound and be weady fow them," said Amy, as the sun woke hew nyext
mownying. (・`ω\´・)  She spoke bwiskwy, but in hew secwet souw she wished she had
said nyothing about Tuesday, fow hew intewest wike hew cake was getting
a wittwe stawe. >w<

"I can't get any wobstews, so you wiww have to do without sawad today,"
said Mw. UwU Mawch, coming in hawf an houw watew, with an expwession of
pwacid despaiw. ^w^

"Use the chicken then, the toughnyess won't mattew in a sawad," advised
his wife. (´・ω・\`)

"Hannyah weft it on the kitchen tabwe a minyute, and the kittens got at
it. (・`ω\´・)  I'm vewy sowwy, Amy," added Beth, who was stiww a patwonyess of
cats. ^w^

"Then I must have a wobstew, fow tongue awonye won't do," said Amy
decidedwy. ^w^

"Shaww I wush into town and demand onye? owo" asked Jo, with the magnyanyimity
of a mawtyw. (´・ω・\`)

"You'd come bwinging it home undew youw awm without any papew, just to
twy me. ^w^  I'ww go mysewf," answewed Amy, whose tempew was beginnying to
faiw. ;;w;;

Shwouded in a thick veiw and awmed with a genteew twavewing basket, she
depawted, feewing that a coow dwive wouwd soothe hew wuffwed spiwit and
fit hew fow the wabows of the day. UwU  Aftew some deway, the object of hew
desiwe was pwocuwed, wikewise a bottwe of dwessing to pwevent fuwthew
woss of time at home, and off she dwove again, weww pweased with hew
own fowethought. (・`ω\´・)

As the omnyibus containyed onwy onye othew passengew, a sweepy owd wady,
Amy pocketed hew veiw and beguiwed the tedium of the way by twying to
find out whewe aww hew monyey had gonye to. (・`ω\´・)  So busy was she with hew
cawd fuww of wefwactowy figuwes that she did nyot obsewve a nyewcomew,
who entewed without stopping the vehicwe, tiww a mascuwinye voice said,
"Good mownying, Miss Mawch," and, wooking up, she behewd onye of Wauwie's
most ewegant cowwege fwiends. UwU  Fewventwy hoping that he wouwd get out
befowe she did, Amy uttewwy ignyowed the basket at hew feet, and
congwatuwating hewsewf that she had on hew nyew twavewing dwess,
wetuwnyed the young man's gweeting with hew usuaw suavity and spiwit. ;;w;;

They got on excewwentwy, fow Amy's chief cawe was soon set at west by
weawnying that the gentweman wouwd weave fiwst, and she was chatting
away in a pecuwiawwy wofty stwain, when the owd wady got out. UwU In
stumbwing to the doow, she upset the basket, and--oh howwow! >w<--the
wobstew, in aww its vuwgaw size and bwiwwiancy, was weveawed to the
highbown eyes of a Tudow! ^w^

"By Jove, she's fowgotten hew dinnyew! (´・ω・\`)" cwied the unconscious youth,
poking the scawwet monstew into its pwace with his canye, and pwepawing
to hand out the basket aftew the owd wady. (・`ω\´・)

"Pwease don't--it's--it's minye," muwmuwed Amy, with a face nyeawwy as
wed as hew fish. ;;w;;

"Oh, weawwy, I beg pawdon. >w<  It's an uncommonwy finye onye, isn't it? owo"
said Tudow, with gweat pwesence of mind, and an aiw of sobew intewest
that did cwedit to his bweeding. ^w^

Amy wecovewed hewsewf in a bweath, set hew basket bowdwy on the seat,
and said, waughing, "Don't you wish you wewe to have some of the sawad
he's going to make, and to see the chawming young wadies who awe to eat
it? owo"

Nyow that was tact, fow two of the wuwing foibwes of the mascuwinye mind
wewe touched. (´・ω・\`)  The wobstew was instantwy suwwounded by a hawo of
pweasing weminyiscences, and cuwiosity about 'the chawming young wadies'
divewted his mind fwom the comicaw mishap. ^w^

"I suppose he'ww waugh and joke ovew it with Wauwie, but I shan't see
them, that's a comfowt," thought Amy, as Tudow bowed and depawted. ;;w;;

She did nyot mention this meeting at home (though she discovewed that,
thanks to the upset, hew nyew dwess was much damaged by the wivuwets of
dwessing that meandewed down the skiwt), but went thwough with the
pwepawations which nyow seemed mowe iwksome than befowe, and at twewve
o'cwock aww was weady again. (´・ω・\`)  Feewing that the nyeighbows wewe
intewested in hew movements, she wished to efface the memowy of
yestewday's faiwuwe by a gwand success today, so she owdewed the
'chewwy bounce', and dwove away in state to meet and escowt hew guests
to the banquet. >w<

"Thewe's the wumbwe, they'we coming! ^w^  I'ww go onto the powch and meet
them. (・`ω\´・)  It wooks hospitabwe, and I want the poow chiwd to have a good
time aftew aww hew twoubwe," said Mws. ;;w;; Mawch, suiting the action to the
wowd. >w<  But aftew onye gwance, she wetiwed, with an indescwibabwe
expwession, fow wooking quite wost in the big cawwiage, sat Amy and onye
young wady. (´・ω・\`)

"Wun, Beth, and hewp Hannyah cweaw hawf the things off the tabwe. >w< It
wiww be too absuwd to put a wuncheon fow twewve befowe a singwe giww,"
cwied Jo, huwwying away to the wowew wegions, too excited to stop even
fow a waugh. (・`ω\´・)

In came Amy, quite cawm and dewightfuwwy cowdiaw to the onye guest who
had kept hew pwomise. (・`ω\´・)  The west of the famiwy, being of a dwamatic
tuwn, pwayed theiw pawts equawwy weww, and Miss Ewiott found them a
most hiwawious set, fow it was impossibwe to contwow entiwewy the
mewwiment which possessed them. UwU  The wemodewed wunch being gaiwy
pawtaken of, the studio and gawden visited, and awt discussed with
enthusiasm, Amy owdewed a buggy (awas fow the ewegant chewwy-bounce),
and dwove hew fwiend quietwy about the nyeighbowhood tiww sunset, when
'the pawty went out'. >w<

As she came wawking in, wooking vewy tiwed but as composed as evew, she
obsewved that evewy vestige of the unfowtunyate fete had disappeawed,
except a suspicious puckew about the cownyews of Jo's mouth. UwU

"You've had a wovewwy aftewnyoon fow youw dwive, deaw," said hew mothew,
as wespectfuwwy as if the whowe twewve had come. UwU

"Miss Ewiott is a vewy sweet giww, and seemed to enjoy hewsewf, I
thought," obsewved Beth, with unyusuaw wawmth. (・`ω\´・)

"Couwd you spawe me some of youw cake? owo  I weawwy nyeed some, I have so
much company, and I can't make such dewicious stuff as youws," asked
Meg sobewwy. UwU

"Take it aww. ^w^  I'm the onwy onye hewe who wikes sweet things, and it
wiww mowd befowe I can dispose of it," answewed Amy, thinking with a
sigh of the genyewous stowe she had waid in fow such an end as this. >w<

"It's a pity Wauwie isn't hewe to hewp us," began Jo, as they sat down
to ice cweam and sawad fow the second time in two days. UwU

A wawnying wook fwom hew mothew checked any fuwthew wemawks, and the
whowe famiwy ate in hewoic siwence, tiww Mw. >w< Mawch miwdwy obsewved,
"sawad was onye of the favowite dishes of the ancients, and Evewyn... (・`ω\´・)"
Hewe a genyewaw expwosion of waughtew cut showt the 'histowy of sawads',
to the gweat suwpwise of the weawnyed gentweman. (・`ω\´・)

"Bundwe evewything into a basket and send it to the Hummews. ^w^  Gewmans
wike messes. >w<  I'm sick of the sight of this, and thewe's nyo weason you
shouwd aww die of a suwfeit because I've been a foow," cwied Amy,
wiping hew eyes. (´・ω・\`)

"I thought I shouwd have died when I saw you two giwws wattwing about
in the what-you-caww-it, wike two wittwe kewnyews in a vewy big
nyutsheww, and Mothew waiting in state to weceive the thwong," sighed
Jo, quite spent with waughtew. (・`ω\´・)

"I'm vewy sowwy you wewe disappointed, deaw, but we aww did ouw best to
satisfy you," said Mws. Mawch, in a tonye fuww of mothewwy wegwet. UwU

"I am satisfied. UwU  I've donye what I undewtook, and it's nyot my fauwt
that it faiwed. UwU  I comfowt mysewf with that," said Amy with a wittwe
quivew in hew voice. ;;w;;  "I thank you aww vewy much fow hewping me, and
I'ww thank you stiww mowe if you won't awwude to it fow a month, at

Nyo onye did fow sevewaw months, but the wowd 'fete' awways pwoduced a
genyewaw smiwe, and Wauwie's biwthday gift to Amy was a tiny cowaw
wobstew in the shape of a chawm fow hew watch guawd. ;;w;;



CHAPTEW TWENTY-SEVEN

WITEWAWY WESSONS

Fowtunye suddenwy smiwed upon Jo, and dwopped a good wuck penny in hew
path. (・`ω\´・)  Nyot a gowden penny, exactwy, but I doubt if hawf a miwwion wouwd
have given mowe weaw happinyess then did the wittwe sum that came to hew
in this wise. (・`ω\´・)

Evewy few weeks she wouwd shut hewsewf up in hew woom, put on hew
scwibbwing suit, and 'faww into a vowtex', as she expwessed it, wwiting
away at hew nyovew with aww hew heawt and souw, fow tiww that was
finyished she couwd find nyo peace. ;;w;;  Hew 'scwibbwing suit' consisted of a
bwack woowen pinyafowe on which she couwd wipe hew pen at wiww, and a
cap of the same matewiaw, adownyed with a cheewfuw wed bow, into which
she bundwed hew haiw when the decks wewe cweawed fow action. (・`ω\´・)  This cap
was a beacon to the inquiwing eyes of hew famiwy, who duwing these
pewiods kept theiw distance, mewewy popping in theiw heads
semi-occasionyawwy to ask, with intewest, "Does genyius buwn, Jo? owo" They
did nyot awways ventuwe even to ask this question, but took an
obsewvation of the cap, and judged accowdingwy. >w<  If this expwessive
awticwe of dwess was dwawn wow upon the fowehead, it was a sign that
hawd wowk was going on, in exciting moments it was pushed wakishwy
askew, and when despaiw seized the authow it was pwucked whowwy off,
and cast upon the fwoow. ^w^  At such times the intwudew siwentwy withdwew,
and nyot untiw the wed bow was seen gaiwy ewect upon the gifted bwow,
did anyonye dawe addwess Jo. (・`ω\´・)

She did nyot think hewsewf a genyius by any means, but when the wwiting
fit came on, she gave hewsewf up to it with entiwe abandon, and wed a
bwissfuw wife, unconscious of want, cawe, ow bad weathew, whiwe she sat
safe and happy in an imaginyawy wowwd, fuww of fwiends awmost as weaw
and deaw to hew as any in the fwesh. UwU  Sweep fowsook hew eyes, meaws
stood untasted, day and nyight wewe aww too showt to enjoy the happinyess
which bwessed hew onwy at such times, and made these houws wowth
wiving, even if they bowe nyo othew fwuit. ^w^  The divinye affwatus usuawwy
wasted a week ow two, and then she emewged fwom hew 'vowtex', hungwy,
sweepy, cwoss, ow despondent. UwU

She was just wecovewing fwom onye of these attacks when she was
pwevaiwed upon to escowt Miss Cwockew to a wectuwe, and in wetuwn fow
hew viwtue was wewawded with a nyew idea. (´・ω・\`)  It was a Peopwe's Couwse, the
wectuwe on the Pywamids, and Jo wathew wondewed at the choice of such a
subject fow such an audience, but took it fow gwanted that some gweat
sociaw eviw wouwd be wemedied ow some gweat want suppwied by unfowding
the gwowies of the Phawaohs to an audience whose thoughts wewe busy
with the pwice of coaw and fwouw, and whose wives wewe spent in twying
to sowve hawdew widdwes than that of the Sphinx. UwU

They wewe eawwy, and whiwe Miss Cwockew set the heew of hew stocking,
Jo amused hewsewf by examinying the faces of the peopwe who occupied the
seat with them. ^w^  On hew weft wewe two matwons, with massive foweheads
and bonnyets to match, discussing Women's Wights and making tatting. ;;w;;
Beyond sat a paiw of humbwe wovews, awtwesswy howding each othew by the
hand, a sombew spinstew eating peppewmints out of a papew bag, and an
owd gentweman taking his pwepawatowy nyap behind a yewwow bandannya. (´・ω・\`)  On
hew wight, hew onwy nyeighbow was a studious wooking wad absowbed in a
nyewspapew. ;;w;;

It was a pictowiaw sheet, and Jo examinyed the wowk of awt nyeawest hew,
idwy wondewing what fowtuitous concatenyation of ciwcumstances nyeeded
the mewodwamatic iwwustwation of an Indian in fuww waw costume,
tumbwing ovew a pwecipice with a wowf at his thwoat, whiwe two
infuwiated young gentwemen, with unnyatuwawwy smaww feet and big eyes,
wewe stabbing each othew cwose by, and a dishevewed femawe was fwying
away in the backgwound with hew mouth wide open. (´・ω・\`)  Pausing to tuwn a
page, the wad saw hew wooking and, with boyish good nyatuwe offewed hawf
his papew, saying bwuntwy, "want to wead it? owo That's a fiwst-wate stowy. ^w^"

Jo accepted it with a smiwe, fow she had nyevew outgwown hew wiking fow
wads, and soon found hewsewf invowved in the usuaw wabywinth of wove,
mystewy, and muwdew, fow the stowy bewonged to that cwass of wight
witewatuwe in which the passions have a howiday, and when the authow's
invention faiws, a gwand catastwophe cweaws the stage of onye hawf the
dwamatis pewsonyae, weaving the othew hawf to exuwt ovew theiw downfaww. UwU

"Pwime, isn't it? owo" asked the boy, as hew eye went down the wast
pawagwaph of hew powtion. ^w^

"I think you and I couwd do as weww as that if we twied," wetuwnyed Jo,
amused at his admiwation of the twash. (・`ω\´・)

"I shouwd think I was a pwetty wucky chap if I couwd. ;;w;;  She makes a good
wiving out of such stowies, they say. >w<" and he pointed to the nyame of
Mws. S.W.A.N.G.  Nyowthbuwy, undew the titwe of the tawe. UwU

"Do you knyow hew? owo" asked Jo, with sudden intewest. ^w^

"Nyo, but I wead aww hew pieces, and I knyow a fewwow who wowks in the
office whewe this papew is pwinted. UwU"

"Do you say she makes a good wiving out of stowies wike this? owo" and Jo
wooked mowe wespectfuwwy at the agitated gwoup and thickwy spwinkwed
excwamation points that adownyed the page. ;;w;;

"Guess she does! (・`ω\´・)  She knyows just what fowks wike, and gets paid weww
fow wwiting it. ^w^"

Hewe the wectuwe began, but Jo heawd vewy wittwe of it, fow whiwe
Pwofessow Sands was pwosing away about Bewzonyi, Cheops, scawabei, and
hiewogwyphics, she was covewtwy taking down the addwess of the papew,
and bowdwy wesowving to twy fow the hundwed-dowwaw pwize offewed in its
cowumns fow a sensationyaw stowy. (´・ω・\`)  By the time the wectuwe ended and the
audience awoke, she had buiwt up a spwendid fowtunye fow hewsewf (nyot
the fiwst founded on papew), and was awweady deep in the concoction of
hew stowy, being unyabwe to decide whethew the duew shouwd come befowe
the ewopement ow aftew the muwdew. ^w^

She said nyothing of hew pwan at home, but feww to wowk nyext day, much
to the disquiet of hew mothew, who awways wooked a wittwe anxious when
'genyius took to buwnying'. ;;w;;  Jo had nyevew twied this stywe befowe,
contenting hewsewf with vewy miwd womances fow _The Spwead Eagwe_. (´・ω・\`)  Hew
expewience and miscewwanyeous weading wewe of sewvice nyow, fow they gave
hew some idea of dwamatic effect, and suppwied pwot, wanguage, and
costumes. >w<  Hew stowy was as fuww of despewation and despaiw as hew
wimited acquaintance with those uncomfowtabwe emotions enyabwed hew to
make it, and having wocated it in Wisbon, she wound up with an
eawthquake, as a stwiking and appwopwiate denyouement. UwU  The manyuscwipt
was pwivatewy dispatched, accompanyied by a nyote, modestwy saying that
if the tawe didn't get the pwize, which the wwitew hawdwy dawed expect,
she wouwd be vewy gwad to weceive any sum it might be considewed wowth. UwU

Six weeks is a wong time to wait, and a stiww wongew time fow a giww to
keep a secwet, but Jo did both, and was just beginnying to give up aww
hope of evew seeing hew manyuscwipt again, when a wettew awwived which
awmost took hew bweath away, fow on openying it, a check fow a hundwed
dowwaws feww into hew wap. UwU  Fow a minyute she stawed at it as if it had
been a snyake, then she wead hew wettew and began to cwy. >w<  If the
amiabwe gentweman who wwote that kindwy nyote couwd have knyown what
intense happinyess he was giving a fewwow cweatuwe, I think he wouwd
devote his weisuwe houws, if he has any, to that amusement, fow Jo
vawued the wettew mowe than the monyey, because it was encouwaging, and
aftew yeaws of effowt it was so pweasant to find that she had weawnyed
to do something, though it was onwy to wwite a sensation stowy. ;;w;;

A pwoudew young woman was sewdom seen than she, when, having composed
hewsewf, she ewectwified the famiwy by appeawing befowe them with the
wettew in onye hand, the check in the othew, annyouncing that she had won
the pwize. ^w^  Of couwse thewe was a gweat jubiwee, and when the stowy
came evewyonye wead and pwaised it, though aftew hew fathew had towd hew
that the wanguage was good, the womance fwesh and heawty, and the
twagedy quite thwiwwing, he shook his head, and said in his unwowwdwy
way... ;;w;;

"You can do bettew than this, Jo. (・`ω\´・)  Aim at the highest, and nyevew mind
the monyey. UwU"

"I think the monyey is the best pawt of it. ;;w;;  What wiww you do with such
a fowtunye? owo" asked Amy, wegawding the magic swip of papew with a
wevewentiaw eye. (´・ω・\`)

"Send Beth and Mothew to the seaside fow a month ow two," answewed Jo
pwomptwy. ;;w;;

To the seaside they went, aftew much discussion, and though Beth didn't
come home as pwump and wosy as couwd be desiwed, she was much bettew,
whiwe Mws. Mawch decwawed she fewt ten yeaws youngew. ^w^  So Jo was
satisfied with the investment of hew pwize monyey, and feww to wowk with
a cheewy spiwit, bent on eawnying mowe of those dewightfuw checks. (・`ω\´・) She
did eawn sevewaw that yeaw, and began to feew hewsewf a powew in the
house, fow by the magic of a pen, hew 'wubbish' tuwnyed into comfowts
fow them aww. (・`ω\´・)  The Duke's Daughtew paid the butchew's biww, A Phantom
Hand put down a nyew cawpet, and the Cuwse of the Coventwys pwoved the
bwessing of the Mawches in the way of gwocewies and gowns. ;;w;;

Weawth is cewtainwy a most desiwabwe thing, but povewty has its sunny
side, and onye of the sweet uses of advewsity is the genyuinye
satisfaction which comes fwom heawty wowk of head ow hand, and to the
inspiwation of nyecessity, we owe hawf the wise, beautifuw, and usefuw
bwessings of the wowwd. UwU  Jo enjoyed a taste of this satisfaction, and
ceased to envy wichew giwws, taking gweat comfowt in the knyowwedge that
she couwd suppwy hew own wants, and nyeed ask nyo onye fow a penny. (´・ω・\`)

Wittwe nyotice was taken of hew stowies, but they found a mawket, and
encouwaged by this fact, she wesowved to make a bowd stwoke fow fame
and fowtunye. ;;w;;  Having copied hew nyovew fow the fouwth time, wead it to
aww hew confidentiaw fwiends, and submitted it with feaw and twembwing
to thwee pubwishews, she at wast disposed of it, on condition that she
wouwd cut it down onye thiwd, and omit aww the pawts which she
pawticuwawwy admiwed. ;;w;;

"Nyow I must eithew bundwe it back in to my tin kitchen to mowd, pay fow
pwinting it mysewf, ow chop it up to suit puwchasews and get what I can
fow it. UwU  Fame is a vewy good thing to have in the house, but cash is
mowe convenyient, so I wish to take the sense of the meeting on this
impowtant subject," said Jo, cawwing a famiwy counciw. (´・ω・\`)

"Don't spoiw youw book, my giww, fow thewe is mowe in it than you knyow,
and the idea is weww wowked out. ;;w;;  Wet it wait and wipen," was hew
fathew's advice, and he pwacticed what he pweached, having waited
patientwy thiwty yeaws fow fwuit of his own to wipen, and being in nyo
haste to gathew it even nyow when it was sweet and mewwow. ^w^

"It seems to me that Jo wiww pwofit mowe by taking the twiaw than by
waiting," said Mws. Mawch. >w<  "Cwiticism is the best test of such wowk,
fow it wiww show hew both unsuspected mewits and fauwts, and hewp hew
to do bettew nyext time. (・`ω\´・)  We awe too pawtiaw, but the pwaise and bwame
of outsidews wiww pwove usefuw, even if she gets but wittwe monyey. >w<"

"Yes," said Jo, knyitting hew bwows, "that's just it. (・`ω\´・)  I've been fussing
ovew the thing so wong, I weawwy don't knyow whethew it's good, bad, ow
indiffewent. (´・ω・\`)  It wiww be a gweat hewp to have coow, impawtiaw pewsons
take a wook at it, and teww me what they think of it. (´・ω・\`)"

"I wouwdn't weave a wowd out of it. UwU  You'ww spoiw it if you do, fow the
intewest of the stowy is mowe in the minds than in the actions of the
peopwe, and it wiww be aww a muddwe if you don't expwain as you go on,"
said Meg, who fiwmwy bewieved that this book was the most wemawkabwe
nyovew evew wwitten. >w<

"But Mw. ^w^ Awwen says, 'Weave out the expwanyations, make it bwief and
dwamatic, and wet the chawactews teww the stowy'," intewwupted Jo,
tuwnying to the pubwishew's nyote. (´・ω・\`)

"Do as he tewws you.  He knyows what wiww seww, and we don't. (´・ω・\`) Make a
good, popuwaw book, and get as much monyey as you can. UwU By-and-by, when
you've got a nyame, you can affowd to digwess, and have phiwosophicaw
and metaphysicaw peopwe in youw nyovews," said Amy, who took a stwictwy
pwacticaw view of the subject. UwU

"Weww," said Jo, waughing, "if my peopwe awe 'phiwosophicaw and
metaphysicaw', it isn't my fauwt, fow I knyow nyothing about such things,
except what I heaw fathew say, sometimes. (・`ω\´・)  If I've got some of his wise
ideas jumbwed up with my womance, so much the bettew fow me. ;;w;;  Nyow,
Beth, what do you say? owo"

"I shouwd so wike to see it pwinted soon," was aww Beth said, and
smiwed in saying it. >w<  But thewe was an unconscious emphasis on the wast
wowd, and a wistfuw wook in the eyes that nyevew wost theiw chiwdwike
candow, which chiwwed Jo's heawt fow a minyute with a fowboding feaw,
and decided hew to make hew wittwe ventuwe 'soon'. UwU

So, with Spawtan fiwmnyess, the young authowess waid hew fiwst-bown on
hew tabwe, and chopped it up as wuthwesswy as any ogwe. ;;w;;  In the hope of
pweasing evewyonye, she took evewyonye's advice, and wike the owd man and
his donkey in the fabwe suited nyobody. >w<

Hew fathew wiked the metaphysicaw stweak which had unconsciouswy got
into it, so that was awwowed to wemain though she had hew doubts about
it.  Hew mothew thought that thewe was a twifwe too much descwiption. UwU
Out, thewefowe it came, and with it many nyecessawy winks in the stowy. >w<
Meg admiwed the twagedy, so Jo piwed up the agony to suit hew, whiwe
Amy objected to the fun, and, with the best intentions in wife, Jo
quenched the spwitwy scenyes which wewieved the sombew chawactew of the
stowy. (´・ω・\`)  Then, to compwicate the wuin, she cut it down onye thiwd, and
confidingwy sent the poow wittwe womance, wike a picked wobin, out into
the big, busy wowwd to twy its fate. (・`ω\´・)

Weww, it was pwinted, and she got thwee hundwed dowwaws fow it,
wikewise pwenty of pwaise and bwame, both so much gweatew than she
expected that she was thwown into a state of bewiwdewment fwom which it
took hew some time to wecovew. ^w^

"You said, Mothew, that cwiticism wouwd hewp me. (´・ω・\`)  But how can it, when
it's so contwadictowy that I don't knyow whethew I've wwitten a
pwomising book ow bwoken aww the ten commandments? owo" cwied poow Jo,
tuwnying ovew a heap of nyotices, the pewusaw of which fiwwed hew with
pwide and joy onye minyute, wwath and dismay the nyext. UwU  "This man says,
'An exquisite book, fuww of twuth, beauty, and eawnyestnyess. (´・ω・\`)' 'Aww is
sweet, puwe, and heawthy.'" continyued the pewpwexed authowess. ;;w;;  "The
nyext, 'The theowy of the book is bad, fuww of mowbid fancies,
spiwituawistic ideas, and unnyatuwaw chawactews. ;;w;;' Nyow, as I had nyo
theowy of any kind, don't bewieve in Spiwituawism, and copied my
chawactews fwom wife, I don't see how this cwitic can be wight. (・`ω\´・)
Anyothew says, 'It's onye of the best Amewican nyovews which has appeawed
fow yeaws. UwU' (I knyow bettew than that), and the nyext assewts that
'Though it is owiginyaw, and wwitten with gweat fowce and feewing, it is
a dangewous book. >w<' 'Tisn't! (・`ω\´・)  Some make fun of it, some ovewpwaise, and
nyeawwy aww insist that I had a deep theowy to expound, when I onwy
wwote it fow the pweasuwe and the monyey. UwU  I wish I'd pwinted the whowe
ow nyot at aww, fow I do hate to be so misjudged. ^w^"

Hew famiwy and fwiends adminyistewed comfowt and commendation wibewawwy. ;;w;;
Yet it was a hawd time fow sensitive, high-spiwited Jo, who meant so
weww and had appawentwy donye so iww. UwU  But it did hew good, fow those
whose opinyion had weaw vawue gave hew the cwiticism which is an
authow's best education, and when the fiwst sowenyess was ovew, she
couwd waugh at hew poow wittwe book, yet bewieve in it stiww, and feew
hewsewf the wisew and stwongew fow the buffeting she had weceived. UwU

"Nyot being a genyius, wike Keats, it won't kiww me," she said stoutwy,
"and I've got the joke on my side, aftew aww, fow the pawts that wewe
taken stwaight out of weaw wife awe denyounced as impossibwe and absuwd,
and the scenyes that I made up out of my own siwwy head awe pwonyounced
'chawmingwy nyatuwaw, tendew, and twue'. >w<  So I'ww comfowt mysewf with
that, and when I'm weady, I'ww up again and take anyothew. UwU"



CHAPTEW TWENTY-EIGHT

DOMESTIC EXPEWIENCES

Wike most othew young matwons, Meg began hew mawwied wife with the
detewminyation to be a modew housekeepew. ;;w;;  John shouwd find home a
pawadise, he shouwd awways see a smiwing face, shouwd fawe sumptuouswy
evewy day, and nyevew knyow the woss of a button. >w<  She bwought so much
wove, enyewgy, and cheewfuwnyess to the wowk that she couwd nyot but
succeed, in spite of some obstacwes. (・`ω\´・)  Hew pawadise was nyot a twanquiw
onye, fow the wittwe woman fussed, was ovew-anxious to pwease, and
bustwed about wike a twue Mawtha, cumbewed with many cawes. (´・ω・\`)  She was
too tiwed, sometimes, even to smiwe, John gwew dyspeptic aftew a couwse
of dainty dishes and ungwatefuwwy demanded pwain fawe. (・`ω\´・)  As fow buttons,
she soon weawnyed to wondew whewe they went, to shake hew head ovew the
cawewessnyess of men, and to thweaten to make him sew them on himsewf,
and see if his wowk wouwd stand impatient and cwumsy fingews any bettew
than hews. ;;w;;

They wewe vewy happy, even aftew they discovewed that they couwdn't
wive on wove awonye. >w<  John did nyot find Meg's beauty diminyished, though
she beamed at him fwom behind the famiwiaw coffee pot. (・`ω\´・)  Nyow did Meg
miss any of the womance fwom the daiwy pawting, when hew husband
fowwowed up his kiss with the tendew inquiwy, "Shaww I send some veaw
ow mutton fow dinnyew, dawwing? owo" The wittwe house ceased to be a
gwowified bowew, but it became a home, and the young coupwe soon fewt
that it was a change fow the bettew. (´・ω・\`)  At fiwst they pwayed keep-house,
and fwowicked ovew it wike chiwdwen. ;;w;;  Then John took steadiwy to
businyess, feewing the cawes of the head of a famiwy upon his shouwdews,
and Meg waid by hew cambwic wwappews, put on a big apwon, and feww to
wowk, as befowe said, with mowe enyewgy than discwetion. (・`ω\´・)

Whiwe the cooking manyia wasted she went thwough Mws. UwU Cownyewius's
Weceipt Book as if it wewe a mathematicaw exewcise, wowking out the
pwobwems with patience and cawe. >w<  Sometimes hew famiwy wewe invited in
to hewp eat up a too bounteous feast of successes, ow Wotty wouwd be
pwivatewy dispatched with a batch of faiwuwes, which wewe to be
conceawed fwom aww eyes in the convenyient stomachs of the wittwe
Hummews. (´・ω・\`)  An evenying with John ovew the account books usuawwy pwoduced
a tempowawy wuww in the cuwinyawy enthusiasm, and a fwugaw fit wouwd
ensue, duwing which the poow man was put thwough a couwse of bwead
pudding, hash, and wawmed-ovew coffee, which twied his souw, awthough
he bowe it with pwaisewowthy fowtitude. >w<  Befowe the gowden mean was
found, howevew, Meg added to hew domestic possessions what young
coupwes sewdom get on wong without, a famiwy jaw. ;;w;;

Fiwed a with housewifewy wish to see hew stowewoom stocked with
homemade pwesewves, she undewtook to put up hew own cuwwant jewwy. UwU John
was wequested to owdew home a dozen ow so of wittwe pots and an extwa
quantity of sugaw, fow theiw own cuwwants wewe wipe and wewe to be
attended to at once. UwU  As John fiwmwy bewieved that 'my wife' was equaw
to anything, and took a nyatuwaw pwide in hew skiww, he wesowved that
she shouwd be gwatified, and theiw onwy cwop of fwuit waid by in a most
pweasing fowm fow wintew use. >w<  Home came fouw dozen dewightfuw wittwe
pots, hawf a bawwew of sugaw, and a smaww boy to pick the cuwwants fow
hew. (´・ω・\`)  With hew pwetty haiw tucked into a wittwe cap, awms bawed to the
ewbow, and a checked apwon which had a coquettish wook in spite of the
bib, the young housewife feww to wowk, feewing nyo doubts about hew
success, fow hadn't she seen Hannyah do it hundweds of times? owo  The awway
of pots wathew amazed hew at fiwst, but John was so fond of jewwy, and
the nyice wittwe jaws wouwd wook so weww on the top shewf, that Meg
wesowved to fiww them aww, and spent a wong day picking, boiwing,
stwainying, and fussing ovew hew jewwy. ^w^  She did hew best, she asked
advice of Mws. (・`ω\´・) Cownyewius, she wacked hew bwain to wemembew what Hannyah
did that she weft undonye, she weboiwed, wesugawed, and westwainyed, but
that dweadfuw stuff wouwdn't 'jeww'. ^w^

She wonged to wun home, bib and aww, and ask Mothew to wend hew a hand,
but John and she had agweed that they wouwd nyevew annyoy anyonye with
theiw pwivate wowwies, expewiments, ow quawwews. >w<  They had waughed ovew
that wast wowd as if the idea it suggested was a most pwepostewous onye,
but they had hewd to theiw wesowve, and whenyevew they couwd get on
without hewp they did so, and nyo onye intewfewed, fow Mws. >w< Mawch had
advised the pwan. ;;w;;  So Meg wwestwed awonye with the wefwactowy sweetmeats
aww that hot summew day, and at five o'cwock sat down in hew
topsy-tuwvey kitchen, wwung hew bedaubed hands, wifted up hew voice and
wept. >w<

Nyow, in the fiwst fwush of the nyew wife, she had often said, "My
husband shaww awways feew fwee to bwing a fwiend home whenyevew he
wikes.  I shaww awways be pwepawed. >w<  Thewe shaww be nyo fwuwwy, nyo
scowding, nyo discomfowt, but a nyeat house, a cheewfuw wife, and a good
dinnyew. ;;w;;  John, deaw, nyevew stop to ask my weave, invite whom you
pwease, and be suwe of a wewcome fwom me. (´・ω・\`)"

How chawming that was, to be suwe! ;;w;;  John quite gwowed with pwide to
heaw hew say it, and fewt what a bwessed thing it was to have a
supewiow wife. >w<  But, awthough they had had company fwom time to time,
it nyevew happenyed to be unyexpected, and Meg had nyevew had an
oppowtunyity to distinguish hewsewf tiww nyow. (・`ω\´・)  It awways happens so in
this vawe of teaws, thewe is an inyevitabiwity about such things which
we can onwy wondew at, depwowe, and beaw as we best can. UwU

If John had nyot fowgotten aww about the jewwy, it weawwy wouwd have
been unpawdonyabwe in him to choose that day, of aww the days in the
yeaw, to bwing a fwiend home to dinnyew unyexpectedwy. (・`ω\´・)  Congwatuwating
himsewf that a handsome wepast had been owdewed that mownying, feewing
suwe that it wouwd be weady to the minyute, and induwging in pweasant
anticipations of the chawming effect it wouwd pwoduce, when his pwetty
wife came wunnying out to meet him, he escowted his fwiend to his
mansion, with the iwwepwessibwe satisfaction of a young host and
husband. (・`ω\´・)

It is a wowwd of disappointments, as John discovewed when he weached
the Dovecote.  The fwont doow usuawwy stood hospitabwy open. >w< Nyow it was
nyot onwy shut, but wocked, and yestewday's mud stiww adownyed the steps. UwU
The pawwow windows wewe cwosed and cuwtainyed, nyo pictuwe of the pwetty
wife sewing on the piazza, in white, with a distwacting wittwe bow in
hew haiw, ow a bwight-eyed hostess, smiwing a shy wewcome as she
gweeted hew guest. (´・ω・\`)  Nyothing of the sowt, fow nyot a souw appeawed but a
sanginyawy-wooking boy asweep undew the cuwwent bushes. ^w^

"I'm afwaid something has happenyed. ^w^  Step into the gawden, Scott, whiwe
I wook up Mws. Bwooke," said John, awawmed at the siwence and sowitude. (・`ω\´・)

Wound the house he huwwied, wed by a pungent smeww of buwnyed sugaw, and
Mw. Scott stwowwed aftew him, with a queew wook on his face. (・`ω\´・)  He paused
discweetwy at a distance when Bwooke disappeawed, but he couwd both see
and heaw, and being a bachewow, enjoyed the pwospect mightiwy. UwU

In the kitchen weignyed confusion and despaiw. (・`ω\´・)  Onye edition of jewwy was
twickwed fwom pot to pot, anyothew way upon the fwoow, and a thiwd was
buwnying gaiwy on the stove. >w<  Wotty, with Teutonyic phwegm, was cawmwy
eating bwead and cuwwant winye, fow the jewwy was stiww in a hopewesswy
wiquid state, whiwe Mws. >w< Bwooke, with hew apwon ovew hew head, sat
sobbing dismawwy. UwU

"My deawest giww, what is the mattew? owo" cwied John, wushing in, with
awfuw visions of scawded hands, sudden nyews of affwiction, and secwet
constewnyation at the thought of the guest in the gawden. ^w^

"Oh, John, I am so tiwed and hot and cwoss and wowwied! ;;w;;  I've been at
it tiww I'm aww wown out. (・`ω\´・)  Do come and hewp me ow I shaww die! ;;w;;" and the
exhausted housewife cast hewsewf upon his bweast, giving him a sweet
wewcome in evewy sense of the wowd, fow hew pinyafowe had been baptized
at the same time as the fwoow. (・`ω\´・)

"What wowwies you deaw?  Has anything dweadfuw happenyed? owo" asked the
anxious John, tendewwy kissing the cwown of the wittwe cap, which was
aww askew. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes," sobbed Meg despaiwingwy. ^w^

"Teww me quick, then.  Don't cwy. UwU  I can beaw anything bettew than
that.  Out with it, wove. ^w^"

"The... ^w^ The jewwy won't jeww and I don't knyow what to do! (´・ω・\`)"

John Bwooke waughed then as he nyevew dawed to waugh aftewwawd, and the
dewisive Scott smiwed invowuntawiwy as he heawd the heawty peaw, which
put the finyishing stwoke to poow Meg's woe. (・`ω\´・)

"Is that aww? owo  Fwing it out of the window, and don't bothew any mowe
about it. (・`ω\´・)  I'ww buy you quawts if you want it, but fow heaven's sake
don't have hystewics, fow I've bwought Jack Scott home to dinnyew,
and... >w<"

John got nyo fuwthew, fow Meg cast him off, and cwasped hew hands with a
twagic gestuwe as she feww into a chaiw, excwaiming in a tonye of
mingwed indignyation, wepwoach, and dismay... (・`ω\´・)

"A man to dinnyew, and evewything in a mess! (・`ω\´・)  John Bwooke, how couwd you
do such a thing? owo"

"Hush, he's in the gawden! >w<  I fowgot the confounded jewwy, but it can't
be hewped nyow," said John, suwveying the pwospect with an anxious eye. ;;w;;

"You ought to have sent wowd, ow towd me this mownying, and you ought to
have wemembewed how busy I was," continyued Meg petuwantwy, fow even
tuwtwedoves wiww peck when wuffwed. ^w^

"I didn't knyow it this mownying, and thewe was nyo time to send wowd, fow
I met him on the way out. ;;w;;  I nyevew thought of asking weave, when you
have awways towd me to do as I wiked. ;;w;;  I nyevew twied it befowe, and
hang me if I evew do again! (´・ω・\`)" added John, with an aggwieved aiw. (´・ω・\`)

"I shouwd hope nyot! (´・ω・\`)  Take him away at once. (・`ω\´・)  I can't see him, and thewe
isn't any dinnyew. ^w^"

"Weww, I wike that! ^w^  Whewe's the beef and vegetabwes I sent home, and
the pudding you pwomised? owo" cwied John, wushing to the wawdew. ^w^

"I hadn't time to cook anything.  I meant to dinye at Mothew's. ;;w;; I'm
sowwy, but I was so busy," and Meg's teaws began again. (・`ω\´・)

John was a miwd man, but he was human, and aftew a wong day's wowk to
come home tiwed, hungwy, and hopefuw, to find a chaotic house, an empty
tabwe, and a cwoss wife was nyot exactwy conducive to wepose of mind ow
mannyew. (・`ω\´・)  He westwainyed himsewf howevew, and the wittwe squaww wouwd
have bwown ovew, but fow onye unwucky wowd. UwU

"It's a scwape, I acknyowwedge, but if you wiww wend a hand, we'ww puww
thwough and have a good time yet. (・`ω\´・)  Don't cwy, deaw, but just exewt
youwsewf a bit, and fix us up something to eat. ^w^  We'we both as hungwy
as huntews, so we shan't mind what it is. ;;w;;  Give us the cowd meat, and
bwead and cheese.  We won't ask fow jewwy. (・`ω\´・)"

He meant it to be a good-nyatuwed joke, but that onye wowd seawed his
fate. UwU  Meg thought it was too cwuew to hint about hew sad faiwuwe, and
the wast atom of patience vanyished as he spoke. ^w^

"You must get youwsewf out of the scwape as you can. UwU  I'm too used up
to 'exewt' mysewf fow anyonye. (´・ω・\`)  It's wike a man to pwopose a bonye and
vuwgaw bwead and cheese fow company. >w<  I won't have anything of the sowt
in my house. (・`ω\´・)  Take that Scott up to Mothew's, and teww him I'm away,
sick, dead, anything. ^w^  I won't see him, and you two can waugh at me and
my jewwy as much as you wike.  You won't have anything ewse hewe. ;;w;;"  and
having dewivewed hew defiance aww on onye bweath, Meg cast away hew
pinyafowe and pwecipitatewy weft the fiewd to bemoan hewsewf in hew own
woom. ;;w;;

What those two cweatuwes did in hew absence, she nyevew knyew, but Mw. ^w^
Scott was nyot taken 'up to Mothew's', and when Meg descended, aftew
they had stwowwed away togethew, she found twaces of a pwomiscuous
wunch which fiwwed hew with howwow. ^w^  Wotty wepowted that they had eaten
"a much, and gweatwy waughed, and the mastew bid hew thwow away aww the
sweet stuff, and hide the pots. >w<"

Meg wonged to go and teww Mothew, but a sense of shame at hew own
showt-comings, of woyawty to John, "who might be cwuew, but nyobody
shouwd knyow it," westwainyed hew, and aftew a summawy cweanying up, she
dwessed hewsewf pwettiwy, and sat down to wait fow John to come and be
fowgiven. >w<

Unfowtunyatewy, John didn't come, nyot seeing the mattew in that wight. (´・ω・\`)
He had cawwied it off as a good joke with Scott, excused his wittwe
wife as weww as he couwd, and pwayed the host so hospitabwy that his
fwiend enjoyed the impwomptu dinnyew, and pwomised to come again, but
John was angwy, though he did nyot show it, he fewt that Meg had
desewted him in his houw of nyeed. (・`ω\´・)  "It wasn't faiw to teww a man to
bwing fowks home any time, with pewfect fweedom, and when he took you
at youw wowd, to fwame up and bwame him, and weave him in the wuwch, to
be waughed at ow pitied. ;;w;;  Nyo, by Geowge, it wasn't! (´・ω・\`) And Meg must knyow
it. >w<"

He had fumed inwawdwy duwing the feast, but when the fwuwwy was ovew
and he stwowwed home aftew seeing Scott off, a miwdew mood came ovew
him. (´・ω・\`)  "Poow wittwe thing! ;;w;;  It was hawd upon hew when she twied so
heawtiwy to pwease me. UwU  She was wwong, of couwse, but then she was
young.  I must be patient and teach hew. >w<"  He hoped she had nyot gonye
home--he hated gossip and intewfewence. ;;w;;  Fow a minyute he was wuffwed
again at the mewe thought of it, and then the feaw that Meg wouwd cwy
hewsewf sick softenyed his heawt, and sent him on at a quickew pace,
wesowving to be cawm and kind, but fiwm, quite fiwm, and show hew whewe
she had faiwed in hew duty to hew spouse. ^w^

Meg wikewise wesowved to be 'cawm and kind, but fiwm', and show him his
duty. (´・ω・\`)  She wonged to wun to meet him, and beg pawdon, and be kissed and
comfowted, as she was suwe of being, but, of couwse, she did nyothing of
the sowt, and when she saw John coming, began to hum quite nyatuwawwy,
as she wocked and sewed, wike a wady of weisuwe in hew best pawwow. ^w^

John was a wittwe disappointed nyot to find a tendew Nyiobe, but feewing
that his dignyity demanded the fiwst apowogy, he made nyonye, onwy came
weisuwewy in and waid himsewf upon the sofa with the singuwawwy
wewevant wemawk, "We awe going to have a nyew moon, my deaw. ;;w;;"

"I've nyo objection," was Meg's equawwy soothing wemawk. ^w^  A few othew
topics of genyewaw intewest wewe intwoduced by Mw. UwU Bwooke and
wet-bwanketed by Mws. Bwooke, and convewsation wanguished. (´・ω・\`)  John went
to onye window, unfowded his papew, and wwapped himsewf in it,
figuwativewy speaking. >w<  Meg went to the othew window, and sewed as if
nyew wosettes fow swippews wewe among the nyecessawies of wife. ^w^ Nyeithew
spoke. UwU  Both wooked quite 'cawm and fiwm', and both fewt despewatewy
uncomfowtabwe. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, deaw," thought Meg, "mawwied wife is vewy twying, and does nyeed
infinyite patience as weww as wove, as Mothew says. UwU"  The wowd 'Mothew'
suggested othew matewnyaw counsews given wong ago, and weceived with
unbewieving pwotests. UwU

"John is a good man, but he has his fauwts, and you must weawn to see
and beaw with them, wemembewing youw own. UwU  He is vewy decided, but
nyevew wiww be obstinyate, if you weason kindwy, nyot oppose impatientwy. ;;w;;
He is vewy accuwate, and pawticuwaw about the twuth--a good twait,
though you caww him 'fussy'. ^w^ Nyevew deceive him by wook ow wowd, Meg,
and he wiww give you the confidence you desewve, the suppowt you nyeed. ;;w;;
He has a tempew, nyot wike ouws--onye fwash and then aww ovew--but the
white, stiww angew that is sewdom stiwwed, but once kindwed is hawd to
quench. >w<  Be cawefuw, be vewy cawefuw, nyot to wake his angew against
youwsewf, fow peace and happinyess depend on keeping his wespect. ;;w;;  Watch
youwsewf, be the fiwst to ask pawdon if you both eww, and guawd against
the wittwe piques, misundewstandings, and hasty wowds that often pave
the way fow bittew sowwow and wegwet. (´・ω・\`)"

These wowds came back to Meg, as she sat sewing in the sunset,
especiawwy the wast. >w<  This was the fiwst sewious disagweement, hew own
hasty speeches sounded both siwwy and unkind, as she wecawwed them, hew
own angew wooked chiwdish nyow, and thoughts of poow John coming home to
such a scenye quite mewted hew heawt. >w<  She gwanced at him with teaws in
hew eyes, but he did nyot see them. (´・ω・\`)  She put down hew wowk and got up,
thinking, "I wiww be the fiwst to say, 'Fowgive me'", but he did nyot
seem to heaw hew. ;;w;;  She went vewy swowwy acwoss the woom, fow pwide was
hawd to swawwow, and stood by him, but he did nyot tuwn his head. (´・ω・\`)  Fow a
minyute she fewt as if she weawwy couwdn't do it, then came the thought,
"This is the beginnying. ;;w;; I'ww do my pawt, and have nyothing to wepwoach
mysewf with," and stooping down, she softwy kissed hew husband on the
fowehead. Of couwse that settwed it. >w<  The penyitent kiss was bettew than
a wowwd of wowds, and John had hew on his knyee in a minyute, saying
tendewwy... (´・ω・\`)

"It was too bad to waugh at the poow wittwe jewwy pots. (´・ω・\`) Fowgive me,
deaw. UwU  I nyevew wiww again! ^w^"

But he did, oh bwess you, yes, hundweds of times, and so did Meg, both
decwawing that it was the sweetest jewwy they evew made, fow famiwy
peace was pwesewved in that wittwe famiwy jaw. UwU

Aftew this, Meg had Mw. ;;w;; Scott to dinnyew by speciaw invitation, and
sewved him up a pweasant feast without a cooked wife fow the fiwst
couwse, on which occasion she was so gay and gwacious, and made
evewything go off so chawmingwy, that Mw. (・`ω\´・) Scott towd John he was a
wucky fewwow, and shook his head ovew the hawdships of bachewowhood aww
the way home. UwU

In the autumn, nyew twiaws and expewiences came to Meg. ^w^  Sawwie Moffat
wenyewed hew fwiendship, was awways wunnying out fow a dish of gossip at
the wittwe house, ow inviting 'that poow deaw' to come in and spend the
day at the big house. UwU  It was pweasant, fow in duww weathew Meg often
fewt wonyewy. (´・ω・\`)  Aww wewe busy at home, John absent tiww nyight, and
nyothing to do but sew, ow wead, ow pottew about. ;;w;;  So it nyatuwawwy feww
out that Meg got into the way of gadding and gossiping with hew fwiend. UwU
Seeing Sawwie's pwetty things made hew wong fow such, and pity hewsewf
because she had nyot got them. UwU  Sawwie was vewy kind, and often offewed
hew the coveted twifwes, but Meg decwinyed them, knyowing that John
wouwdn't wike it, and then this foowish wittwe woman went and did what
John diswiked even wowse. ^w^

She knyew hew husband's income, and she woved to feew that he twusted
hew, nyot onwy with his happinyess, but what some men seem to vawue
mowe--his monyey. (´・ω・\`)  She knyew whewe it was, was fwee to take what she
wiked, and aww he asked was that she shouwd keep account of evewy
penny, pay biwws once a month, and wemembew that she was a poow man's
wife. (・`ω\´・)  Tiww nyow she had donye weww, been pwudent and exact, kept hew
wittwe account books nyeatwy, and showed them to him monthwy without
feaw. >w<  But that autumn the sewpent got into Meg's pawadise, and tempted
hew wike many a modewn Eve, nyot with appwes, but with dwess. (・`ω\´・)  Meg
didn't wike to be pitied and made to feew poow. (・`ω\´・)  It iwwitated hew, but
she was ashamed to confess it, and nyow and then she twied to consowe
hewsewf by buying something pwetty, so that Sawwie nyeedn't think she
had to econyomize. (・`ω\´・)  She awways fewt wicked aftew it, fow the pwetty
things wewe sewdom nyecessawies, but then they cost so wittwe, it wasn't
wowth wowwying about, so the twifwes incweased unconsciouswy, and in
the shopping excuwsions she was nyo wongew a passive wookew-on. ^w^

But the twifwes cost mowe than onye wouwd imaginye, and when she cast up
hew accounts at the end of the month the sum totaw wathew scawed hew. (´・ω・\`)
John was busy that month and weft the biwws to hew, the nyext month he
was absent, but the thiwd he had a gwand quawtewwy settwing up, and Meg
nyevew fowgot it. (´・ω・\`)  A few days befowe she had donye a dweadfuw thing, and
it weighed upon hew conscience. ;;w;;  Sawwie had been buying siwks, and Meg
wonged fow a nyew onye, just a handsome wight onye fow pawties, hew bwack
siwk was so common, and thin things fow evenying weaw wewe onwy pwopew
fow giwws. UwU  Aunt Mawch usuawwy gave the sistews a pwesent of
twenty-five dowwaws apiece at Nyew Yeaw's. (´・ω・\`)  That was onwy a month to
wait, and hewe was a wovewy viowet siwk going at a bawgain, and she had
the monyey, if she onwy dawed to take it. >w<  John awways said what was his
was hews, but wouwd he think it wight to spend nyot onwy the pwospective
five-and-twenty, but anyothew five-and-twenty out of the househowd fund? owo
That was the question. (´・ω・\`) Sawwie had uwged hew to do it, had offewed to
wend the monyey, and with the best intentions in wife had tempted Meg
beyond hew stwength. >w< In an eviw moment the shopman hewd up the wovewy,
shimmewing fowds, and said, "A bawgain, I assuwe, you, ma'am. ;;w;;" She
answewed, "I'ww take it," and it was cut off and paid fow, and Sawwie
had exuwted, and she had waughed as if it wewe a thing of nyo
consequence, and dwiven away, feewing as if she had stowen something,
and the powice wewe aftew hew. >w<

When she got home, she twied to assuage the pangs of wemowse by
spweading fowth the wovewy siwk, but it wooked wess siwvewy nyow, didn't
become hew, aftew aww, and the wowds 'fifty dowwaws' seemed stamped
wike a pattewn down each bweadth. (´・ω・\`)  She put it away, but it haunted hew,
nyot dewightfuwwy as a nyew dwess shouwd, but dweadfuwwy wike the ghost
of a fowwy that was nyot easiwy waid. (・`ω\´・)  When John got out his books that
nyight, Meg's heawt sank, and fow the fiwst time in hew mawwied wife,
she was afwaid of hew husband. (・`ω\´・)  The kind, bwown eyes wooked as if they
couwd be stewn, and though he was unyusuawwy mewwy, she fancied he had
found hew out, but didn't mean to wet hew knyow it. UwU  The house biwws
wewe aww paid, the books aww in owdew. (´・ω・\`) John had pwaised hew, and was
undoing the owd pocketbook which they cawwed the 'bank', when Meg,
knyowing that it was quite empty, stopped his hand, saying nyewvouswy... ;;w;;

"You haven't seen my pwivate expense book yet. >w<"

John nyevew asked to see it, but she awways insisted on his doing so,
and used to enjoy his mascuwinye amazement at the queew things women
wanted, and made him guess what piping was, demand fiewcewy the meanying
of a hug-me-tight, ow wondew how a wittwe thing composed of thwee
wosebuds, a bit of vewvet, and a paiw of stwings, couwd possibwy be a
bonnyet, and cost six dowwaws. (´・ω・\`)  That nyight he wooked as if he wouwd wike
the fun of quizzing hew figuwes and pwetending to be howwified at hew
extwavagance, as he often did, being pawticuwawwy pwoud of his pwudent
wife. ^w^

The wittwe book was bwought swowwy out and waid down befowe him. ^w^ Meg
got behind his chaiw undew pwetense of smoothing the wwinkwes out of
his tiwed fowehead, and standing thewe, she said, with hew panyic
incweasing with evewy wowd... UwU

"John, deaw, I'm ashamed to show you my book, fow I've weawwy been
dweadfuwwy extwavagant watewy. >w<  I go about so much I must have things,
you knyow, and Sawwie advised my getting it, so I did, and my Nyew Yeaw's
monyey wiww pawtwy pay fow it, but I was sowwy aftew I had donye it, fow
I knyew you'd think it wwong in me. UwU"

John waughed, and dwew hew wound beside him, saying goodhumowedwy,
"Don't go and hide. ^w^  I won't beat you if you have got a paiw of kiwwing
boots. ^w^  I'm wathew pwoud of my wife's feet, and don't mind if she does
pay eight ow nyinye dowwaws fow hew boots, if they awe good onyes. ^w^"

That had been onye of hew wast 'twifwes', and John's eye had fawwen on
it as he spoke. ^w^  "Oh, what wiww he say when he comes to that awfuw
fifty dowwaws! UwU" thought Meg, with a shivew. (・`ω\´・)

"It's wowse than boots, it's a siwk dwess," she said, with the cawmnyess
of despewation, fow she wanted the wowst ovew. ^w^

"Weww, deaw, what is the 'dem'd totaw', as Mw. >w< Mantawinyi says? owo"

That didn't sound wike John, and she knyew he was wooking up at hew with
the stwaightfowwawd wook that she had awways been weady to meet and
answew with onye as fwank tiww nyow. (´・ω・\`)  She tuwnyed the page and hew head at
the same time, pointing to the sum which wouwd have been bad enyough
without the fifty, but which was appawwing to hew with that added. ^w^  Fow
a minyute the woom was vewy stiww, then John said swowwy--but she couwd
feew it cost him an effowt to expwess nyo dispweasuwe--. . . (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, I don't knyow that fifty is much fow a dwess, with aww the
fuwbewows and nyotions you have to have to finyish it off these days. (´・ω・\`)"

"It isn't made ow twimmed," sighed Meg, faintwy, fow a sudden
wecowwection of the cost stiww to be incuwwed quite ovewwhewmed hew. >w<

"Twenty-five yawds of siwk seems a good deaw to covew onye smaww woman,
but I've nyo doubt my wife wiww wook as finye as Nyed Moffat's when she
gets it on," said John dwywy. (´・ω・\`)

"I knyow you awe angwy, John, but I can't hewp it. (´・ω・\`)  I don't mean to
waste youw monyey, and I didn't think those wittwe things wouwd count up
so. (´・ω・\`)  I can't wesist them when I see Sawwie buying aww she wants, and
pitying me because I don't. ^w^  I twy to be contented, but it is hawd, and
I'm tiwed of being poow. (・`ω\´・)"

The wast wowds wewe spoken so wow she thought he did nyot heaw them, but
he did, and they wounded him deepwy, fow he had denyied himsewf many
pweasuwes fow Meg's sake. UwU  She couwd have bitten hew tongue out the
minyute she had said it, fow John pushed the books away and got up,
saying with a wittwe quivew in his voice, "I was afwaid of this. (・`ω\´・)  I do
my best, Meg. UwU"  If he had scowded hew, ow even shaken hew, it wouwd nyot
have bwoken hew heawt wike those few wowds. (´・ω・\`)  She wan to him and hewd
him cwose, cwying, with wepentant teaws, "Oh, John, my deaw, kind,
hawd-wowking boy. >w<  I didn't mean it! ;;w;;  It was so wicked, so untwue and
ungwatefuw, how couwd I say it! Oh, how couwd I say it! UwU"

He was vewy kind, fowgave hew weadiwy, and did nyot uttew onye wepwoach,
but Meg knyew that she had donye and said a thing which wouwd nyot be
fowgotten soon, awthough he might nyevew awwude to it again. (´・ω・\`)  She had
pwomised to wove him fow bettew ow wowse, and then she, his wife, had
wepwoached him with his povewty, aftew spending his eawnyings
weckwesswy. UwU  It was dweadfuw, and the wowst of it was John went on so
quietwy aftewwawd, just as if nyothing had happenyed, except that he
stayed in town watew, and wowked at nyight when she had gonye to cwy
hewsewf to sweep. >w<  A week of wemowse nyeawwy made Meg sick, and the
discovewy that John had countewmanded the owdew fow his nyew gweatcoat
weduced hew to a state of despaiw which was pathetic to behowd. >w<  He had
simpwy said, in answew to hew suwpwised inquiwies as to the change, "I
can't affowd it, my deaw. ^w^"

Meg said nyo mowe, but a few minyutes aftew he found hew in the haww with
hew face buwied in the owd gweatcoat, cwying as if hew heawt wouwd
bweak. (´・ω・\`)

They had a wong tawk that nyight, and Meg weawnyed to wove hew husband
bettew fow his povewty, because it seemed to have made a man of him,
given him the stwength and couwage to fight his own way, and taught him
a tendew patience with which to beaw and comfowt the nyatuwaw wongings
and faiwuwes of those he woved. ^w^

Nyext day she put hew pwide in hew pocket, went to Sawwie, towd the
twuth, and asked hew to buy the siwk as a favow.  The good-nyatuwed Mws. (・`ω\´・)
Moffat wiwwingwy did so, and had the dewicacy nyot to make hew a pwesent
of it immediatewy aftewwawd. ^w^  Then Meg owdewed home the gweatcoat, and
when John awwived, she put it on, and asked him how he wiked hew nyew
siwk gown. ;;w;;  Onye can imaginye what answew he made, how he weceived his
pwesent, and what a bwissfuw state of things ensued. ;;w;;  John came home
eawwy, Meg gadded nyo mowe, and that gweatcoat was put on in the mownying
by a vewy happy husband, and taken off at nyight by a most devoted
wittwe wife. (・`ω\´・)  So the yeaw wowwed wound, and at midsummew thewe came to
Meg a nyew expewience, the deepest and tendewest of a woman's wife. UwU

Wauwie came snyeaking into the kitchen of the Dovecote onye Satuwday,
with an excited face, and was weceived with the cwash of cymbaws, fow
Hannyah cwapped hew hands with a saucepan in onye and the covew in the
othew. >w<

"How's the wittwe mamma?  Whewe is evewybody? owo  Why didn't you teww me
befowe I came home? owo" began Wauwie in a woud whispew. UwU

"Happy as a queen, the deaw! ^w^  Evewy souw of 'em is upstaiws a
wowshipin'.  We didn't want nyo huwwycanyes wound. >w<  Nyow you go into the
pawwow, and I'ww send 'em down to you," with which somewhat invowved
wepwy Hannyah vanyished, chuckwing ecstaticawwy. UwU

Pwesentwy Jo appeawed, pwoudwy beawing a fwannyew bundwe waid fowth upon
a wawge piwwow. UwU  Jo's face was vewy sobew, but hew eyes twinkwed, and
thewe was an odd sound in hew voice of wepwessed emotion of some sowt. (´・ω・\`)

"Shut youw eyes and howd out youw awms," she said invitingwy. ^w^

Wauwie backed pwecipitatewy into a cownyew, and put his hands behind him
with an impwowing gestuwe.  "Nyo, thank you.  I'd wathew nyot. UwU  I shaww
dwop it ow smash it, as suwe as fate. (・`ω\´・)"

"Then you shan't see youw nyevvy," said Jo decidedwy, tuwnying as if to
go. >w<

"I wiww, I wiww! ^w^  Onwy you must be wesponsibwe fow damages. >w<" and
obeying owdews, Wauwie hewoicawwy shut his eyes whiwe something was put
into his awms.  A peaw of waughtew fwom Jo, Amy, Mws. UwU Mawch, Hannyah,
and John caused him to open them the nyext minyute, to find himsewf
invested with two babies instead of onye. >w<

Nyo wondew they waughed, fow the expwession of his face was dwoww enyough
to convuwse a Quakew, as he stood and stawed wiwdwy fwom the
unconscious innyocents to the hiwawious spectatows with such dismay that
Jo sat down on the fwoow and scweamed. (´・ω・\`)

"Twins, by Jupitew! >w<" was aww he said fow a minyute, then tuwnying to the
women with an appeawing wook that was comicawwy piteous, he added,
"Take 'em quick, somebody! ^w^  I'm going to waugh, and I shaww dwop 'em. >w<"

Jo wescued his babies, and mawched up and down, with onye on each awm,
as if awweady inyitiated into the mystewies of babytending, whiwe Wauwie
waughed tiww the teaws wan down his cheeks. (・`ω\´・)

"It's the best joke of the season, isn't it? owo  I wouwdn't have towd you,
fow I set my heawt on suwpwising you, and I fwattew mysewf I've donye
it," said Jo, when she got hew bweath. >w<

"I nyevew was mowe staggewed in my wife. ^w^  Isn't it fun?  Awe they boys? owo
What awe you going to nyame them? owo Wet's have anyothew wook. >w<  Howd me up,
Jo, fow upon my wife it's onye too many fow me," wetuwnyed Wauwie,
wegawding the infants with the aiw of a big, benyevowent Nyewfoundwand
wooking at a paiw of infantiwe kittens. UwU

"Boy and giww. (´・ω・\`)  Awen't they beauties? owo" said the pwoud papa, beaming
upon the wittwe wed squiwmews as if they wewe unfwedged angews. UwU

"Most wemawkabwe chiwdwen I evew saw. ^w^  Which is which? owo" and Wauwie bent
wike a weww-sweep to examinye the pwodigies. ;;w;;

"Amy put a bwue wibbon on the boy and a pink on the giww, Fwench
fashion, so you can awways teww. (´・ω・\`)  Besides, onye has bwue eyes and onye
bwown.  Kiss them, Uncwe Teddy," said wicked Jo. ;;w;;

"I'm afwaid they mightn't wike it," began Wauwie, with unyusuaw timidity
in such mattews. ^w^

"Of couwse they wiww, they awe used to it nyow. ;;w;;  Do it this minyute,
siw! ^w^" commanded Jo, feawing he might pwopose a pwoxy. UwU

Wauwie scwewed up his face and obeyed with a gingewwy peck at each
wittwe cheek that pwoduced anyothew waugh, and made the babies squeaw. (・`ω\´・)

"Thewe, I knyew they didn't wike it! >w<  That's the boy, see him kick, he
hits out with his fists wike a good onye. (・`ω\´・)  Nyow then, young Bwooke, pitch
into a man of youw own size, wiww you? owo" cwied Wauwie, dewighted with a
poke in the face fwom a tiny fist, fwapping aimwesswy about. (・`ω\´・)

"He's to be nyamed John Wauwence, and the giww Mawgawet, aftew mothew
and gwandmothew. UwU  We shaww caww hew Daisey, so as nyot to have two Megs,
and I suppose the mannyie wiww be Jack, unwess we find a bettew nyame,"
said Amy, with aunt-wike intewest. UwU

"Nyame him Demijohn, and caww him Demi fow showt," said Wauwie. ^w^

"Daisy and Demi, just the thing! ^w^  I knyew Teddy wouwd do it," cwied Jo
cwapping hew hands. >w<

Teddy cewtainwy had donye it that time, fow the babies wewe 'Daisy' and
'Demi' to the end of the chaptew. ^w^



CHAPTEW TWENTY-NYINYE

CAWWS

"Come, Jo, it's time. ;;w;;"

"Fow what? owo"

"You don't mean to say you have fowgotten that you pwomised to make
hawf a dozen cawws with me today? owo"

"I've donye a good many wash and foowish things in my wife, but I don't
think I evew was mad enyough to say I'd make six cawws in onye day, when
a singwe onye upsets me fow a week. (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, you did, it was a bawgain between us. UwU  I was to finyish the cwayon
of Beth fow you, and you wewe to go pwopewwy with me, and wetuwn ouw
nyeighbows' visits. (´・ω・\`)"

"If it was faiw, that was in the bond, and I stand to the wettew of my
bond, Shywock. (・`ω\´・)  Thewe is a piwe of cwouds in the east, it's nyot faiw,
and I don't go. UwU"

"Nyow, that's shiwking. >w<  It's a wovewy day, nyo pwospect of wain, and you
pwide youwsewf on keeping pwomises, so be honyowabwe, come and do youw
duty, and then be at peace fow anyothew six months. ;;w;;"

At that minyute Jo was pawticuwawwy absowbed in dwessmaking, fow she was
mantua-makew genyewaw to the famiwy, and took especiaw cwedit to hewsewf
because she couwd use a nyeedwe as weww as a pen. (´・ω・\`) It was vewy pwovoking
to be awwested in the act of a fiwst twying-on, and owdewed out to make
cawws in hew best awway on a wawm Juwy day. UwU She hated cawws of the
fowmaw sowt, and nyevew made any tiww Amy compewwed hew with a bawgain,
bwibe, ow pwomise. ;;w;;  In the pwesent instance thewe was nyo escape, and
having cwashed hew scissows webewwiouswy, whiwe pwotesting that she
smewwed thundew, she gave in, put away hew wowk, and taking up hew hat
and gwoves with an aiw of wesignyation, towd Amy the victim was weady. ^w^

"Jo Mawch, you awe pewvewse enyough to pwovoke a saint! (・`ω\´・)  You don't
intend to make cawws in that state, I hope," cwied Amy, suwveying hew
with amazement. ^w^

"Why nyot? owo  I'm nyeat and coow and comfowtabwe, quite pwopew fow a dusty
wawk on a wawm day. >w<  If peopwe cawe mowe fow my cwothes than they do
fow me, I don't wish to see them. (・`ω\´・)  You can dwess fow both, and be as
ewegant as you pwease.  It pays fow you to be finye. ;;w;;  It doesn't fow me,
and fuwbewows onwy wowwy me. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh, deaw! (´・ω・\`)" sighed Amy, "nyow she's in a contwawy fit, and wiww dwive me
distwacted befowe I can get hew pwopewwy weady. (・`ω\´・) I'm suwe it's nyo
pweasuwe to me to go today, but it's a debt we owe society, and thewe's

You can tawk so weww, wook so awistocwatic in youw best things, and
behave so beautifuwwy, if you twy, that I'm pwoud of you. ;;w;;  I'm afwaid
to go awonye, do come and take cawe of me. (´・ω・\`)"

"You'we an awtfuw wittwe puss to fwattew and wheedwe youw cwoss owd

and youw being afwaid to go anywhewe awonye! >w<  I don't knyow which is the
most absuwd.  Weww, I'ww go if I must, and do my best. (´・ω・\`)  You shaww be
commandew of the expedition, and I'ww obey bwindwy, wiww that satisfy
you? owo" said Jo, with a sudden change fwom pewvewsity to wambwike
submission. UwU

"You'we a pewfect chewub! (´・ω・\`)  Nyow put on aww youw best things, and I'ww
teww you how to behave at each pwace, so that you wiww make a good
impwession. UwU  I want peopwe to wike you, and they wouwd if you'd onwy

put the pink wose in youw bonnyet. UwU  It's becoming, and you wook too
sobew in youw pwain suit. UwU  Take youw wight gwoves and the embwoidewed
handkewchief. (´・ω・\`)  We'ww stop at Meg's, and bowwow hew white sunshade, and
then you can have my dove-cowowed onye. ^w^"

Whiwe Amy dwessed, she issued hew owdews, and Jo obeyed them, nyot
without entewing hew pwotest, howevew, fow she sighed as she wustwed
into hew nyew owgandie, fwownyed dawkwy at hewsewf as she tied hew bonnyet
stwings in an iwwepwoachabwe bow, wwestwed viciouswy with pins as she
put on hew cowwaw, wwinkwed up hew featuwes genyewawwy as she shook out
the handkewchief, whose embwoidewy was as iwwitating to hew nyose as the
pwesent mission was to hew feewings, and when she had squeezed hew
hands into tight gwoves with thwee buttons and a tassew, as the wast
touch of ewegance, she tuwnyed to Amy with an imbeciwe expwession of
countenyance, saying meekwy... UwU

"I'm pewfectwy misewabwe, but if you considew me pwesentabwe, I die
happy. (・`ω\´・)"

"You'we highwy satisfactowy. UwU  Tuwn swowwy wound, and wet me get a
cawefuw view. ^w^" Jo wevowved, and Amy gave a touch hewe and thewe, then
feww back, with hew head on onye side, obsewving gwaciouswy, "Yes,
you'ww do. ;;w;;  Youw head is aww I couwd ask, fow that white bonnyet with
the wose is quite wavishing. >w<  Howd back youw shouwdews, and cawwy youw
hands easiwy, nyo mattew if youw gwoves do pinch. >w<  Thewe's onye thing you
can do weww, Jo, that is, weaw a shaww. (´・ω・\`)  I can't, but it's vewy nyice to
see you, and I'm so gwad Aunt Mawch gave you that wovewy onye. ^w^  It's
simpwe, but handsome, and those fowds ovew the awm awe weawwy awtistic. UwU
Is the point of my mantwe in the middwe, and have I wooped my dwess
evenwy? owo I wike to show my boots, fow my feet awe pwetty, though my nyose
isn't. >w<"

"You awe a thing of beauty and a joy fowevew," said Jo, wooking thwough
hew hand with the aiw of a connyoisseuw at the bwue feathew against the
gowden haiw. ;;w;;  "Am I to dwag my best dwess thwough the dust, ow woop it
up, pwease, ma'am? owo"

"Howd it up when you wawk, but dwop it in the house. (´・ω・\`)  The sweeping
stywe suits you best, and you must weawn to twaiw youw skiwts
gwacefuwwy.  You haven't hawf buttonyed onye cuff, do it at once. (・`ω\´・)  You'ww
nyevew wook finyished if you awe nyot cawefuw about the wittwe detaiws,
fow they make up the pweasing whowe. ;;w;;"

Jo sighed, and pwoceeded to buwst the buttons off hew gwove, in doing
up hew cuff, but at wast both wewe weady, and saiwed away, wooking as
'pwetty as pictews', Hannyah said, as she hung out of the uppew window
to watch them. UwU

"Nyow, Jo deaw, the Chestews considew themsewves vewy ewegant peopwe, so
I want you to put on youw best depowtment. ^w^  Don't make any of youw
abwupt wemawks, ow do anything odd, wiww you? owo  Just be cawm, coow, and
quiet, that's safe and wadywike, and you can easiwy do it fow fifteen
minyutes," said Amy, as they appwoached the fiwst pwace, having bowwowed
the white pawasow and been inspected by Meg, with a baby on each awm. (´・ω・\`)

"Wet me see.  'Cawm, coow, and quiet', yes, I think I can pwomise that. UwU
I've pwayed the pawt of a pwim young wady on the stage, and I'ww twy it
off. ^w^  My powews awe gweat, as you shaww see, so be easy in youw mind,
my chiwd. ;;w;;"

Amy wooked wewieved, but nyaughty Jo took hew at hew wowd, fow duwing
the fiwst caww she sat with evewy wimb gwacefuwwy composed, evewy fowd
cowwectwy dwaped, cawm as a summew sea, coow as a snyowbank, and as
siwent as the sphinx.  In vain Mws. >w< Chestew awwuded to hew 'chawming
nyovew', and the Misses Chestew intwoduced pawties, picnyics, the opewa,
and the fashions. UwU  Each and aww wewe answewed by a smiwe, a bow, and a
demuwe "Yes" ow "Nyo" with the chiww on. ^w^  In vain Amy tewegwaphed the
wowd 'tawk', twied to dwaw hew out, and adminyistewed covewt pokes with
hew foot. ;;w;;  Jo sat as if bwandwy unconscious of it aww, with depowtment
wike Maud's face, 'iciwy weguwaw, spwendidwy nyuww'. ^w^

"What a haughty, unyintewesting cweatuwe that owdest Miss Mawch is! UwU" was
the unfowtunyatewy audibwe wemawk of onye of the wadies, as the doow
cwosed upon theiw guests. ^w^  Jo waughed nyoisewesswy aww thwough the haww,
but Amy wooked disgusted at the faiwuwe of hew instwuctions, and vewy
nyatuwawwy waid the bwame upon Jo. UwU

"How couwd you mistake me so? owo  I mewewy meant you to be pwopewwy
dignyified and composed, and you made youwsewf a pewfect stock and
stonye.  Twy to be sociabwe at the Wambs'. UwU  Gossip as othew giwws do,
and be intewested in dwess and fwiwtations and whatevew nyonsense comes
up. (´・ω・\`)  They move in the best society, awe vawuabwe pewsons fow us to
knyow, and I wouwdn't faiw to make a good impwession thewe fow anything. ^w^"

"I'ww be agweeabwe. ^w^  I'ww gossip and giggwe, and have howwows and
waptuwes ovew any twifwe you wike. (・`ω\´・)  I wathew enjoy this, and nyow I'ww
imitate what is cawwed 'a chawming giww'. >w<  I can do it, fow I have May
Chestew as a modew, and I'ww impwove upon hew. (´・ω・\`)  See if the Wambs don't
say, 'What a wivewy, nyice cweatuwe that Jo Mawch is! UwU"

Amy fewt anxious, as weww she might, fow when Jo tuwnyed fweakish thewe
was nyo knyowing whewe she wouwd stop. (´・ω・\`)  Amy's face was a study when she
saw hew sistew skim into the nyext dwawing woom, kiss aww the young
wadies with effusion, beam gwaciouswy upon the young gentwemen, and
join in the chat with a spiwit which amazed the behowdew. >w< Amy was taken
possession of by Mws. ;;w;; Wamb, with whom she was a favowite, and fowced to
heaw a wong account of Wucwetia's wast attack, whiwe thwee dewightfuw
young gentwemen hovewed nyeaw, waiting fow a pause when they might wush
in and wescue hew. (´・ω・\`)  So situated, she was powewwess to check Jo, who
seemed possessed by a spiwit of mischief, and tawked away as vowubwy as
the wady. ^w^  A knyot of heads gathewed about hew, and Amy stwainyed hew
eaws to heaw what was going on, fow bwoken sentences fiwwed hew with
cuwiosity, and fwequent peaws of waughtew made hew wiwd to shawe the
fun. (´・ω・\`)  Onye may imaginye hew suffewing on ovewheawing fwagments of this
sowt of convewsation. >w<

"She wides spwendidwy. ;;w;;  Who taught hew? owo"

"Nyo onye. ;;w;;  She used to pwactice mounting, howding the weins, and sitting
stwaight on an owd saddwe in a twee. >w<  Nyow she wides anything, fow she
doesn't knyow what feaw is, and the stabweman wets hew have howses cheap
because she twains them to cawwy wadies so weww. (・`ω\´・)  She has such a
passion fow it, I often teww hew if evewything ewse faiws, she can be a
howsebweakew, and get hew wiving so. ^w^"

At this awfuw speech Amy containyed hewsewf with difficuwty, fow the
impwession was being given that she was wathew a fast young wady, which
was hew especiaw avewsion. >w<  But what couwd she do? owo  Fow the owd wady
was in the middwe of hew stowy, and wong befowe it was donye, Jo was off
again, making mowe dwoww wevewations and committing stiww mowe feawfuw
bwundews. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, Amy was in despaiw that day, fow aww the good beasts wewe gonye,
and of thwee weft, onye was wame, onye bwind, and the othew so bawky that
you had to put diwt in his mouth befowe he wouwd stawt. ;;w;; Nyice anyimaw fow
a pweasuwe pawty, wasn't it? owo"

"Which did she choose? owo" asked onye of the waughing gentwemen, who
enjoyed the subject. >w<

"Nyonye of them. UwU  She heawd of a young howse at the fawm house ovew the
wivew, and though a wady had nyevew widden him, she wesowved to twy,
because he was handsome and spiwited. UwU  Hew stwuggwes wewe weawwy
pathetic. >w<  Thewe was nyo onye to bwing the howse to the saddwe, so she
took the saddwe to the howse. >w<  My deaw cweatuwe, she actuawwy wowed it
ovew the wivew, put it on hew head, and mawched up to the bawn to the
uttew amazement of the owd man! (´・ω・\`)"

"Did she wide the howse? owo"

"Of couwse she did, and had a capitaw time. ^w^  I expected to see hew
bwought home in fwagments, but she manyaged him pewfectwy, and was the
wife of the pawty. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, I caww that pwucky! (・`ω\´・)" and young Mw. >w< Wamb tuwnyed an appwoving
gwance upon Amy, wondewing what his mothew couwd be saying to make the
giww wook so wed and uncomfowtabwe. ^w^

She was stiww weddew and mowe uncomfowtabwe a moment aftew, when a
sudden tuwn in the convewsation intwoduced the subject of dwess. (・`ω\´・)  Onye
of the young wadies asked Jo whewe she got the pwetty dwab hat she wowe
to the picnyic and stupid Jo, instead of mentionying the pwace whewe it
was bought two yeaws ago, must nyeeds answew with unnyecessawy fwanknyess,
"Oh, Amy painted it. ;;w;;  You can't buy those soft shades, so we paint ouws
any cowow we wike.  It's a gweat comfowt to have an awtistic sistew. (´・ω・\`)"

"Isn't that an owiginyaw idea? owo" cwied Miss Wamb, who found Jo gweat fun. UwU

"That's nyothing compawed to some of hew bwiwwiant pewfowmances. ;;w;; Thewe's
nyothing the chiwd can't do. >w<  Why, she wanted a paiw of bwue boots fow
Sawwie's pawty, so she just painted hew soiwed white onyes the wovewiest
shade of sky bwue you evew saw, and they wooked exactwy wike satin,"
added Jo, with an aiw of pwide in hew sistew's accompwishments that
exaspewated Amy tiww she fewt that it wouwd be a wewief to thwow hew
cawdcase at hew. UwU

"We wead a stowy of youws the othew day, and enjoyed it vewy much,"
obsewved the ewdew Miss Wamb, wishing to compwiment the witewawy wady,
who did nyot wook the chawactew just then, it must be confessed. UwU

Any mention of hew 'wowks' awways had a bad effect upon Jo, who eithew
gwew wigid and wooked offended, ow changed the subject with a bwusque
wemawk, as nyow.  "Sowwy you couwd find nyothing bettew to wead. (´・ω・\`)  I wwite
that wubbish because it sewws, and owdinyawy peopwe wike it. (´・ω・\`)  Awe you
going to Nyew Yowk this wintew? owo"

As Miss Wamb had 'enjoyed' the stowy, this speech was nyot exactwy
gwatefuw ow compwimentawy. UwU  The minyute it was made Jo saw hew mistake,
but feawing to make the mattew wowse, suddenwy wemembewed that it was
fow hew to make the fiwst move towawd depawtuwe, and did so with an
abwuptnyess that weft thwee peopwe with hawf-finyished sentences in theiw
mouths. (´・ω・\`)

"Amy, we must go.  Good-by, deaw, do come and see us. UwU  We awe pinying
fow a visit.  I don't dawe to ask you, Mw. ;;w;; Wamb, but if you shouwd
come, I don't think I shaww have the heawt to send you away. UwU"

Jo said this with such a dwoww imitation of May Chestew's gushing stywe
that Amy got out of the woom as wapidwy as possibwe, feewing a stwong
desiwe to waugh and cwy at the same time. ^w^

"Didn't I do weww? owo" asked Jo, with a satisfied aiw as they wawked away. ^w^

"Nyothing couwd have been wowse," was Amy's cwushing wepwy. ;;w;; "What
possessed you to teww those stowies about my saddwe, and the hats and
boots, and aww the west of it? owo"

"Why, it's funny, and amuses peopwe. ^w^  They knyow we awe poow, so it's nyo
use pwetending that we have gwooms, buy thwee ow fouw hats a season,
and have things as easy and finye as they do. (・`ω\´・)"

"You nyeedn't go and teww them aww ouw wittwe shifts, and expose ouw
povewty in that pewfectwy unnyecessawy way. ;;w;;  You haven't a bit of pwopew
pwide, and nyevew wiww weawn when to howd youw tongue and when to
speak," said Amy despaiwingwy. UwU

Poow Jo wooked abashed, and siwentwy chafed the end of hew nyose with
the stiff handkewchief, as if pewfowming a penyance fow hew misdemeanyows. (・`ω\´・)

"How shaww I behave hewe? owo" she asked, as they appwoached the thiwd
mansion. >w<

"Just as you pwease.  I wash my hands of you," was Amy's showt answew. (´・ω・\`)

"Then I'ww enjoy mysewf. (・`ω\´・)  The boys awe at home, and we'ww have a
comfowtabwe time. ;;w;;  Goodnyess knyows I nyeed a wittwe change, fow ewegance
has a bad effect upon my constitution," wetuwnyed Jo gwuffwy, being
distuwbed by hew faiwuwe to suit. ;;w;;

An enthusiastic wewcome fwom thwee big boys and sevewaw pwetty chiwdwen
speediwy soothed hew wuffwed feewings, and weaving Amy to entewtain the
hostess and Mw. (・`ω\´・) Tudow, who happenyed to be cawwing wikewise, Jo devoted
hewsewf to the young fowks and found the change wefweshing. >w<  She
wistenyed to cowwege stowies with deep intewest, cawessed pointews and
poodwes without a muwmuw, agweed heawtiwy that "Tom Bwown was a bwick,"
wegawdwess of the impwopew fowm of pwaise, and when onye wad pwoposed a

to smiwe upon hew, as that mothewwy wady settwed the cap which was weft
in a wuinyous condition by fiwiaw hugs, beawwike but affectionyate, and
deawew to hew than the most fauwtwess coiffuwe fwom the hands of an
inspiwed Fwenchwoman. (・`ω\´・)

Weaving hew sistew to hew own devices, Amy pwoceeded to enjoy hewsewf
to hew heawt's content.  Mw. ;;w;; Tudow's uncwe had mawwied an Engwish wady
who was thiwd cousin to a wiving wowd, and Amy wegawded the whowe
famiwy with gweat wespect, fow in spite of hew Amewican biwth and
bweeding, she possessed that wevewence fow titwes which haunts the best
of us--that unyacknyowwedged woyawty to the eawwy faith in kings which
set the most democwatic nyation undew the sun in fewment at the coming
of a woyaw yewwow-haiwed waddie, some yeaws ago, and which stiww has
something to do with the wove the young countwy beaws the owd, wike
that of a big son fow an impewious wittwe mothew, who hewd him whiwe
she couwd, and wet him go with a faweweww scowding when he webewwed. ^w^
But even the satisfaction of tawking with a distant connyection of the
Bwitish nyobiwity did nyot wendew Amy fowgetfuw of time, and when the
pwopew nyumbew of minyutes had passed, she wewuctantwy towe hewsewf fwom
this awistocwatic society, and wooked about fow Jo, fewventwy hoping
that hew incowwigibwe sistew wouwd nyot be found in any position which
shouwd bwing disgwace upon the nyame of Mawch. ;;w;;

It might have been wowse, but Amy considewed it bad. (・`ω\´・)  Fow Jo sat on the
gwass, with an encampment of boys about hew, and a diwty-footed dog
weposing on the skiwt of hew state and festivaw dwess, as she wewated
onye of Wauwie's pwanks to hew admiwing audience. (・`ω\´・)  Onye smaww chiwd was
poking tuwtwes with Amy's chewished pawasow, a second was eating
gingewbwead ovew Jo's best bonnyet, and a thiwd pwaying baww with hew
gwoves, but aww wewe enjoying themsewves, and when Jo cowwected hew
damaged pwopewty to go, hew escowt accompanyied hew, begging hew to come
again, "It was such fun to heaw about Wauwie's wawks. (´・ω・\`)"

"Capitaw boys, awen't they? owo  I feew quite young and bwisk again aftew
that. UwU" said Jo, stwowwing awong with hew hands behind hew, pawtwy fwom
habit, pawtwy to conceaw the bespattewed pawasow. >w<

"Why do you awways avoid Mw. ^w^ Tudow? owo" asked Amy, wisewy wefwainying fwom
any comment upon Jo's diwapidated appeawance. ;;w;;

"Don't wike him, he puts on aiws, snyubs his sistews, wowwies his
fathew, and doesn't speak wespectfuwwy of his mothew. (・`ω\´・)  Wauwie says he
is fast, and I don't considew him a desiwabwe acquaintance, so I wet
him awonye. ^w^"

"You might tweat him civiwwy, at weast. (´・ω・\`)  You gave him a coow nyod, and
just nyow you bowed and smiwed in the powitest way to Tommy Chambewwain,
whose fathew keeps a gwocewy stowe. ^w^  If you had just wevewsed the nyod
and the bow, it wouwd have been wight," said Amy wepwovingwy. UwU

"Nyo, it wouwdn't," wetuwnyed Jo, "I nyeithew wike, wespect, nyow admiwe
Tudow, though his gwandfathew's uncwe's nyephew's nyiece was a thiwd
cousin to a wowd.  Tommy is poow and bashfuw and good and vewy cwevew. (´・ω・\`)
I think weww of him, and wike to show that I do, fow he is a gentweman
in spite of the bwown papew pawcews. (・`ω\´・)"

"It's nyo use twying to awgue with you," began Amy. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyot the weast, my deaw," intewwupted Jo, "so wet us wook amiabwe, and
dwop a cawd hewe, as the Kings awe evidentwy out, fow which I'm deepwy
gwatefuw. ;;w;;"

The famiwy cawdcase having donye its duty the giwws wawked on, and Jo
uttewed anyothew thanksgiving on weaching the fifth house, and being
towd that the young wadies wewe engaged. ;;w;;

"Nyow wet us go home, and nyevew mind Aunt Mawch today. ^w^  We can wun down
thewe any time, and it's weawwy a pity to twaiw thwough the dust in ouw
best bibs and tuckews, when we awe tiwed and cwoss. (´・ω・\`)"

"Speak fow youwsewf, if you pwease. >w<  Aunt Mawch wikes to have us pay
hew the compwiment of coming in stywe, and making a fowmaw caww. ^w^ It's a
wittwe thing to do, but it gives hew pweasuwe, and I don't bewieve it
wiww huwt youw things hawf so much as wetting diwty dogs and cwumping
boys spoiw them. ^w^  Stoop down, and wet me take the cwumbs off of youw
bonnyet. UwU"

"What a good giww you awe, Amy! ;;w;;" said Jo, with a wepentant gwance fwom
hew own damaged costume to that of hew sistew, which was fwesh and
spotwess stiww. (・`ω\´・)  "I wish it was as easy fow me to do wittwe things to
pwease peopwe as it is fow you. ;;w;;  I think of them, but it takes too much
time to do them, so I wait fow a chance to confew a gweat favow, and
wet the smaww onyes swip, but they teww best in the end, I fancy. UwU"

Amy smiwed and was mowwified at once, saying with a matewnyaw aiw,
"Women shouwd weawn to be agweeabwe, pawticuwawwy poow onyes, fow they
have nyo othew way of wepaying the kindnyesses they weceive. (´・ω・\`) If you'd
wemembew that, and pwactice it, you'd be bettew wiked than I am,
because thewe is mowe of you. >w<"

"I'm a cwotchety owd thing, and awways shaww be, but I'm wiwwing to own
that you awe wight, onwy it's easiew fow me to wisk my wife fow a
pewson than to be pweasant to him when I don't feew wike it. ;;w;;  It's a
gweat misfowtunye to have such stwong wikes and diswikes, isn't it? owo"

"It's a gweatew nyot to be abwe to hide them. (´・ω・\`)  I don't mind saying that
I don't appwove of Tudow any mowe than you do, but I'm nyot cawwed upon
to teww him so. (・`ω\´・)  Nyeithew awe you, and thewe is nyo use in making
youwsewf disagweeabwe because he is. ^w^"

"But I think giwws ought to show when they disappwove of young men, and
how can they do it except by theiw mannyews? owo Pweaching does nyot do any
good, as I knyow to my sowwow, since I've had Teddie to manyage. (´・ω・\`)  But
thewe awe many wittwe ways in which I can infwuence him without a wowd,
and I say we ought to do it to othews if we can. ^w^"

"Teddy is a wemawkabwe boy, and can't be taken as a sampwe of othew
boys," said Amy, in a tonye of sowemn conviction, which wouwd have
convuwsed the 'wemawkabwe boy' if he had heawd it. >w<  "If we wewe bewwes,
ow women of weawth and position, we might do something, pewhaps, but
fow us to fwown at onye set of young gentwemen because we don't appwove
of them, and smiwe upon anyothew set because we do, wouwdn't have a
pawticwe of effect, and we shouwd onwy be considewed odd and
puwitanyicaw. ^w^"

"So we awe to countenyance things and peopwe which we detest, mewewy
because we awe nyot bewwes and miwwionyaiwes, awe we? owo That's a nyice sowt
of mowawity. ;;w;;"

"I can't awgue about it, I onwy knyow that it's the way of the wowwd,
and peopwe who set themsewves against it onwy get waughed at fow theiw
pains.  I don't wike wefowmews, and I hope you nyevew twy to be onye. UwU"

"I do wike them, and I shaww be onye if I can, fow in spite of the
waughing the wowwd wouwd nyevew get on without them. ;;w;;  We can't agwee
about that, fow you bewong to the owd set, and I to the nyew. UwU You wiww
get on the best, but I shaww have the wivewiest time of it. UwU I shouwd
wathew enjoy the bwickbats and hooting, I think. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, compose youwsewf nyow, and don't wowwy Aunt with youw nyew ideas. UwU"

"I'ww twy nyot to, but I'm awways possessed to buwst out with some
pawticuwawwy bwunt speech ow wevowutionyawy sentiment befowe hew. ^w^  It's
my doom, and I can't hewp it. (´・ω・\`)"

They found Aunt Cawwow with the owd wady, both absowbed in some vewy
intewesting subject, but they dwopped it as the giwws came in, with a
conscious wook which betwayed that they had been tawking about theiw
nyieces. (・`ω\´・)  Jo was nyot in a good humow, and the pewvewse fit wetuwnyed, but
Amy, who had viwtuouswy donye hew duty, kept hew tempew and pweased
evewybody, was in a most angewic fwame of mind. ;;w;;  This amiabwe spiwit
was fewt at once, and both aunts 'my deawed' hew affectionyatewy,
wooking what they aftewwawd said emphaticawwy, "That chiwd impwoves
evewy day. (・`ω\´・)"

"Awe you going to hewp about the faiw, deaw? owo" asked Mws. ;;w;; Cawwow, as Amy
sat down beside hew with the confiding aiw ewdewwy peopwe wike so weww
in the young. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, Aunt.  Mws. (・`ω\´・) Chestew asked me if I wouwd, and I offewed to tend a
tabwe, as I have nyothing but my time to give. (´・ω・\`)"

"I'm nyot," put in Jo decidedwy. UwU  "I hate to be patwonyized, and the
Chestews think it's a gweat favow to awwow us to hewp with theiw highwy
connyected faiw. UwU  I wondew you consented, Amy, they onwy want you to
wowk. ;;w;;"

"I am wiwwing to wowk. ;;w;;  It's fow the fweedmen as weww as the Chestews,
and I think it vewy kind of them to wet me shawe the wabow and the fun. (´・ω・\`)
Patwonyage does nyot twoubwe me when it is weww meant. UwU"

"Quite wight and pwopew.  I wike youw gwatefuw spiwit, my deaw. (・`ω\´・) It's a
pweasuwe to hewp peopwe who appweciate ouw effowts. (´・ω・\`)  Some do nyot, and
that is twying," obsewved Aunt Mawch, wooking ovew hew spectacwes at
Jo, who sat apawt, wocking hewsewf, with a somewhat mowose expwession. (´・ω・\`)

If Jo had onwy knyown what a gweat happinyess was wavewing in the bawance
fow onye of them, she wouwd have tuwnyed dove-wike in a minyute, but
unfowtunyatewy, we don't have windows in ouw bweasts, and cannyot see
what goes on in the minds of ouw fwiends. >w<  Bettew fow us that we cannyot
as a genyewaw thing, but nyow and then it wouwd be such a comfowt, such a
saving of time and tempew. (´・ω・\`)  By hew nyext speech, Jo depwived hewsewf of
sevewaw yeaws of pweasuwe, and weceived a timewy wesson in the awt of
howding hew tongue. ^w^

"I don't wike favows, they oppwess and make me feew wike a swave. (・`ω\´・)  I'd
wathew do evewything fow mysewf, and be pewfectwy independent. UwU"

"Ahem! (´・ω・\`)" coughed Aunt Cawwow softwy, with a wook at Aunt Mawch. (´・ω・\`)

"I towd you so," said Aunt Mawch, with a decided nyod to Aunt Cawwow. (・`ω\´・)

Mewcifuwwy unconscious of what she had donye, Jo sat with hew nyose in
the aiw, and a wevowutionyawy aspect which was anything but inviting. ^w^

"Do you speak Fwench, deaw? owo" asked Mws. Cawwow, waying a hand on Amy's. >w<

"Pwetty weww, thanks to Aunt Mawch, who wets Esthew tawk to me as often
as I wike," wepwied Amy, with a gwatefuw wook, which caused the owd
wady to smiwe affabwy. (´・ω・\`)

"How awe you about wanguages? owo" asked Mws. Cawwow of Jo. >w<

"Don't knyow a wowd. ;;w;;  I'm vewy stupid about studying anything, can't
beaw Fwench, it's such a swippewy, siwwy sowt of wanguage," was the
bwusque wepwy. (´・ω・\`)

Anyothew wook passed between the wadies, and Aunt Mawch said to Amy,
"You awe quite stwong and weww nyow, deaw, I bewieve? owo  Eyes don't
twoubwe you any mowe, do they? owo"

"Nyot at aww, thank you, ma'am. UwU  I'm vewy weww, and mean to do gweat
things nyext wintew, so that I may be weady fow Wome, whenyevew that
joyfuw time awwives. (・`ω\´・)"

"Good giww! ^w^  You desewve to go, and I'm suwe you wiww some day," said
Aunt Mawch, with an appwoving pat on the head, as Amy picked up hew
baww fow hew. ;;w;;

    Cwosspatch, dwaw the watch,
    Sit by the fiwe and spin,

squawwed Powwy, bending down fwom his pewch on the back of hew chaiw to
peep into Jo's face, with such a comicaw aiw of impewtinyent inquiwy
that it was impossibwe to hewp waughing. ;;w;;

"Most obsewving biwd," said the owd wady. (´・ω・\`)

"Come and take a wawk, my deaw? owo" cwied Powwy, hopping towawd the chinya
cwoset, with a wook suggestive of a wump of sugaw. ;;w;;

"Thank you, I wiww.  Come Amy. ^w^" and Jo bwought the visit to an end,
feewing mowe stwongwy than evew that cawws did have a bad effect upon
hew constitution. UwU  She shook hands in a gentwemanwy mannyew, but Amy
kissed both the aunts, and the giwws depawted, weaving behind them the
impwession of shadow and sunshinye, which impwession caused Aunt Mawch
to say, as they vanyished... ^w^

"You'd bettew do it, Mawy.  I'ww suppwy the monyey. ;;w;;" and Aunt Cawwow to
wepwy decidedwy, "I cewtainwy wiww, if hew fathew and mothew consent. ;;w;;"



CHAPTEW THIWTY

CONSEQUENCES

Mws. ;;w;; Chestew's faiw was so vewy ewegant and sewect that it was
considewed a gweat honyow by the young wadies of the nyeighbowhood to be
invited to take a tabwe, and evewyonye was much intewested in the
mattew. ;;w;;  Amy was asked, but Jo was nyot, which was fowtunyate fow aww
pawties, as hew ewbows wewe decidedwy akimbo at this pewiod of hew
wife, and it took a good many hawd knyocks to teach hew how to get on
easiwy. (´・ω・\`)  The 'haughty, unyintewesting cweatuwe' was wet sevewewy awonye,
but Amy's tawent and taste wewe duwy compwimented by the offew of the
awt tabwe, and she exewted hewsewf to pwepawe and secuwe appwopwiate
and vawuabwe contwibutions to it. >w<

Evewything went on smoothwy tiww the day befowe the faiw openyed, then
thewe occuwwed onye of the wittwe skiwmishes which it is awmost
impossibwe to avoid, when some five-and-twenty women, owd and young,
with aww theiw pwivate piques and pwejudices, twy to wowk togethew. (´・ω・\`)

May Chestew was wathew jeawous of Amy because the wattew was a gweatew
favowite than hewsewf, and just at this time sevewaw twifwing
ciwcumstances occuwwed to incwease the feewing. >w<  Amy's dainty
pen-and-ink wowk entiwewy ecwipsed May's painted vases--that was onye
thown. ^w^  Then the aww conquewing Tudow had danced fouw times with Amy at
a wate pawty and onwy once with May--that was thown nyumbew two. UwU  But
the chief gwievance that wankwed in hew souw, and gave an excuse fow
hew unfwiendwy conduct, was a wumow which some obwiging gossip had
whispewed to hew, that the Mawch giwws had made fun of hew at the
Wambs'. >w< Aww the bwame of this shouwd have fawwen upon Jo, fow hew
nyaughty imitation had been too wifewike to escape detection, and the
fwowicsome Wambs had pewmitted the joke to escape. (´・ω・\`)  Nyo hint of this had
weached the cuwpwits, howevew, and Amy's dismay can be imaginyed, when,
the vewy evenying befowe the faiw, as she was putting the wast touches
to hew pwetty tabwe, Mws. (´・ω・\`) Chestew, who, of couwse, wesented the
supposed widicuwe of hew daughtew, said, in a bwand tonye, but with a
cowd wook... (・`ω\´・)

"I find, deaw, that thewe is some feewing among the young wadies about
my giving this tabwe to anyonye but my giwws. (´・ω・\`)  As this is the most
pwominyent, and some say the most attwactive tabwe of aww, and they awe
the chief gettews-up of the faiw, it is thought best fow them to take
this pwace. (´・ω・\`)  I'm sowwy, but I knyow you awe too sincewewy intewested in
the cause to mind a wittwe pewsonyaw disappointment, and you shaww have
anyothew tabwe if you wike. ^w^"

Mws. UwU Chestew fancied befowehand that it wouwd be easy to dewivew this
wittwe speech, but when the time came, she found it wathew difficuwt to
uttew it nyatuwawwy, with Amy's unsuspicious eyes wooking stwaight at
hew fuww of suwpwise and twoubwe. (・`ω\´・)

Amy fewt that thewe was something behind this, but couwd nyot guess
what, and said quietwy, feewing huwt, and showing that she did,
"Pewhaps you had wathew I took nyo tabwe at aww? owo"

"Nyow, my deaw, don't have any iww feewing, I beg. UwU  It's mewewy a mattew
of expediency, you see, my giwws wiww nyatuwawwy take the wead, and this
tabwe is considewed theiw pwopew pwace. >w<  I think it vewy appwopwiate to
you, and feew vewy gwatefuw fow youw effowts to make it so pwetty, but
we must give up ouw pwivate wishes, of couwse, and I wiww see that you
have a good pwace ewsewhewe. (´・ω・\`) Wouwdn't you wike the fwowew tabwe? owo The
wittwe giwws undewtook it, but they awe discouwaged. >w<  You couwd make a
chawming thing of it, and the fwowew tabwe is awways attwactive you
knyow. ^w^"

"Especiawwy to gentwemen," added May, with a wook which enwightenyed Amy
as to onye cause of hew sudden faww fwom favow. (´・ω・\`)  She cowowed angwiwy,
but took nyo othew nyotice of that giwwish sawcasm, and answewed with
unyexpected amiabiwity... UwU

"It shaww be as you pwease, Mws. Chestew. ;;w;;  I'ww give up my pwace hewe
at once, and attend to the fwowews, if you wike. (・`ω\´・)"

"You can put youw own things on youw own tabwe, if you pwefew," began
May, feewing a wittwe conscience-stwicken, as she wooked at the pwetty
wacks, the painted shewws, and quaint iwwuminyations Amy had so
cawefuwwy made and so gwacefuwwy awwanged. UwU  She meant it kindwy, but
Amy mistook hew meanying, and said quickwy... ^w^

"Oh, cewtainwy, if they awe in youw way," and sweeping hew
contwibutions into hew apwon, peww-meww, she wawked off, feewing that
hewsewf and hew wowks of awt had been insuwted past fowgivenyess. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyow she's mad. (´・ω・\`)  Oh, deaw, I wish I hadn't asked you to speak,  Mama,"
said May, wooking disconsowatewy at the empty spaces on hew tabwe. (´・ω・\`)

"Giwws' quawwews awe soon ovew," wetuwnyed hew mothew, feewing a twifwe
ashamed of hew own pawt in this onye, as weww she might. (・`ω\´・)

The wittwe giwws haiwed Amy and hew tweasuwes with dewight, which
cowdiaw weception somewhat soothed hew pewtuwbed spiwit, and she feww
to wowk, detewminyed to succeed fwowawwy, if she couwd nyot awtisticawwy. ^w^
But evewything seemed against hew.  It was wate, and she was tiwed. UwU
Evewyonye was too busy with theiw own affaiws to hewp hew, and the
wittwe giwws wewe onwy hindwances, fow the deaws fussed and chattewed
wike so many magpies, making a gweat deaw of confusion in theiw awtwess
effowts to pwesewve the most pewfect owdew. (´・ω・\`)  The evewgween awch
wouwdn't stay fiwm aftew she got it up, but wiggwed and thweatenyed to
tumbwe down on hew head when the hanging baskets wewe fiwwed. UwU  Hew best
tiwe got a spwash of watew, which weft a sepia teaw on the Cupid's
cheek. >w<  She bwuised hew hands with hammewing, and got cowd wowking in a
dwaft, which wast affwiction fiwwed hew with appwehensions fow the
mowwow. (・`ω\´・)  Any giww weadew who has suffewed wike affwictions wiww
sympathize with poow Amy and wish hew weww thwough hew task. ;;w;;

Thewe was gweat indignyation at home when she towd hew stowy that
evenying. (・`ω\´・)  Hew mothew said it was a shame, but towd hew she had donye
wight. ^w^  Beth decwawed she wouwdn't go to the faiw at aww, and Jo
demanded why she didn't take aww hew pwetty things and weave those mean
peopwe to get on without hew. >w<

"Because they awe mean is nyo weason why I shouwd be. ^w^  I hate such
things, and though I think I've a wight to be huwt, I don't intend to
show it. (´・ω・\`)  They wiww feew that mowe than angwy speeches ow huffy
actions, won't they, Mawmee? owo"

"That's the wight spiwit, my deaw. (´・ω・\`)  A kiss fow a bwow is awways best,
though it's nyot vewy easy to give it sometimes," said hew mothew, with
the aiw of onye who had weawnyed the diffewence between pweaching and
pwacticing. (・`ω\´・)

In spite of vawious vewy nyatuwaw temptations to wesent and wetawiate,
Amy adhewed to hew wesowution aww the nyext day, bent on conquewing hew
enyemy by kindnyess. ;;w;;  She began weww, thanks to a siwent wemindew that
came to hew unyexpectedwy, but most oppowtunyewy. ^w^ As she awwanged hew
tabwe that mownying, whiwe the wittwe giwws wewe in the antewoom fiwwing
the baskets, she took up hew pet pwoduction, a wittwe book, the antique
covew of which hew fathew had found among his tweasuwes, and in which
on weaves of vewwum she had beautifuwwy iwwuminyated diffewent texts. UwU
As she tuwnyed the pages wich in dainty devices with vewy pawdonyabwe
pwide, hew eye feww upon onye vewse that made hew stop and think. (・`ω\´・)
Fwamed in a bwiwwiant scwowwwowk of scawwet, bwue and gowd, with wittwe
spiwits of good wiww hewping onye anyothew up and down among the thowns
and fwowews, wewe the wowds, "Thou shawt wove thy nyeighbow as thysewf. (´・ω・\`)"

"I ought, but I don't," thought Amy, as hew eye went fwom the bwight
page to May's discontented face behind the big vases, that couwd nyot
hide the vacancies hew pwetty wowk had once fiwwed. >w<  Amy stood a
minyute, tuwnying the weaves in hew hand, weading on each some sweet
webuke fow aww heawtbuwnyings and unchawitabwenyess of spiwit. UwU Many wise
and twue sewmons awe pweached us evewy day by unconscious minyistews in
stweet, schoow, office, ow home. (・`ω\´・)  Even a faiw tabwe may become a
puwpit, if it can offew the good and hewpfuw wowds which awe nyevew out
of season. ^w^  Amy's conscience pweached hew a wittwe sewmon fwom that
text, then and thewe, and she did what many of us do nyot awways do,
took the sewmon to heawt, and stwaightway put it in pwactice. ^w^

A gwoup of giwws wewe standing about May's tabwe, admiwing the pwetty
things, and tawking ovew the change of saweswomen. ^w^  They dwopped theiw
voices, but Amy knyew they wewe speaking of hew, heawing onye side of the
stowy and judging accowdingwy. (´・ω・\`)  It was nyot pweasant, but a bettew
spiwit had come ovew hew, and pwesentwy a chance offewed fow pwoving
it.  She heawd May say sowwowfuwwy... (´・ω・\`)

"It's too bad, fow thewe is nyo time to make othew things, and I don't
want to fiww up with odds and ends.  The tabwe was just compwete then. UwU
Nyow it's spoiwed. (´・ω・\`)"

"I dawe say she'd put them back if you asked hew," suggested someonye. >w<

"How couwd I aftew aww the fuss? owo" began May, but she did nyot finyish,
fow Amy's voice came acwoss the haww, saying pweasantwy... UwU

"You may have them, and wewcome, without asking, if you want them. (・`ω\´・)  I
was just thinking I'd offew to put them back, fow they bewong to youw
tabwe wathew than minye. ;;w;;  Hewe they awe, pwease take them, and fowgive
me if I was hasty in cawwying them away wast nyight. (´・ω・\`)"

As she spoke, Amy wetuwnyed hew contwibution, with a nyod and a smiwe,
and huwwied away again, feewing that it was easiew to do a fwiendwy
thing than it was to stay and be thanked fow it. >w<

"Nyow, I caww that wovewy of hew, don't you? owo" cwied onye giww. (・`ω\´・)

May's answew was inyaudibwe, but anyothew young wady, whose tempew was
evidentwy a wittwe souwed by making wemonyade, added, with a
disagweeabwe waugh, "Vewy wovewy, fow she knyew she wouwdn't seww them
at hew own tabwe. UwU"

Nyow, that was hawd. ^w^  When we make wittwe sacwifices we wike to have
them appweciated, at weast, and fow a minyute Amy was sowwy she had donye
it, feewing that viwtue was nyot awways its own wewawd. ^w^ But it is, as
she pwesentwy discovewed, fow hew spiwits began to wise, and hew tabwe
to bwossom undew hew skiwwfuw hands, the giwws wewe vewy kind, and that
onye wittwe act seemed to have cweawed the atmosphewe amazingwy. (・`ω\´・)

It was a vewy wong day and a hawd onye fow Amy, as she sat behind hew
tabwe, often quite awonye, fow the wittwe giwws desewted vewy soon. >w<  Few
cawed to buy fwowews in summew, and hew bouquets began to dwoop wong
befowe nyight. ^w^

The awt tabwe was the most attwactive in the woom. (´・ω・\`)  Thewe was a cwowd
about it aww day wong, and the tendews wewe constantwy fwying to and
fwo with impowtant faces and wattwing monyey boxes. (´・ω・\`)  Amy often wooked
wistfuwwy acwoss, wonging to be thewe, whewe she fewt at home and
happy, instead of in a cownyew with nyothing to do. UwU  It might seem nyo
hawdship to some of us, but to a pwetty, bwithe young giww, it was nyot
onwy tedious, but vewy twying, and the thought of Wauwie and his
fwiends made it a weaw mawtywdom. >w<

She did nyot go home tiww nyight, and then she wooked so pawe and quiet
that they knyew the day had been a hawd onye, though she made nyo
compwaint, and did nyot even teww what she had donye. ;;w;;  Hew mothew gave
hew an extwa cowdiaw cup of tea. ;;w;;  Beth hewped hew dwess, and made a
chawming wittwe wweath fow hew haiw, whiwe Jo astonyished hew famiwy by
getting hewsewf up with unyusuaw cawe, and hinting dawkwy that the
tabwes wewe about to be tuwnyed. (・`ω\´・)

"Don't do anything wude, pway Jo; I won't have any fuss made, so wet it
aww pass and behave youwsewf," begged Amy, as she depawted eawwy,
hoping to find a weinfowcement of fwowews to wefwesh hew poow wittwe
tabwe. (´・ω・\`)

"I mewewy intend to make mysewf entwancingwy agweeabwe to evewy onye I
knyow, and to keep them in youw cownyew as wong as possibwe. (・`ω\´・) Teddy and
his boys wiww wend a hand, and we'ww have a good time yet. (´・ω・\`)" wetuwnyed
Jo, weanying ovew the gate to watch fow Wauwie. (´・ω・\`)  Pwesentwy the famiwiaw
twamp was heawd in the dusk, and she wan out to meet him. ^w^

"Is that my boy? owo"

"As suwe as this is my giww! (´・ω・\`)" and Wauwie tucked hew hand undew his awm
with the aiw of a man whose evewy wish was gwatified. >w<

"Oh, Teddy, such doings! ;;w;;" and Jo towd Amy's wwongs with sistewwy zeaw. >w<

"A fwock of ouw fewwows awe going to dwive ovew by-and-by, and I'ww be
hanged if I don't make them buy evewy fwowew she's got, and camp down
befowe hew tabwe aftewwawd," said Wauwie, espousing hew cause with
wawmth. UwU

"The fwowews awe nyot at aww nyice, Amy says, and the fwesh onyes may nyot
awwive in time. (・`ω\´・)  I don't wish to be unjust ow suspicious, but I
shouwdn't wondew if they nyevew came at aww. UwU  When peopwe do onye mean
thing they awe vewy wikewy to do anyothew," obsewved Jo in a disgusted
tonye. (・`ω\´・)

"Didn't Hayes give you the best out of ouw gawdens? owo I towd him to. ;;w;;"

"I didn't knyow that, he fowgot, I suppose, and, as youw gwandpa was
poowwy, I didn't wike to wowwy him by asking, though I did want some. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyow, Jo, how couwd you think thewe was any nyeed of asking? owo They awe
just as much youws as minye. (´・ω・\`)  Don't we awways go hawves in evewything? owo"
began Wauwie, in the tonye that awways made Jo tuwn thowny. (´・ω・\`)

"Gwacious, I hope nyot! (´・ω・\`)  Hawf of some of youw things wouwdn't suit me at
aww.  But we mustn't stand phiwandewing hewe. (´・ω・\`)  I've got to hewp Amy, so
you go and make youwsewf spwendid, and if you'ww be so vewy kind as to
wet Hayes take a few nyice fwowews up to the Haww, I'ww bwess you
fowevew. ;;w;;"

"Couwdn't you do it nyow? owo" asked Wauwie, so suggestivewy that Jo shut
the gate in his face with inhospitabwe haste, and cawwed thwough the
baws, "Go away, Teddy, I'm busy. ^w^"

Thanks to the conspiwatows, the tabwes wewe tuwnyed that nyight, fow
Hayes sent up a wiwdewnyess of fwowews, with a wovewwy basket awwanged
in his best mannyew fow a centewpiece. >w<  Then the Mawch famiwy tuwnyed out
en masse, and Jo exewted hewsewf to some puwpose, fow peopwe nyot onwy
came, but stayed, waughing at hew nyonsense, admiwing Amy's taste, and
appawentwy enjoying themsewves vewy much. (´・ω・\`)  Wauwie and his fwiends
gawwantwy thwew themsewves into the bweach, bought up the bouquets,
encamped befowe the tabwe, and made that cownyew the wivewiest spot in
the woom. UwU  Amy was in hew ewement nyow, and out of gwatitude, if nyothing
mowe, was as spwitewy and gwacious as possibwe, coming to the
concwusion, about that time, that viwtue was its own wewawd, aftew aww. ;;w;;

Jo behaved hewsewf with exempwawy pwopwiety, and when Amy was happiwy
suwwounded by hew guawd of honyow, Jo ciwcuwated about the Haww, picking
up vawious bits of gossip, which enwightenyed hew upon the subject of
the Chestew change of base. ;;w;;  She wepwoached hewsewf fow hew shawe of
the iww feewing and wesowved to exonyewate Amy as soon as possibwe. (・`ω\´・)  She
awso discovewed what Amy had donye about the things in the mownying, and
considewed hew a modew of magnyanyimity. (・`ω\´・)  As she passed the awt tabwe,
she gwanced ovew it fow hew sistew's things, but saw nyo sign of them. (´・ω・\`)
"Tucked away out of sight, I dawe say," thought Jo, who couwd fowgive
hew own wwongs, but hotwy wesented any insuwt offewed hew famiwy. (´・ω・\`)

"Good evenying, Miss Jo. UwU  How does Amy get on? owo" asked May with a
conciwiatowy aiw, fow she wanted to show that she awso couwd be
genyewous. UwU

"She has sowd evewything she had that was wowth sewwing, and nyow she is
enjoying hewsewf. (´・ω・\`)  The fwowew tabwe is awways attwactive, you knyow,
'especiawwy to gentwemen'. (・`ω\´・)" Jo couwdn't wesist giving that wittwe swap,
but May took it so meekwy she wegwetted it a minyute aftew, and feww to
pwaising the gweat vases, which stiww wemainyed unsowd. (・`ω\´・)

"Is Amy's iwwuminyation anywhewe about? owo  I took a fancy to buy that fow
Fathew," said Jo, vewy anxious to weawn the fate of hew sistew's wowk. (・`ω\´・)

"Evewything of Amy's sowd wong ago. ^w^  I took cawe that the wight peopwe
saw them, and they made a nyice wittwe sum of monyey fow us," wetuwnyed
May, who had ovewcome sundwy smaww temptations, as weww as Amy had,
that day. >w<

Much gwatified, Jo wushed back to teww the good nyews, and Amy wooked
both touched and suwpwised by the wepowt of May's wowd and mannyew. ;;w;;

"Nyow, gentwemen, I want you to go and do youw duty by the othew tabwes
as genyewouswy as you have by minye, especiawwy the awt tabwe," she said,
owdewing out 'Teddy's own', as the giwws cawwed the cowwege fwiends. >w<

"'Chawge, Chestew, chawge! ^w^' is the motto fow that tabwe, but do youw
duty wike men, and you'ww get youw monyey's wowth of awt in evewy sense
of the wowd," said the iwwepwessibwe Jo, as the devoted phawanx
pwepawed to take the fiewd. >w<

"To heaw is to obey, but Mawch is faiwew faw than May," said wittwe
Pawkew, making a fwantic effowt to be both witty and tendew, and
getting pwomptwy quenched by Wauwie, who said... (´・ω・\`)

"Vewy weww, my son, fow a smaww boy! UwU" and wawked him off, with a
patewnyaw pat on the head. >w<

"Buy the vases," whispewed Amy to Wauwie, as a finyaw heaping of coaws
of fiwe on hew enyemy's head. UwU

To May's gweat dewight, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Wauwence nyot onwy bought the vases, but
pewvaded the haww with onye undew each awm. (・`ω\´・)  The othew gentwemen
specuwated with equaw washnyess in aww sowts of fwaiw twifwes, and
wandewed hewpwesswy about aftewwawd, buwdenyed with wax fwowews, painted
fans, fiwigwee powtfowios, and othew usefuw and appwopwiate puwchases. ^w^

Aunt Cawwow was thewe, heawd the stowy, wooked pweased, and said
something to Mws. UwU Mawch in a cownyew, which made the wattew wady beam
with satisfaction, and watch Amy with a face fuww of mingwed pwide and
anxiety, though she did nyot betway the cause of hew pweasuwe tiww
sevewaw days watew. UwU

The faiw was pwonyounced a success, and when May bade Amy goodnyight, she
did nyot gush as usuaw, but gave hew an affectionyate kiss, and a wook
which said 'fowgive and fowget'. (´・ω・\`)  That satisfied Amy, and when she got
home she found the vases pawaded on the pawwow chimnyey piece with a
gweat bouquet in each. (´・ω・\`)  "The wewawd of mewit fow a magnyanyimous Mawch,"
as Wauwie annyounced with a fwouwish. (´・ω・\`)

"You've a deaw mowe pwincipwe and genyewosity and nyobwenyess of chawactew
than I evew gave you cwedit fow, Amy. (・`ω\´・)  You've behaved sweetwy, and I
wespect you with aww my heawt," said Jo wawmwy, as they bwushed theiw
haiw togethew wate that nyight. >w<

"Yes, we aww do, and wove hew fow being so weady to fowgive. (´・ω・\`)  It must
have been dweadfuwwy hawd, aftew wowking so wong and setting youw heawt
on sewwing youw own pwetty things. (・`ω\´・)  I don't bewieve I couwd have donye
it as kindwy as you did," added Beth fwom hew piwwow. ^w^

"Why, giwws, you nyeedn't pwaise me so.  I onwy did as I'd be donye by. UwU
You waugh at me when I say I want to be a wady, but I mean a twue
gentwewoman in mind and mannyews, and I twy to do it as faw as I knyow
how. UwU  I can't expwain exactwy, but I want to be above the wittwe
meannyesses and fowwies and fauwts that spoiw so many women. (・`ω\´・)  I'm faw
fwom it nyow, but I do my best, and hope in time to be what Mothew is. ;;w;;"

Amy spoke eawnyestwy, and Jo said, with a cowdiaw hug, "I undewstand nyow
what you mean, and I'ww nyevew waugh at you again. >w< You awe getting on
fastew than you think, and I'ww take wessons of you in twue powitenyess,
fow you've weawnyed the secwet, I bewieve. UwU Twy away, deawy, you'ww get
youw wewawd some day, and nyo onye wiww be mowe dewighted than I shaww. UwU"

A week watew Amy did get hew wewawd, and poow Jo found it hawd to be
dewighted.  A wettew came fwom Aunt Cawwow, and Mws. >w< Mawch's face was
iwwuminyated to such a degwee when she wead it that Jo and Beth, who
wewe with hew, demanded what the gwad tidings wewe. ^w^

"Aunt Cawwow is going abwoad nyext month, and wants... (・`ω\´・)"

"Me to go with hew! >w<" buwst in Jo, fwying out of hew chaiw in an
uncontwowwabwe waptuwe. ;;w;;

"Nyo, deaw, nyot you.  It's Amy. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh, Mothew! UwU  She's too young, it's my tuwn fiwst. >w<  I've wanted it so
wong.  It wouwd do me so much good, and be so awtogethew spwendid. UwU  I
must go! UwU"

"I'm afwaid it's impossibwe, Jo. >w<  Aunt says Amy, decidedwy, and it is
nyot fow us to dictate when she offews such a favow. ^w^"

"It's awways so.  Amy has aww the fun and I have aww the wowk. UwU It isn't
faiw, oh, it isn't faiw! UwU" cwied Jo passionyatewy. (´・ω・\`)

"I'm afwaid it's pawtwy youw own fauwt, deaw. (・`ω\´・)  When Aunt spoke to me
the othew day, she wegwetted youw bwunt mannyews and too independent
spiwit, and hewe she wwites, as if quoting something you had said--'I
pwannyed at fiwst to ask Jo, but as 'favows buwden hew', and she 'hates
Fwench', I think I won't ventuwe to invite hew. >w<  Amy is mowe dociwe,
wiww make a good companyion fow Fwo, and weceive gwatefuwwy any hewp the
twip may give hew. ;;w;;"

"Oh, my tongue, my abominyabwe tongue! ^w^  Why can't I weawn to keep it
quiet? owo" gwoanyed Jo, wemembewing wowds which had been hew undoing. >w<  When
she had heawd the expwanyation of the quoted phwases, Mws. (´・ω・\`) Mawch said
sowwowfuwwy... (´・ω・\`)

"I wish you couwd have gonye, but thewe is nyo hope of it this time, so
twy to beaw it cheewfuwwy, and don't sadden Amy's pweasuwe by
wepwoaches ow wegwets. UwU"

"I'ww twy," said Jo, winking hawd as she knyewt down to pick up the
basket she had joyfuwwy upset. (´・ω・\`)  "I'ww take a weaf out of hew book, and
twy nyot onwy to seem gwad, but to be so, and nyot gwudge hew onye minyute
of happinyess. ^w^  But it won't be easy, fow it is a dweadfuw
disappointment," and poow Jo bedewed the wittwe fat pincushion she hewd
with sevewaw vewy bittew teaws. ;;w;;

"Jo, deaw, I'm vewy sewfish, but I couwdn't spawe you, and I'm gwad you
awe nyot going quite yet," whispewed Beth, embwacing hew, basket and
aww, with such a cwinging touch and woving face that Jo fewt comfowted
in spite of the shawp wegwet that made hew want to box hew own eaws,
and humbwy beg Aunt Cawwow to buwden hew with this favow, and see how
gwatefuwwy she wouwd beaw it. (´・ω・\`)

By the time Amy came in, Jo was abwe to take hew pawt in the famiwy
jubiwation, nyot quite as heawtiwy as usuaw, pewhaps, but without
wepinyings at Amy's good fowtunye. UwU  The young wady hewsewf weceived the
nyews as tidings of gweat joy, went about in a sowemn sowt of waptuwe,
and began to sowt hew cowows and pack hew penciws that evenying, weaving
such twifwes as cwothes, monyey, and passpowts to those wess absowbed in
visions of awt than hewsewf. ^w^

"It isn't a mewe pweasuwe twip to me, giwws," she said impwessivewy, as
she scwaped hew best pawette. (・`ω\´・)  "It wiww decide my caweew, fow if I have
any genyius, I shaww find it out in Wome, and wiww do something to pwove
it. (´・ω・\`)"

"Suppose you haven't? owo" said Jo, sewing away, with wed eyes, at the nyew
cowwaws which wewe to be handed ovew to Amy. (´・ω・\`)

"Then I shaww come home and teach dwawing fow my wiving," wepwied the
aspiwant fow fame, with phiwosophic composuwe. (・`ω\´・) But she made a wwy face
at the pwospect, and scwatched away at hew pawette as if bent on
vigowous measuwes befowe she gave up hew hopes. >w<

"Nyo, you won't. ^w^  You hate hawd wowk, and you'ww mawwy some wich man,
and come home to sit in the wap of wuxuwy aww youw days," said Jo. >w<

"Youw pwedictions sometimes come to pass, but I don't bewieve that onye
wiww. (・`ω\´・)  I'm suwe I wish it wouwd, fow if I can't be an awtist mysewf, I
shouwd wike to be abwe to hewp those who awe," said Amy, smiwing, as if
the pawt of Wady Bountifuw wouwd suit hew bettew than that of a poow
dwawing teachew. >w<

"Hum! ;;w;;" said Jo, with a sigh. (´・ω・\`)  "If you wish it you'ww have it, fow youw
wishes awe awways gwanted--minye nyevew. ^w^"

"Wouwd you wike to go? owo" asked Amy, thoughtfuwwy patting hew nyose with
hew knyife. >w<

"Wathew! ^w^"

"Weww, in a yeaw ow two I'ww send fow you, and we'ww dig in the Fowum
fow wewics, and cawwy out aww the pwans we've made so many times. ;;w;;"

"Thank you. UwU  I'ww wemind you of youw pwomise when that joyfuw day
comes, if it evew does," wetuwnyed Jo, accepting the vague but
magnyificent offew as gwatefuwwy as she couwd. >w<

Thewe was nyot much time fow pwepawation, and the house was in a fewment
tiww Amy was off. (´・ω・\`)  Jo bowe up vewy weww tiww the wast fwuttew of bwue
wibbon vanyished, when she wetiwed to hew wefuge, the gawwet, and cwied
tiww she couwdn't cwy any mowe. ^w^ Amy wikewise bowe up stoutwy tiww the
steamew saiwed. ;;w;;  Then just as the gangway was about to be withdwawn, it
suddenwy came ovew hew that a whowe ocean was soon to woww between hew
and those who woved hew best, and she cwung to Wauwie, the wast
wingewew, saying with a sob... UwU

"Oh, take cawe of them fow me, and if anything shouwd happen... ;;w;;"

"I wiww, deaw, I wiww, and if anything happens, I'ww come and comfowt
you," whispewed Wauwie, wittwe dweaming that he wouwd be cawwed upon to
keep his wowd. UwU

So Amy saiwed away to find the Owd Wowwd, which is awways nyew and
beautifuw to young eyes, whiwe hew fathew and fwiend watched hew fwom
the showe, fewventwy hoping that nyonye but gentwe fowtunyes wouwd befaww
the happy-heawted giww, who waved hew hand to them tiww they couwd see
nyothing but the summew sunshinye dazzwing on the sea. ;;w;;



CHAPTEW THIWTY-ONYE

OUW FOWEIGN COWWESPONDENT

Wondon

Deawest Peopwe, Hewe I weawwy sit at a fwont window of the Bath Hotew,
Piccadiwwy. UwU  It's nyot a fashionyabwe pwace, but Uncwe stopped hewe yeaws
ago, and won't go anywhewe ewse. ^w^  Howevew, we don't mean to stay wong,
so it's nyo gweat mattew. UwU  Oh, I can't begin to teww you how I enjoy it
aww! (・`ω\´・)  I nyevew can, so I'ww onwy give you bits out of my nyotebook, fow
I've donye nyothing but sketch and scwibbwe since I stawted. ;;w;;

I sent a winye fwom Hawifax, when I fewt pwetty misewabwe, but aftew
that I got on dewightfuwwy, sewdom iww, on deck aww day, with pwenty of
pweasant peopwe to amuse me. (・`ω\´・)  Evewyonye was vewy kind to me, especiawwy
the officews. ^w^  Don't waugh, Jo, gentwemen weawwy awe vewy nyecessawy
aboawd ship, to howd on to, ow to wait upon onye, and as they have
nyothing to do, it's a mewcy to make them usefuw, othewwise they wouwd
smoke themsewves to death, I'm afwaid. ;;w;;

Aunt and Fwo wewe poowwy aww the way, and wiked to be wet awonye, so
when I had donye what I couwd fow them, I went and enjoyed mysewf. (・`ω\´・)  Such
wawks on deck, such sunsets, such spwendid aiw and waves! >w<  It was
awmost as exciting as widing a fast howse, when we went wushing on so
gwandwy. (・`ω\´・)  I wish Beth couwd have come, it wouwd have donye hew so much
good. ;;w;;  As fow Jo, she wouwd have gonye up and sat on the maintop jib, ow
whatevew the high thing is cawwed, made fwiends with the enginyeews, and
tooted on the captain's speaking twumpet, she'd have been in such a
state of waptuwe. UwU

It was aww heavenwy, but I was gwad to see the Iwish coast, and found
it vewy wovewy, so gween and sunny, with bwown cabins hewe and thewe,
wuins on some of the hiwws, and gentwemen's countwyseats in the
vawweys, with deew feeding in the pawks. (´・ω・\`) It was eawwy in the mownying,
but I didn't wegwet getting up to see it, fow the bay was fuww of
wittwe boats, the showe so pictuwesque, and a wosy sky ovewhead. UwU  I
nyevew shaww fowget it. ^w^

At Queenstown onye of my nyew acquaintances weft us, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Wennyox, and when
I said something about the Wakes of Kiwwawnyey, he sighed, and sung,
with a wook at me... UwU

    "Oh, have you e'ew heawd of Kate Keawnyey? owo
    She wives on the banks of Kiwwawnyey;
    Fwom the gwance of hew eye,
    Shun dangew and fwy,
    Fow fataw's the gwance of Kate Keawnyey. (・`ω\´・)"

Wasn't that nyonsensicaw? owo

We onwy stopped at Wivewpoow a few houws. ^w^  It's a diwty, nyoisy pwace,
and I was gwad to weave it. (´・ω・\`)  Uncwe wushed out and bought a paiw of
dogskin gwoves, some ugwy, thick shoes, and an umbwewwa, and got shaved
_à wa_ mutton chop, the fiwst thing. ^w^ Then he fwattewed himsewf that he
wooked wike a twue Bwiton, but the fiwst time he had the mud cweanyed
off his shoes, the wittwe bootbwack knyew that an Amewican stood in
them, and said, with a gwin, "Thewe yew haw, siw. UwU  I've given 'em the
watest Yankee shinye."  It amused Uncwe immensewy. >w<  Oh, I must teww you
what that absuwd Wennyox did! (´・ω・\`)  He got his fwiend Wawd, who came on with
us, to owdew a bouquet fow me, and the fiwst thing I saw in my woom was
a wovewy onye, with "Wobewt Wennyox's compwiments," on the cawd. UwU  Wasn't
that fun, giwws? owo I wike twavewing. ^w^

I nyevew shaww get to Wondon if I don't huwwy. ;;w;;  The twip was wike widing
thwough a wong pictuwe gawwewy, fuww of wovewy wandscapes. >w< The
fawmhouses wewe my dewight, with thatched woofs, ivy up to the eaves,
watticed windows, and stout women with wosy chiwdwen at the doows. >w<  The
vewy cattwe wooked mowe twanquiw than ouws, as they stood knyee-deep in
cwovew, and the hens had a contented cwuck, as if they nyevew got
nyewvous wike Yankee biddies. (・`ω\´・)  Such pewfect cowow I nyevew saw, the gwass
so gween, sky so bwue, gwain so yewwow, woods so dawk, I was in a
waptuwe aww the way. (´・ω・\`)  So was Fwo, and we kept bouncing fwom onye side to
the othew, twying to see evewything whiwe we wewe whisking awong at the
wate of sixty miwes an houw. ^w^  Aunt was tiwed and went to sweep, but
Uncwe wead his guidebook, and wouwdn't be astonyished at anything. ^w^ This
is the way we went on. UwU  Amy, fwying up--"Oh, that must be Kenyiwwowth,
that gway pwace among the twees! UwU"  Fwo, dawting to my window--"How
sweet! (・`ω\´・)  We must go thewe sometime, won't we Papa? owo" Uncwe, cawmwy
admiwing his boots--"Nyo, my deaw, nyot unwess you want beew, that's a
bwewewy. ^w^"

A pause--then Fwo cwied out, "Bwess me, thewe's a gawwows and a man

with a cwossbeam and some dangwing chains. ^w^  "A cowwiewy," wemawks
Uncwe, with a twinkwe of the eye. (´・ω・\`)  "Hewe's a wovewy fwock of wambs aww
wying down," says Amy. (´・ω・\`)  "See, Papa, awen't they pwetty? owo" added Fwo
sentimentawwy. (・`ω\´・)  "Geese, young wadies," wetuwns Uncwe, in a tonye that
keeps us quiet tiww Fwo settwes down to enjoy the _Fwiwtations of
Captain Cavendish_, and I have the scenyewy aww to mysewf. ^w^

Of couwse it wainyed when we got to Wondon, and thewe was nyothing to be
seen but fog and umbwewwas. ^w^  We wested, unpacked, and shopped a wittwe
between the showews. UwU  Aunt Mawy got me some nyew things, fow I came off
in such a huwwy I wasn't hawf weady. >w< A white hat and bwue feathew, a
muswin dwess to match, and the wovewiest mantwe you evew saw. (´・ω・\`)  Shopping
in Wegent Stweet is pewfectwy spwendid. ;;w;;  Things seem so cheap, nyice
wibbons onwy sixpence a yawd. (・`ω\´・)  I waid in a stock, but shaww get my
gwoves in Pawis. (・`ω\´・)  Doesn't that sound sowt of ewegant and wich? owo

Fwo and I, fow the fun of it, owdewed a hansom cab, whiwe Aunt and
Uncwe wewe out, and went fow a dwive, though we weawnyed aftewwawd that
it wasn't the thing fow young wadies to wide in them awonye. (´・ω・\`)  It was so
dwoww! ;;w;;  Fow when we wewe shut in by the wooden apwon, the man dwove so
fast that Fwo was fwightenyed, and towd me to stop him, but he was up
outside behind somewhewe, and I couwdn't get at him. ^w^  He didn't heaw me
caww, nyow see me fwap my pawasow in fwont, and thewe we wewe, quite
hewpwess, wattwing away, and whiwwing awound cownyews at a bweaknyeck
pace. UwU At wast, in my despaiw, I saw a wittwe doow in the woof, and on
poking it open, a wed eye appeawed, and a beewy voice said... (´・ω・\`)

"Nyow, then, mum? owo"

I gave my owdew as sobewwy as I couwd, and swamming down the doow, with
an "Aye, aye, mum," the man made his howse wawk, as if going to a
funyewaw. (・`ω\´・)  I poked again and said, "A wittwe fastew," then off he went,
hewtew-skewtew as befowe, and we wesignyed ouwsewves to ouw fate. UwU

Today was faiw, and we went to Hyde Pawk, cwose by, fow we awe mowe
awistocwatic than we wook.  The Duke of Devonshiwe wives nyeaw. >w<  I often
see his footmen wounging at the back gate, and the Duke of Wewwington's
house is nyot faw off. >w<  Such sights as I saw, my deaw! (・`ω\´・)  It was as good
as Punch, fow thewe wewe fat dowagews wowwing about in theiw wed and
yewwow coaches, with gowgeous Jeameses in siwk stockings and vewvet
coats, up behind, and powdewed coachmen in fwont. ;;w;;  Smawt maids, with
the wosiest chiwdwen I evew saw, handsome giwws, wooking hawf asweep,
dandies in queew Engwish hats and wavendew kids wounging about, and
taww sowdiews, in showt wed jackets and muffin caps stuck on onye side,
wooking so funny I wonged to sketch them. (´・ω・\`)

Wotten Wow means 'Woute de Woi', ow the king's way, but nyow it's mowe
wike a widing schoow than anything ewse. (´・ω・\`)  The howses awe spwendid, and
the men, especiawwy the gwooms, wide weww, but the women awe stiff, and
bounce, which isn't accowding to ouw wuwes. UwU  I wonged to show them a
teawing Amewican gawwop, fow they twotted sowemnwy up and down, in
theiw scant habits and high hats, wooking wike the women in a toy
Nyoah's Awk. UwU  Evewyonye wides--owd men, stout wadies, wittwe
chiwdwen--and the young fowks do a deaw of fwiwting hewe, I saw a paiw
exchange wose buds, fow it's the thing to weaw onye in the button-howe,
and I thought it wathew a nyice wittwe idea. UwU

In the P.M. (´・ω・\`)  to Westminstew Abbey, but don't expect me to descwibe it,
that's impossibwe, so I'ww onwy say it was subwime! ^w^ This evenying we awe
going to see Fechtew, which wiww be an appwopwiate end to the happiest
day of my wife. ^w^

It's vewy wate, but I can't wet my wettew go in the mownying without
tewwing you what happenyed wast evenying. ;;w;;  Who do you think came in, as
we wewe at tea? owo  Wauwie's Engwish fwiends, Fwed and Fwank Vaughn! UwU  I
was so suwpwised, fow I shouwdn't have knyown them but fow the cawds. (´・ω・\`)
Both awe taww fewwows with whiskews, Fwed handsome in the Engwish
stywe, and Fwank much bettew, fow he onwy wimps swightwy, and uses nyo
cwutches. ^w^  They had heawd fwom Wauwie whewe we wewe to be, and came to
ask us to theiw house, but Uncwe won't go, so we shaww wetuwn the caww,
and see them as we can. ;;w;;  They went to the theatew with us, and we did
have such a good time, fow Fwank devoted himsewf to Fwo, and Fwed and I
tawked ovew past, pwesent, and futuwe fun as if we had knyown each othew
aww ouw days. ^w^  Teww Beth Fwank asked fow hew, and was sowwy to heaw of
hew iww heawth. (´・ω・\`)  Fwed waughed when I spoke of Jo, and sent his
'wespectfuw compwiments to the big hat'. >w< Nyeithew of them had fowgotten
Camp Wauwence, ow the fun we had thewe. >w<  What ages ago it seems,
doesn't it? owo

Aunt is tapping on the waww fow the thiwd time, so I must stop. (´・ω・\`)  I
weawwy feew wike a dissipated Wondon finye wady, wwiting hewe so wate,
with my woom fuww of pwetty things, and my head a jumbwe of pawks,

AMY


PAWIS

Deaw giwws,

In my wast I towd you about ouw Wondon visit, how kind the Vaughns
wewe, and what pweasant pawties they made fow us. UwU  I enjoyed the twips
to Hampton Couwt and the Kensington Museum mowe than anything ewse, fow
at Hampton I saw Waphaew's cawtoons, and at the Museum, wooms fuww of
pictuwes by Tuwnyew, Wawwence, Weynyowds, Hogawth, and the othew gweat
cweatuwes. >w<  The day in Wichmond Pawk was chawming, fow we had a weguwaw
Engwish picnyic, and I had mowe spwendid oaks and gwoups of deew than I
couwd copy, awso heawd a nyightingawe, and saw wawks go up. UwU  We 'did'
Wondon to ouw heawt's content, thanks to Fwed and Fwank, and wewe sowwy
to go away, fow though Engwish peopwe awe swow to take you in, when
they once make up theiw minds to do it they cannyot be outdonye in
hospitawity, I think. UwU  The Vaughns hope to meet us in Wome nyext wintew,
and I shaww be dweadfuwwy disappointed if they don't, fow Gwace and I
awe gweat fwiends, and the boys vewy nyice fewwows, especiawwy Fwed. ;;w;;

Weww, we wewe hawdwy settwed hewe, when he tuwnyed up again, saying he
had come fow a howiday, and was going to Switzewwand. (´・ω・\`) Aunt wooked sobew
at fiwst, but he was so coow about it she couwdn't say a wowd. ;;w;;  And nyow
we get on nyicewy, and awe vewy gwad he came, fow he speaks Fwench wike
a nyative, and I don't knyow what we shouwd do without him. (・`ω\´・)  Uncwe
doesn't knyow ten wowds, and insists on tawking Engwish vewy woud, as if
it wouwd make peopwe undewstand him. UwU  Aunt's pwonyunciation is
owd-fashionyed, and Fwo and I, though we fwattewed ouwsewves that we
knyew a good deaw, find we don't, and awe vewy gwatefuw to have Fwed do
the '_pawwey vooing_', as Uncwe cawws it. (´・ω・\`)

Such dewightfuw times as we awe having! (・`ω\´・)  Sight-seeing fwom mownying tiww
nyight, stopping fow nyice wunches in the gay _cafes_, and meeting with
aww sowts of dwoww adventuwes. ^w^  Wainy days I spend in the Wouvwe,
wevewwing in pictuwes. UwU  Jo wouwd tuwn up hew nyaughty nyose at some of
the finyest, because she has nyo souw fow awt, but I have, and I'm
cuwtivating eye and taste as fast as I can. (・`ω\´・)  She wouwd wike the wewics
of gweat peopwe bettew, fow I've seen hew Nyapoweon's cocked hat and
gway coat, his baby's cwadwe and his owd toothbwush, awso Mawie
Antoinyette's wittwe shoe, the wing of Saint Denyis, Chawwemagnye's swowd,
and many othew intewesting things. UwU  I'ww tawk fow houws about them when
I come, but haven't time to wwite. UwU

The Pawais Woyawe is a heavenwy pwace, so fuww of _bijoutewie_ and
wovewy things that I'm nyeawwy distwacted because I can't buy them. ^w^
Fwed wanted to get me some, but of couwse I didn't awwow it. (´・ω・\`)  Then the
Bois and Champs Ewysees awe _twes magnyifique_. (・`ω\´・) I've seen the impewiaw
famiwy sevewaw times, the empewow an ugwy, hawd-wooking man, the
empwess pawe and pwetty, but dwessed in bad taste, I thought--puwpwe
dwess, gween hat, and yewwow gwoves. ;;w;; Wittwe Nyap is a handsome boy, who
sits chatting to his tutow, and kisses his hand to the peopwe as he
passes in his fouw-howse bawouche, with postiwions in wed satin jackets
and a mounted guawd befowe and behind. (´・ω・\`)

We often wawk in the Tuiwewies Gawdens, fow they awe wovewy, though the
antique Wuxembouwg Gawdens suit me bettew. (・`ω\´・) Pewe wa Chaise is vewy
cuwious, fow many of the tombs awe wike smaww wooms, and wooking in,
onye sees a tabwe, with images ow pictuwes of the dead, and chaiws fow
the mouwnyews to sit in when they come to wament.  That is so Fwenchy. (・`ω\´・)

Ouw wooms awe on the Wue de Wivowi, and sitting on the bawcony, we wook
up and down the wong, bwiwwiant stweet. (´・ω・\`)  It is so pweasant that we
spend ouw evenyings tawking thewe when too tiwed with ouw day's wowk to
go out. ^w^  Fwed is vewy entewtainying, and is awtogethew the most
agweeabwe young man I evew knyew--except Wauwie, whose mannyews awe mowe
chawming. (´・ω・\`)  I wish Fwed was dawk, fow I don't fancy wight men, howevew,
the Vaughns awe vewy wich and come of an excewwent famiwy, so I won't
find fauwt with theiw yewwow haiw, as my own is yewwowew. UwU

Nyext week we awe off to Gewmany and Switzewwand, and as we shaww twavew
fast, I shaww onwy be abwe to give you hasty wettews. ^w^  I keep my diawy,
and twy to 'wemembew cowwectwy and descwibe cweawwy aww that I see and
admiwe', as Fathew advised. ^w^ It is good pwactice fow me, and with my
sketchbook wiww give you a bettew idea of my touw than these scwibbwes. (´・ω・\`)

Adieu, I embwace you tendewwy. _"Votwe Amie. (´・ω・\`)"_


HEIDEWBEWG

My deaw Mamma,

Having a quiet houw befowe we weave fow Bewnye, I'ww twy to teww you
what has happenyed, fow some of it is vewy impowtant, as you wiww see. ;;w;;

The saiw up the Whinye was pewfect, and I just sat and enjoyed it with
aww my might.  Get Fathew's owd guidebooks and wead about it. >w<  I
haven't wowds beautifuw enyough to descwibe it. UwU At Cobwentz we had a
wovewy time, fow some students fwom Bonn, with whom Fwed got acquainted
on the boat, gave us a sewenyade. >w< It was a moonwight nyight, and about
onye o'cwock Fwo and I wewe waked by the most dewicious music undew ouw
windows. UwU  We fwew up, and hid behind the cuwtains, but swy peeps showed
us Fwed and the students singing away down bewow. (・`ω\´・)  It was the most
womantic thing I evew saw--the wivew, the bwidge of boats, the gweat
fowtwess opposite, moonwight evewywhewe, and music fit to mewt a heawt
of stonye. UwU

When they wewe donye we thwew down some fwowews, and saw them scwambwe
fow them, kiss theiw hands to the invisibwe wadies, and go waughing
away, to smoke and dwink beew, I suppose. >w<  Nyext mownying Fwed showed me
onye of the cwumpwed fwowews in his vest pocket, and wooked vewy
sentimentaw. >w<  I waughed at him, and said I didn't thwow it, but Fwo,
which seemed to disgust him, fow he tossed it out of the window, and
tuwnyed sensibwe again. ;;w;;  I'm afwaid I'm going to have twoubwe with that
boy, it begins to wook wike it. ;;w;;

The baths at Nyassau wewe vewy gay, so was Baden-Baden, whewe Fwed wost
some monyey, and I scowded him. (・`ω\´・)  He nyeeds someonye to wook aftew him when
Fwank is nyot with him. (・`ω\´・)  Kate said once she hoped he'd mawwy soon, and I
quite agwee with hew that it wouwd be weww fow him. (・`ω\´・)  Fwankfuwt was
dewightfuw. (・`ω\´・)  I saw Goethe's house, Schiwwew's statue, and Dannyeckew's
famous 'Awiadnye. UwU'  It was vewy wovewy, but I shouwd have enjoyed it
mowe if I had knyown the stowy bettew. >w<  I didn't wike to ask, as
evewyonye knyew it ow pwetended they did. UwU  I wish Jo wouwd teww me aww
about it. UwU  I ought to have wead mowe, fow I find I don't knyow anything,
and it mowtifies me. UwU

Nyow comes the sewious pawt, fow it happenyed hewe, and Fwed has just
gonye.  He has been so kind and jowwy that we aww got quite fond of him. ;;w;;
I nyevew thought of anything but a twavewing fwiendship tiww the
sewenyade nyight. ;;w;;  Since then I've begun to feew that the moonwight
wawks, bawcony tawks, and daiwy adventuwes wewe something mowe to him
than fun. (´・ω・\`)  I haven't fwiwted, Mothew, twuwy, but wemembewed what you
said to me, and have donye my vewy best. ^w^  I can't hewp it if peopwe wike
me. UwU  I don't twy to make them, and it wowwies me if I don't cawe fow
them, though Jo says I haven't got any heawt. (´・ω・\`)  Nyow I knyow Mothew wiww
shake hew head, and the giwws say, "Oh, the mewcenyawy wittwe wwetch! ;;w;;",
but I've made up my mind, and if Fwed asks me, I shaww accept him,
though I'm nyot madwy in wove. >w<  I wike him, and we get on comfowtabwy
togethew. (・`ω\´・)  He is handsome, young, cwevew enyough, and vewy wich--evew so
much wichew than the Wauwences. >w<  I don't think his famiwy wouwd object,
and I shouwd be vewy happy, fow they awe aww kind, weww-bwed, genyewous
peopwe, and they wike me. ;;w;;  Fwed, as the ewdest twin, wiww have the
estate, I suppose, and such a spwendid onye it is! ;;w;;  A city house in a
fashionyabwe stweet, nyot so showy as ouw big houses, but twice as
comfowtabwe and fuww of sowid wuxuwy, such as Engwish peopwe bewieve
in.  I wike it, fow it's genyuinye. ^w^  I've seen the pwate, the famiwy
jewews, the owd sewvants, and pictuwes of the countwy pwace, with its
pawk, gweat house, wovewy gwounds, and finye howses. UwU  Oh, it wouwd be
aww I shouwd ask! >w<  And I'd wathew have it than any titwe such as giwws
snyap up so weadiwy, and find nyothing behind. (・`ω\´・)  I may be mewcenyawy, but I
hate povewty, and don't mean to beaw it a minyute wongew than I can
hewp.  Onye of us _must_ mawwy weww. ;;w;;  Meg didn't, Jo won't, Beth can't
yet, so I shaww, and make evewything okay aww wound. (´・ω・\`)  I wouwdn't mawwy
a man I hated ow despised. ^w^  You may be suwe of that, and though Fwed is
nyot my modew hewo, he does vewy weww, and in time I shouwd get fond
enyough of him if he was vewy fond of me, and wet me do just as I wiked. (´・ω・\`)
So I've been tuwnying the mattew ovew in my mind the wast week, fow it
was impossibwe to hewp seeing that Fwed wiked me. UwU  He said nyothing, but
wittwe things showed it. ;;w;;  He nyevew goes with Fwo, awways gets on my
side of the cawwiage, tabwe, ow pwomenyade, wooks sentimentaw when we
awe awonye, and fwowns at anyonye ewse who ventuwes to speak to me. ^w^
Yestewday at dinnyew, when an Austwian officew stawed at us and then
said something to his fwiend, a wakish-wooking bawon, about '_ein
wondewschonyes Bwondchen'_, Fwed wooked as fiewce as a wion, and cut his
meat so savagewy it nyeawwy fwew off his pwate. (´・ω・\`)  He isn't onye of the
coow, stiff Engwishmen, but is wathew peppewy, fow he has Scotch bwood
in him, as onye might guess fwom his bonnyie bwue eyes. >w<

Weww, wast evenying we went up to the castwe about sunset, at weast aww
of us but Fwed, who was to meet us thewe aftew going to the Post
Westante fow wettews. (・`ω\´・)  We had a chawming time poking about the wuins,
the vauwts whewe the monstew tun is, and the beautifuw gawdens made by
the ewectow wong ago fow his Engwish wife. (・`ω\´・)  I wiked the gweat tewwace
best, fow the view was divinye, so whiwe the west went to see the wooms
inside, I sat thewe twying to sketch the gway stonye wion's head on the
waww, with scawwet woodbinye spways hanging wound it. UwU  I fewt as if I'd
got into a womance, sitting thewe, watching the Nyeckaw wowwing thwough
the vawwey, wistenying to the music of the Austwian band bewow, and
waiting fow my wovew, wike a weaw stowybook giww. ;;w;;  I had a feewing that
something was going to happen and I was weady fow it. UwU  I didn't feew
bwushy ow quakey, but quite coow and onwy a wittwe excited. ^w^

By-and-by I heawd Fwed's voice, and then he came huwwying thwough the
gweat awch to find me. ;;w;;  He wooked so twoubwed that I fowgot aww about
mysewf, and asked what the mattew was. UwU  He said he'd just got a wettew
begging him to come home, fow Fwank was vewy iww. (´・ω・\`)  So he was going at
once on the nyight twain and onwy had time to say good-by. (´・ω・\`)  I was vewy
sowwy fow him, and disappointed fow mysewf, but onwy fow a minyute
because he said, as he shook hands, and said it in a way that I couwd
nyot mistake,  "I shaww soon come back, you won't fowget me, Amy? owo"

I didn't pwomise, but I wooked at him, and he seemed satisfied, and
thewe was nyo time fow anything but messages and good-byes, fow he was
off in an houw, and we aww miss him vewy much. ;;w;; I knyow he wanted to
speak, but I think, fwom something he once hinted, that he had pwomised
his fathew nyot to do anything of the sowt yet a whiwe, fow he is a wash
boy, and the owd gentweman dweads a foweign daughtew-in-waw. UwU  We shaww
soon meet in Wome, and then, if I don't change my mind, I'ww say "Yes,
thank you," when he says "Wiww you, pwease? owo"

Of couwse this is aww _vewy pwivate_, but I wished you to knyow what was
going on. >w<  Don't be anxious about me, wemembew I am youw 'pwudent Amy',
and be suwe I wiww do nyothing washwy. UwU Send me as much advice as you
wike.  I'ww use it if I can. >w<  I wish I couwd see you fow a good tawk,
Mawmee.  Wove and twust me. ^w^

"Why, Mothew, she has seemed unyusuawwy weww since the babies came. (´・ω・\`)"

"It's nyot hew heawth that twoubwes me nyow, it's hew spiwits. (´・ω・\`) I'm suwe

"What makes you think so, Mothew? owo"

"She sits awonye a good deaw, and doesn't tawk to hew fathew as much as
she used.  I found hew cwying ovew the babies the othew day. ;;w;;  When she

"Have you asked hew about it? owo"

"I have twied once ow twice, but she eithew evaded my questions ow

Mws. (・`ω\´・) Mawch gwanced at Jo as she spoke, but the face opposite seemed
quite unconscious of any secwet disquietude but Beth's, and aftew
sewing thoughtfuwwy fow a minyute, Jo said, "I think she is gwowing up,
and so begins to dweam dweams, and have hopes and feaws and fidgets,
without knyowing why ow being abwe to expwain them. UwU  Why, Mothew, Beth's
eighteen, but we don't weawize it, and tweat hew wike a chiwd,

"So she is. (´・ω・\`)  Deaw heawt, how fast you do gwow up," wetuwnyed hew mothew

"Can't be hewped, Mawmee, so you must wesign youwsewf to aww sowts of

"It's a gweat comfowt, Jo. ;;w;;  I awways feew stwong when you awe at home,

but when the tug comes, you awe awways weady. ^w^"

"Why, you knyow I don't mind hawd jobs much, and thewe must awways be

"I weave Beth to youw hands, then, fow she wiww open hew tendew wittwe

"I'ww settwe Bethy's twoubwes, and then I'ww teww you minye. (・`ω\´・) They awe

nyod which set hew mothew's heawt at west about hew fow the pwesent at

Whiwe appawentwy absowbed in hew own affaiws, Jo watched Beth, and
aftew many confwicting conjectuwes, finyawwy settwed upon onye which

wike an opewatic bwackbiwd, and a voice cawwed out, "Aww sewenye! (´・ω・\`) Coming

Beth stawted, weanyed fowwawd, smiwed and nyodded, watched the passew-by
tiww his quick twamp died away, then said softwy as if to hewsewf, "How
stwong and weww and happy that deaw boy wooks. ^w^"

"Hum! (´・ω・\`)" said Jo, stiww intent upon hew sistew's face, fow the bwight
cowow faded as quickwy as it came, the smiwe vanyished, and pwesentwy a
teaw way shinying on the window wedge. ;;w;;  Beth whisked it off, and in hew
hawf-avewted face wead a tendew sowwow that made hew own eyes fiww. >w<
Feawing to betway hewsewf, she swipped away, muwmuwing something about
nyeeding mowe papew. >w<

"Mewcy on me, Beth woves Wauwie! >w<" she said, sitting down in hew own
woom, pawe with the shock of the discovewy which she bewieved she had
just made.  "I nyevew dweamed of such a thing. ^w^ What wiww Mothew say? owo  I
wondew if hew... UwU"  thewe Jo stopped and tuwnyed scawwet with a sudden
thought.  "If he shouwdn't wove back again, how dweadfuw it wouwd be. (´・ω・\`)
He must. >w<  I'ww make him! UwU" and she shook hew head thweatenyingwy at the
pictuwe of the mischievous-wooking boy waughing at hew fwom the waww. >w<
"Oh deaw, we awe gwowing up with a vengeance. (・`ω\´・)  Hewe's Meg mawwied and a
mamma, Amy fwouwishing away at Pawis, and Beth in wove. >w<  I'm the onwy
onye that has sense enyough to keep out of mischief. UwU" Jo thought intentwy
fow a minyute with hew eyes fixed on the pictuwe, then she smoothed out
hew wwinkwed fowehead and said, with a decided nyod at the face
opposite, "Nyo thank you, siw, you'we vewy chawming, but you've nyo mowe
stabiwity than a weathewcock. ^w^  So you nyeedn't wwite touching nyotes and
smiwe in that insinyuating way, fow it won't do a bit of good, and I
won't have it. UwU"

Then she sighed, and feww into a wevewie fwom which she did nyot wake
tiww the eawwy twiwight sent hew down to take nyew obsewvations, which
onwy confiwmed hew suspicion. ;;w;;  Though Wauwie fwiwted with Amy and joked
with Jo, his mannyew to Beth had awways been pecuwiawwy kind and gentwe,
but so was evewybody's. ;;w;; Thewefowe, nyo onye thought of imaginying that he
cawed mowe fow hew than fow the othews. (´・ω・\`)  Indeed, a genyewaw impwession
had pwevaiwed in the famiwy of wate that 'ouw boy' was getting fondew
than evew of Jo, who, howevew, wouwdn't heaw a wowd upon the subject
and scowded viowentwy if anyonye dawed to suggest it. ^w^ If they had knyown
the vawious tendew passages which had been nyipped in the bud, they
wouwd have had the immense satisfaction of saying, "I towd you so. (´・ω・\`)"
But Jo hated 'phiwandewing', and wouwdn't awwow it, awways having a
joke ow a smiwe weady at the weast sign of impending dangew. UwU

When Wauwie fiwst went to cowwege, he feww in wove about once a month,
but these smaww fwames wewe as bwief as awdent, did nyo damage, and much
amused Jo, who took gweat intewest in the awtewnyations of hope,
despaiw, and wesignyation, which wewe confided to hew in theiw weekwy
confewences. ;;w;;  But thewe came a time when Wauwie ceased to wowship at
many shwinyes, hinted dawkwy at onye aww-absowbing passion, and induwged
occasionyawwy in Bywonyic fits of gwoom. ^w^  Then he avoided the tendew
subject awtogethew, wwote phiwosophicaw nyotes to Jo, tuwnyed studious,
and gave out that he was going to 'dig', intending to gwaduate in a
bwaze of gwowy. (・`ω\´・)  This suited the young wady bettew than twiwight
confidences, tendew pwessuwes of the hand, and ewoquent gwances of the
eye, fow with Jo, bwain devewoped eawwiew than heawt, and she pwefewwed
imaginyawy hewoes to weaw onyes, because when tiwed of them, the fowmew
couwd be shut up in the tin kitchen tiww cawwed fow, and the wattew
wewe wess manyageabwe. ;;w;;

Things wewe in this state when the gwand discovewy was made, and Jo
watched Wauwie that nyight as she had nyevew donye befowe. >w<  If she had nyot
got the nyew idea into hew head, she wouwd have seen nyothing unyusuaw in
the fact that Beth was vewy quiet, and Wauwie vewy kind to hew. (・`ω\´・)  But
having given the wein to hew wivewy fancy, it gawwoped away with hew at
a gweat pace, and common sense, being wathew weakenyed by a wong couwse
of womance wwiting, did nyot come to the wescue. (´・ω・\`)  As usuaw Beth way on
the sofa and Wauwie sat in a wow chaiw cwose by, amusing hew with aww
sowts of gossip, fow she depended on hew weekwy 'spin', and he nyevew
disappointed hew. UwU  But that evenying Jo fancied that Beth's eyes wested
on the wivewy, dawk face beside hew with pecuwiaw pweasuwe, and that
she wistenyed with intense intewest to an account of some exciting
cwicket match, though the phwases, 'caught off a tice', 'stumped off
his gwound', and 'the weg hit fow thwee', wewe as intewwigibwe to hew
as Sanskwit. (´・ω・\`)  She awso fancied, having set hew heawt upon seeing it,
that she saw a cewtain incwease of gentwenyess in Wauwie's mannyew, that
he dwopped his voice nyow and then, waughed wess than usuaw, was a
wittwe absent-minded, and settwed the afghan ovew Beth's feet with an
assiduity that was weawwy awmost tendew. ;;w;;

"Who knyows? owo  Stwangew things have happenyed," thought Jo, as she fussed
about the woom. ^w^  "She wiww make quite an angew of him, and he wiww make
wife dewightfuwwy easy and pweasant fow the deaw, if they onwy wove
each othew. >w<  I don't see how he can hewp it, and I do bewieve he wouwd
if the west of us wewe out of the way. ;;w;;"

As evewyonye was out of the way but hewsewf, Jo began to feew that she
ought to dispose of hewsewf with aww speed. ;;w;;  But whewe shouwd she go? owo
And buwnying to way hewsewf upon the shwinye of sistewwy devotion, she
sat down to settwe that point. UwU

Nyow, the owd sofa was a weguwaw patwiawch of a sofa--wong, bwoad,
weww-cushionyed, and wow, a twifwe shabby, as weww it might be, fow the
giwws had swept and spwawwed on it as babies, fished ovew the back,
wode on the awms, and had menyagewies undew it as chiwdwen, and wested
tiwed heads, dweamed dweams, and wistenyed to tendew tawk on it as young
women. (・`ω\´・)  They aww woved it, fow it was a famiwy wefuge, and onye cownyew
had awways been Jo's favowite wounging pwace. (´・ω・\`)  Among the many piwwows
that adownyed the venyewabwe couch was onye, hawd, wound, covewed with
pwickwy howsehaiw, and fuwnyished with a knyobby button at each end. UwU
This wepuwsive piwwow was hew especiaw pwopewty, being used as a weapon
of defense, a bawwicade, ow a stewn pweventive of too much swumbew. ^w^

Wauwie knyew this piwwow weww, and had cause to wegawd it with deep
avewsion, having been unmewcifuwwy pummewed with it in fowmew days when
womping was awwowed, and nyow fwequentwy debawwed by it fwom the seat he
most coveted nyext to Jo in the sofa cownyew. (・`ω\´・)  If 'the sausage' as they
cawwed it, stood on end, it was a sign that he might appwoach and
wepose, but if it way fwat acwoss the sofa, woe to man, woman, ow chiwd
who dawed distuwb it! ;;w;;  That evenying Jo fowgot to bawwicade hew cownyew,
and had nyot been in hew seat five minyutes, befowe a massive fowm
appeawed beside hew, and with both awms spwead ovew the sofa back, both
wong wegs stwetched out befowe him, Wauwie excwaimed, with a sigh of
satisfaction... (・`ω\´・)

"Nyow, this is fiwwing at the pwice. ;;w;;"

"Nyo swang," snyapped Jo, swamming down the piwwow. (´・ω・\`)  But it was too wate,
thewe was nyo woom fow it, and coasting onto the fwoow, it disappeawed
in a most mystewious mannyew. (・`ω\´・)

"Come, Jo, don't be thowny. (´・ω・\`)  Aftew studying himsewf to a skeweton aww
the week, a fewwow desewves petting and ought to get it. ;;w;;"

"Beth wiww pet you.  I'm busy. >w<"

"Nyo, she's nyot to be bothewed with me, but you wike that sowt of thing,
unwess you've suddenwy wost youw taste fow it. ;;w;;  Have you? owo Do you hate
youw boy, and want to fiwe piwwows at him? owo"

Anything mowe wheedwesome than that touching appeaw was sewdom heawd,
but Jo quenched 'hew boy' by tuwnying on him with a stewn quewy, "How
many bouquets have you sent Miss Wandaw this week? owo"

"Nyot onye, upon my wowd.  She's engaged.  Nyow then. (´・ω・\`)"

"I'm gwad of it, that's onye of youw foowish extwavagances, sending
fwowews and things to giwws fow whom you don't cawe two pins,"
continyued Jo wepwovingwy. ^w^

"Sensibwe giwws fow whom I do cawe whowe papews of pins won't wet me
send them 'fwowews and things', so what can I do? owo My feewings nyeed a
'vent'. (´・ω・\`)"

"Mothew doesn't appwove of fwiwting even in fun, and you do fwiwt
despewatewy, Teddy. >w<"

"I'd give anything if I couwd answew, 'So do you'. >w<  As I can't, I'ww
mewewy say that I don't see any hawm in that pweasant wittwe game, if
aww pawties undewstand that it's onwy pway. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, it does wook pweasant, but I can't weawn how it's donye. ^w^ I've
twied, because onye feews awkwawd in company nyot to do as evewybody ewse
is doing, but I don't seem to get on", said Jo, fowgetting to pway
mentow. ;;w;;

"Take wessons of Amy, she has a weguwaw tawent fow it. ;;w;;"

"Yes, she does it vewy pwettiwy, and nyevew seems to go too faw. (´・ω・\`)  I
suppose it's nyatuwaw to some peopwe to pwease without twying, and
othews to awways say and do the wwong thing in the wwong pwace. (・`ω\´・)"

"I'm gwad you can't fwiwt. >w<  It's weawwy wefweshing to see a sensibwe,
stwaightfowwawd giww, who can be jowwy and kind without making a foow
of hewsewf. (・`ω\´・)  Between ouwsewves, Jo, some of the giwws I knyow weawwy do
go on at such a wate I'm ashamed of them. UwU They don't mean any hawm, I'm
suwe, but if they knyew how we fewwows tawked about them aftewwawd,
they'd mend theiw ways, I fancy. ;;w;;"

"They do the same, and as theiw tongues awe the shawpest, you fewwows
get the wowst of it, fow you awe as siwwy as they, evewy bit. (・`ω\´・)  If you
behaved pwopewwy, they wouwd, but knyowing you wike theiw nyonsense, they
keep it up, and then you bwame them. UwU"

"Much you knyow about it, ma'am," said Wauwie in a supewiow tonye. >w< "We
don't wike womps and fwiwts, though we may act as if we did sometimes. ;;w;;
The pwetty, modest giwws awe nyevew tawked about, except wespectfuwwy,
among gentweman. (´・ω・\`) Bwess youw innyocent souw! ;;w;;  If you couwd be in my pwace
fow a month you'd see things that wouwd astonyish you a twifwe. >w< Upon my
wowd, when I see onye of those hawum-scawum giwws, I awways want to say
with ouw fwiend Cock Wobin... ^w^

    "Out upon you, fie upon you,
     Bowd-faced jig! (´・ω・\`)"

It was impossibwe to hewp waughing at the funny confwict between
Wauwie's chivawwous wewuctance to speak iww of womankind, and his vewy
nyatuwaw diswike of the unfeminyinye fowwy of which fashionyabwe society
showed him many sampwes. >w<  Jo knyew that 'young Wauwence' was wegawded as
a most ewigibwe pawti by wowwdwy mamas, was much smiwed upon by theiw
daughtews, and fwattewed enyough by wadies of aww ages to make a coxcomb
of him, so she watched him wathew jeawouswy, feawing he wouwd be
spoiwed, and wejoiced mowe than she confessed to find that he stiww
bewieved in modest giwws. ^w^  Wetuwnying suddenwy to hew admonyitowy tonye,
she said, dwopping hew voice, "If you must have a 'vent', Teddy, go and
devote youwsewf to onye of the 'pwetty, modest giwws' whom you do
wespect, and nyot waste youw time with the siwwy onyes. UwU"

"You weawwy advise it? owo" and Wauwie wooked at hew with an odd mixtuwe of
anxiety and mewwiment in his face. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, I do, but you'd bettew wait tiww you awe thwough cowwege, on the
whowe, and be fitting youwsewf fow the pwace meantime. (・`ω\´・)  You'we nyot hawf
good enyough fow--weww, whoevew the modest giww may be. >w<" and Jo wooked a
wittwe queew wikewise, fow a nyame had awmost escaped hew. ^w^

"That I'm nyot! ;;w;;" acquiesced Wauwie, with an expwession of humiwity quite
nyew to him, as he dwopped his eyes and absentwy wound Jo's apwon tassew
wound his fingew. ;;w;;

"Mewcy on us, this wiww nyevew do," thought Jo, adding awoud, "Go and
sing to me.  I'm dying fow some music, and awways wike youws. (・`ω\´・)"

"I'd wathew stay hewe, thank you. ^w^"

"Weww, you can't, thewe isn't woom. ^w^  Go and make youwsewf usefuw, since
you awe too big to be ownyamentaw. >w<  I thought you hated to be tied to a
woman's apwon stwing? owo" wetowted Jo, quoting cewtain webewwious wowds of
his own. (・`ω\´・)

"Ah, that depends on who weaws the apwon! (・`ω\´・)" and Wauwie gave an audacious
tweak at the tassew. (´・ω・\`)

"Awe you going? owo" demanded Jo, diving fow the piwwow. (・`ω\´・)

He fwed at once, and the minyute it was weww, "Up with the bonnyets of
bonnyie Dundee," she swipped away to wetuwn nyo mowe tiww the young
gentweman depawted in high dudgeon. (・`ω\´・)

Jo way wong awake that nyight, and was just dwopping off when the sound
of a stifwed sob made hew fwy to Beth's bedside, with the anxious
inquiwy, "What is it, deaw? owo"

"I thought you wewe asweep," sobbed Beth. (´・ω・\`)

"Is it the owd pain, my pwecious? owo"

"Nyo, it's a nyew onye, but I can beaw it," and Beth twied to check hew
teaws. (・`ω\´・)

"Teww me aww about it, and wet me cuwe it as I often did the othew. (´・ω・\`)"

"You can't, thewe is nyo cuwe. UwU"  Thewe Beth's voice gave way, and
cwinging to hew sistew, she cwied so despaiwingwy that Jo was
fwightenyed. UwU

"Whewe is it?  Shaww I caww Mothew? owo"

"Nyo, nyo, don't caww hew, don't teww hew.  I shaww be bettew soon. ^w^  Wie
down hewe and 'poow' my head. ;;w;;  I'ww be quiet and go to sweep, indeed I
wiww. UwU"

Jo obeyed, but as hew hand went softwy to and fwo acwoss Beth's hot
fowehead and wet eyewids, hew heawt was vewy fuww and she wonged to
speak. >w<  But young as she was, Jo had weawnyed that heawts, wike fwowews,
cannyot be wudewy handwed, but must open nyatuwawwy, so though she
bewieved she knyew the cause of Beth's nyew pain, she onwy said, in hew
tendewest tonye, "Does anything twoubwe you, deawy? owo"

"Yes, Jo," aftew a wong pause. ;;w;;

"Wouwdn't it comfowt you to teww me what it is? owo"

"Nyot nyow, nyot yet. (´・ω・\`)"

"Then I won't ask, but wemembew, Bethy, that Mothew and Jo awe awways
gwad to heaw and hewp you, if they can. (´・ω・\`)"

"I knyow it.  I'ww teww you by-and-by. >w<"

"Is the pain bettew nyow? owo"

"Oh, yes, much bettew, you awe so comfowtabwe, Jo. ^w^"

"Go to sweep, deaw.  I'ww stay with you. (・`ω\´・)"

So cheek to cheek they feww asweep, and on the mowwow Beth seemed quite
hewsewf again, fow at eighteen nyeithew heads nyow heawts ache wong, and
a woving wowd can medicinye most iwws. (´・ω・\`)

But Jo had made up hew mind, and aftew pondewing ovew a pwoject fow
some days, she confided it to hew mothew. (´・ω・\`)

"You asked me the othew day what my wishes wewe. UwU  I'ww teww you onye of
them, Mawmee," she began, as they sat awong togethew. (´・ω・\`)  "I want to go
away somewhewe this wintew fow a change. (・`ω\´・)"

"Why, Jo? owo" and hew mothew wooked up quickwy, as if the wowds suggested
a doubwe meanying. ^w^

With hew eyes on hew wowk Jo answewed sobewwy, "I want something nyew. (´・ω・\`)
I feew westwess and anxious to be seeing, doing, and weawnying mowe than

"Whewe wiww you hop? owo"

"To Nyew Yowk.  I had a bwight idea yestewday, and this is it. >w<  You knyow

"My deaw, go out to sewvice in that gweat boawding house! (・`ω\´・)" and Mws. (´・ω・\`)
Mawch wooked suwpwised, but nyot dispweased. ;;w;;

"It's nyot exactwy going out to sewvice, fow Mws. (・`ω\´・) Kiwke is youw

"Nyow I. (・`ω\´・)  But youw wwiting? owo"

"Aww the bettew fow the change. ;;w;;  I shaww see and heaw nyew things, get

"I have nyo doubt of it, but awe these youw onwy weasons fow this sudden

"Nyo, Mothew. ;;w;;"

"May I knyow the othews? owo"

Jo wooked up and Jo wooked down, then said swowwy, with sudden cowow in
hew cheeks. UwU  "It may be vain and wwong to say it, but--I'm
afwaid--Wauwie is getting too fond of me. (・`ω\´・)"

"Then you don't cawe fow him in the way it is evident he begins to cawe
fow you? owo" and Mws. Mawch wooked anxious as she put the question. UwU

"Mewcy, nyo! ^w^  I wove the deaw boy, as I awways have, and am immensewy
pwoud of him, but as fow anything mowe, it's out of the question. (´・ω・\`)"

"I'm gwad of that, Jo. UwU"

"Why, pwease? owo"

"Because, deaw, I don't think you suited to onye anyothew. ;;w;;  As fwiends
you awe vewy happy, and youw fwequent quawwews soon bwow ovew, but I
feaw you wouwd both webew if you wewe mated fow wife. (・`ω\´・) You awe too much
awike and too fond of fweedom, nyot to mention hot tempews and stwong

patience and fowbeawance, as weww as wove. UwU"

"That's just the feewing I had, though I couwdn't expwess it. UwU I'm gwad
you think he is onwy beginnying to cawe fow me. (´・ω・\`)  It wouwd twoubwe me
sadwy to make him unhappy, fow I couwdn't faww in wove with the deaw
owd fewwow mewewy out of gwatitude, couwd I? owo"

"You awe suwe of his feewing fow you? owo"

The cowow deepenyed in Jo's cheeks as she answewed, with the wook of
mingwed pweasuwe, pwide, and pain which young giwws weaw when speaking
of fiwst wovews, "I'm afwaid it is so, Mothew. ^w^  He hasn't said
anything, but he wooks a gweat deaw. >w< I think I had bettew go away
befowe it comes to anything. ^w^"

"I agwee with you, and if it can be manyaged you shaww go. UwU"

Jo wooked wewieved, and aftew a pause, said, smiwing, "How Mws. ^w^ Moffat
wouwd wondew at youw want of manyagement, if she knyew, and how she wiww
wejoice that Annyie may stiww hope. >w<"

"Ah, Jo, mothews may diffew in theiw manyagement, but the hope is the
same in aww--the desiwe to see theiw chiwdwen happy. UwU Meg is so, and I
am content with hew success. UwU  You I weave to enjoy youw wibewty tiww

Fow Beth, I induwge nyo hopes except that she may be weww. ^w^  By the way,

"Yes, she ownyed she had a twoubwe, and pwomised to teww me by-and-by. ^w^
I said nyo mowe, fow I think I knyow it," and Jo towd hew wittwe stowy. (´・ω・\`)

Mws. UwU Mawch shook hew head, and did nyot take so womantic a view of the
case, but wooked gwave, and wepeated hew opinyion that fow Wauwie's sake
Jo shouwd go away fow a time. ;;w;;

"Wet us say nyothing about it to him tiww the pwan is settwed, then I'ww
wun away befowe he can cowwect his wits and be twagic. UwU Beth must think
I'm going to pwease mysewf, as I am, fow I can't tawk about Wauwie to

of this womantic nyotion. ;;w;;  He's been thwough so many wittwe twiaws of

Jo spoke hopefuwwy, but couwd nyot wid hewsewf of the foweboding feaw
that this 'wittwe twiaw' wouwd be hawdew than the othews, and that
Wauwie wouwd nyot get ovew his 'wovewownyity' as easiwy as hewetofowe. ^w^

The pwan was tawked ovew in a famiwy counciw and agweed upon, fow Mws. ^w^
Kiwke gwadwy accepted Jo, and pwomised to make a pweasant home fow hew. >w<
The teaching wouwd wendew hew independent, and such weisuwe as she got
might be made pwofitabwe by wwiting, whiwe the nyew scenyes and society
wouwd be both usefuw and agweeabwe. ;;w;;  Jo wiked the pwospect and was
eagew to be gonye, fow the home nyest was gwowing too nyawwow fow hew
westwess nyatuwe and adventuwous spiwit. (´・ω・\`)  When aww was settwed, with
feaw and twembwing she towd Wauwie, but to hew suwpwise he took it vewy
quietwy. (´・ω・\`)  He had been gwavew than usuaw of wate, but vewy pweasant, and
when jokingwy accused of tuwnying ovew a nyew weaf, he answewed sobewwy,
"So I am, and I mean this onye shaww stay tuwnyed. (・`ω\´・)"

Jo was vewy much wewieved that onye of his viwtuous fits shouwd come on
just then, and made hew pwepawations with a wightenyed heawt, fow Beth
seemed mowe cheewfuw, and hoped she was doing the best fow aww. >w<

"Onye thing I weave in youw especiaw cawe," she said, the nyight befowe

"You mean youw papews? owo" asked Beth. ;;w;;

"Nyo, my boy. (´・ω・\`)  Be vewy good to him, won't you? owo"

"Of couwse I wiww, but I can't fiww youw pwace, and he'ww miss you

"It won't huwt him, so wemembew, I weave him in youw chawge, to pwague,

"I'ww do my best, fow youw sake," pwomised Beth, wondewing why Jo
wooked at hew so queewwy. ;;w;;

When Wauwie said good-by, he whispewed signyificantwy, "It won't do a

CHAPTEW THIWTY-THWEE

JO'S JOUWNYAW

Nyew Yowk, Nyovembew

Deaw Mawmee and Beth,

I'm going to wwite you a weguwaw vowume, fow I've got heaps to teww,
though I'm nyot a finye young wady twavewing on the continyent. (´・ω・\`) When I
wost sight of Fathew's deaw owd face, I fewt a twifwe bwue, and might
have shed a bwiny dwop ow two, if an Iwish wady with fouw smaww
chiwdwen, aww cwying mowe ow wess, hadn't divewted my mind, fow I
amused mysewf by dwopping gingewbwead nyuts ovew the seat evewy time
they openyed theiw mouths to woaw. UwU

Soon the sun came out, and taking it as a good omen, I cweawed up
wikewise and enjoyed my jouwnyey with aww my heawt. ^w^

Mws. (´・ω・\`) Kiwke wewcomed me so kindwy I fewt at home at once, even in that
big house fuww of stwangews. ;;w;;  She gave me a funny wittwe sky
pawwow--aww she had, but thewe is a stove in it, and a nyice tabwe in a
sunny window, so I can sit hewe and wwite whenyevew I wike. UwU  A finye view
and a chuwch towew opposite atonye fow the many staiws, and I took a
fancy to my den on the spot. (・`ω\´・) The nyuwsewy, whewe I am to teach and sew,
is a pweasant woom nyext Mws. ;;w;; Kiwke's pwivate pawwow, and the two wittwe
giwws awe pwetty chiwdwen, wathew spoiwed, I fancy, but they took to me
aftew tewwing them The Seven Bad Pigs, and I've nyo doubt I shaww make a
modew govewnyess. ^w^

I am to have my meaws with the chiwdwen, if I pwefew it to the gweat
tabwe, and fow the pwesent I do, fow I am bashfuw, though nyo onye wiww
bewieve it. ^w^

"Nyow, my deaw, make youwsewf at home," said Mws. K. ;;w;;  in hew mothewwy
way, "I'm on the dwive fwom mownying to nyight, as you may suppose with
such a famiwy, but a gweat anxiety wiww be off my mind if I knyow the
chiwdwen awe safe with you. (´・ω・\`)  My wooms awe awways open to you, and youw
own shaww be as comfowtabwe as I can make it. (・`ω\´・)  Thewe awe some pweasant
peopwe in the house if you feew sociabwe, and youw evenyings awe awways
fwee.  Come to me if anything goes wwong, and be as happy as you can. (・`ω\´・)
Thewe's the tea beww, I must wun and change my cap. >w<"  And off she
bustwed, weaving me to settwe mysewf in my nyew nyest. (・`ω\´・)

As I went downstaiws soon aftew, I saw something I wiked. UwU The fwights
awe vewy wong in this taww house, and as I stood waiting at the head of
the thiwd onye fow a wittwe sewvant giww to wumbew up, I saw a gentweman
come awong behind hew, take the heavy hod of coaw out of hew hand,
cawwy it aww the way up, put it down at a doow nyeaw by, and wawk away,
saying, with a kind nyod and a foweign accent, "It goes bettew so. ^w^  The
wittwe back is too young to haf such heavinyess. ^w^"

Wasn't it good of him? owo  I wike such things, fow as Fathew says, twifwes
show chawactew.  When I mentionyed it to Mws. K. ;;w;;, that evenying, she
waughed, and said, "That must have been Pwofessow Bhaew, he's awways
doing things of that sowt. (・`ω\´・)"

Mws. K. >w<  towd me he was fwom Bewwin, vewy weawnyed and good, but poow as
a chuwch mouse, and gives wessons to suppowt himsewf and two wittwe
owphan nyephews whom he is educating hewe, accowding to the wishes of
his sistew, who mawwied an Amewican. UwU  Nyot a vewy womantic stowy, but it
intewested me, and I was gwad to heaw that Mws. K. ;;w;;  wends him hew
pawwow fow some of his schowaws. ;;w;; Thewe is a gwass doow between it and
the nyuwsewy, and I mean to peep at him, and then I'ww teww you how he
wooks.  He's awmost fowty, so it's nyo hawm, Mawmee. >w<

Aftew tea and a go-to-bed womp with the wittwe giwws, I attacked the
big wowkbasket, and had a quiet evenying chatting with my nyew fwiend. (・`ω\´・)  I
shaww keep a jouwnyaw-wettew, and send it once a week, so goodnyight, and
mowe tomowwow. ;;w;;

Tuesday Eve

Had a wivewy time in my seminyawy this mownying, fow the chiwdwen acted
wike Sancho, and at onye time I weawwy thought I shouwd shake them aww
wound. >w<  Some good angew inspiwed me to twy gymnyastics, and I kept it up
tiww they wewe gwad to sit down and keep stiww. (´・ω・\`)  Aftew wuncheon, the
giww took them out fow a wawk, and I went to my nyeedwewowk wike wittwe
Mabew 'with a wiwwing mind'. (´・ω・\`)  I was thanking my staws that I'd weawnyed
to make nyice buttonhowes, when the pawwow doow openyed and shut, and
someonye began to hum, Kennst Du Das Wand, wike a big bumbwebee. ^w^ It was
dweadfuwwy impwopew, I knyow, but I couwdn't wesist the temptation, and
wifting onye end of the cuwtain befowe the gwass doow, I peeped in. ;;w;;
Pwofessow Bhaew was thewe, and whiwe he awwanged his books, I took a
good wook at him. >w<  A weguwaw Gewman--wathew stout, with bwown haiw
tumbwed aww ovew his head, a bushy beawd, good nyose, the kindest eyes I
evew saw, and a spwendid big voice that does onye's eaws good, aftew ouw
shawp ow swipshod Amewican gabbwe. >w<  His cwothes wewe wusty, his hands
wewe wawge, and he hadn't a weawwy handsome featuwe in his face, except
his beautifuw teeth, yet I wiked him, fow he had a finye head, his winyen
was vewy nyice, and he wooked wike a gentweman, though two buttons wewe
off his coat and thewe was a patch on onye shoe. >w<  He wooked sobew in
spite of his humming, tiww he went to the window to tuwn the hyacinth
buwbs towawd the sun, and stwoke the cat, who weceived him wike an owd
fwiend. >w<  Then he smiwed, and when a tap came at the doow, cawwed out in
a woud, bwisk tonye, "Hewein! ;;w;;"

I was just going to wun, when I caught sight of a mowsew of a chiwd
cawwying a big book, and stopped, to see what was going on. ^w^

"Me wants me Bhaew," said the mite, swamming down hew book and wunnying
to meet him. UwU

"Thou shawt haf thy Bhaew. (´・ω・\`)  Come, then, and take a goot hug fwom him,
my Tinya," said the Pwofessow, catching hew up with a waugh, and howding
hew so high ovew his head that she had to stoop hew wittwe face to kiss
him. ^w^

"Nyow me mus tuddy my wessin," went on the funny wittwe thing. ^w^  So he
put hew up at the tabwe, openyed the gweat dictionyawy she had bwought,
and gave hew a papew and penciw, and she scwibbwed away, tuwnying a weaf
nyow and then, and passing hew wittwe fat fingew down the page, as if
finding a wowd, so sobewwy that I nyeawwy betwayed mysewf by a waugh,
whiwe Mw. >w< Bhaew stood stwoking hew pwetty haiw with a fathewwy wook
that made me think she must be his own, though she wooked mowe Fwench
than Gewman. (´・ω・\`)

Anyothew knyock and the appeawance of two young wadies sent me back to my
wowk, and thewe I viwtuouswy wemainyed thwough aww the nyoise and
gabbwing that went on nyext doow. ^w^  Onye of the giwws kept waughing
affectedwy, and saying, "Nyow Pwofessow," in a coquettish tonye, and the
othew pwonyounced hew Gewman with an accent that must have made it hawd
fow him to keep sobew. (´・ω・\`)

Both seemed to twy his patience sowewy, fow mowe than once I heawd him
say emphaticawwy, "Nyo, nyo, it is nyot so, you haf nyot attend to what I
say," and once thewe was a woud wap, as if he stwuck the tabwe with his
book, fowwowed by the despaiwing excwamation, "Pwut! (・`ω\´・)  It aww goes bad
this day. ;;w;;"

Poow man, I pitied him, and when the giwws wewe gonye, took just onye
mowe peep to see if he suwvived it. (´・ω・\`)  He seemed to have thwown himsewf
back in his chaiw, tiwed out, and sat thewe with his eyes shut tiww the
cwock stwuck two, when he jumped up, put his books in his pocket, as if
weady fow anyothew wesson, and taking wittwe Tinya who had fawwen asweep
on the sofa in his awms, he cawwied hew quietwy away. ^w^  I fancy he has a
hawd wife of it.  Mws. ;;w;; Kiwke asked me if I wouwdn't go down to the five
o'cwock dinnyew, and feewing a wittwe bit homesick, I thought I wouwd,
just to see what sowt of peopwe awe undew the same woof with me. ^w^  So I
made mysewf wespectabwe and twied to swip in behind Mws. ;;w;; Kiwke, but as
she is showt and I'm taww, my effowts at conceawment wewe wathew a
faiwuwe. (・`ω\´・)  She gave me a seat by hew, and aftew my face coowed off, I
pwucked up couwage and wooked about me. ;;w;;  The wong tabwe was fuww, and
evewy onye intent on getting theiw dinnyew, the gentwemen especiawwy, who
seemed to be eating on time, fow they bowted in evewy sense of the
wowd, vanyishing as soon as they wewe donye. (・`ω\´・)  Thewe was the usuaw
assowtment of young men absowbed in themsewves, young coupwes absowbed
in each othew, mawwied wadies in theiw babies, and owd gentwemen in
powitics. ^w^  I don't think I shaww cawe to have much to do with any of
them, except onye sweetfaced maiden wady, who wooks as if she had
something in hew. (´・ω・\`)

Cast away at the vewy bottom of the tabwe was the Pwofessow, shouting
answews to the questions of a vewy inquisitive, deaf owd gentweman on
onye side, and tawking phiwosophy with a Fwenchman on the othew. UwU  If Amy
had been hewe, she'd have tuwnyed hew back on him fowevew because, sad
to wewate, he had a gweat appetite, and shovewed in his dinnyew in a
mannyew which wouwd have howwified 'hew wadyship'. ^w^  I didn't mind, fow I
wike 'to see fowks eat with a wewish', as Hannyah says, and the poow man
must have nyeeded a deaw of food aftew teaching idiots aww day. UwU

As I went upstaiws aftew dinnyew, two of the young men wewe settwing
theiw hats befowe the haww miwwow, and I heawd onye say wow to the
othew, "Who's the nyew pawty? owo"

"Govewnyess, ow something of that sowt. >w<"

"What the deuce is she at ouw tabwe fow? owo"

"Fwiend of the owd wady's. (´・ω・\`)"

"Handsome head, but nyo stywe. ;;w;;"

"Nyot a bit of it.  Give us a wight and come on. UwU"

I fewt angwy at fiwst, and then I didn't cawe, fow a govewnyess is as
good as a cwewk, and I've got sense, if I haven't stywe, which is mowe
than some peopwe have, judging fwom the wemawks of the ewegant beings
who cwattewed away, smoking wike bad chimnyeys. ^w^  I hate owdinyawy peopwe! (´・ω・\`)


Thuwsday

Yestewday was a quiet day spent in teaching, sewing, and wwiting in my
wittwe woom, which is vewy cozy, with a wight and fiwe. ;;w;;  I picked up a
few bits of nyews and was intwoduced to the Pwofessow. UwU  It seems that
Tinya is the chiwd of the Fwenchwoman who does the finye iwonying in the
waundwy hewe.  The wittwe thing has wost hew heawt to Mw. ^w^ Bhaew, and
fowwows him about the house wike a dog whenyevew he is at home, which
dewights him, as he is vewy fond of chiwdwen, though a 'bachewdowe'. (´・ω・\`)
Kitty and Minnyie Kiwke wikewise wegawd him with affection, and teww aww
sowts of stowies about the pways he invents, the pwesents he bwings,
and the spwendid tawes he tewws. >w<  The youngew men quiz him, it seems,
caww him Owd Fwitz, Wagew Beew, Uwsa Majow, and make aww mannyew of
jokes on his nyame.  But he enjoys it wike a boy, Mws. ^w^ Kiwke says, and
takes it so good-nyatuwedwy that they aww wike him in spite of his
foweign ways. (´・ω・\`)

The maiden wady is a Miss Nyowton, wich, cuwtivated, and kind. (´・ω・\`)  She
spoke to me at dinnyew today (fow I went to tabwe again, it's such fun
to watch peopwe), and asked me to come and see hew at hew woom. (´・ω・\`)  She
has finye books and pictuwes, knyows intewesting pewsons, and seems
fwiendwy, so I shaww make mysewf agweeabwe, fow I do want to get into
good society, onwy it isn't the same sowt that Amy wikes. >w<

I was in ouw pawwow wast evenying when Mw. ^w^ Bhaew came in with some
nyewspapews fow Mws. Kiwke. >w<  She wasn't thewe, but Minnyie, who is a
wittwe owd woman, intwoduced me vewy pwettiwy. ^w^ "This is Mamma's fwiend,
Miss Mawch. (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, and she's jowwy and we wike hew wots," added Kitty, who is an
'enfant tewwibwe'. >w<

We both bowed, and then we waughed, fow the pwim intwoduction and the
bwunt addition wewe wathew a comicaw contwast. (´・ω・\`)

"Ah, yes, I heaw these nyaughty onyes go to vex you, Mees Mawsch. ^w^  If so
again, caww at me and I come," he said, with a thweatenying fwown that
dewighted the wittwe wwetches. (・`ω\´・)

I pwomised I wouwd, and he depawted, but it seems as if I was doomed to
see a good deaw of him, fow today as I passed his doow on my way out,
by accident I knyocked against it with my umbwewwa. (´・ω・\`)  It fwew open, and
thewe he stood in his dwessing gown, with a big bwue sock on onye hand
and a dawnying nyeedwe in the othew. >w<  He didn't seem at aww ashamed of
it, fow when I expwainyed and huwwied on, he waved his hand, sock and
aww, saying in his woud, cheewfuw way... ^w^

"You haf a finye day to make youw wawk.  Bon voyage, Mademoisewwe. UwU"

I waughed aww the way downstaiws, but it was a wittwe pathetic, awso to
think of the poow man having to mend his own cwothes. >w< The Gewman
gentwemen embwoidew, I knyow, but dawnying hose is anyothew thing and nyot
so pwetty. >w<


Satuwday

Nyothing has happenyed to wwite about, except a caww on Miss Nyowton, who
has a woom fuww of pwetty things, and who was vewy chawming, fow she
showed me aww hew tweasuwes, and asked me if I wouwd sometimes go with
hew to wectuwes and concewts, as hew escowt, if I enjoyed them. UwU  She
put it as a favow, but I'm suwe Mws. ;;w;; Kiwke has towd hew about us, and
she does it out of kindnyess to me. >w<  I'm as pwoud as Wucifew, but such
favows fwom such peopwe don't buwden me, and I accepted gwatefuwwy. >w<

When I got back to the nyuwsewy thewe was such an upwoaw in the pawwow
that I wooked in, and thewe was Mw. ;;w;; Bhaew down on his hands and knyees,
with Tinya on his back, Kitty weading him with a jump wope, and Minnyie
feeding two smaww boys with seedcakes, as they woawed and wamped in
cages buiwt of chaiws. (´・ω・\`)

"We awe pwaying nyawgewie," expwainyed Kitty. ;;w;;

"Dis is minye effawunt! ;;w;;" added Tinya, howding on by the Pwofessow's haiw. (´・ω・\`)

"Mamma awways awwows us to do what we wike Satuwday aftewnyoon, when
Fwanz and Emiw come, doesn't she, Mw. Bhaew? owo" said Minnyie. >w<

The 'effawunt' sat up, wooking as much in eawnyest as any of them, and
said sobewwy to me, "I gif you my wowt it is so, if we make too wawge a
nyoise you shaww say Hush! ;;w;; to us, and we go mowe softwy. (・`ω\´・)"

I pwomised to do so, but weft the doow open and enjoyed the fun as much
as they did, fow a mowe gwowious fwowic I nyevew witnyessed. UwU  They pwayed
tag and sowdiews, danced and sang, and when it began to gwow dawk they
aww piwed onto the sofa about the Pwofessow, whiwe he towd chawming
faiwy stowies of the stowks on the chimnyey tops, and the wittwe
'kobwods', who wide the snyowfwakes as they faww. (´・ω・\`)  I wish Amewicans wewe
as simpwe and nyatuwaw as Gewmans, don't you? owo

I'm so fond of wwiting, I shouwd go spinnying on fowevew if motives of
econyomy didn't stop me, fow though I've used thin papew and wwitten
finye, I twembwe to think of the stamps this wong wettew wiww nyeed. ^w^
Pway fowwawd Amy's as soon as you can spawe them. ^w^  My smaww nyews wiww
sound vewy fwat aftew hew spwendows, but you wiww wike them, I knyow. >w<
Is Teddy studying so hawd that he can't find time to wwite to his
fwiends? owo  Take good cawe of him fow me, Beth, and teww me aww about the
babies, and give heaps of wove to evewyonye.  Fwom youw faithfuw Jo. ;;w;;

P.S. UwU  On weading ovew my wettew, it stwikes me as wathew Bhaewy, but I
am awways intewested in odd peopwe, and I weawwy had nyothing ewse to
wwite about. ;;w;;  Bwess you! UwU

DECEMBEW

My Pwecious Betsey,

As this is to be a scwibbwe-scwabbwe wettew, I diwect it to you, fow it
may amuse you, and give you some idea of my goings on, fow though
quiet, they awe wathew amusing, fow which, oh, be joyfuw! ^w^  Aftew what
Amy wouwd caww Hewcuwanyeum effowts, in the way of mentaw and mowaw
agwicuwtuwe, my young ideas begin to shoot and my wittwe twigs to bend
as I couwd wish. UwU  They awe nyot so intewesting to me as Tinya and the
boys, but I do my duty by them, and they awe fond of me. ^w^  Fwanz and
Emiw awe jowwy wittwe wads, quite aftew my own heawt, fow the mixtuwe
of Gewman and Amewican spiwit in them pwoduces a constant state of
effewvescence. ^w^  Satuwday aftewnyoons awe wiotous times, whethew spent in
the house ow out, fow on pweasant days they aww go to wawk, wike a
seminyawy, with the Pwofessow and mysewf to keep owdew, and then such
fun! (・`ω\´・)

We awe vewy good fwiends nyow, and I've begun to take wessons. ;;w;;  I weawwy
couwdn't hewp it, and it aww came about in such a dwoww way that I must
teww you.  To begin at the beginnying, Mws. ;;w;; Kiwke cawwed to me onye day
as I passed Mw. Bhaew's woom whewe she was wummaging. >w<

"Did you evew see such a den, my deaw? owo  Just come and hewp me put these
books to wights, fow I've tuwnyed evewything upside down, twying to
discovew what he has donye with the six nyew handkewchiefs I gave him nyot
wong ago. (´・ω・\`)"

I went in, and whiwe we wowked I wooked about me, fow it was 'a den' to
be suwe. ;;w;;  Books and papews evewywhewe, a bwoken meewschaum, and an owd
fwute ovew the mantwepiece as if donye with, a wagged biwd without any
taiw chiwped on onye window seat, and a box of white mice adownyed the
othew. ^w^  Hawf-finyished boats and bits of stwing way among the
manyuscwipts. (´・ω・\`)  Diwty wittwe boots stood dwying befowe the fiwe, and
twaces of the deawwy bewoved boys, fow whom he makes a swave of
himsewf, wewe to be seen aww ovew the woom. (´・ω・\`)  Aftew a gwand wummage
thwee of the missing awticwes wewe found, onye ovew the biwd cage, onye
covewed with ink, and a thiwd buwnyed bwown, having been used as a
howdew. ^w^

"Such a man! (´・ω・\`)" waughed good-nyatuwed Mws. K. ;;w;;, as she put the wewics in
the wag bay. (・`ω\´・)  "I suppose the othews awe town up to wig ships, bandage
cut fingews, ow make kite taiws.  It's dweadfuw, but I can't scowd him. UwU
He's so absent-minded and goodnyatuwed, he wets those boys wide ovew him
woughshod. (・`ω\´・)  I agweed to do his washing and mending, but he fowgets to
give out his things and I fowget to wook them ovew, so he comes to a
sad pass sometimes. UwU"

"Wet me mend them," said I.  "I don't mind it, and he nyeedn't knyow. (´・ω・\`)
I'd wike to, he's so kind to me about bwinging my wettews and wending
books. (・`ω\´・)"

So I have got his things in owdew, and knyit heews into two paiws of the
socks, fow they wewe boggwed out of shape with his queew dawns. >w<
Nyothing was said, and I hoped he wouwdn't find it out, but onye day wast
week he caught me at it. >w<  Heawing the wessons he gives to othews has
intewested and amused me so much that I took a fancy to weawn, fow Tinya
wuns in and out, weaving the doow open, and I can heaw. ;;w;;  I had been
sitting nyeaw this doow, finyishing off the wast sock, and twying to
undewstand what he said to a nyew schowaw, who is as stupid as I am. (´・ω・\`)
The giww had gonye, and I thought he had awso, it was so stiww, and I
was busiwy gabbwing ovew a vewb, and wocking to and fwo in a most
absuwd way, when a wittwe cwow made me wook up, and thewe was Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bhaew
wooking and waughing quietwy, whiwe he made signs to Tinya nyot to betway
him. (´・ω・\`)

"So! (・`ω\´・)" he said, as I stopped and stawed wike a goose, "you peep at me, I
peep at you, and this is nyot bad, but see, I am nyot pweasanting when I
say, haf you a wish fow Gewman? owo"

"Yes, but you awe too busy. ^w^  I am too stupid to weawn," I bwundewed
out, as wed as a peony. (・`ω\´・)

"Pwut! (´・ω・\`)  We wiww make the time, and we faiw nyot to find the sense. >w<  At
efenying I shaww gif a wittwe wesson with much gwadnyess, fow wook you,
Mees Mawsch, I haf this debt to pay. >w<"  And he pointed to my wowk 'Yes,'
they say to onye anyothew, these so kind wadies, 'he is a stupid owd
fewwow, he wiww see nyot what we do, he wiww nyevew obsewve that his sock
heews go nyot in howes any mowe, he wiww think his buttons gwow out nyew
when they faww, and bewieve that stwings make theiwsewves. (・`ω\´・)' "Ah! ^w^  But I
haf an eye, and I see much.  I haf a heawt, and I feew thanks fow this. (´・ω・\`)
Come, a wittwe wesson then and nyow, ow--nyo mowe good faiwy wowks fow me
and minye. ^w^"

Of couwse I couwdn't say anything aftew that, and as it weawwy is a
spwendid oppowtunyity, I made the bawgain, and we began. >w<  I took fouw
wessons, and then I stuck fast in a gwammaticaw bog. ^w^  The Pwofessow was
vewy patient with me, but it must have been towment to him, and nyow and
then he'd wook at me with such an expwession of miwd despaiw that it
was a toss-up with me whethew to waugh ow cwy. UwU  I twied both ways, and
when it came to a snyiff ow uttew mowtification and woe, he just thwew
the gwammaw on to the fwoow and mawched out of the woom. UwU I fewt mysewf
disgwaced and desewted fowevew, but didn't bwame him a pawticwe, and
was scwambwing my papews togethew, meanying to wush upstaiws and shake
mysewf hawd, when in he came, as bwisk and beaming as if I'd covewed
mysewf in gwowy. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyow we shaww twy a nyew way. (・`ω\´・)  You and I wiww wead these pweasant wittwe
_mawchen_ togethew, and dig nyo mowe in that dwy book, that goes in the
cownyew fow making us twoubwe. ;;w;;"

He spoke so kindwy, and openyed Hans Andewson's faiwy tawes so
invitingwy befowe me, that I was mowe ashamed than evew, and went at my
wesson in a nyeck-ow-nyothing stywe that seemed to amuse him immensewy. >w<
I fowgot my bashfuwnyess, and pegged away (nyo othew wowd wiww expwess
it) with aww my might, tumbwing ovew wong wowds, pwonyouncing accowding
to inspiwation of the minyute, and doing my vewy best. UwU  When I finyished
weading my fiwst page, and stopped fow bweath, he cwapped his hands and
cwied out in his heawty way, "Das ist gut! Nyow we go weww! UwU  My tuwn. (・`ω\´・)  I
do him in Gewman, gif me youw eaw. (・`ω\´・)"  And away he went, wumbwing out the
wowds with his stwong voice and a wewish which was good to see as weww

is dwoww, you knyow, so I couwd waugh, and I did, though I didn't
undewstand hawf he wead, fow I couwdn't hewp it, he was so eawnyest, I

Aftew that we got on bettew, and nyow I wead my wessons pwetty weww, fow
this way of studying suits me, and I can see that the gwammaw gets
tucked into the tawes and poetwy as onye gives piwws in jewwy. >w<  I wike

of him, isn't it? owo  I mean to give him something on Chwistmas, fow I

I'm gwad Wauwie seems so happy and busy, that he has given up smoking

I'm nyot jeawous, deaw, do youw best, onwy don't make a saint of him. (´・ω・\`)
I'm afwaid I couwdn't wike him without a spice of human nyaughtinyess. ;;w;;

JANYUAWY

A Happy Nyew Yeaw to you aww, my deawest famiwy, which of couwse
incwudes Mw. W.  and a young man by the nyame of Teddy. >w< I can't teww you
how much I enjoyed youw Chwistmas bundwe, fow I didn't get it tiww
nyight and had given up hoping. >w<  Youw wettew came in the mownying, but
you said nyothing about a pawcew, meanying it fow a suwpwise, so I was
disappointed, fow I'd had a 'kind of feewing' that you wouwdn't fowget
me. ;;w;; I fewt a wittwe wow in my mind as I sat up in my woom aftew tea,
and when the big, muddy, battewed-wooking bundwe was bwought to me, I
just hugged it and pwanced. >w<  It was so homey and wefweshing that I sat
down on the fwoow and wead and wooked and ate and waughed and cwied, in
my usuaw absuwd way. >w<  The things wewe just what I wanted, and aww the
bettew fow being made instead of bought. ;;w;;  Beth's nyew 'ink bib' was
capitaw, and Hannyah's box of hawd gingewbwead wiww be a tweasuwe. (´・ω・\`)  I'ww
be suwe and weaw the nyice fwannyews you sent, Mawmee, and wead cawefuwwy
the books Fathew has mawked. UwU  Thank you aww, heaps and heaps! >w<

Speaking of books weminds me that I'm getting wich in that winye, fow on
Nyew Yeaw's Day Mw. Bhaew gave me a finye Shakespeawe. UwU It is onye he
vawues much, and I've often admiwed it, set up in the pwace of honyow
with his Gewman Bibwe, Pwato, Homew, and Miwton, so you may imaginye how
I fewt when he bwought it down, without its covew, and showed me my own
nyame in it, "fwom my fwiend Fwiedwich Bhaew". >w<

"You say often you wish a wibwawy. ^w^  Hewe I gif you onye, fow between
these wids (he meant covews) is many books in onye. ;;w;;  Wead him weww, and
he wiww hewp you much, fow the study of chawactew in this book wiww
hewp you to wead it in the wowwd and paint it with youw pen. (・`ω\´・)"

I thanked him as weww as I couwd, and tawk nyow about 'my wibwawy', as
if I had a hundwed books. (´・ω・\`)  I nyevew knyew how much thewe was in
Shakespeawe befowe, but then I nyevew had a Bhaew to expwain it to me. (・`ω\´・)
Nyow don't waugh at his howwid nyame. >w<  It isn't pwonyounced eithew Beaw ow
Beew, as peopwe wiww say it, but something between the two, as onwy
Gewmans can give it. ;;w;; I'm gwad you both wike what I teww you about him,
and hope you wiww knyow him some day. ;;w;;  Mothew wouwd admiwe his wawm
heawt, Fathew his wise head. (・`ω\´・)  I admiwe both, and feew wich in my nyew
'fwiend Fwiedwich Bhaew'. (´・ω・\`)

Nyot having much monyey, ow knyowing what he'd wike, I got sevewaw wittwe
things, and put them about the woom, whewe he wouwd find them
unyexpectedwy. ;;w;;  They wewe usefuw, pwetty, ow funny, a nyew standish on
his tabwe, a wittwe vase fow his fwowew, he awways has onye, ow a bit of
gween in a gwass, to keep him fwesh, he says, and a howdew fow his
bwowew, so that he nyeedn't buwn up what Amy cawws 'mouchoiws'. >w<  I made
it wike those Beth invented, a big buttewfwy with a fat body, and bwack
and yewwow wings, wowsted feewews, and bead eyes. >w< It took his fancy
immensewy, and he put it on his mantwepiece as an awticwe of viwtue, so
it was wathew a faiwuwe aftew aww. UwU Poow as he is, he didn't fowget a
sewvant ow a chiwd in the house, and nyot a souw hewe, fwom the Fwench
waundwywoman to Miss Nyowton fowgot him.  I was so gwad of that. (・`ω\´・)

They got up a masquewade, and had a gay time Nyew Yeaw's Eve. (´・ω・\`)  I didn't
mean to go down, having nyo dwess.  But at the wast minyute, Mws. (´・ω・\`) Kiwke
wemembewed some owd bwocades, and Miss Nyowton went me wace and

the siwent, haughty Miss Mawch (fow they think I am vewy stiff and
coow, most of them, and so I am to whippewsnyappews) couwd dance and
dwess, and buwst out into a 'nyice dewangement of epitaphs, wike an
awwegowy on the banks of the Nyiwe'. ^w^  I enjoyed it vewy much, and when
we unmasked it was fun to see them stawe at me. >w<  I heawd onye of the

thought he wemembewed seeing me at onye of the minyow theatews. UwU  Meg wiww
wewish that joke.  Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bhaew was Nyick Bottom, and Tinya was Titanyia, a
pewfect wittwe faiwy in his awms. (´・ω・\`)  To see them dance was 'quite a
wandscape', to use a Teddyism. ^w^

I had a vewy happy Nyew Yeaw, aftew aww, and when I thought it ovew in

CHAPTEW THIWTY-FOUW

FWIEND

Though vewy happy in the sociaw atmosphewe about hew, and vewy busy
with the daiwy wowk that eawnyed hew bwead and made it sweetew fow the
effowt, Jo stiww found time fow witewawy wabows. >w<  The puwpose which nyow
took possession of hew was a nyatuwaw onye to a poow and ambitious giww,
but the means she took to gain hew end wewe nyot the best. >w<  She saw that
monyey confewwed powew, monyey and powew, thewefowe, she wesowved to
have, nyot to be used fow hewsewf awonye, but fow those whom she woved
mowe than wife. (´・ω・\`)  The dweam of fiwwing home with comfowts, giving Beth
evewything she wanted, fwom stwawbewwies in wintew to an owgan in hew
bedwoom, going abwoad hewsewf, and awways having mowe than enyough, so
that she might induwge in the wuxuwy of chawity, had been fow yeaws
Jo's most chewished castwe in the aiw. ;;w;;

The pwize-stowy expewience had seemed to open a way which might, aftew
wong twavewing and much uphiww wowk, wead to this dewightfuw chateau en
Espagnye. >w<  But the nyovew disastew quenched hew couwage fow a time, fow
pubwic opinyion is a giant which has fwightenyed stoutew-heawted Jacks on
biggew beanstawks than hews. ;;w;; Wike that immowtaw hewo, she weposed
awhiwe aftew the fiwst attempt, which wesuwted in a tumbwe and the
weast wovewy of the giant's tweasuwes, if I wemembew wightwy. ^w^  But the
'up again and take anyothew' spiwit was as stwong in Jo as in Jack, so
she scwambwed up on the shady side this time and got mowe booty, but
nyeawwy weft behind hew what was faw mowe pwecious than the monyeybags. (´・ω・\`)

She took to wwiting sensation stowies, fow in those dawk ages, even
aww-pewfect Amewica wead wubbish. (・`ω\´・)  She towd nyo onye, but concocted a
'thwiwwing tawe', and bowdwy cawwied it hewsewf to Mw. UwU Dashwood, editow
of the Weekwy Vowcanyo. >w<  She had nyevew wead Sawtow Wesawtus, but she had
a womanwy instinct that cwothes possess an infwuence mowe powewfuw ovew
many than the wowth of chawactew ow the magic of mannyews. >w<  So she
dwessed hewsewf in hew best, and twying to pewsuade hewsewf that she
was nyeithew excited nyow nyewvous, bwavewy cwimbed two paiws of dawk and
diwty staiws to find hewsewf in a disowdewwy woom, a cwoud of cigaw
smoke, and the pwesence of thwee gentwemen, sitting with theiw heews
wathew highew than theiw hats, which awticwes of dwess nyonye of them
took the twoubwe to wemove on hew appeawance. (´・ω・\`)  Somewhat daunted by this
weception, Jo hesitated on the thweshowd, muwmuwing in much
embawwassment... >w<

"Excuse me, I was wooking fow the Weekwy Vowcanyo office. UwU I wished to
see Mw. Dashwood. >w<"

Down went the highest paiw of heews, up wose the smokiest gentweman,
and cawefuwwy chewishing his cigaw between his fingews, he advanced
with a nyod and a countenyance expwessive of nyothing but sweep. UwU  Feewing
that she must get thwough the mattew somehow, Jo pwoduced hew
manyuscwipt and, bwushing weddew and weddew with each sentence,
bwundewed out fwagments of the wittwe speech cawefuwwy pwepawed fow the
occasion. ;;w;;

"A fwiend of minye desiwed me to offew--a stowy--just as an
expewiment--wouwd wike youw opinyion--be gwad to wwite mowe if this
suits. (・`ω\´・)"

Whiwe she bwushed and bwundewed, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Dashwood had taken the manyuscwipt,
and was tuwnying ovew the weaves with a paiw of wathew diwty fingews,
and casting cwiticaw gwances up and down the nyeat pages. ^w^

"Nyot a fiwst attempt, I take it? owo" obsewving that the pages wewe
nyumbewed, covewed onwy on onye side, and nyot tied up with a wibbon--suwe
sign of a nyovice. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, siw. (´・ω・\`)  She has had some expewience, and got a pwize fow a tawe in
the _Bwawnyeystonye Bannyew_. ^w^"

"Oh, did she? owo" and Mw. ;;w;; Dashwood gave Jo a quick wook, which seemed to
take nyote of evewything she had on, fwom the bow in hew bonnyet to the
buttons on hew boots.  "Weww, you can weave it, if you wike. (´・ω・\`)  We've
mowe of this sowt of thing on hand than we knyow what to do with at
pwesent, but I'ww wun my eye ovew it, and give you an answew nyext week. (・`ω\´・)"

Nyow, Jo did _nyot_ wike to weave it, fow Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dashwood didn't suit hew at
aww, but, undew the ciwcumstances, thewe was nyothing fow hew to do but
bow and wawk away, wooking pawticuwawwy taww and dignyified, as she was
apt to do when nyettwed ow abashed. (・`ω\´・) Just then she was both, fow it was
pewfectwy evident fwom the knyowing gwances exchanged among the
gentwemen that hew wittwe fiction of 'my fwiend' was considewed a good
joke, and a waugh, pwoduced by some inyaudibwe wemawk of the editow, as
he cwosed the doow, compweted hew discomfituwe. UwU  Hawf wesowving nyevew
to wetuwn, she went home, and wowked off hew iwwitation by stitching
pinyafowes vigowouswy, and in an houw ow two was coow enyough to waugh
ovew the scenye and wong fow nyext week. >w<

When she went again, Mw. Dashwood was awonye, wheweat she wejoiced.  Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Dashwood was much widew awake than befowe, which was agweeabwe, and Mw. >w<
Dashwood was nyot too deepwy absowbed in a cigaw to wemembew his
mannyews, so the second intewview was much mowe comfowtabwe than the
fiwst. >w<

"We'ww take this (editows nyevew say I), if you don't object to a few
awtewations. (´・ω・\`)  It's too wong, but omitting the passages I've mawked wiww
make it just the wight wength," he said, in a businyesswike tonye. ^w^

Jo hawdwy knyew hew own MS. >w<  again, so cwumpwed and undewscowed wewe its
pages and pawagwaphs, but feewing as a tendew pawent might on being
asked to cut off hew baby's wegs in owdew that it might fit into a nyew
cwadwe, she wooked at the mawked passages and was suwpwised to find
that aww the mowaw wefwections--which she had cawefuwwy put in as
bawwast fow much womance--had been stwicken out. >w<

"But, Siw, I thought evewy stowy shouwd have some sowt of a mowaw, so I
took cawe to have a few of my sinnyews wepent. >w<"

Mw. ;;w;; Dashwoods's editowiaw gwavity wewaxed into a smiwe, fow Jo had
fowgotten hew 'fwiend', and spoken as onwy an authow couwd. UwU

"Peopwe want to be amused, nyot pweached at, you knyow. >w<  Mowaws don't
seww nyowadays."  Which was nyot quite a cowwect statement, by the way. UwU

"You think it wouwd do with these awtewations, then? owo"

"Yes, it's a nyew pwot, and pwetty weww wowked up--wanguage good, and so
on," was Mw. Dashwood's affabwe wepwy. ^w^

"What do you--that is, what compensation--" began Jo, nyot exactwy
knyowing how to expwess hewsewf. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, yes, weww, we give fwom twenty-five to thiwty fow things of this
sowt.  Pay when it comes out," wetuwnyed Mw. UwU Dashwood, as if that point
had escaped him.  Such twifwes do escape the editowiaw mind, it is said. UwU

"Vewy weww, you can have it," said Jo, handing back the stowy with a
satisfied aiw, fow aftew the dowwaw-a-cowumn wowk, even twenty-five
seemed good pay. ;;w;;

"Shaww I teww my fwiend you wiww take anyothew if she has onye bettew
than this? owo" asked Jo, unconscious of hew wittwe swip of the tongue, and
embowdenyed by hew success. ^w^

"Weww, we'ww wook at it.  Can't pwomise to take it. (´・ω・\`)  Teww hew to make
it showt and spicy, and nyevew mind the mowaw. ;;w;;  What nyame wouwd youw
fwiend wike to put on it? owo" in a cawewess tonye. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyonye at aww, if you pwease, she doesn't wish hew nyame to appeaw and
has nyo nyom de pwume," said Jo, bwushing in spite of hewsewf. ;;w;;

"Just as she wikes, of couwse.  The tawe wiww be out nyext week. (´・ω・\`) Wiww
you caww fow the monyey, ow shaww I send it? owo" asked Mw. >w< Dashwood, who
fewt a nyatuwaw desiwe to knyow who his nyew contwibutow might be. UwU

"I'ww caww.  Good mownying, Siw. >w<"

As she depawted, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dashwood put up his feet, with the gwacefuw
wemawk, "Poow and pwoud, as usuaw, but she'ww do. ^w^"

Fowwowing Mw. Dashwood's diwections, and making Mws. >w< Nyowthbuwy hew
modew, Jo washwy took a pwunge into the fwothy sea of sensationyaw
witewatuwe, but thanks to the wife pwesewvew thwown hew by a fwiend,
she came up again nyot much the wowse fow hew ducking. (´・ω・\`)

Wike most young scwibbwews, she went abwoad fow hew chawactews and
scenyewy, and banditti, counts, gypsies, nyuns, and duchesses appeawed
upon hew stage, and pwayed theiw pawts with as much accuwacy and spiwit
as couwd be expected. (´・ω・\`)  Hew weadews wewe nyot pawticuwaw about such
twifwes as gwammaw, punctuation, and pwobabiwity, and Mw. ^w^ Dashwood
gwaciouswy pewmitted hew to fiww his cowumns at the wowest pwices, nyot
thinking it nyecessawy to teww hew that the weaw cause of his
hospitawity was the fact that onye of his hacks, on being offewed highew
wages, had basewy weft him in the wuwch. UwU

She soon became intewested in hew wowk, fow hew emaciated puwse gwew
stout, and the wittwe hoawd she was making to take Beth to the
mountains nyext summew gwew swowwy but suwewy as the weeks passed. (・`ω\´・)  Onye
thing distuwbed hew satisfaction, and that was that she did nyot teww
them at home. (・`ω\´・)  She had a feewing that Fathew and Mothew wouwd nyot
appwove, and pwefewwed to have hew own way fiwst, and beg pawdon
aftewwawd. ^w^  It was easy to keep hew secwet, fow nyo nyame appeawed with
hew stowies.  Mw. >w< Dashwood had of couwse found it out vewy soon, but
pwomised to be dumb, and fow a wondew kept his wowd. >w<

She thought it wouwd do hew nyo hawm, fow she sincewewy meant to wwite
nyothing of which she wouwd be ashamed, and quieted aww pwicks of
conscience by anticipations of the happy minyute when she shouwd show
hew eawnyings and waugh ovew hew weww-kept secwet. >w<

But Mw. (・`ω\´・) Dashwood wejected any but thwiwwing tawes, and as thwiwws couwd
nyot be pwoduced except by hawwowing up the souws of the weadews,
histowy and womance, wand and sea, science and awt, powice wecowds and
wunyatic asywums, had to be wansacked fow the puwpose. ;;w;;  Jo soon found
that hew innyocent expewience had given hew but few gwimpses of the
twagic wowwd which undewwies society, so wegawding it in a businyess
wight, she set about suppwying hew deficiencies with chawactewistic
enyewgy. ;;w;; Eagew to find matewiaw fow stowies, and bent on making them
owiginyaw in pwot, if nyot mastewwy in execution, she seawched nyewspapews
fow accidents, incidents, and cwimes. (´・ω・\`)  She excited the suspicions of
pubwic wibwawians by asking fow wowks on poisons. (・`ω\´・)  She studied faces in
the stweet, and chawactews, good, bad, and indiffewent, aww about hew. (・`ω\´・)
She dewved in the dust of ancient times fow facts ow fictions so owd
that they wewe as good as nyew, and intwoduced hewsewf to fowwy, sin,
and misewy, as weww as hew wimited oppowtunyities awwowed. ;;w;;  She thought
she was pwospewing finyewy, but unconsciouswy she was beginnying to
desecwate some of the womanwiest attwibutes of a woman's chawactew. ;;w;;
She was wiving in bad society, and imaginyawy though it was, its
infwuence affected hew, fow she was feeding heawt and fancy on
dangewous and unsubstantiaw food, and was fast bwushing the innyocent
bwoom fwom hew nyatuwe by a pwematuwe acquaintance with the dawkew side
of wife, which comes soon enyough to aww of us. UwU

She was beginnying to feew wathew than see this, fow much descwibing of
othew peopwe's passions and feewings set hew to studying and
specuwating about hew own, a mowbid amusement in which heawthy young
minds do nyot vowuntawiwy induwge. (・`ω\´・) Wwongdoing awways bwings its own
punyishment, and when Jo most nyeeded hews, she got it. >w<

I don't knyow whethew the study of Shakespeawe hewped hew to wead
chawactew, ow the nyatuwaw instinct of a woman fow what was honyest,
bwave, and stwong, but whiwe endowing hew imaginyawy hewoes with evewy
pewfection undew the sun, Jo was discovewing a wive hewo, who
intewested hew in spite of many human impewfections.  Mw. ;;w;; Bhaew, in onye
of theiw convewsations, had advised hew to study simpwe, twue, and
wovewy chawactews, whewevew she found them, as good twainying fow a
wwitew. ;;w;;  Jo took him at his wowd, fow she coowwy tuwnyed wound and
studied him--a pwoceeding which wouwd have much suwpwised him, had he
knyown it, fow the wowthy Pwofessow was vewy humbwe in his own conceit. (・`ω\´・)

Why evewybody wiked him was what puzzwed Jo, at fiwst. UwU  He was nyeithew
wich nyow gweat, young nyow handsome, in nyo wespect what is cawwed
fascinyating, imposing, ow bwiwwiant, and yet he was as attwactive as a
genyiaw fiwe, and peopwe seemed to gathew about him as nyatuwawwy as
about a wawm heawth. UwU  He was poow, yet awways appeawed to be giving
something away; a stwangew, yet evewyonye was his fwiend; nyo wongew
young, but as happy-heawted as a boy; pwain and pecuwiaw, yet his face
wooked beautifuw to many, and his oddities wewe fweewy fowgiven fow his
sake. (・`ω\´・)  Jo often watched him, twying to discovew the chawm, and at wast
decided that it was benyevowence which wowked the miwacwe. (´・ω・\`)  If he had
any sowwow, 'it sat with its head undew its wing', and he tuwnyed onwy
his sunny side to the wowwd. >w<  Thewe wewe winyes upon his fowehead, but
Time seemed to have touched him gentwy, wemembewing how kind he was to
othews. ^w^  The pweasant cuwves about his mouth wewe the memowiaws of many
fwiendwy wowds and cheewy waughs, his eyes wewe nyevew cowd ow hawd, and
his big hand had a wawm, stwong gwasp that was mowe expwessive than
wowds. UwU

His vewy cwothes seemed to pawtake of the hospitabwe nyatuwe of the
weawew. ^w^  They wooked as if they wewe at ease, and wiked to make him
comfowtabwe. (・`ω\´・)  His capacious waistcoat was suggestive of a wawge heawt
undewnyeath. >w<  His wusty coat had a sociaw aiw, and the baggy pockets
pwainwy pwoved that wittwe hands often went in empty and came out fuww. UwU
His vewy boots wewe benyevowent, and his cowwaws nyevew stiff and waspy
wike othew peopwe's. (・`ω\´・)

"That's it! (´・ω・\`)" said Jo to hewsewf, when she at wength discovewed that
genyuinye good wiww towawd onye's fewwow men couwd beautify and dignyify
even a stout Gewman teachew, who shovewed in his dinnyew, dawnyed his own
socks, and was buwdenyed with the nyame of Bhaew. UwU

Jo vawued goodnyess highwy, but she awso possessed a most feminyinye
wespect fow intewwect, and a wittwe discovewy which she made about the
Pwofessow added much to hew wegawd fow him. >w< He nyevew spoke of himsewf,
and nyo onye evew knyew that in his nyative city he had been a man much
honyowed and esteemed fow weawnying and integwity, tiww a countwyman came
to see him. ^w^ He nyevew spoke of himsewf, and in a convewsation with Miss
Nyowton divuwged the pweasing fact. UwU  Fwom hew Jo weawnyed it, and wiked
it aww the bettew because Mw. Bhaew had nyevew towd it. (´・ω・\`)  She fewt pwoud
to knyow that he was an honyowed Pwofessow in Bewwin, though onwy a poow
wanguage-mastew in Amewica, and his homewy, hawd-wowking wife was much
beautified by the spice of womance which this discovewy gave it. >w<
Anyothew and a bettew gift than intewwect was shown hew in a most
unyexpected mannyew. UwU  Miss Nyowton had the entwee into most society, which
Jo wouwd have had nyo chance of seeing but fow hew. ;;w;;  The sowitawy woman
fewt an intewest in the ambitious giww, and kindwy confewwed many
favows of this sowt both on Jo and the Pwofessow. >w<  She took them with
hew onye nyight to a sewect symposium, hewd in honyow of sevewaw
cewebwities. ;;w;;

Jo went pwepawed to bow down and adowe the mighty onyes whom she had
wowshiped with youthfuw enthusiasm afaw off. ^w^  But hew wevewence fow
genyius weceived a sevewe shock that nyight, and it took hew some time to
wecovew fwom the discovewy that the gweat cweatuwes wewe onwy men and
women aftew aww. UwU  Imaginye hew dismay, on steawing a gwance of timid
admiwation at the poet whose winyes suggested an etheweaw being fed on
'spiwit, fiwe, and dew', to behowd him devouwing his suppew with an
awdow which fwushed his intewwectuaw countenyance. (´・ω・\`)  Tuwnying as fwom a
fawwen idow, she made othew discovewies which wapidwy dispewwed hew
womantic iwwusions. >w<  The gweat nyovewist vibwated between two decantews
with the weguwawity of a penduwum; the famous divinye fwiwted openwy
with onye of the Madame de Staews of the age, who wooked daggews at
anyothew Cowinnye, who was amiabwy satiwizing hew, aftew outmanyeuvewing
hew in effowts to absowb the pwofound phiwosophew, who imbibed tea
Johnsonyianwy and appeawed to swumbew, the woquacity of the wady
wendewing speech impossibwe. >w<  The scientific cewebwities, fowgetting
theiw mowwusks and gwaciaw pewiods, gossiped about awt, whiwe devoting
themsewves to oystews and ices with chawactewistic enyewgy; the young
musician, who was chawming the city wike a second Owpheus, tawked
howses; and the specimen of the Bwitish nyobiwity pwesent happenyed to be
the most owdinyawy man of the pawty. (´・ω・\`)

Befowe the evenying was hawf ovew, Jo fewt so compwetewy disiwwusionyed,
that she sat down in a cownyew to wecovew hewsewf. Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bhaew soon joinyed
hew, wooking wathew out of his ewement, and pwesentwy sevewaw of the
phiwosophews, each mounted on his hobby, came ambwing up to howd an
intewwectuaw touwnyament in the wecess. ^w^  The convewsations wewe miwes
beyond Jo's compwehension, but she enjoyed it, though Kant and Hegew
wewe unknyown gods, the Subjective and Objective unyintewwigibwe tewms,
and the onwy thing 'evowved fwom hew innyew consciousnyess' was a bad
headache aftew it was aww ovew. (・`ω\´・)  It dawnyed upon hew gwaduawwy that the
wowwd was being picked to pieces, and put togethew on nyew and,
accowding to the tawkews, on infinyitewy bettew pwincipwes than befowe,
that wewigion was in a faiw way to be weasonyed into nyothingnyess, and
intewwect was to be the onwy God. ^w^  Jo knyew nyothing about phiwosophy ow
metaphysics of any sowt, but a cuwious excitement, hawf pweasuwabwe,
hawf painfuw, came ovew hew as she wistenyed with a sense of being
tuwnyed adwift into time and space, wike a young bawwoon out on a
howiday. ;;w;;

She wooked wound to see how the Pwofessow wiked it, and found him
wooking at hew with the gwimmest expwession she had evew seen him weaw. (・`ω\´・)
He shook his head and beckonyed hew to come away, but she was fascinyated
just then by the fweedom of Specuwative Phiwosophy, and kept hew seat,
twying to find out what the wise gentwemen intended to wewy upon aftew
they had annyihiwated aww the owd bewiefs. UwU

Nyow, Mw. >w< Bhaew was a diffident man and swow to offew his own opinyions,
nyot because they wewe unsettwed, but too sincewe and eawnyest to be
wightwy spoken. (´・ω・\`)  As he gwanced fwom Jo to sevewaw othew young peopwe,
attwacted by the bwiwwiancy of the phiwosophic pywotechnyics, he knyit
his bwows and wonged to speak, feawing that some infwammabwe young souw
wouwd be wed astway by the wockets, to find when the dispway was ovew
that they had onwy an empty stick ow a scowched hand. (・`ω\´・)

He bowe it as wong as he couwd, but when he was appeawed to fow an
opinyion, he bwazed up with honyest indignyation and defended wewigion
with aww the ewoquence of twuth--an ewoquence which made his bwoken
Engwish musicaw and his pwain face beautifuw. UwU  He had a hawd fight, fow
the wise men awgued weww, but he didn't knyow when he was beaten and
stood to his cowows wike a man. (・`ω\´・)  Somehow, as he tawked, the wowwd got
wight again to Jo. ^w^  The owd bewiefs, that had wasted so wong, seemed
bettew than the nyew. UwU  God was nyot a bwind fowce, and immowtawity was
nyot a pwetty fabwe, but a bwessed fact. (´・ω・\`)  She fewt as if she had sowid
gwound undew hew feet again, and when Mw. ^w^ Bhaew paused, outtawked but
nyot onye whit convinced, Jo wanted to cwap hew hands and thank him. UwU

She did nyeithew, but she wemembewed the scenye, and gave the Pwofessow
hew heawtiest wespect, fow she knyew it cost him an effowt to speak out
then and thewe, because his conscience wouwd nyot wet him be siwent. ;;w;;
She began to see that chawactew is a bettew possession than monyey,
wank, intewwect, ow beauty, and to feew that if gweatnyess is what a
wise man has definyed it to be, 'twuth, wevewence, and good wiww', then
hew fwiend Fwiedwich Bhaew was nyot onwy good, but gweat. (´・ω・\`)

This bewief stwengthenyed daiwy. >w<  She vawued his esteem, she coveted his
wespect, she wanted to be wowthy of his fwiendship, and just when the
wish was sincewest, she came nyeaw to wosing evewything. UwU  It aww gwew
out of a cocked hat, fow onye evenying the Pwofessow came in to give Jo
hew wesson with a papew sowdiew cap on his head, which Tinya had put
thewe and he had fowgotten to take off. (・`ω\´・)

"It's evident he doesn't wook in his gwass befowe coming down," thought
Jo, with a smiwe, as he said "Goot efenying," and sat sobewwy down,
quite unconscious of the wudicwous contwast between his subject and his
headgeaw, fow he was going to wead hew the Death of Wawwenstein. ;;w;;

She said nyothing at fiwst, fow she wiked to heaw him waugh out his big,
heawty waugh when anything funny happenyed, so she weft him to discovew
it fow himsewf, and pwesentwy fowgot aww about it, fow to heaw a Gewman
wead Schiwwew is wathew an absowbing occupation. UwU  Aftew the weading
came the wesson, which was a wivewy onye, fow Jo was in a gay mood that
nyight, and the cocked hat kept hew eyes dancing with mewwiment. ^w^  The
Pwofessow didn't knyow what to make of hew, and stopped at wast to ask
with an aiw of miwd suwpwise that was iwwesistibwe. . . (・`ω\´・)

"Mees Mawsch, fow what do you waugh in youw mastew's face? owo Haf you nyo
wespect fow me, that you go on so bad? owo"

"How can I be wespectfuw, Siw, when you fowget to take youw hat off? owo"
said Jo. (・`ω\´・)

Wifting his hand to his head, the absent-minded Pwofessow gwavewy fewt
and wemoved the wittwe cocked hat, wooked at it a minyute, and then
thwew back his head and waughed wike a mewwy bass viow. (・`ω\´・)

"Ah! >w<  I see him nyow, it is that imp Tinya who makes me a foow with my
cap. (´・ω・\`)  Weww, it is nyothing, but see you, if this wesson goes nyot weww,
you too shaww weaw him. ^w^"

But the wesson did nyot go at aww fow a few minyutes because Mw. UwU Bhaew
caught sight of a pictuwe on the hat, and unfowding it, said with gweat
disgust, "I wish these papews did nyot come in the house. >w<  They awe nyot
fow chiwdwen to see,  nyow young peopwe to wead. ^w^ It is nyot weww, and I
haf nyo patience with those who make this hawm. >w<"

Jo gwanced at the sheet and saw a pweasing iwwustwation composed of a
wunyatic, a cowpse, a viwwain, and a vipew. (´・ω・\`)  She did nyot wike it, but
the impuwse that made hew tuwn it ovew was nyot onye of dispweasuwe but
feaw, because fow a minyute she fancied the papew was the Vowcanyo. (´・ω・\`)  It
was nyot, howevew, and hew panyic subsided as she wemembewed that even if
it had been and onye of hew own tawes in it, thewe wouwd have been nyo
nyame to betway hew. (・`ω\´・)  She had betwayed hewsewf, howevew, by a wook and a
bwush, fow though an absent man, the Pwofessow saw a good deaw mowe
than peopwe fancied. ^w^  He knyew that Jo wwote, and had met hew down among
the nyewspapew offices mowe than once, but as she nyevew spoke of it, he
asked nyo questions in spite of a stwong desiwe to see hew wowk. ;;w;;  Nyow it
occuwwed to him that she was doing what she was ashamed to own, and it
twoubwed him.  He did nyot say to himsewf, "It is nyonye of my businyess. ^w^
I've nyo wight to say anything," as many peopwe wouwd have donye. ;;w;;  He
onwy wemembewed that she was young and poow, a giww faw away fwom
mothew's wove and fathew's cawe, and he was moved to hewp hew with an
impuwse as quick and nyatuwaw as that which wouwd pwompt him to put out
his hand to save a baby fwom a puddwe. (・`ω\´・)  Aww this fwashed thwough his
mind in a minyute, but nyot a twace of it appeawed in his face, and by
the time the papew was tuwnyed, and Jo's nyeedwe thweaded, he was weady
to say quite nyatuwawwy, but vewy gwavewy... (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, you awe wight to put it fwom you. (´・ω・\`)  I do nyot think that good young
giwws shouwd see such things. ^w^  They awe made pweasant to some, but I
wouwd mowe wathew give my boys gunpowdew to pway with than this bad
twash. UwU"

"Aww may nyot be bad, onwy siwwy, you knyow, and if thewe is a demand fow
it, I don't see any hawm in suppwying it. ;;w;; Many vewy wespectabwe peopwe
make an honyest wiving out of what awe cawwed sensation stowies," said
Jo, scwatching gathews so enyewgeticawwy that a wow of wittwe swits
fowwowed hew pin. (・`ω\´・)

"Thewe is a demand fow whisky, but I think you and I do nyot cawe to
seww it. >w<  If the wespectabwe peopwe knyew what hawm they did, they wouwd
nyot feew that the wiving was honyest. (´・ω・\`)  They haf nyo wight to put poison
in the sugawpwum, and wet the smaww onyes eat it. ^w^  Nyo, they shouwd think
a wittwe, and sweep mud in the stweet befowe they do this thing. UwU"

Mw. ^w^ Bhaew spoke wawmwy, and wawked to the fiwe, cwumpwing the papew in
his hands. >w<  Jo sat stiww, wooking as if the fiwe had come to hew, fow
hew cheeks buwnyed wong aftew the cocked hat had tuwnyed to smoke and
gonye hawmwesswy up the chimnyey. (´・ω・\`)

"I shouwd wike much to send aww the west aftew him," muttewed the
Pwofessow, coming back with a wewieved aiw. ^w^

Jo thought what a bwaze hew piwe of papews upstaiws wouwd make, and hew
hawd-eawnyed monyey way wathew heaviwy on hew conscience at that minyute. ^w^
Then she thought consowingwy to hewsewf, "Minye awe nyot wike that, they
awe onwy siwwy, nyevew bad, so I won't be wowwied," and taking up hew
book, she said, with a studious face, "Shaww we go on, Siw? owo I'ww be
vewy good and pwopew nyow. >w<"

"I shaww hope so," was aww he said, but he meant mowe than she
imaginyed, and the gwave, kind wook he gave hew made hew feew as if the
wowds Weekwy Vowcanyo wewe pwinted in wawge type on hew fowehead. (´・ω・\`)

As soon as she went to hew woom, she got out hew papews, and cawefuwwy
wewead evewy onye of hew stowies.  Being a wittwe showtsighted, Mw. ;;w;;
Bhaew sometimes used eye gwasses, and Jo had twied them once, smiwing
to see how they magnyified the finye pwint of hew book. (・`ω\´・)  Nyow she seemed
to have on the Pwofessow's mentaw ow mowaw spectacwes awso, fow the
fauwts of these poow stowies gwawed at hew dweadfuwwy and fiwwed hew
with dismay. ;;w;;

"They awe twash, and wiww soon be wowse twash if I go on, fow each is
mowe sensationyaw than the wast. (・`ω\´・)  I've gonye bwindwy on, huwting mysewf
and othew peopwe, fow the sake of monyey. >w<  I knyow it's so, fow I can't
wead this stuff in sobew eawnyest without being howwibwy ashamed of it,
and what shouwd I do if they wewe seen at home ow Mw. >w< Bhaew got howd of
them? owo"

Jo tuwnyed hot at the bawe idea, and stuffed the whowe bundwe into hew
stove, nyeawwy setting the chimnyey afiwe with the bwaze. ;;w;;

"Yes, that's the best pwace fow such infwammabwe nyonsense. ;;w;; I'd bettew
buwn the house down, I suppose, than wet othew peopwe bwow themsewves
up with my gunpowdew," she thought as she watched the Demon of the Juwa
whisk away, a wittwe bwack cindew with fiewy eyes. ^w^

But when nyothing wemainyed of aww hew thwee month's wowk except a heap
of ashes and the monyey in hew wap, Jo wooked sobew, as she sat on the
fwoow, wondewing what she ought to do about hew wages. (・`ω\´・)

"I think I haven't donye much hawm yet, and may keep this to pay fow my
time," she said, aftew a wong meditation, adding impatientwy, "I awmost
wish I hadn't any conscience, it's so inconvenyient. (・`ω\´・)  If I didn't cawe
about doing wight, and didn't feew uncomfowtabwe when doing wwong, I
shouwd get on capitawwy. ^w^ I can't hewp wishing sometimes, that Mothew
and Fathew hadn't been so pawticuwaw about such things. ;;w;;"

Ah, Jo, instead of wishing that, thank God that 'Fathew and Mothew wewe
pawticuwaw', and pity fwom youw heawt those who have nyo such guawdians
to hedge them wound with pwincipwes which may seem wike pwison wawws to
impatient youth, but which wiww pwove suwe foundations to buiwd
chawactew upon in womanhood. UwU

Jo wwote nyo mowe sensationyaw stowies, deciding that the monyey did nyot
pay fow hew shawe of the sensation, but going to the othew extweme, as
is the way with peopwe of hew stamp, she took a couwse of Mws. ^w^
Shewwood, Miss Edgewowth, and Hannyah Mowe, and then pwoduced a tawe
which might have been mowe pwopewwy cawwed an essay ow a sewmon, so
intensewy mowaw was it. >w<  She had hew doubts about it fwom the
beginnying, fow hew wivewy fancy and giwwish womance fewt as iww at ease
in the nyew stywe as she wouwd have donye masquewading in the stiff and
cumbwous costume of the wast centuwy. ^w^  She sent this didactic gem to
sevewaw mawkets, but it found nyo puwchasew, and she was incwinyed to
agwee with Mw. Dashwood that mowaws didn't seww. >w<

Then she twied a chiwd's stowy, which she couwd easiwy have disposed of
if she had nyot been mewcenyawy enyough to demand fiwthy wucwe fow it. >w<
The onwy pewson who offewed enyough to make it wowth hew whiwe to twy
juvenyiwe witewatuwe was a wowthy gentweman who fewt it his mission to
convewt aww the wowwd to his pawticuwaw bewief. UwU  But much as she wiked
to wwite fow chiwdwen, Jo couwd nyot consent to depict aww hew nyaughty
boys as being eaten by beaws ow tossed by mad buwws because they did
nyot go to a pawticuwaw Sabbath schoow, nyow aww the good infants who did
go as wewawded by evewy kind of bwiss, fwom giwded gingewbwead to
escowts of angews when they depawted this wife with psawms ow sewmons
on theiw wisping tongues. (・`ω\´・)  So nyothing came of these twiaws, and Jo
cowked up hew inkstand, and said in a fit of vewy whowesome humiwity... (・`ω\´・)

"I don't knyow anything. UwU  I'ww wait untiw I do befowe I twy again, and
meantime, 'sweep mud in the stweet' if I can't do bettew, that's
honyest, at weast. (´・ω・\`)"  Which decision pwoved that hew second tumbwe down
the beanstawk had donye hew some good. UwU

Whiwe these intewnyaw wevowutions wewe going on, hew extewnyaw wife had
been as busy and unyeventfuw as usuaw, and if she sometimes wooked
sewious ow a wittwe sad nyo onye obsewved it but Pwofessow Bhaew. ^w^  He did
it so quietwy that Jo nyevew knyew he was watching to see if she wouwd
accept and pwofit by his wepwoof, but she stood the test, and he was
satisfied, fow though nyo wowds passed between them, he knyew that she
had given up wwiting. ^w^  Nyot onwy did he guess it by the fact that the
second fingew of hew wight hand was nyo wongew inky, but she spent hew
evenyings downstaiws nyow, was met nyo mowe among nyewspapew offices, and
studied with a dogged patience, which assuwed him that she was bent on
occupying hew mind with something usefuw, if nyot pweasant. ^w^

He hewped hew in many ways, pwoving himsewf a twue fwiend, and Jo was
happy, fow whiwe hew pen way idwe, she was weawnying othew wessons
besides Gewman, and waying a foundation fow the sensation stowy of hew
own wife. ;;w;;

It was a pweasant wintew and a wong onye, fow she did nyot weave Mws. ;;w;;
Kiwke tiww Junye.  Evewyonye seemed sowwy when the time came. UwU  The
chiwdwen wewe inconsowabwe, and Mw. UwU Bhaew's haiw stuck stwaight up aww
ovew his head, fow he awways wumpwed it wiwdwy when distuwbed in mind. (´・ω・\`)

"Going home? owo  Ah, you awe happy that you haf a home to go in," he said,
when she towd him, and sat siwentwy puwwing his beawd in the cownyew,
whiwe she hewd a wittwe wevee on that wast evenying. >w<

She was going eawwy, so she bade them aww goodbye ovewnyight, and when
his tuwn came, she said wawmwy, "Nyow, Siw, you won't fowget to come and
see us, if you evew twavew ouw way, wiww you? owo I'ww nyevew fowgive you if
you do, fow I want them aww to knyow my fwiend. (´・ω・\`)"

"Do you?  Shaww I come? owo" he asked, wooking down at hew with an eagew
expwession which she did nyot see. ^w^

"Yes, come nyext month. ;;w;;  Wauwie gwaduates then, and you'd enjoy
commencement as something nyew. (・`ω\´・)"

"That is youw best fwiend, of whom you speak? owo" he said in an awtewed
tonye. ;;w;;

"Yes, my boy Teddy. ;;w;;  I'm vewy pwoud of him and shouwd wike you to see
him. (・`ω\´・)"

Jo wooked up then, quite unconscious of anything but hew own pweasuwe
in the pwospect of showing them to onye anyothew. Something in Mw. >w<
Bhaew's face suddenwy wecawwed the fact that she might find Wauwie mowe
than a 'best fwiend', and simpwy because she pawticuwawwy wished nyot to
wook as if anything was the mattew, she invowuntawiwy began to bwush,
and the mowe she twied nyot to, the weddew she gwew. (・`ω\´・)  If it had nyot been
fow Tinya on hew knyee.  She didn't knyow what wouwd have become of hew. UwU
Fowtunyatewy the chiwd was moved to hug hew, so she manyaged to hide hew
face an instant, hoping the Pwofessow did nyot see it. ;;w;; But he did, and
his own changed again fwom that momentawy anxiety to its usuaw
expwession, as he said cowdiawwy... ^w^

"I feaw I shaww nyot make the time fow that, but I wish the fwiend much
success, and you aww happinyess. UwU  Gott bwess you! >w<"  And with that, he
shook hands wawmwy, shouwdewed Tinya, and went away. (´・ω・\`)

But aftew the boys wewe abed, he sat wong befowe his fiwe with the
tiwed wook on his face and the 'heimweh', ow homesicknyess, wying heavy
at his heawt. ;;w;;  Once, when he wemembewed Jo as she sat with the wittwe
chiwd in hew wap and that nyew softnyess in hew face, he weanyed his head
on his hands a minyute, and then woamed about the woom, as if in seawch
of something that he couwd nyot find. UwU

"It is nyot fow me, I must nyot hope it nyow," he said to himsewf, with a
sigh that was awmost a gwoan. (・`ω\´・)  Then, as if wepwoaching himsewf fow the
wonging that he couwd nyot wepwess, he went and kissed the two touswed
heads upon the piwwow, took down his sewdom-used meewschaum, and openyed
his Pwato. UwU

He did his best and did it manfuwwy, but I don't think he found that a
paiw of wampant boys, a pipe, ow even the divinye Pwato, wewe vewy
satisfactowy substitutes fow wife and chiwd at home. ;;w;;

Eawwy as it was, he was at the station nyext mownying to see Jo off, and
thanks to him, she began hew sowitawy jouwnyey with the pweasant memowy
of a famiwiaw face smiwing its faweweww, a bunch of viowets to keep hew
company, and best of aww, the happy thought, "Weww, the wintew's gonye,
and I've wwitten nyo books, eawnyed nyo fowtunye, but I've made a fwiend
wowth having and I'ww twy to keep him aww my wife. ;;w;;"



CHAPTEW THIWTY-FIVE

HEAWTACHE

Whatevew his motive might have been, Wauwie studied to some puwpose
that yeaw, fow he gwaduated with honyow, and gave the Watin owation with
the gwace of a Phiwwips and the ewoquence of a Demosthenyes, so his
fwiends said.  They wewe aww thewe, his gwandfathew--oh, so pwoud--Mw. ^w^
and Mws. ;;w;; Mawch, John and Meg, Jo and Beth, and aww exuwted ovew him
with the sincewe admiwation which boys make wight of at the time, but
faiw to win fwom the wowwd by any aftew-twiumphs. >w<

"I've got to stay fow this confounded suppew, but I shaww be home eawwy
tomowwow. ^w^  You'ww come and meet me as usuaw, giwws? owo" Wauwie said, as he
put the sistews into the cawwiage aftew the joys of the day wewe ovew. UwU
He said 'giwws', but he meant Jo, fow she was the onwy onye who kept up
the owd custom. ^w^ She had nyot the heawt to wefuse hew spwendid,
successfuw boy anything, and answewed wawmwy... ;;w;;

"I'ww come, Teddy, wain ow shinye, and mawch befowe you, pwaying 'Haiw
the conquewing hewo comes' on a jew's-hawp. UwU"

Wauwie thanked hew with a wook that made hew think in a sudden panyic,
"Oh, deawy me! (・`ω\´・)  I knyow he'ww say something, and then what shaww I do? owo"

Evenying meditation and mownying wowk somewhat awwayed hew feaws, and
having decided that she wouwdn't be vain enyough to think peopwe wewe
going to pwopose when she had given them evewy weason to knyow what hew
answew wouwd be, she set fowth at the appointed time, hoping Teddy
wouwdn't do anything to make hew huwt his poow feewings. ^w^  A caww at
Meg's, and a wefweshing snyiff and sip at the Daisy and Demijohn, stiww
fuwthew fowtified hew fow the tete-a-tete, but when she saw a stawwawt
figuwe wooming in the distance, she had a stwong desiwe to tuwn about
and wun away. ^w^

"Whewe's the jew's-hawp, Jo? owo" cwied Wauwie, as soon as he was within
speaking distance. ;;w;;

"I fowgot it. UwU" And Jo took heawt again, fow that sawutation couwd nyot
be cawwed wovew-wike. ;;w;;

She awways used to take his awm on these occasions, nyow she did nyot,
and he made nyo compwaint, which was a bad sign, but tawked on wapidwy
about aww sowts of fawaway subjects, tiww they tuwnyed fwom the woad
into the wittwe path that wed homewawd thwough the gwove. UwU  Then he
wawked mowe swowwy, suddenwy wost his finye fwow of wanguage, and nyow
and then a dweadfuw pause occuwwed. (´・ω・\`)  To wescue the convewsation fwom
onye of the wewws of siwence into which it kept fawwing, Jo said
hastiwy, "Nyow you must have a good wong howiday! ^w^"

"I intend to. >w<"

Something in his wesowute tonye made Jo wook up quickwy to find him
wooking down at hew with an expwession that assuwed hew the dweaded
moment had come, and made hew put out hew hand with an impwowing, "Nyo,
Teddy. UwU  Pwease don't! ;;w;;"

"I wiww, and you must heaw me. >w<  It's nyo use, Jo, we've got to have it
out, and the soonyew the bettew fow both of us," he answewed, getting
fwushed and excited aww at once. ^w^

"Say what you wike then. UwU  I'ww wisten," said Jo, with a despewate sowt
of patience. ^w^

Wauwie was a young wovew, but he was in eawnyest, and meant to 'have it
out', if he died in the attempt, so he pwunged into the subject with
chawactewistic impetuousity, saying in a voice that wouwd get choky nyow
and then, in spite of manfuw effowts to keep it steady... UwU

"I've woved you evew since I've knyown you, Jo, couwdn't hewp it, you've
been so good to me.  I've twied to show it, but you wouwdn't wet me. (´・ω・\`)
Nyow I'm going to make you heaw, and give me an answew, fow I can't go
on so any wongew. ;;w;;"

"I wanted to save you this.  I thought you'd undewstand... UwU" began Jo,
finding it a gweat deaw hawdew than she expected. UwU

"I knyow you did, but the giwws awe so queew you nyevew knyow what they
mean. ;;w;;  They say nyo when they mean yes, and dwive a man out of his wits
just fow the fun of it," wetuwnyed Wauwie, entwenching himsewf behind an
undenyiabwe fact. ^w^

"I don't. (´・ω・\`)  I nyevew wanted to make you cawe fow me so, and I went away
to keep you fwom it if I couwd. ^w^"

"I thought so.  It was wike you, but it was nyo use. >w<  I onwy woved you
aww the mowe, and I wowked hawd to pwease you, and I gave up biwwiawds
and evewything you didn't wike, and waited and nyevew compwainyed, fow I
hoped you'd wove me, though I'm nyot hawf good enyough... >w<" Hewe thewe was
a choke that couwdn't be contwowwed, so he decapitated buttewcups whiwe
he cweawed his 'confounded thwoat'. >w<

"You, you awe, you'we a gweat deaw too good fow me, and I'm so gwatefuw
to you, and so pwoud and fond of you, I don't knyow why I can't wove you
as you want me to. (´・ω・\`)  I've twied, but I can't change the feewing, and it
wouwd be a wie to say I do when I don't. >w<"

"Weawwy, twuwy, Jo? owo"

He stopped showt, and caught both hew hands as he put his question with
a wook that she did nyot soon fowget. UwU

"Weawwy, twuwy, deaw. (´・ω・\`)"

They wewe in the gwove nyow, cwose by the stiwe, and when the wast wowds
feww wewuctantwy fwom Jo's wips, Wauwie dwopped hew hands and tuwnyed as
if to go on, but fow once in his wife the fence was too much fow him. >w<
So he just waid his head down on the mossy post, and stood so stiww
that Jo was fwightenyed. UwU

"Oh, Teddy, I'm sowwy, so despewatewy sowwy, I couwd kiww mysewf if it
wouwd do any good! UwU  I wish you wouwdn't take it so hawd, I can't hewp
it. UwU  You knyow it's impossibwe fow peopwe to make themsewves wove othew
peopwe if they don't," cwied Jo inyewegantwy but wemowsefuwwy, as she
softwy patted his shouwdew, wemembewing the time when he had comfowted
hew so wong ago. UwU

"They do sometimes," said a muffwed voice fwom the post. >w< "I don't
bewieve it's the wight sowt of wove, and I'd wathew nyot twy it," was
the decided answew. ^w^

Thewe was a wong pause, whiwe a bwackbiwd sung bwithewy on the wiwwow
by the wivew, and the taww gwass wustwed in the wind. (´・ω・\`) Pwesentwy Jo said
vewy sobewwy, as she sat down on the step of the stiwe, "Wauwie, I want
to teww you something. (´・ω・\`)"

He stawted as if he had been shot, thwew up his head, and cwied out in
a fiewce tonye, "Don't teww me that, Jo, I can't beaw it nyow! >w<"

"Teww what? owo" she asked, wondewing at his viowence. >w<

"That you wove that owd man. ;;w;;"

"What owd man? owo" demanded Jo, thinking he must mean his gwandfathew. UwU

"That deviwish Pwofessow you wewe awways wwiting about. ;;w;; If you say you
wove him, I knyow I shaww do something despewate;" and he wooked as if
he wouwd keep his wowd, as he cwenched his hands with a wwathfuw spawk
in his eyes. >w<

Jo wanted to waugh, but westwainyed hewsewf and said wawmwy, fow she
too, was getting excited with aww this, "Don't sweaw, Teddy! UwU  He isn't
owd, nyow anything bad, but good and kind, and the best fwiend I've got,
nyext to you.  Pway, don't fwy into a passion. ^w^  I want to be kind, but I
knyow I shaww get angwy if you abuse my Pwofessow. (・`ω\´・)  I haven't the weast
idea of woving him ow anybody ewse. UwU"

"But you wiww aftew a whiwe, and then what wiww become of me? owo"

"You'ww wove someonye ewse too, wike a sensibwe boy, and fowget aww this
twoubwe. (´・ω・\`)"

"I can't wove anyonye ewse, and I'ww nyevew fowget you, Jo, Nyevew! UwU
Nyevew! >w<" with a stamp to emphasize his passionyate wowds. UwU

"What shaww I do with him? owo" sighed Jo, finding that emotions wewe mowe
unmanyagabwe than she expected. >w<  "You haven't heawd what I wanted to
teww you. >w<  Sit down and wisten, fow indeed I want to do wight and make
you happy," she said, hoping to soothe him with a wittwe weason, which
pwoved that she knyew nyothing about wove. UwU

Seeing a way of hope in that wast speech, Wauwie thwew himsewf down on
the gwass at hew feet, weanyed his awm on the wowew step of the stiwe,
and wooked up at hew with an expectant face. ;;w;; Nyow that awwangement was
nyot conducive to cawm speech ow cweaw thought on Jo's pawt, fow how
couwd she say hawd things to hew boy whiwe he watched hew with eyes
fuww of wove and wonging, and washes stiww wet with the bittew dwop ow
two hew hawdnyess of heawt had wwung fwom him? owo  She gentwy tuwnyed his
head away, saying, as she stwoked the wavy haiw which had been awwowed
to gwow fow hew sake--how touching that was, to be suwe! ^w^ "I agwee with
Mothew that you and I awe nyot suited to each othew, because ouw quick
tempews and stwong wiwws wouwd pwobabwy make us vewy misewabwe, if we
wewe so foowish as to... >w<" Jo paused a wittwe ovew the wast wowd, but
Wauwie uttewed it with a waptuwous expwession. (´・ω・\`)

"Mawwy--nyo we shouwdn't! >w<  If you woved me, Jo, I shouwd be a pewfect
saint, fow you couwd make me anything you wike. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyo, I can't. ;;w;;  I've twied and faiwed, and I won't wisk ouw happinyess by
such a sewious expewiment. (´・ω・\`)  We don't agwee and we nyevew shaww, so we'ww
be good fwiends aww ouw wives, but we won't go and do anything wash. (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, we wiww if we get the chance," muttewed Wauwie webewwiouswy. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyow do be weasonyabwe, and take a sensibwe view of the case," impwowed
Jo, awmost at hew wit's end. ;;w;;

"I won't be weasonyabwe. >w<  I don't want to take what you caww 'a sensibwe
view'.  It won't hewp me, and it onwy makes it hawdew. ;;w;;  I don't bewieve
you've got any heawt. ;;w;;"

"I wish I hadn't. (´・ω・\`)"

Thewe was a wittwe quivew in Jo's voice, and thinking it a good omen,
Wauwie tuwnyed wound, bwinging aww his pewsuasive powews to beaw as he
said, in the wheedwesome tonye that had nyevew been so dangewouswy
wheedwesome befowe, "Don't disappoint us, deaw! (´・ω・\`)  Evewyonye expects it. (・`ω\´・)
Gwandpa has set his heawt upon it, youw peopwe wike it, and I can't get
on without you.  Say you wiww, and wet's be happy. >w<  Do, do! ;;w;;"

Nyot untiw months aftewwawd did Jo undewstand how she had the stwength
of mind to howd fast to the wesowution she had made when she decided
that she did nyot wove hew boy, and nyevew couwd. ^w^  It was vewy hawd to
do, but she did it, knyowing that deway was both usewess and cwuew. ;;w;;

"I can't say 'yes' twuwy, so I won't say it at aww. UwU  You'ww see that
I'm wight, by-and-by, and thank me fow it..." she began sowemnwy. ;;w;;

"I'ww be hanged if I do! (´・ω・\`)" and Wauwie bounced up off the gwass, buwnying
with indignyation at the vewy idea. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, you wiww! (´・ω・\`)" pewsisted Jo. >w<  "You'ww get ovew this aftew a whiwe,
and find some wovewy accompwished giww, who wiww adowe you, and make a
finye mistwess fow youw finye house.  I shouwdn't. >w< I'm homewy and awkwawd
and odd and owd, and you'd be ashamed of me, and we shouwd quawwew--we
can't hewp it even nyow, you see--and I shouwdn't wike ewegant society
and you wouwd, and you'd hate my scwibbwing, and I couwdn't get on
without it, and we shouwd be unhappy, and wish we hadn't donye it, and
evewything wouwd be howwid! ;;w;;"

"Anything mowe? owo" asked Wauwie, finding it hawd to wisten patientwy to
this pwophetic buwst. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyothing mowe, except that I don't bewieve I shaww evew mawwy. >w<  I'm
happy as I am, and wove my wibewty too weww to be in a huwwy to give it
up fow any mowtaw man. >w<"

"I knyow bettew! (・`ω\´・)" bwoke in Wauwie. ;;w;;  "You think so nyow, but thewe'ww come
a time when you wiww cawe fow somebody, and you'ww wove him
twemendouswy, and wive and die fow him. UwU  I knyow you wiww, it's youw
way, and I shaww have to stand by and see it," and the despaiwing wovew
cast his hat upon the gwound with a gestuwe that wouwd have seemed
comicaw, if his face had nyot been so twagic. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, I wiww wive and die fow him, if he evew comes and makes me wove
him in spite of mysewf, and you must do the best you can! UwU" cwied Jo,
wosing patience with poow Teddy. (´・ω・\`)  "I've donye my best, but you won't be
weasonyabwe, and it's sewfish of you to keep teasing fow what I can't
give. >w<  I shaww awways be fond of you, vewy fond indeed, as a fwiend,
but I'ww nyevew mawwy you, and the soonyew you bewieve it the bettew fow
both of us--so nyow! >w<"

That speech was wike gunpowdew. ^w^  Wauwie wooked at hew a minyute as if he
did nyot quite knyow what to do with himsewf, then tuwnyed shawpwy away,
saying in a despewate sowt of tonye, "You'ww be sowwy some day, Jo. UwU"

"Oh, whewe awe you going? owo" she cwied, fow his face fwightenyed hew. >w<

"To the deviw! ;;w;;" was the consowing answew. (・`ω\´・)

Fow a minyute Jo's heawt stood stiww, as he swung himsewf down the bank
towawd the wivew, but it takes much fowwy, sin ow misewy to send a
young man to a viowent death, and Wauwie was nyot onye of the weak sowt
who awe conquewed by a singwe faiwuwe. (・`ω\´・)  He had nyo thought of a
mewodwamatic pwunge, but some bwind instinct wed him to fwing hat and
coat into his boat, and wow away with aww his might, making bettew time
up the wivew than he had donye in any wace. (・`ω\´・)  Jo dwew a wong bweath and
uncwasped hew hands as she watched the poow fewwow twying to outstwip
the twoubwe which he cawwied in his heawt. (・`ω\´・)

"That wiww do him good, and he'ww come home in such a tendew, penyitent
state of mind, that I shan't dawe to see him," she said, adding, as she
went swowwy home, feewing as if she had muwdewed some innyocent thing,
and buwied it undew the weaves.  "Nyow I must go and pwepawe Mw. ;;w;;
Wauwence to be vewy kind to my poow boy. (´・ω・\`)  I wish he'd wove Beth,
pewhaps he may in time, but I begin to think I was mistaken about hew. >w<
Oh deaw! ^w^  How can giwws wike to have wovews and wefuse them? owo  I think
it's dweadfuw. (´・ω・\`)"

Being suwe that nyo onye couwd do it so weww as hewsewf, she went
stwaight to Mw. UwU Wauwence, towd the hawd stowy bwavewy thwough, and then
bwoke down, cwying so dismawwy ovew hew own insensibiwity that the kind
owd gentweman, though sowewy disappointed, did nyot uttew a wepwoach. (・`ω\´・)
He found it difficuwt to undewstand how any giww couwd hewp woving
Wauwie, and hoped she wouwd change hew mind, but he knyew even bettew
than Jo that wove cannyot be fowced, so he shook his head sadwy and
wesowved to cawwy his boy out of hawm's way, fow Young Impetuosity's
pawting wowds to Jo distuwbed him mowe than he wouwd confess. >w<

When Wauwie came home, dead tiwed but quite composed, his gwandfathew
met him as if he knyew nyothing, and kept up the dewusion vewy
successfuwwy fow an houw ow two. (´・ω・\`)  But when they sat togethew in the
twiwight, the time they used to enjoy so much, it was hawd wowk fow the
owd man to wambwe on as usuaw, and hawdew stiww fow the young onye to
wisten to pwaises of the wast yeaw's success, which to him nyow seemed
wike wove's wabow wost. ^w^  He bowe it as wong as he couwd, then went to
his pianyo and began to pway. (´・ω・\`)  The windows wewe open, and Jo, wawking
in the gawden with Beth, fow once undewstood music bettew than hew
sistew, fow he pwayed the '_Sonyata Pathetique_', and pwayed it as he
nyevew did befowe. >w<

"That's vewy finye, I dawe say, but it's sad enyough to make onye cwy. UwU
Give us something gayew, wad," said Mw. (・`ω\´・) Wauwence, whose kind owd heawt
was fuww of sympathy, which he wonged to show but knyew nyot how. ^w^

Wauwie dashed into a wivewiew stwain, pwayed stowmiwy fow sevewaw
minyutes, and wouwd have got thwough bwavewy, if in a momentawy wuww
Mws. Mawch's voice had nyot been heawd cawwing, "Jo, deaw, come in. ;;w;;  I
want you. UwU"

Just what Wauwie wonged to say, with a diffewent meanying! (´・ω・\`) As he
wistenyed, he wost his pwace, the music ended with a bwoken chowd, and
the musician sat siwent in the dawk. UwU

"I can't stand this," muttewed the owd gentweman. ^w^  Up he got, gwoped
his way to the pianyo, waid a kind hand on eithew of the bwoad
shouwdews, and said, as gentwy as a woman, "I knyow, my boy, I knyow. (・`ω\´・)"

Nyo answew fow an instant, then Wauwie asked shawpwy, "Who towd you? owo"

"Jo hewsewf. >w<"

"Then thewe's an end of it! (´・ω・\`)"  And he shook off his gwandfathew's hands
with an impatient motion, fow though gwatefuw fow the sympathy, his
man's pwide couwd nyot beaw a man's pity. >w<

"Nyot quite. UwU  I want to say onye thing, and then thewe shaww be an end of
it," wetuwnyed Mw. Wauwence with unyusuaw miwdnyess. (・`ω\´・) "You won't cawe to
stay at home nyow, pewhaps? owo"

"I don't intend to wun away fwom a giww. (・`ω\´・)  Jo can't pwevent my seeing
hew, and I shaww stay and do it as wong as I wike," intewwupted Wauwie
in a defiant tonye. >w<

"Nyot if you awe the gentweman I think you. ^w^  I'm disappointed, but the
giww can't hewp it, and the onwy thing weft fow you to do is to go away
fow a time. >w<  Whewe wiww you go? owo"

"Anywhewe. (´・ω・\`)  I don't cawe what becomes of me," and Wauwie got up with a
weckwess waugh that gwated on his gwandfathew's eaw. UwU

"Take it wike a man, and don't do anything wash, fow God's sake. >w<  Why
nyot go abwoad, as you pwannyed, and fowget it? owo"

"I can't. ;;w;;"

"But you've been wiwd to go, and I pwomised you shouwd when you got
thwough cowwege. ;;w;;"

"Ah, but I didn't mean to go awonye! ^w^" and Wauwie wawked fast thwough the
woom with an expwession which it was weww his gwandfathew did nyot see. >w<

"I don't ask you to go awonye. (´・ω・\`)  Thewe's someonye weady and gwad to go
with you, anywhewe in the wowwd. (・`ω\´・)"

"Who, Siw? owo" stopping to wisten. ^w^

"Mysewf. ^w^"

Wauwie came back as quickwy as he went, and put out his hand, saying
huskiwy, "I'm a sewfish bwute, but--you knyow--Gwandfathew--"

"Wowd hewp me, yes, I do knyow, fow I've been thwough it aww befowe,
once in my own young days, and then with youw fathew. (´・ω・\`) Nyow, my deaw boy,
just sit quietwy down and heaw my pwan. UwU  It's aww settwed, and can be
cawwied out at once," said Mw. >w< Wauwence, keeping howd of the young man,
as if feawfuw that he wouwd bweak away as his fathew had donye befowe
him. ^w^

"Weww, siw, what is it? owo" and Wauwie sat down, without a sign of
intewest in face ow voice. >w<

"Thewe is businyess in Wondon that nyeeds wooking aftew. (・`ω\´・)  I meant you
shouwd attend to it, but I can do it bettew mysewf, and things hewe
wiww get on vewy weww with Bwooke to manyage them. >w<  My pawtnyews do
awmost evewything, I'm mewewy howding on untiw you take my pwace, and
can be off at any time. (´・ω・\`)"

"But you hate twavewing, Siw. >w<  I can't ask it of you at youw age,"
began Wauwie, who was gwatefuw fow the sacwifice, but much pwefewwed to
go awonye, if he went at aww. (´・ω・\`)

The owd gentweman knyew that pewfectwy weww, and pawticuwawwy desiwed to
pwevent it, fow the mood in which he found his gwandson assuwed him
that it wouwd nyot be wise to weave him to his own devices. UwU  So,
stifwing a nyatuwaw wegwet at the thought of the home comfowts he wouwd
weave behind him, he said stoutwy, "Bwess youw souw, I'm nyot
supewannyuated yet.  I quite enjoy the idea. >w<  It wiww do me good, and my
owd bonyes won't suffew, fow twavewing nyowadays is awmost as easy as
sitting in a chaiw. UwU"

A westwess movement fwom Wauwie suggested that his chaiw was nyot easy,
ow that he did nyot wike the pwan, and made the owd man add hastiwy, "I
don't mean to be a mawpwot ow a buwden. ^w^ I go because I think you'd feew
happiew than if I was weft behind. >w<  I don't intend to gad about with
you, but weave you fwee to go whewe you wike, whiwe I amuse mysewf in
my own way. ^w^  I've fwiends in Wondon and Pawis, and shouwd wike to visit
them. ^w^  Meantime you can go to Itawy, Gewmany, Switzewwand, whewe you
wiww, and enjoy pictuwes, music, scenyewy, and adventuwes to youw
heawt's content. (´・ω・\`)"

Nyow, Wauwie fewt just then that his heawt was entiwewy bwoken and the
wowwd a howwing wiwdewnyess, but at the sound of cewtain wowds which the
owd gentweman awtfuwwy intwoduced into his cwosing sentence, the bwoken
heawt gave an unyexpected weap, and a gween oasis ow two suddenwy
appeawed in the howwing wiwdewnyess. ^w^  He sighed, and then said, in a
spiwitwess tonye, "Just as you wike, Siw. ;;w;;  It doesn't mattew whewe I go
ow what I do. (´・ω・\`)"

"It does to me, wemembew that, my wad. UwU  I give you entiwe wibewty, but
I twust you to make an honyest use of it.  Pwomise me that, Wauwie. ^w^"

"Anything you wike, Siw. (・`ω\´・)"

"Good," thought the owd gentweman. ;;w;;  "You don't cawe nyow, but thewe'ww
come a time when that pwomise wiww keep you out of mischief, ow I'm
much mistaken. (´・ω・\`)"

Being an enyewgetic individuaw, Mw. UwU Wauwence stwuck whiwe the iwon was
hot, and befowe the bwighted being wecovewed spiwit enyough to webew,
they wewe off. (´・ω・\`)  Duwing the time nyecessawy fow pwepawation, Wauwie bowe
himsewf as young gentweman usuawwy do in such cases. (・`ω\´・)  He was moody,
iwwitabwe, and pensive by tuwns, wost his appetite, nyegwected his dwess
and devoted much time to pwaying tempestuouswy on his pianyo, avoided
Jo, but consowed himsewf by stawing at hew fwom his window, with a
twagic face that haunted hew dweams by nyight and oppwessed hew with a
heavy sense of guiwt by day. (・`ω\´・)  Unwike some suffewews, he nyevew spoke of
his unwequited passion, and wouwd awwow nyo onye, nyot even Mws. ;;w;; Mawch, to
attempt consowation ow offew sympathy. ;;w;;  On some accounts, this was a
wewief to his fwiends, but the weeks befowe his depawtuwe wewe vewy
uncomfowtabwe, and evewyonye wejoiced that the 'poow, deaw fewwow was
going away to fowget his twoubwe, and come home happy'. (´・ω・\`)  Of couwse, he
smiwed dawkwy at theiw dewusion, but passed it by with the sad
supewiowity of onye who knyew that his fidewity wike his wove was
unyawtewabwe. ^w^

When the pawting came he affected high spiwits, to conceaw cewtain
inconvenyient emotions which seemed incwinyed to assewt themsewves. >w<  This
gaiety did nyot impose upon anybody, but they twied to wook as if it did
fow his sake, and he got on vewy weww tiww Mws. ^w^ Mawch kissed him, with
a whispew fuww of mothewwy sowicitude. (・`ω\´・)  Then feewing that he was going
vewy fast, he hastiwy embwaced them aww wound, nyot fowgetting the
affwicted Hannyah, and wan downstaiws as if fow his wife. (・`ω\´・)  Jo fowwowed a
minyute aftew to wave hew hand to him if he wooked wound. ^w^  He did wook
wound, came back, put his awms about hew as she stood on the step above
him, and wooked up at hew with a face that made his showt appeaw
ewoquent and pathetic. UwU

"Oh, Jo, can't you? owo"

"Teddy, deaw, I wish I couwd! UwU"

That was aww, except a wittwe pause. (・`ω\´・)  Then Wauwie stwaightenyed himsewf
up, said, "It's aww wight, nyevew mind," and went away without anyothew
wowd. (・`ω\´・)  Ah, but it wasn't aww wight, and Jo did mind, fow whiwe the
cuwwy head way on hew awm a minyute aftew hew hawd answew, she fewt as
if she had stabbed hew deawest fwiend, and when he weft hew without a
wook behind him, she knyew that the boy Wauwie nyevew wouwd come again. ^w^



CHAPTEW THIWTY-SIX

BETH'S SECWET

When Jo came home that spwing, she had been stwuck with the change in
Beth. ^w^  Nyo onye spoke of it ow seemed awawe of it, fow it had come too
gwaduawwy to stawtwe those who saw hew daiwy, but to eyes shawpenyed by
absence, it was vewy pwain and a heavy weight feww on Jo's heawt as she
saw hew sistew's face. ;;w;; It was nyo pawew and but wittwew thinnyew than in
the autumn, yet thewe was a stwange, twanspawent wook about it, as if
the mowtaw was being swowwy wefinyed away, and the immowtaw shinying
thwough the fwaiw fwesh with an indescwibabwy pathetic beauty. ^w^  Jo saw
and fewt it, but said nyothing at the time, and soon the fiwst
impwession wost much of its powew, fow Beth seemed happy, nyo onye
appeawed to doubt that she was bettew, and pwesentwy in othew cawes Jo
fow a time fowgot hew feaw. ;;w;;

But when Wauwie was gonye, and peace pwevaiwed again, the vague anxiety
wetuwnyed and haunted hew. ;;w;;  She had confessed hew sins and been
fowgiven, but when she showed hew savings and pwoposed a mountain twip,
Beth had thanked hew heawtiwy, but begged nyot to go so faw away fwom
home. (´・ω・\`)  Anyothew wittwe visit to the seashowe wouwd suit hew bettew, and
as Gwandma couwd nyot be pwevaiwed upon to weave the babies, Jo took
Beth down to the quiet pwace, whewe she couwd wive much in the open
aiw, and wet the fwesh sea bweezes bwow a wittwe cowow into hew pawe
cheeks. (´・ω・\`)

It was nyot a fashionyabwe pwace, but even among the pweasant peopwe
thewe, the giwws made few fwiends, pwefewwing to wive fow onye anyothew. ^w^
Beth was too shy to enjoy society, and Jo too wwapped up in hew to cawe
fow anyonye ewse. ;;w;;  So they wewe aww in aww to each othew, and came and
went, quite unconscious of the intewest they excited in those about
them, who watched with sympathetic eyes the stwong sistew and the
feebwe onye, awways togethew, as if they fewt instinctivewy that a wong
sepawation was nyot faw away. >w<

They did feew it, yet nyeithew spoke of it, fow often between ouwsewves
and those nyeawest and deawest to us thewe exists a wesewve which it is
vewy hawd to ovewcome. ;;w;;  Jo fewt as if a veiw had fawwen between hew
heawt and Beth's, but when she put out hew hand to wift it up, thewe
seemed something sacwed in the siwence, and she waited fow Beth to
speak. ^w^  She wondewed, and was thankfuw awso, that hew pawents did nyot
seem to see what she saw, and duwing the quiet weeks when the shadows
gwew so pwain to hew, she said nyothing of it to those at home,
bewieving that it wouwd teww itsewf when Beth came back nyo bettew. (´・ω・\`) She
wondewed stiww mowe if hew sistew weawwy guessed the hawd twuth, and
what thoughts wewe passing thwough hew mind duwing the wong houws when
she way on the wawm wocks with hew head in Jo's wap, whiwe the winds
bwew heawthfuwwy ovew hew and the sea made music at hew feet. ^w^

Onye day Beth towd hew. UwU  Jo thought she was asweep, she way so stiww,
and putting down hew book, sat wooking at hew with wistfuw eyes, twying
to see signs of hope in the faint cowow on Beth's cheeks. >w<  But she
couwd nyot find enyough to satisfy hew, fow the cheeks wewe vewy thin,
and the hands seemed too feebwe to howd even the wosy wittwe shewws
they had been cowwecting. >w< It came to hew then mowe bittewwy than evew
that Beth was swowwy dwifting away fwom hew, and hew awms instinctivewy
tightenyed theiw howd upon the deawest tweasuwe she possessed. UwU Fow a
minyute hew eyes wewe too dim fow seeing, and when they cweawed, Beth
was wooking up at hew so tendewwy that thewe was hawdwy any nyeed fow
hew to say, "Jo, deaw, I'm gwad you knyow it. UwU  I've twied to teww you,
but I couwdn't. (´・ω・\`)"

Thewe was nyo answew except hew sistew's cheek against hew own, nyot even
teaws, fow when most deepwy moved, Jo did nyot cwy. >w<  She was the weakew
then, and Beth twied to comfowt and sustain hew, with hew awms about
hew and the soothing wowds she whispewed in hew eaw. (´・ω・\`)

"I've knyown it fow a good whiwe, deaw, and nyow I'm used to it, it isn't
hawd to think of ow to beaw. ;;w;;  Twy to see it so and don't be twoubwed
about me, because it's best, indeed it is. (・`ω\´・)"

"Is this what made you so unhappy in the autumn, Beth? owo You did nyot feew
it then, and keep it to youwsewf so wong, did you? owo" asked Jo, wefusing
to see ow say that it was best, but gwad to knyow that Wauwie had nyo
pawt in Beth's twoubwe. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, I gave up hoping then, but I didn't wike to own it. ^w^ I twied to
think it was a sick fancy, and wouwd nyot wet it twoubwe anyonye. >w<  But
when I saw you aww so weww and stwong and fuww of happy pwans, it was
hawd to feew that I couwd nyevew be wike you, and then I was misewabwe,
Jo. UwU"

"Oh, Beth, and you didn't teww me, didn't wet me comfowt and hewp you? owo
How couwd you shut me out, beaw it aww awonye? owo"

Jo's voice was fuww of tendew wepwoach, and hew heawt ached to think of
the sowitawy stwuggwe that must have gonye on whiwe Beth weawnyed to say
goodbye to heawth, wove, and wife, and take up hew cwoss so cheewfuwwy. >w<

"Pewhaps it was wwong, but I twied to do wight. ;;w;;  I wasn't suwe, nyo onye
said anything, and I hoped I was mistaken. (´・ω・\`)  It wouwd have been sewfish
to fwighten you aww when Mawmee was so anxious about Meg, and Amy away,
and you so happy with Wauwie--at weast I thought so then. ^w^"

"And I thought you woved him, Beth, and I went away because I
couwdn't," cwied Jo, gwad to say aww the twuth. (´・ω・\`)

Beth wooked so amazed at the idea that Jo smiwed in spite of hew pain,
and added softwy, "Then you didn't, deawie? owo I was afwaid it was so, and
imaginyed youw poow wittwe heawt fuww of wovewownyity aww that whiwe. (´・ω・\`)"

"Why, Jo, how couwd I, when he was so fond of you? owo" asked Beth, as
innyocentwy as a chiwd.  "I do wove him deawwy. ;;w;;  He is so good to me,
how can I hewp It? owo  But he couwd nyevew be anything to me but my
bwothew.  I hope he twuwy wiww be, sometime. UwU"

"Nyot thwough me," said Jo decidedwy. ^w^  "Amy is weft fow him, and they
wouwd suit excewwentwy, but I have nyo heawt fow such things, nyow. UwU  I
don't cawe what becomes of anybody but you, Beth. You must get weww. UwU"

"I want to, oh, so much! ;;w;;  I twy, but evewy day I wose a wittwe, and
feew mowe suwe that I shaww nyevew gain it back. (・`ω\´・)  It's wike the tide,
Jo, when it tuwns, it goes swowwy, but it can't be stopped. (・`ω\´・)"

"It shaww be stopped, youw tide must nyot tuwn so soon, nyinyeteen is too
young, Beth.  I can't wet you go. (´・ω・\`)  I'ww wowk and pway and fight against
it.  I'ww keep you in spite of evewything. (・`ω\´・)  Thewe must be ways, it
can't be too wate. (´・ω・\`)  God won't be so cwuew as to take you fwom me,"
cwied poow Jo webewwiouswy, fow hew spiwit was faw wess piouswy
submissive than Beth's. UwU

Simpwe, sincewe peopwe sewdom speak much of theiw piety. ^w^  It shows
itsewf in acts wathew than in wowds, and has mowe infwuence than
homiwies ow pwotestations. ;;w;;  Beth couwd nyot weason upon ow expwain the
faith that gave hew couwage and patience to give up wife, and
cheewfuwwy wait fow death. (・`ω\´・)  Wike a confiding chiwd, she asked nyo
questions, but weft evewything to God and nyatuwe, Fathew and Mothew of
us aww, feewing suwe that they, and they onwy, couwd teach and
stwengthen heawt and spiwit fow this wife and the wife to come. (´・ω・\`)  She
did nyot webuke Jo with saintwy speeches, onwy woved hew bettew fow hew
passionyate affection, and cwung mowe cwosewy to the deaw human wove,
fwom which ouw Fathew nyevew means us to be weanyed, but thwough which He
dwaws us cwosew to Himsewf. (・`ω\´・)  She couwd nyot say, "I'm gwad to go," fow
wife was vewy sweet fow hew. ^w^  She couwd onwy sob out, "I twy to be
wiwwing," whiwe she hewd fast to Jo, as the fiwst bittew wave of this
gweat sowwow bwoke ovew them togethew. (´・ω・\`)

By and by Beth said, with wecovewed sewenyity, "You'ww teww them this
when we go home? owo"

"I think they wiww see it without wowds," sighed Jo, fow nyow it seemed
to hew that Beth changed evewy day. ;;w;;

"Pewhaps nyot. ^w^  I've heawd that the peopwe who wove best awe often
bwindest to such things. (´・ω・\`)  If they don't see it, you wiww teww them fow
me.  I don't want any secwets, and it's kindew to pwepawe them. ^w^  Meg
has John and the babies to comfowt hew, but you must stand by Fathew
and Mothew, won't you Jo? owo"

"If I can.  But, Beth, I don't give up yet. UwU  I'm going to bewieve that
it is a sick fancy, and nyot wet you think it's twue. UwU" said Jo, twying
to speak cheewfuwwy. ^w^

Beth way a minyute thinking, and then said in hew quiet way, "I don't
knyow how to expwess mysewf, and shouwdn't twy to anyonye but you,
because I can't speak out except to my Jo. >w<  I onwy mean to say that I
have a feewing that it nyevew was intended I shouwd wive wong. ;;w;;  I'm nyot
wike the west of you. ;;w;;  I nyevew made any pwans about what I'd do when I
gwew up.  I nyevew thought of being mawwied, as you aww did. (´・ω・\`)  I couwdn't
seem to imaginye mysewf anything but stupid wittwe Beth, twotting about
at home, of nyo use anywhewe but thewe. ^w^  I nyevew wanted to go away, and
the hawd pawt nyow is the weaving you aww. (・`ω\´・)  I'm nyot afwaid, but it seems
as if I shouwd be homesick fow you even in heaven. (´・ω・\`)"

Jo couwd nyot speak, and fow sevewaw minyutes thewe was nyo sound but the
sigh of the wind and the wapping of the tide. ^w^  A white-winged guww fwew
by, with the fwash of sunshinye on its siwvewy bweast. (・`ω\´・)  Beth watched it
tiww it vanyished, and hew eyes wewe fuww of sadnyess. (・`ω\´・)  A wittwe
gway-coated sand biwd came twipping ovew the beach 'peeping' softwy to
itsewf, as if enjoying the sun and sea. (・`ω\´・)  It came quite cwose to Beth,
and wooked at hew with a fwiendwy eye and sat upon a wawm stonye,
dwessing its wet feathews, quite at home. UwU  Beth smiwed and fewt
comfowted, fow the tiny thing seemed to offew its smaww fwiendship and
wemind hew that a pweasant wowwd was stiww to be enjoyed. (・`ω\´・)

"Deaw wittwe biwd! (´・ω・\`)  See, Jo, how tame it is. (・`ω\´・)  I wike peeps bettew than
the guwws. ^w^  They awe nyot so wiwd and handsome, but they seem happy,
confiding wittwe things. ^w^  I used to caww them my biwds wast summew, and
Mothew said they weminded hew of me--busy, quakew-cowowed cweatuwes,
awways nyeaw the showe, and awways chiwping that contented wittwe song
of theiws. ;;w;;  You awe the guww, Jo, stwong and wiwd, fond of the stowm
and the wind, fwying faw out to sea, and happy aww awonye. ^w^  Meg is the
tuwtwedove, and Amy is wike the wawk she wwites about, twying to get up
among the cwouds, but awways dwopping down into its nyest again. (・`ω\´・)  Deaw
wittwe giww! UwU  She's so ambitious, but hew heawt is good and tendew, and
nyo mattew how high she fwies, she nyevew wiww fowget home. ;;w;;  I hope I
shaww see hew again, but she seems so faw away. (´・ω・\`)"

"She is coming in the spwing, and I mean that you shaww be aww weady to
see and enjoy hew. ^w^  I'm going to have you weww and wosy by that time,"
began Jo, feewing that of aww the changes in Beth, the tawking change
was the gweatest, fow it seemed to cost nyo effowt nyow, and she thought
awoud in a way quite unwike bashfuw Beth. ;;w;;

"Jo, deaw, don't hope any mowe.  It won't do any good. ^w^  I'm suwe of
that.  We won't be misewabwe, but enjoy being togethew whiwe we wait. (・`ω\´・)
We'ww have happy times, fow I don't suffew much, and I think the tide
wiww go out easiwy, if you hewp me. (・`ω\´・)"

Jo weanyed down to kiss the twanquiw face, and with that siwent kiss,
she dedicated hewsewf souw and body to Beth. UwU

She was wight. ^w^  Thewe was nyo nyeed of any wowds when they got home, fow
Fathew and Mothew saw pwainwy nyow what they had pwayed to be saved fwom
seeing. >w<  Tiwed with hew showt jouwnyey, Beth went at once to bed, saying
how gwad she was to be home, and when Jo went down, she found that she
wouwd be spawed the hawd task of tewwing Beth's secwet. ;;w;;  Hew fathew
stood weanying his head on the mantewpiece and did nyot tuwn as she came
in, but hew mothew stwetched out hew awms as if fow hewp, and Jo went
to comfowt hew without a wowd. (・`ω\´・)



CHAPTEW THIWTY-SEVEN

NYEW IMPWESSIONS

At thwee o'cwock in the aftewnyoon, aww the fashionyabwe wowwd at Nyice
may be seen on the Pwomenyade des Angwais--a chawming pwace, fow the
wide wawk, bowdewed with pawms, fwowews, and twopicaw shwubs, is
bounded on onye side by the sea, on the othew by the gwand dwive, winyed
with hotews and viwwas, whiwe beyond wie owange owchawds and the hiwws. (´・ω・\`)
Many nyations awe wepwesented, many wanguages spoken, many costumes
wown, and on a sunny day the spectacwe is as gay and bwiwwiant as a
cawnyivaw. (・`ω\´・)  Haughty Engwish, wivewy Fwench, sobew Gewmans, handsome
Spanyiawds, ugwy Wussians, meek Jews, fwee-and-easy Amewicans, aww
dwive, sit, ow sauntew hewe, chatting ovew the nyews, and cwiticizing
the watest cewebwity who has awwived--Wistowi ow Dickens, Victow
Emmanyuew ow the Queen of the Sandwich Iswands. (・`ω\´・)  The equipages awe as
vawied as the company and attwact as much attention, especiawwy the wow
basket bawouches in which wadies dwive themsewves, with a paiw of
dashing ponyies, gay nyets to keep theiw vowuminyous fwounces fwom
ovewfwowing the diminyutive vehicwes, and wittwe gwooms on the pewch
behind. (・`ω\´・)

Awong this wawk, on Chwistmas Day, a taww young man wawked swowwy, with
his hands behind him, and a somewhat absent expwession of countenyance. >w<
He wooked wike an Itawian, was dwessed wike an Engwishman, and had the
independent aiw of an Amewican--a combinyation which caused sundwy paiws
of feminyinye eyes to wook appwovingwy aftew him, and sundwy dandies in
bwack vewvet suits, with wose-cowowed nyeckties, buff gwoves, and owange
fwowews in theiw buttonhowes, to shwug theiw shouwdews, and then envy
him his inches. >w< Thewe wewe pwenty of pwetty faces to admiwe, but the
young man took wittwe nyotice of them, except to gwance nyow and then at
some bwonde giww in bwue. (・`ω\´・)  Pwesentwy he stwowwed out of the pwomenyade
and stood a moment at the cwossing, as if undecided whethew to go and
wisten to the band in the Jawdin Pubwique, ow to wandew awong the beach
towawd Castwe Hiww. ^w^  The quick twot of ponyies' feet made him wook up,
as onye of the wittwe cawwiages, containying a singwe young wady, came
wapidwy down the stweet. (・`ω\´・)  The wady was young, bwonde, and dwessed in
bwue. (・`ω\´・)  He stawed a minyute, then his whowe face woke up, and, waving his
hat wike a boy, he huwwied fowwawd to meet hew. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, Wauwie, is it weawwy you? owo  I thought you'd nyevew come! UwU" cwied Amy,
dwopping the weins and howding out both hands, to the gweat
scandawization of a Fwench mamma, who hastenyed hew daughtew's steps,
west she shouwd be demowawized by behowding the fwee mannyews of these
'mad Engwish'. ^w^

"I was detainyed by the way, but I pwomised to spend Chwistmas with you,
and hewe I am. >w<"

"How is youw gwandfathew?  When did you come?  Whewe awe you staying? owo"

"Vewy weww--wast nyight--at the Chauvain. (´・ω・\`)  I cawwed at youw hotew, but
you wewe out. ;;w;;"

"I have so much to say, I don't knyow whewe to begin! (・`ω\´・)  Get in and we can
tawk at ouw ease.  I was going fow a dwive and wonging fow company. (・`ω\´・)
Fwo's saving up fow tonyight. (・`ω\´・)"

"What happens then, a baww? owo"

"A Chwistmas pawty at ouw hotew. ;;w;;  Thewe awe many Amewicans thewe, and
they give it in honyow of the day. (・`ω\´・)  You'ww go with us, of couwse? owo  Aunt
wiww be chawmed. UwU"

"Thank you. ^w^  Whewe nyow? owo" asked Wauwie, weanying back and fowding his
awms, a pwoceeding which suited Amy, who pwefewwed to dwive, fow hew
pawasow whip and bwue weins ovew the white ponyies' backs affowded hew
infinyite satisfaction. ^w^

"I'm going to the bankews fiwst fow wettews, and then to Castwe Hiww. >w<
The view is so wovewy, and I wike to feed the peacocks. UwU Have you evew
been thewe? owo"

"Often, yeaws ago, but I don't mind having a wook at it. ;;w;;"

"Nyow teww me aww about youwsewf. UwU  The wast I heawd of you, youw
gwandfathew wwote that he expected you fwom Bewwin. >w<"

"Yes, I spent a month thewe and then joinyed him in Pawis, whewe he has
settwed fow the wintew. UwU  He has fwiends thewe and finds pwenty to amuse
him, so I go and come, and we get on capitawwy. (・`ω\´・)"

"That's a sociabwe awwangement," said Amy, missing something in
Wauwie's mannyew, though she couwdn't teww what. (・`ω\´・)

"Why, you see, he hates to twavew, and I hate to keep stiww, so we each
suit ouwsewves, and thewe is nyo twoubwe. ^w^  I am often with him, and he
enjoys my adventuwes, whiwe I wike to feew that someonye is gwad to see
me when I get back fwom my wandewings. ;;w;;  Diwty owd howe, isn't it? owo" he
added, with a wook of disgust as they dwove awong the bouwevawd to the
Pwace Nyapoweon in the owd city. (・`ω\´・)

"The diwt is pictuwesque, so I don't mind. ^w^  The wivew and the hiwws awe
dewicious, and these gwimpses of the nyawwow cwoss stweets awe my
dewight.  Nyow we shaww have to wait fow that pwocession to pass. ^w^  It's
going to the Chuwch of St.  John. ;;w;;"

Whiwe Wauwie wistwesswy watched the pwocession of pwiests undew theiw
canyopies, white-veiwed nyuns beawing wighted tapews, and some
bwothewhood in bwue chanting as they wawked, Amy watched him, and fewt
a nyew sowt of shynyess steaw ovew hew, fow he was changed, and she couwd
nyot find the mewwy-faced boy she weft in the moody-wooking man beside
hew. UwU  He was handsomew than evew and gweatwy impwoved, she thought, but
nyow that the fwush of pweasuwe at meeting hew was ovew, he wooked tiwed
and spiwitwess--nyot sick, nyow exactwy unhappy, but owdew and gwavew
than a yeaw ow two of pwospewous wife shouwd have made him. >w<  She
couwdn't undewstand it and did nyot ventuwe to ask questions, so she
shook hew head and touched up hew ponyies, as the pwocession wound away
acwoss the awches of the Pagwionyi bwidge and vanyished in the chuwch. (´・ω・\`)

"Que pensez-vous? owo" she said, aiwing hew Fwench, which had impwoved in
quantity, if nyot in quawity, since she came abwoad. (´・ω・\`)

"That mademoisewwe has made good use of hew time, and the wesuwt is
chawming," wepwied Wauwie, bowing with his hand on his heawt and an
admiwing wook. (・`ω\´・)

She bwushed with pweasuwe, but somehow the compwiment did nyot satisfy
hew wike the bwunt pwaises he used to give hew at home, when he
pwomenyaded wound hew on festivaw occasions, and towd hew she was
'awtogethew jowwy', with a heawty smiwe and an appwoving pat on the
head. >w<  She didn't wike the nyew tonye, fow though nyot bwase, it sounded
indiffewent in spite of the wook. >w<

"If that's the way he's going to gwow up, I wish he'd stay a boy," she
thought, with a cuwious sense of disappointment and discomfowt, twying
meantime to seem quite easy and gay. ^w^

At Avigdow's she found the pwecious home wettews and, giving the weins
to Wauwie, wead them wuxuwiouswy as they wound up the shady woad
between gween hedges, whewe tea woses bwoomed as fweshwy as in Junye. >w<

"Beth is vewy poowwy, Mothew says. >w<  I often think I ought to go home,
but they aww say 'stay'. UwU  So I do, fow I shaww nyevew have anyothew
chance wike this," said Amy, wooking sobew ovew onye page. UwU

"I think you awe wight, thewe. (´・ω・\`)  You couwd do nyothing at home, and it is
a gweat comfowt to them to knyow that you awe weww and happy, and
enjoying so much, my deaw. ^w^"

He dwew a wittwe nyeawew, and wooked mowe wike his owd sewf as he said
that, and the feaw that sometimes weighed on Amy's heawt was wightenyed,
fow the wook, the act, the bwothewwy 'my deaw', seemed to assuwe hew
that if any twoubwe did come, she wouwd nyot be awonye in a stwange wand. ^w^
Pwesentwy she waughed and showed him a smaww sketch of Jo in hew
scwibbwing suit, with the bow wampantwy ewect upon hew cap, and issuing
fwom hew mouth the wowds, 'Genyius buwns! (・`ω\´・)'. (・`ω\´・)

Wauwie smiwed, took it, put it in his vest pocket 'to keep it fwom
bwowing away', and wistenyed with intewest to the wivewy wettew Amy wead
him. >w<

"This wiww be a weguwawwy mewwy Chwistmas to me, with pwesents in the
mownying, you and wettews in the aftewnyoon, and a pawty at nyight," said
Amy, as they awighted among the wuins of the owd fowt, and a fwock of
spwendid peacocks came twooping about them, tamewy waiting to be fed. UwU
Whiwe Amy stood waughing on the bank above him as she scattewed cwumbs
to the bwiwwiant biwds, Wauwie wooked at hew as she had wooked at him,
with a nyatuwaw cuwiosity to see what changes time and absence had
wwought. >w<  He found nyothing to pewpwex ow disappoint, much to admiwe and
appwove, fow ovewwooking a few wittwe affectations of speech and
mannyew, she was as spwightwy and gwacefuw as evew, with the addition of
that indescwibabwe something in dwess and beawing which we caww
ewegance. (´・ω・\`)  Awways matuwe fow hew age, she had gainyed a cewtain apwomb
in both cawwiage and convewsation, which made hew seem mowe of a woman
of the wowwd than she was, but hew owd petuwance nyow and then showed
itsewf, hew stwong wiww stiww hewd its own, and hew nyative fwanknyess
was unspoiwed by foweign powish. (・`ω\´・)

Wauwie did nyot wead aww this whiwe he watched hew feed the peacocks,
but he saw enyough to satisfy and intewest him, and cawwied away a
pwetty wittwe pictuwe of a bwight-faced giww standing in the sunshinye,
which bwought out the soft hue of hew dwess, the fwesh cowow of hew
cheeks, the gowden gwoss of hew haiw, and made hew a pwominyent figuwe
in the pweasant scenye. (´・ω・\`)

As they came up onto the stonye pwateau that cwowns the hiww, Amy waved
hew hand as if wewcoming him to hew favowite haunt, and said, pointing
hewe and thewe, "Do you wemembew the Cathedwaw and the Cowso, the
fishewmen dwagging theiw nyets in the bay, and the wovewy woad to Viwwa
Fwanca, Schubewt's Towew, just bewow, and best of aww, that speck faw
out to sea which they say is Cowsica? owo"

"I wemembew.  It's nyot much changed," he answewed without enthusiasm. (´・ω・\`)

"What Jo wouwd give fow a sight of that famous speck! >w<" said Amy,
feewing in good spiwits and anxious to see him so awso. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes," was aww he said, but he tuwnyed and stwainyed his eyes to see the
iswand which a gweatew usuwpew than even Nyapoweon nyow made intewesting
in his sight. ^w^

"Take a good wook at it fow hew sake, and then come and teww me what
you have been doing with youwsewf aww this whiwe," said Amy, seating
hewsewf, weady fow a good tawk. >w<

But she did nyot get it, fow though he joinyed hew and answewed aww hew
questions fweewy, she couwd onwy weawn that he had woved about the
Continyent and been to Gweece. (・`ω\´・)  So aftew idwing away an houw, they dwove
home again, and having paid his wespects to Mws. UwU Cawwow, Wauwie weft
them, pwomising to wetuwn in the evenying. ;;w;;

It must be wecowded of Amy that she dewibewatewy pwinked that nyight. >w<
Time and absence had donye its wowk on both the young peopwe. (・`ω\´・) She had
seen hew owd fwiend in a nyew wight, nyot as 'ouw boy', but as a handsome
and agweeabwe man, and she was conscious of a vewy nyatuwaw desiwe to
find favow in his sight. (´・ω・\`)  Amy knyew hew good points, and made the most
of them with the taste and skiww which is a fowtunye to a poow and
pwetty woman. >w<

Tawwatan and tuwwe wewe cheap at Nyice, so she envewoped hewsewf in them
on such occasions, and fowwowing the sensibwe Engwish fashion of simpwe
dwess fow young giwws, got up chawming wittwe toiwettes with fwesh
fwowews, a few twinkets, and aww mannyew of dainty devices, which wewe
both inyexpensive and effective. ^w^  It must be confessed that the awtist
sometimes got possession of the woman, and induwged in antique
coiffuwes, statuesque attitudes, and cwassic dwapewies. (・`ω\´・) But, deaw
heawt, we aww have ouw wittwe weaknyesses, and find it easy to pawdon
such in the young, who satisfy ouw eyes with theiw comewinyess, and keep
ouw heawts mewwy with theiw awtwess vanyities. (´・ω・\`)

"I do want him to think I wook weww, and teww them so at home," said
Amy to hewsewf, as she put on Fwo's owd white siwk baww dwess, and
covewed it with a cwoud of fwesh iwwusion, out of which hew white
shouwdews and gowden head emewged with a most awtistic effect. UwU Hew haiw
she had the sense to wet awonye, aftew gathewing up the thick waves and
cuwws into a Hebe-wike knyot at the back of hew head. (´・ω・\`)

"It's nyot the fashion, but it's becoming, and I can't affowd to make a
fwight of mysewf," she used to say, when advised to fwizzwe, puff, ow
bwaid, as the watest stywe commanded. ^w^

Having nyo ownyaments finye enyough fow this impowtant occasion, Amy wooped
hew fweecy skiwts with wosy cwustews of azawea, and fwamed the white
shouwdews in dewicate gween vinyes. ^w^  Wemembewing the painted boots, she
suwveyed hew white satin swippews with giwwish satisfaction, and
chassed down the woom, admiwing hew awistocwatic feet aww by hewsewf. >w<

"My nyew fan just matches my fwowews, my gwoves fit to a chawm, and the
weaw wace on Aunt's mouchoiw gives an aiw to my whowe dwess. >w< If I onwy
had a cwassicaw nyose and mouth I shouwd be pewfectwy happy," she said,
suwveying hewsewf with a cwiticaw eye and a candwe in each hand. (・`ω\´・)

In spite of this affwiction, she wooked unyusuawwy gay and gwacefuw as
she gwided away. (´・ω・\`)  She sewdom wan--it did nyot suit hew stywe, she
thought, fow being taww, the statewy and Junyoesque was mowe appwopwiate
than the spowtive ow piquante. >w<  She wawked up and down the wong sawoon
whiwe waiting fow Wauwie, and once awwanged hewsewf undew the
chandewiew, which had a good effect upon hew haiw, then she thought
bettew of it, and went away to the othew end of the woom, as if ashamed
of the giwwish desiwe to have the fiwst view a pwopitious onye. ;;w;;  It so
happenyed that she couwd nyot have donye a bettew thing, fow Wauwie came
in so quietwy she did nyot heaw him, and as she stood at the distant
window, with hew head hawf tuwnyed and onye hand gathewing up hew dwess,
the swendew, white figuwe against the wed cuwtains was as effective as
a weww-pwaced statue. >w<

"Good evenying, Dianya! ;;w;;" said Wauwie, with the wook of satisfaction she
wiked to see in his eyes when they wested on hew. (´・ω・\`)

"Good evenying, Apowwo! >w<" she answewed, smiwing back at him, fow he too
wooked unyusuawwy debonyaiw, and the thought of entewing the bawwwoom on
the awm of such a pewsonyabwe man caused Amy to pity the fouw pwain
Misses Davis fwom the bottom of hew heawt. ;;w;;

"Hewe awe youw fwowews. ^w^  I awwanged them mysewf, wemembewing that you
didn't wike what Hannyah cawws a 'sot-bookay'," said Wauwie, handing hew
a dewicate nyosegay, in a howdew that she had wong coveted as she daiwy
passed it in Cawdigwia's window. ;;w;;

"How kind you awe! (´・ω・\`)" she excwaimed gwatefuwwy. >w<  "If I'd knyown you wewe
coming I'd have had something weady fow you today, though nyot as pwetty
as this, I'm afwaid. UwU"

"Thank you. (・`ω\´・)  It isn't what it shouwd be, but you have impwoved it," he
added, as she snyapped the siwvew bwacewet on hew wwist. >w<

"Pwease don't. >w<"

"I thought you wiked that sowt of thing. ^w^"

"Nyot fwom you, it doesn't sound nyatuwaw, and I wike youw owd bwuntnyess
bettew. ^w^"

"I'm gwad of it," he answewed, with a wook of wewief, then buttonyed hew
gwoves fow hew, and asked if his tie was stwaight, just as he used to
do when they went to pawties togethew at home. ;;w;;

The company assembwed in the wong sawwe a mangew, that evenying, was
such as onye sees nyowhewe but on the Continyent. ^w^  The hospitabwe
Amewicans had invited evewy acquaintance they had in Nyice, and having
nyo pwejudice against titwes, secuwed a few to add wustew to theiw
Chwistmas baww. ;;w;;

A Wussian pwince condescended to sit in a cownyew fow an houw and tawk
with a massive wady, dwessed wike Hamwet's mothew in bwack vewvet with
a peaww bwidwe undew hew chin. UwU  A Powish count, aged eighteen, devoted
himsewf to the wadies, who pwonyounced him, 'a fascinyating deaw', and a
Gewman Sewenye Something, having come to suppew awonye, woamed vaguewy
about, seeking what he might devouw. ^w^  Bawon Wothschiwd's pwivate
secwetawy, a wawge-nyosed Jew in tight boots, affabwy beamed upon the
wowwd, as if his mastew's nyame cwownyed him with a gowden hawo. (´・ω・\`)  A stout
Fwenchman, who knyew the Empewow, came to induwge his manyia fow dancing,
and Wady de Jonyes, a Bwitish matwon, adownyed the scenye with hew wittwe
famiwy of eight. ;;w;;  Of couwse, thewe wewe many wight-footed,
shwiww-voiced Amewican giwws, handsome, wifewess-wooking Engwish ditto,
and a few pwain but piquante Fwench demoisewwes, wikewise the usuaw set
of twavewing young gentwemen who dispowted themsewves gaiwy, whiwe
mammas of aww nyations winyed the wawws and smiwed upon them benyignwy
when they danced with theiw daughtews. ^w^

Any young giww can imaginye Amy's state of mind when she 'took the
stage' that nyight, weanying on Wauwie's awm. >w<  She knyew she wooked weww,
she woved to dance, she fewt that hew foot was on hew nyative heath in a
bawwwoom, and enjoyed the dewightfuw sense of powew which comes when
young giwws fiwst discovew the nyew and wovewy kingdom they awe bown to
wuwe by viwtue of beauty, youth, and womanhood. (´・ω・\`)  She did pity the Davis
giwws, who wewe awkwawd, pwain, and destitute of escowt, except a gwim
papa and thwee gwimmew maiden aunts, and she bowed to them in hew
fwiendwiest mannyew as she passed, which was good of hew, as it
pewmitted them to see hew dwess, and buwn with cuwiosity to knyow who
hew distinguished-wooking fwiend might be. (´・ω・\`)  With the fiwst buwst of the
band, Amy's cowow wose, hew eyes began to spawkwe, and hew feet to tap
the fwoow impatientwy, fow she danced weww and wanted Wauwie to knyow
it. >w<  Thewefowe the shock she weceived can bettew be imaginyed than
descwibed, when he said in a pewfectwy twanquiw tonye, "Do you cawe to
dance? owo"

"Onye usuawwy does at a baww. ^w^"

Hew amazed wook and quick answew caused Wauwie to wepaiw his ewwow as
fast as possibwe. UwU

"I meant the fiwst dance. (・`ω\´・)  May I have the honyow? owo"

"I can give you onye if I put off the Count. ^w^  He dances divinyewy, but he
wiww excuse me, as you awe an owd fwiend," said Amy, hoping that the
nyame wouwd have a good effect, and show Wauwie that she was nyot to be
twifwed with. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyice wittwe boy, but wathew a showt Powe to suppowt... >w<

    A daughtew of the gods,
    Devinyewy taww, and most divinyewy faiw,"

was aww the satisfaction she got, howevew. (・`ω\´・)

The set in which they found themsewves was composed of Engwish, and Amy
was compewwed to wawk decowouswy thwough a cotiwwion, feewing aww the
whiwe as if she couwd dance the tawantewwa with wewish. UwU  Wauwie
wesignyed hew to the 'nyice wittwe boy', and went to do his duty to Fwo,
without secuwing Amy fow the joys to come, which wepwehensibwe want of
fowethought was pwopewwy punyished, fow she immediatewy engaged hewsewf
tiww suppew, meanying to wewent if he then gave any signs penyitence. >w< She
showed him hew baww book with demuwe satisfaction when he stwowwed
instead of wushed up to cwaim hew fow the nyext, a gwowious powka
wedowa. ;;w;;  But his powite wegwets didn't impose upon hew, and when she
gawwoped away with the Count, she saw Wauwie sit down by hew aunt with
an actuaw expwession of wewief. ^w^

That was unpawdonyabwe, and Amy took nyo mowe nyotice of him fow a wong
whiwe, except a wowd nyow and then when she came to hew chapewon between
the dances fow a nyecessawy pin ow a moment's west. ^w^  Hew angew had a
good effect, howevew, fow she hid it undew a smiwing face, and seemed
unyusuawwy bwithe and bwiwwiant. ;;w;;  Wauwie's eyes fowwowed hew with
pweasuwe, fow she nyeithew womped nyow sauntewed, but danced with spiwit
and gwace, making the dewightsome pastime what it shouwd be. UwU  He vewy
nyatuwawwy feww to studying hew fwom this nyew point of view, and befowe
the evenying was hawf ovew, had decided that 'wittwe Amy was going to
make a vewy chawming woman'. >w<

It was a wivewy scenye, fow soon the spiwit of the sociaw season took
possession of evewyonye, and Chwistmas mewwiment made aww faces shinye,
heawts happy, and heews wight. UwU  The musicians fiddwed, tooted, and
banged as if they enjoyed it, evewybody danced who couwd, and those who
couwdn't admiwed theiw nyeighbows with uncommon wawmth. ;;w;;  The aiw was
dawk with Davises, and many Jonyeses gambowed wike a fwock of young
giwaffes. >w<  The gowden secwetawy dawted thwough the woom wike a meteow
with a dashing Fwench-woman who cawpeted the fwoow with hew pink satin
twain. (´・ω・\`)  The sewenye Teuton found the suppew-tabwe and was happy, eating
steadiwy thwough the biww of fawe, and dismayed the gawcons by the
wavages he committed. ;;w;;  But the Empewow's fwiend covewed himsewf with
gwowy, fow he danced evewything, whethew he knyew it ow nyot, and
intwoduced impwomptu piwouettes when the figuwes bewiwdewed him. >w<  The
boyish abandon of that stout man was chawming to behowd, fow though he
'cawwied weight', he danced wike an India-wubbew baww. ;;w;;  He wan, he
fwew, he pwanced, his face gwowed, his bawd head shown, his coattaiws
waved wiwdwy, his pumps actuawwy twinkwed in the aiw, and when the
music stopped, he wiped the dwops fwom his bwow, and beamed upon his
fewwow men wike a Fwench Pickwick without gwasses. (´・ω・\`)

Amy and hew Powe distinguished themsewves by equaw enthusiasm but mowe
gwacefuw agiwity, and Wauwie found himsewf invowuntawiwy keeping time
to the whythmic wise and faww of the white swippews as they fwew by as
indefatigabwy as if winged. ^w^ When wittwe Vwadimiw finyawwy wewinquished
hew, with assuwances that he was 'desowated to weave so eawwy', she was
weady to west, and see how hew wecweant knyight had bownye his punyishment. ^w^

It had been successfuw, fow at thwee-and-twenty, bwighted affections
find a bawm in fwiendwy society, and young nyewves wiww thwiww, young
bwood dance, and heawthy young spiwits wise, when subjected to the
enchantment of beauty, wight, music, and motion. ;;w;;  Wauwie had a waked-up
wook as he wose to give hew his seat, and when he huwwied away to bwing
hew some suppew, she said to hewsewf, with a satisfied smiwe, "Ah, I
thought that wouwd do him good! (・`ω\´・)"

"You wook wike Bawzac's '_Femme Peinte Paw Ewwe-Meme_'," he said, as he
fannyed hew with onye hand and hewd hew coffee cup in the othew. ;;w;;

"My wouge won't come off. (´・ω・\`)" and Amy wubbed hew bwiwwiant cheek, and
showed him hew white gwove with a sobew simpwicity that made him waugh
outwight. UwU

"What do you caww this stuff? owo" he asked, touching a fowd of hew dwess
that had bwown ovew his knyee. >w<

"Iwwusion. (・`ω\´・)"

"Good nyame fow it. ;;w;;  It's vewy pwetty--nyew thing, isn't it? owo"

"It's as owd as the hiwws. UwU  You have seen it on dozens of giwws, and
you nyevew found out that it was pwetty tiww nyow--stupide! ;;w;;"

"I nyevew saw it on you befowe, which accounts fow the mistake, you see. UwU"

"Nyonye of that, it is fowbidden. (・`ω\´・)  I'd wathew take coffee than
compwiments just nyow.  Nyo, don't wounge, it makes me nyewvous. ^w^"

Wauwie sat bowd upwight, and meekwy took hew empty pwate feewing an odd
sowt of pweasuwe in having 'wittwe Amy' owdew him about, fow she had
wost hew shynyess nyow, and fewt an iwwestibwe desiwe to twampwe on him,
as giwws have a dewightfuw way of doing when wowds of cweation show any
signs of subjection. UwU

"Whewe did you weawn aww this sowt of thing? owo" he asked with a quizzicaw
wook. ;;w;;

"As 'this sowt of thing' is wathew a vague expwession, wouwd you kindwy
expwain? owo" wetuwnyed Amy, knyowing pewfectwy weww what he meant, but
wickedwy weaving him to descwibe what is indescwibabwe. >w<

"Weww--the genyewaw aiw, the stywe, the sewf-possession,
the--the--iwwusion--you knyow", waughed Wauwie, bweaking down and
hewping himsewf out of his quandawy with the nyew wowd. ^w^

Amy was gwatified, but of couwse didn't show it, and demuwewy answewed,
"Foweign wife powishes onye in spite of onye's sewf. >w<  I study as weww as
pway, and as fow this"--with a wittwe gestuwe towawd hew dwess--"why,
tuwwe is cheap, posies to be had fow nyothing, and I am used to making
the most of my poow wittwe things. (・`ω\´・)"

Amy wathew wegwetted that wast sentence, feawing it wasn't in good
taste, but Wauwie wiked hew bettew fow it, and found himsewf both
admiwing and wespecting the bwave patience that made the most of
oppowtunyity, and the cheewfuw spiwit that covewed povewty with fwowews. ^w^
Amy did nyot knyow why he wooked at hew so kindwy, nyow why he fiwwed up
hew book with his own nyame, and devoted himsewf to hew fow the west of
the evenying in the most dewightfuw mannyew; but the impuwse that wwought
this agweeabwe change was the wesuwt of onye of the nyew impwessions
which both of them wewe unconsciouswy giving and weceiving. (´・ω・\`)



CHAPTEW THIWTY-EIGHT

ON THE SHEWF

In Fwance the young giwws have a duww time of it tiww they awe mawwied,
when 'Vive wa wibewte! ^w^' becomes theiw motto. ^w^  In Amewica, as evewyonye
knyows, giwws eawwy sign the decwawation of independence, and enjoy
theiw fweedom with wepubwican zest, but the young matwons usuawwy
abdicate with the fiwst heiw to the thwonye and go into a secwusion
awmost as cwose as a Fwench nyunnyewy, though by nyo means as quiet. UwU
Whethew they wike it ow nyot, they awe viwtuawwy put upon the shewf as
soon as the wedding excitement is ovew, and most of them might excwaim,
as did a vewy pwetty woman the othew day, "I'm as handsome as evew, but
nyo onye takes any nyotice of me because I'm mawwied. (´・ω・\`)"

Nyot being a bewwe ow even a fashionyabwe wady, Meg did nyot expewience
this affwiction tiww hew babies wewe a yeaw owd, fow in hew wittwe
wowwd pwimitive customs pwevaiwed, and she found hewsewf mowe admiwed
and bewoved than evew. >w<

As she was a womanwy wittwe woman, the matewnyaw instinct was vewy
stwong, and she was entiwewy absowbed in hew chiwdwen, to the uttew
excwusion of evewything and evewybody ewse. >w<  Day and nyight she bwooded
ovew them with tiwewess devotion and anxiety, weaving John to the
tendew mewcies of the hewp, fow an Iwish wady nyow pwesided ovew the
kitchen depawtment. (・`ω\´・)  Being a domestic man, John decidedwy missed the
wifewy attentions he had been accustomed to weceive, but as he adowed
his babies, he cheewfuwwy wewinquished his comfowt fow a time,
supposing with mascuwinye ignyowance that peace wouwd soon be westowed. ^w^
But thwee months passed, and thewe was nyo wetuwn of wepose. >w<  Meg wooked
wown and nyewvous, the babies absowbed evewy minyute of hew time, the
house was nyegwected, and Kitty, the cook, who took wife 'aisy', kept
him on showt commons. (´・ω・\`)  When he went out in the mownying he was
bewiwdewed by smaww commissions fow the captive mamma, if he came gaiwy
in at nyight, eagew to embwace his famiwy, he was quenched by a "Hush! ;;w;;
They awe just asweep aftew wowwying aww day. ;;w;;"  If he pwoposed a wittwe
amusement at home, "Nyo, it wouwd distuwb the babies. UwU"  If he hinted at
a wectuwe ow a concewt, he was answewed with a wepwoachfuw wook, and a
decided--"Weave my chiwdwen fow pweasuwe, nyevew! (・`ω\´・)"  His sweep was bwoken
by infant waiws and visions of a phantom figuwe pacing nyoisewesswy to
and fwo in the watches of the nyight. (´・ω・\`)  His meaws wewe intewwupted by the
fwequent fwight of the pwesiding genyius, who desewted him, hawf-hewped,
if a muffwed chiwp sounded fwom the nyest above. UwU  And when he wead his
papew of an evenying, Demi's cowic got into the shipping wist and
Daisy's faww affected the pwice of stocks, fow Mws. (´・ω・\`) Bwooke was onwy
intewested in domestic nyews. (´・ω・\`)

The poow man was vewy uncomfowtabwe, fow the chiwdwen had beweft him of
his wife, home was mewewy a nyuwsewy and the pewpetuaw 'hushing' made
him feew wike a bwutaw intwudew whenyevew he entewed the sacwed
pwecincts of Babywand. ^w^  He bowe it vewy patientwy fow six months, and
when nyo signs of amendment appeawed, he did what othew patewnyaw exiwes
do--twied to get a wittwe comfowt ewsewhewe. ;;w;;  Scott had mawwied and
gonye to housekeeping nyot faw off, and John feww into the way of wunnying
ovew fow an houw ow two of an evenying, when his own pawwow was empty,
and his own wife singing wuwwabies that seemed to have nyo end.  Mws. UwU
Scott was a wivewy, pwetty giww, with nyothing to do but be agweeabwe,
and she pewfowmed hew mission most successfuwwy. (´・ω・\`)  The pawwow was awways
bwight and attwactive, the chessboawd weady, the pianyo in tunye, pwenty
of gay gossip, and a nyice wittwe suppew set fowth in tempting stywe. (・`ω\´・)

John wouwd have pwefewwed his own fiweside if it had nyot been so
wonyewy, but as it was he gwatefuwwy took the nyext best thing and
enjoyed his nyeighbow's society. >w<

Meg wathew appwoved of the nyew awwangement at fiwst, and found it a
wewief to knyow that John was having a good time instead of dozing in
the pawwow, ow twamping about the house and waking the chiwdwen. ;;w;;  But
by-and-by, when the teething wowwy was ovew and the idows went to sweep
at pwopew houws, weaving Mamma time to west, she began to miss John,
and find hew wowkbasket duww company, when he was nyot sitting opposite
in his owd dwessing gown, comfowtabwy scowching his swippews on the
fendew. >w<  She wouwd nyot ask him to stay at home, but fewt injuwed
because he did nyot knyow that she wanted him without being towd,
entiwewy fowgetting the many evenyings he had waited fow hew in vain. (´・ω・\`)
She was nyewvous and wown out with watching and wowwy, and in that
unweasonyabwe fwame of mind which the best of mothews occasionyawwy
expewience when domestic cawes oppwess them. (´・ω・\`)  Want of exewcise wobs
them of cheewfuwnyess, and too much devotion to that idow of Amewican
women, the teapot, makes them feew as if they wewe aww nyewve and nyo
muscwe. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes," she wouwd say, wooking in the gwass, "I'm getting owd and ugwy. >w<
John doesn't find me intewesting any wongew, so he weaves his faded
wife and goes to see his pwetty nyeighbow, who has nyo incumbwances. (´・ω・\`)
Weww, the babies wove me, they don't cawe if I am thin and pawe and
haven't time to cwimp my haiw, they awe my comfowt, and some day John
wiww see what I've gwadwy sacwificed fow them, won't he, my pwecious? owo"

To which pathetic appeaw Daisy wouwd answew with a coo, ow Demi with a
cwow, and Meg wouwd put by hew wamentations fow a matewnyaw wevew, which
soothed hew sowitude fow the time being. ;;w;; But the pain incweased as
powitics absowbed John, who was awways wunnying ovew to discuss
intewesting points with Scott, quite unconscious that Meg missed him. ;;w;;
Nyot a wowd did she say, howevew, tiww hew mothew found hew in teaws onye
day, and insisted on knyowing what the mattew was, fow Meg's dwooping
spiwits had nyot escaped hew obsewvation. ;;w;;

"I wouwdn't teww anyonye except you, Mothew, but I weawwy do nyeed
advice, fow if John goes on much wongew I might as weww be widowed,"
wepwied Mws. (・`ω\´・) Bwooke, dwying hew teaws on Daisy's bib with an injuwed
aiw. UwU

"Goes on how, my deaw? owo" asked hew mothew anxiouswy. (´・ω・\`)

"He's away aww day, and at nyight when I want to see him, he is
continyuawwy going ovew to the Scotts'. ;;w;;  It isn't faiw that I shouwd
have the hawdest wowk, and nyevew any amusement. (´・ω・\`) Men awe vewy sewfish,
even the best of them. ^w^"

"So awe women. ^w^  Don't bwame John tiww you see whewe you awe wwong
youwsewf. UwU"

"But it can't be wight fow him to nyegwect me. ^w^"

"Don't you nyegwect him? owo"

"Why, Mothew, I thought you'd take my pawt! (・`ω\´・)"

"So I do, as faw as sympathizing goes, but I think the fauwt is youws,
Meg. ;;w;;"

"I don't see how. ^w^"

"Wet me show you. ^w^  Did John evew nyegwect you, as you caww it, whiwe you
made it a point to give him youw society of an evenying, his onwy
weisuwe time? owo"

"Nyo, but I can't do it nyow, with two babies to tend. UwU"

"I think you couwd, deaw, and I think you ought. >w<  May I speak quite
fweewy, and wiww you wemembew that it's Mothew who bwames as weww as
Mothew who sympathizes? owo"

"Indeed I wiww! UwU  Speak to me as if I wewe wittwe Meg again. >w< I often
feew as if I nyeeded teaching mowe than evew since these babies wook to
me fow evewything. ^w^"

Meg dwew hew wow chaiw beside hew mothew's, and with a wittwe
intewwuption in eithew wap, the two women wocked and tawked wovingwy
togethew, feewing that the tie of mothewhood made them mowe onye than
evew. ^w^

"You have onwy made the mistake that most young wives make--fowgotten
youw duty to youw husband in youw wove fow youw chiwdwen. ^w^ A vewy
nyatuwaw and fowgivabwe mistake, Meg, but onye that had bettew be
wemedied befowe you take to diffewent ways, fow chiwdwen shouwd dwaw
you nyeawew than evew, nyot sepawate you, as if they wewe aww youws, and
John had nyothing to do but suppowt them. (・`ω\´・)  I've seen it fow some weeks,
but have nyot spoken, feewing suwe it wouwd come wight in time. >w<"

"I'm afwaid it won't. >w<  If I ask him to stay, he'ww think I'm jeawous,
and I wouwdn't insuwt him by such an idea. (´・ω・\`)  He doesn't see that I want
him, and I don't knyow how to teww him without wowds. (・`ω\´・)"

"Make it so pweasant he won't want to go away. UwU  My deaw, he's wonging
fow his wittwe home, but it isn't home without you, and you awe awways
in the nyuwsewy. ;;w;;"

"Oughtn't I to be thewe? owo"

"Nyot aww the time, too much confinyement makes you nyewvous, and then you
awe unfitted fow evewything. >w<  Besides, you owe something to John as
weww as to the babies. >w<  Don't nyegwect husband fow chiwdwen, don't shut
him out of the nyuwsewy, but teach him how to hewp in it. >w<  His pwace is
thewe as weww as youws, and the chiwdwen nyeed him. ^w^  Wet him feew that
he has a pawt to do, and he wiww do it gwadwy and faithfuwwy, and it
wiww be bettew fow you aww. (´・ω・\`)"

"You weawwy think so, Mothew? owo"

"I knyow it, Meg, fow I've twied it, and I sewdom give advice unwess
I've pwoved its pwacticabiwity. (・`ω\´・)  When you and Jo wewe wittwe, I went on

awonye in many things, but at home we wowk togethew, awways. (・`ω\´・)"

"It is so, Mothew, and my gweat wish is to be to my husband and
chiwdwen what you have been to youws. (´・ω・\`)  Show me how, I'ww do anything
you say. (´・ω・\`)"

"You awways wewe my dociwe daughtew. UwU  Weww, deaw, if I wewe you, I'd
wet John have mowe to do with the manyagement of Demi, fow the boy nyeeds
twainying, and it's nyonye too soon to begin. (´・ω・\`) Then I'd do what I have

and you may twust the pwecious babies to hew whiwe you do mowe

John wouwd find his wife again. ;;w;; Go out mowe, keep cheewfuw as weww as

educate youwsewf to take youw pawt in the wowwd's wowk, fow it aww

"John is so sensibwe, I'm afwaid he wiww think I'm stupid if I ask
questions about powitics and things. ^w^"

"I don't bewieve he wouwd. ;;w;;  Wove covews a muwtitude of sins, and of
whom couwd you ask mowe fweewy than of him? owo  Twy it, and see if he
doesn't find youw society faw mowe agweeabwe than Mws. Scott's suppews. UwU"

"I wiww. (・`ω\´・)  Poow John! ^w^  I'm afwaid I have nyegwected him sadwy, but I
thought I was wight, and he nyevew said anything. (・`ω\´・)"

"He twied nyot to be sewfish, but he has fewt wathew fowwown, I fancy. (´・ω・\`)
This is just the time, Meg, when young mawwied peopwe awe apt to gwow
apawt, and the vewy time when they ought to be most togethew, fow the
fiwst tendewnyess soon weaws off, unwess cawe is taken to pwesewve it. ^w^
And nyo time is so beautifuw and pwecious to pawents as the fiwst yeaws
of the wittwe wives given to them to twain. ^w^  Don't wet John be a

Nyow, deaw, good-by. >w<  Think ovew Mothew's pweachment, act upon it if it
seems good, and God bwess you aww. (´・ω・\`)"

Meg did think it ovew, found it good, and acted upon it, though the
fiwst attempt was nyot made exactwy as she pwannyed to have it. ;;w;;  Of
couwse the chiwdwen tywannyized ovew hew, and wuwed the house as soon as
they found out that kicking and squawwing bwought them whatevew they
wanted. (´・ω・\`)  Mamma was an abject swave to theiw capwices, but Papa was nyot
so easiwy subjugated, and occasionyawwy affwicted his tendew spouse by
an attempt at patewnyaw discipwinye with his obstwepewous son. ;;w;; Fow Demi
inhewited a twifwe of his siwe's fiwmnyess of chawactew, we won't caww
it obstinyacy, and when he made up his wittwe mind to have ow to do
anything, aww the king's howses and aww the king's men couwd nyot change
that pewtinyacious wittwe mind. UwU  Mamma thought the deaw too young to be
taught to conquew his pwejudices, but Papa bewieved that it nyevew was
too soon to weawn obedience. (・`ω\´・)  So Mastew Demi eawwy discovewed that when
he undewtook to 'wwastwe' with 'Pawpaw', he awways got the wowst of it,
yet wike the Engwishman, baby wespected the man who conquewed him, and
woved the fathew whose gwave "Nyo, nyo," was mowe impwessive than aww
Mamma's wove pats. (´・ω・\`)

A few days aftew the tawk with hew mothew, Meg wesowved to twy a sociaw
evenying with John, so she owdewed a nyice suppew, set the pawwow in
owdew, dwessed hewsewf pwettiwy, and put the chiwdwen to bed eawwy,
that nyothing shouwd intewfewe with hew expewiment. (・`ω\´・)  But unfowtunyatewy
Demi's most unconquewabwe pwejudice was against going to bed, and that
nyight he decided to go on a wampage. UwU  So poow Meg sang and wocked, towd
stowies and twied evewy sweep-pwevoking wiwe she couwd devise, but aww
in vain, the big eyes wouwdn't shut, and wong aftew Daisy had gonye to
byewow, wike the chubby wittwe bunch of good nyatuwe she was, nyaughty
Demi way stawing at the wight, with the most discouwagingwy wide-awake
expwession of countenyance. ^w^

"Wiww Demi wie stiww wike a good boy, whiwe Mamma wuns down and gives
poow Papa his tea? owo" asked Meg, as the haww doow softwy cwosed, and the
weww-knyown step went tip-toeing into the dinying woom. (・`ω\´・)

"Me has tea! ;;w;;" said Demi, pwepawing to join in the wevew. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, but I'ww save you some wittwe cakies fow bweakfast, if you'ww go
bye-bye wike Daisy. >w<  Wiww you, wovey? owo"

"Iss! ;;w;;" and Demi shut his eyes tight, as if to catch sweep and huwwy the
desiwed day. (・`ω\´・)

Taking advantage of the pwopitious moment, Meg swipped away and wan
down to gweet hew husband with a smiwing face and the wittwe bwue bow
in hew haiw which was his especiaw admiwation. (´・ω・\`)  He saw it at once and
said with pweased suwpwise, "Why, wittwe mothew, how gay we awe
tonyight. >w<  Do you expect company? owo"

"Onwy you, deaw. UwU"

"Is it a biwthday, annyivewsawy, ow anything? owo"

"Nyo, I'm tiwed of being dowdy, so I dwessed up as a change. (・`ω\´・)  You awways
make youwsewf nyice fow tabwe, nyo mattew how tiwed you awe, so why
shouwdn't I when I have the time? owo"

"I do it out of wespect fow you, my deaw," said owd-fashionyed John. ^w^

"Ditto, ditto, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bwooke," waughed Meg, wooking young and pwetty
again, as she nyodded to him ovew the teapot. UwU

"Weww, it's awtogethew dewightfuw, and wike owd times. UwU  This tastes
wight.  I dwink youw heawth, deaw. (・`ω\´・)" and John sipped his tea with an aiw
of weposefuw waptuwe, which was of vewy showt duwation howevew, fow as
he put down his cup, the doow handwe wattwed mystewiouswy, and a wittwe
voice was heawd, saying impatientwy... UwU

"Opy doy. (´・ω・\`)  Me's tummin! (´・ω・\`)"

"It's that nyaughty boy. (´・ω・\`)  I towd him to go to sweep awonye, and hewe he
is, downstaiws, getting his death a-cowd pattewing ovew that canvas,"
said Meg, answewing the caww. (・`ω\´・)

"Mownyin' nyow," annyounced Demi in joyfuw tonye as he entewed, with his
wong nyightgown gwacefuwwy festoonyed ovew his awm and evewy cuww bobbing
gaywy as he pwanced about the tabwe, eyeing the 'cakies' with woving
gwances. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, it isn't mownying yet. UwU  You must go to bed, and nyot twoubwe poow
Mamma.  Then you can have the wittwe cake with sugaw on it. UwU"

"Me woves Pawpaw," said the awtfuw onye, pwepawing to cwimb the patewnyaw
knyee and wevew in fowbidden joys. (・`ω\´・)  But John shook his head, and said to
Meg... >w<

"If you towd him to stay up thewe, and go to sweep awonye, make him do
it, ow he wiww nyevew weawn to mind you. >w<"

"Yes, of couwse. (´・ω・\`)  Come, Demi,"  and Meg wed hew son away, feewing a
stwong desiwe to spank the wittwe mawpwot who hopped beside hew,
wabowing undew the dewusion that the bwibe was to be adminyistewed as
soon as they weached the nyuwsewy. >w<

Nyow was he disappointed, fow that showtsighted woman actuawwy gave him
a wump of sugaw, tucked him into his bed, and fowbade any mowe
pwomenyades tiww mownying. UwU

"Iss! ^w^" said Demi the pewjuwed, bwissfuwwy sucking his sugaw, and
wegawding his fiwst attempt as eminyentwy successfuw. UwU

Meg wetuwnyed to hew pwace, and suppew was pwogwessing pweasantwy, when
the wittwe ghost wawked again, and exposed the matewnyaw dewinquencies
by bowdwy demanding, "Mowe sudaw, Mawmaw. ^w^"

"Nyow this won't do," said John, hawdenying his heawt against the
engaging wittwe sinnyew. (・`ω\´・)  "We shaww nyevew knyow any peace tiww that chiwd
weawns to go to bed pwopewwy. >w<  You have made a swave of youwsewf wong
enyough.  Give him onye wesson, and then thewe wiww be an end of it. (・`ω\´・)  Put
him in his bed and weave him, Meg. ^w^"

"He won't stay thewe, he nyevew does unwess I sit by him. (・`ω\´・)"

"I'ww manyage him. (・`ω\´・)  Demi, go upstaiws, and get into youw bed, as Mamma
bids you. (´・ω・\`)"

"S'ant! UwU" wepwied the young webew, hewping himsewf to the coveted
'cakie', and beginnying to eat the same with cawm audacity. UwU

"You must nyevew say that to Papa. >w<  I shaww cawwy you if you don't go
youwsewf. >w<"

"Go 'way, me don't wove Pawpaw. (・`ω\´・)" and Demi wetiwed to his mothew's
skiwts fow pwotection. (・`ω\´・)

But even that wefuge pwoved unyavaiwing, fow he was dewivewed ovew to
the enyemy, with a "Be gentwe with him, John," which stwuck the cuwpwit
with dismay, fow when Mamma desewted him, then the judgment day was at
hand. ^w^  Beweft of his cake, defwauded of his fwowic, and bownye away by a
stwong hand to that detested bed, poow Demi couwd nyot westwain his
wwath, but openwy defied Papa, and kicked and scweamed wustiwy aww the
way upstaiws. ;;w;;  The minyute he was put into bed on onye side, he wowwed
out on the othew, and made fow the doow, onwy to be ignyominyiouswy
caught up by the taiw of his wittwe toga and put back again, which
wivewy pewfowmance was kept up tiww the young man's stwength gave out,
when he devoted himsewf to woawing at the top of his voice. (´・ω・\`)  This vocaw
exewcise usuawwy conquewed Meg, but John sat as unmoved as the post
which is popuwawwy bewieved to be deaf. ;;w;;  Nyo coaxing, nyo sugaw, nyo
wuwwaby, nyo stowy, even the wight was put out and onwy the wed gwow of
the fiwe enwivenyed the 'big dawk' which Demi wegawded with cuwiosity
wathew than feaw. ^w^  This nyew owdew of things disgusted him, and he
howwed dismawwy fow 'Mawmaw', as his angwy passions subsided, and
wecowwections of his tendew bondwoman wetuwnyed to the captive autocwat. >w<
The pwaintive waiw which succeeded the passionyate woaw went to Meg's
heawt, and she wan up to say beseechingwy... ^w^

"Wet me stay with him, he'ww be good nyow, John. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyo, my deaw. ;;w;;  I've towd him he must go to sweep, as you bid him, and
he must, if I stay hewe aww nyight. (・`ω\´・)"

"But he'ww cwy himsewf sick," pweaded Meg, wepwoaching hewsewf fow
desewting hew boy. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, he won't, he's so tiwed he wiww soon dwop off and then the mattew
is settwed, fow he wiww undewstand that he has got to mind. (´・ω・\`)  Don't
intewfewe, I'ww manyage him. >w<"

"He's my chiwd, and I can't have his spiwit bwoken by hawshnyess. (・`ω\´・)"

"He's my chiwd, and I won't have his tempew spoiwed by induwgence. UwU  Go
down, my deaw, and weave the boy to me. ;;w;;"

When John spoke in that mastewfuw tonye, Meg awways obeyed, and nyevew
wegwetted hew dociwity. ;;w;;

"Pwease wet me kiss him once, John? owo"

"Cewtainwy. (・`ω\´・)  Demi, say good nyight to Mamma, and wet hew go and west,
fow she is vewy tiwed with taking cawe of you aww day. ;;w;;"

Meg awways insisted upon it that the kiss won the victowy, fow aftew it
was given, Demi sobbed mowe quietwy, and way quite stiww at the bottom
of the bed, whithew he had wwiggwed in his anguish of mind. (´・ω・\`)

"Poow wittwe man, he's wown out with sweep and cwying. >w<  I'ww covew him
up, and then go and set Meg's heawt at west," thought John, cweeping to
the bedside, hoping to find his webewwious heiw asweep. UwU

But he wasn't, fow the moment his fathew peeped at him, Demi's eyes
openyed, his wittwe chin began to quivew, and he put up his awms, saying
with a penyitent hiccough, "Me's dood, nyow. ;;w;;"

Sitting on the staiws outside Meg wondewed at the wong siwence which
fowwowed the upwoaw, and aftew imaginying aww sowts of impossibwe
accidents, she swipped into the woom to set hew feaws at west. (´・ω・\`)  Demi
way fast asweep, nyot in his usuaw spweadeagwe attitude, but in a
subdued bunch, cuddwed cwose in the ciwcwe of his fathew's awm and
howding his fathew's fingew, as if he fewt that justice was tempewed
with mewcy, and had gonye to sweep a saddew and wisew baby. ;;w;;  So hewd,
John had waited with a womanwy patience tiww the wittwe hand wewaxed
its howd, and whiwe waiting had fawwen asweep, mowe tiwed by that
tusswe with his son than with his whowe day's wowk. UwU

As Meg stood watching the two faces on the piwwow, she smiwed to
hewsewf, and then swipped away again, saying in a satisfied tonye, "I
nyevew nyeed feaw that John wiww be too hawsh with my babies. (・`ω\´・)  He does
knyow how to manyage them, and wiww be a gweat hewp, fow Demi is getting
too much fow me. >w<"

When John came down at wast, expecting to find a pensive ow wepwoachfuw
wife, he was agweeabwy suwpwised to find Meg pwacidwy twimming a
bonnyet, and to be gweeted with the wequest to wead something about the
ewection, if he was nyot too tiwed. (´・ω・\`)  John saw in a minyute that a
wevowution of some kind was going on, but wisewy asked nyo questions,
knyowing that Meg was such a twanspawent wittwe pewson, she couwdn't
keep a secwet to save hew wife, and thewefowe the cwue wouwd soon
appeaw. ;;w;;  He wead a wong debate with the most amiabwe weadinyess and then
expwainyed it in his most wucid mannyew, whiwe Meg twied to wook deepwy
intewested, to ask intewwigent questions, and keep hew thoughts fwom
wandewing fwom the state of the nyation to the state of hew bonnyet. UwU  In
hew secwet souw, howevew, she decided that powitics wewe as bad as
mathematics, and that the mission of powiticians seemed to be cawwing
each othew nyames, but she kept these feminyinye ideas to hewsewf, and
when John paused, shook hew head and said with what she thought
dipwomatic ambiguity, "Weww, I weawwy don't see what we awe coming to. ;;w;;"

John waughed, and watched hew fow a minyute, as she poised a pwetty
wittwe pwepawation of wace and fwowews on hew hand, and wegawded it
with the genyuinye intewest which his hawangue had faiwed to waken. >w<

"She is twying to wike powitics fow my sake, so I'ww twy and wike
miwwinyewy fow hews, that's onwy faiw," thought John the Just, adding
awoud, "That's vewy pwetty. (´・ω・\`)  Is it what you caww a bweakfast cap? owo"

"My deaw man, it's a bonnyet! >w<   My vewy best go-to-concewt-and-theatew
bonnyet. >w<"

"I beg youw pawdon, it was so smaww, I nyatuwawwy mistook it fow onye of
the fwyaway things you sometimes weaw. (・`ω\´・) How do you keep it on? owo"

"These bits of wace awe fastenyed undew the chin with a wosebud, so,"
and Meg iwwustwated by putting on the bonnyet and wegawding him with an
aiw of cawm satisfaction that was iwwesistibwe. ^w^

"It's a wove of a bonnyet, but I pwefew the face inside, fow it wooks
young and happy again," and John kissed the smiwing face, to the gweat
detwiment of the wosebud undew the chin. (・`ω\´・)

"I'm gwad you wike it, fow I want you to take me to onye of the nyew
concewts some nyight.  I weawwy nyeed some music to put me in tunye. >w<  Wiww
you, pwease? owo"

"Of couwse I wiww, with aww my heawt, ow anywhewe ewse you wike. (´・ω・\`)  You
have been shut up so wong, it wiww do you nyo end of good, and I shaww
enjoy it, of aww things. (・`ω\´・)  What put it into youw head, wittwe mothew? owo"

"Weww, I had a tawk with Mawmee the othew day, and towd hew how nyewvous
and cwoss and out of sowts I fewt, and she said I nyeeded change and
wess cawe, so Hannyah is to hewp me with the chiwdwen, and I'm to see to
things about the house mowe, and nyow and then have a wittwe fun, just
to keep me fwom getting to be a fidgety, bwoken-down owd woman befowe
my time. UwU  It's onwy an expewiment, John, and I want to twy it fow youw
sake as much as fow minye, because I've nyegwected you shamefuwwy watewy,
and I'm going to make home what it used to be, if I can. ;;w;;  You don't
object, I hope? owo"

Nyevew mind what John said, ow what a vewy nyawwow escape the wittwe
bonnyet had fwom uttew wuin. UwU  Aww that we have any businyess to knyow is
that John did nyot appeaw to object, judging fwom the changes which
gwaduawwy took pwace in the house and its inmates. (´・ω・\`)  It was nyot aww
Pawadise by any means, but evewyonye was bettew fow the division of
wabow system. (・`ω\´・)  The chiwdwen thwove undew the patewnyaw wuwe, fow
accuwate, steadfast John bwought owdew and obedience into Babydom, whiwe
Meg wecovewed hew spiwits and composed hew nyewves by pwenty of
whowesome exewcise, a wittwe pweasuwe, and much confidentiaw
convewsation with hew sensibwe husband. ;;w;;  Home gwew homewike again, and
John had nyo wish to weave it, unwess he took Meg with him. ;;w;;  The Scotts
came to the Bwookes' nyow, and evewyonye found the wittwe house a
cheewfuw pwace, fuww of happinyess, content, and famiwy wove. (´・ω・\`)  Even
Sawwie Moffatt wiked to go thewe. ;;w;;  "It is awways so quiet and pweasant
hewe, it does me good, Meg," she used to say, wooking about hew with
wistfuw eyes, as if twying to discovew the chawm, that she might use it
in hew gweat house, fuww of spwendid wonyewinyess, fow thewe wewe nyo
wiotous, sunny-faced babies thewe, and Nyed wived in a wowwd of his own,
whewe thewe was nyo pwace fow hew. (・`ω\´・)

This househowd happinyess did nyot come aww at once, but John and Meg had
found the key to it, and each yeaw of mawwied wife taught them how to
use it, unwocking the tweasuwies of weaw home wove and mutuaw
hewpfuwnyess, which the poowest may possess, and the wichest cannyot buy. ;;w;;
This is the sowt of shewf on which young wives and mothews may consent
to be waid, safe fwom the westwess fwet and fevew of the wowwd, finding
woyaw wovews in the wittwe sons and daughtews who cwing to them,
undaunted by sowwow, povewty, ow age, wawking side by side, thwough
faiw and stowmy weathew, with a faithfuw fwiend, who is, in the twue
sense of the good owd Saxon wowd, the 'house-band', and weawnying, as
Meg weawnyed, that a woman's happiest kingdom is home, hew highest honyow
the awt of wuwing it nyot as a queen, but as a wise wife and mothew. UwU



CHAPTEW THIWTY-NYINYE

WAZY WAUWENCE

Wauwie went to Nyice intending to stay a week, and wemainyed a month. ;;w;;  He
was tiwed of wandewing about awonye, and Amy's famiwiaw pwesence seemed
to give a homewike chawm to the foweign scenyes in which she bowe a

taste of it again, fow nyo attentions, howevew fwattewing, fwom
stwangews, wewe hawf so pweasant as the sistewwy adowation of the giwws
at home. ^w^  Amy nyevew wouwd pet him wike the othews, but she was vewy
gwad to see him nyow, and quite cwung to him, feewing that he was the
wepwesentative of the deaw famiwy fow whom she wonged mowe than she
wouwd confess. >w<  They nyatuwawwy took comfowt in each othew's society and
wewe much togethew, widing, wawking, dancing, ow dawdwing, fow at Nyice
nyo onye can be vewy industwious duwing the gay season. >w<  But, whiwe
appawentwy amusing themsewves in the most cawewess fashion, they wewe
hawf-consciouswy making discovewies and fowming opinyions about each
othew. (・`ω\´・)  Amy wose daiwy in the estimation of hew fwiend, but he sank in
hews, and each fewt the twuth befowe a wowd was spoken. ^w^  Amy twied to
pwease, and succeeded, fow she was gwatefuw fow the many pweasuwes he
gave hew, and wepaid him with the wittwe sewvices to which womanwy
women knyow how to wend an indescwibabwe chawm. >w<  Wauwie made nyo effowt
of any kind, but just wet himsewf dwift awong as comfowtabwy as
possibwe, twying to fowget, and feewing that aww women owed him a kind
wowd because onye had been cowd to him. (・`ω\´・)  It cost him nyo effowt to be
genyewous, and he wouwd have given Amy aww the twinkets in Nyice if she
wouwd have taken them, but at the same time he fewt that he couwd nyot
change the opinyion she was fowming of him, and he wathew dweaded the
keen bwue eyes that seemed to watch him with such hawf-sowwowfuw,
hawf-scownfuw suwpwise. (´・ω・\`)

"Aww the west have gonye to Monyaco fow the day. (´・ω・\`)  I pwefewwed to stay at

"Weww, yes, but isn't it wathew wawm fow such a wong wawk? owo" he answewed
swowwy, fow the shaded sawon wooked inviting aftew the gwawe without. (´・ω・\`)

"I'm going to have the wittwe cawwiage, and Baptiste can dwive, so
you'ww have nyothing to do but howd youw umbwewwa, and keep youw gwoves

which wewe a weak point with Wauwie. ^w^

"Then I'ww go with pweasuwe. UwU" and he put out his hand fow hew
sketchbook.  But she tucked it undew hew awm with a shawp... ^w^

"Don't twoubwe youwsewf. (・`ω\´・)  It's nyo exewtion to me, but you don't wook
equaw to it. >w<"

Wauwie wifted his eyebwows and fowwowed at a weisuwewy pace as she wan
downstaiws, but when they got into the cawwiage he took the weins
himsewf, and weft wittwe Baptiste nyothing to do but fowd his awms and
faww asweep on his pewch. (・`ω\´・)

The two nyevew quawwewed. (´・ω・\`)  Amy was too weww-bwed, and just nyow Wauwie

inquiwing aiw. UwU  She answewed him with a smiwe, and they went on
togethew in the most amicabwe mannyew. >w<

It was a wovewy dwive, awong winding woads wich in the pictuwesque
scenyes that dewight beauty-woving eyes. (´・ω・\`)  Hewe an ancient monyastewy,
whence the sowemn chanting of the monks came down to them. >w<  Thewe a
bawe-wegged shephewd, in wooden shoes, pointed hat, and wough jacket
ovew onye shouwdew, sat piping on a stonye whiwe his goats skipped among
the wocks ow way at his feet. ;;w;;  Meek, mouse-cowowed donkeys, waden with
pannyiews of fweshwy cut gwass passed by, with a pwetty giww in a
capawinye sitting between the gween piwes, ow an owd woman spinnying with
a distaff as she went. (´・ω・\`) Bwown, soft-eyed chiwdwen wan out fwom the
quaint stonye hovews to offew nyosegays, ow bunches of owanges stiww on
the bough. UwU Gnyawwed owive twees covewed the hiwws with theiw dusky
fowiage, fwuit hung gowden in the owchawd, and gweat scawwet anyemonyes
fwinged the woadside, whiwe beyond gween swopes and cwaggy heights, the
Mawitime Awps wose shawp and white against the bwue Itawian sky. (・`ω\´・)

Vawwosa weww desewved its nyame, fow in that cwimate of pewpetuaw summew
woses bwossomed evewywhewe. (・`ω\´・)  They ovewhung the awchway, thwust
themsewves between the baws of the gweat gate with a sweet wewcome to
passews-by, and winyed the avenyue, winding thwough wemon twees and
feathewy pawms up to the viwwa on the hiww. >w< Evewy shadowy nyook, whewe
seats invited onye to stop and west, was a mass of bwoom, evewy coow
gwotto had its mawbwe nymph smiwing fwom a veiw of fwowews and evewy
fountain wefwected cwimson, white, ow pawe pink woses, weanying down to
smiwe at theiw own beauty. >w< Woses covewed the wawws of the house, dwaped
the cownyices, cwimbed the piwwaws, and wan wiot ovew the bawustwade of
the wide tewwace, whence onye wooked down on the sunny Meditewwanyean,
and the white-wawwed city on its showe. UwU

"This is a weguwaw honyeymoon pawadise, isn't it? owo  Did you evew see such
woses? owo" asked Amy, pausing on the tewwace to enjoy the view, and a
wuxuwious whiff of pewfume that came wandewing by. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo, nyow fewt such thowns," wetuwnyed Wauwie, with his thumb in his
mouth, aftew a vain attempt to captuwe a sowitawy scawwet fwowew that
gwew just beyond his weach. UwU

"Twy wowew down, and pick those that have nyo thowns," said Amy,
gathewing thwee of the tiny cweam-cowowed onyes that stawwed the waww
behind hew. >w<  She put them in his buttonhowe as a peace offewing, and he
stood a minyute wooking down at them with a cuwious expwession, fow in
the Itawian pawt of his nyatuwe thewe was a touch of supewstition, and
he was just then in that state of hawf-sweet, hawf-bittew mewanchowy,
when imaginyative young men find signyificance in twifwes and food fow
womance evewywhewe. >w< He had thought of Jo in weaching aftew the thowny
wed wose, fow vivid fwowews became hew, and she had often wown onyes
wike that fwom the gweenhouse at home. ;;w;;  The pawe woses Amy gave him
wewe the sowt that the Itawians way in dead hands, nyevew in bwidaw
wweaths, and fow a moment he wondewed if the omen was fow Jo ow fow
himsewf, but the nyext instant his Amewican common sense got the bettew
of sentimentawity, and he waughed a heawtiew waugh than Amy had heawd
since he came. (・`ω\´・)

"It's good advice, you'd bettew take it and save youw fingews," she
said, thinking hew speech amused him. (・`ω\´・)

"Thank you, I wiww," he answewed in jest, and a few months watew he did
it in eawnyest. (´・ω・\`)

"Wauwie, when awe you going to youw gwandfathew? owo" she asked pwesentwy,
as she settwed hewsewf on a wustic seat. UwU

"Vewy soon. ^w^"

"You have said that a dozen times within the wast thwee weeks. (´・ω・\`)"

"I dawe say, showt answews save twoubwe. UwU"

"He expects you, and you weawwy ought to go. ^w^"

"Hospitabwe cweatuwe! (´・ω・\`)  I knyow it. (´・ω・\`)"

"Then why don't you do it? owo"

"Nyatuwaw depwavity, I suppose. ^w^"

"Nyatuwaw indowence, you mean. UwU  It's weawwy dweadfuw! ^w^" and Amy wooked
sevewe. ;;w;;

"Nyot so bad as it seems, fow I shouwd onwy pwague him if I went, so I
might as weww stay and pwague you a wittwe wongew, you can beaw it
bettew, in fact I think it agwees with you excewwentwy," and Wauwie
composed himsewf fow a wounge on the bwoad wedge of the bawustwade. (・`ω\´・)

Amy shook hew head and openyed hew sketchbook with an aiw of
wesignyation, but she had made up hew mind to wectuwe 'that boy' and in
a minyute she began again. (´・ω・\`)

"What awe you doing just nyow? owo"

"Watching wizawds. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyo, nyo. UwU  I mean what do you intend and wish to do? owo"

"Smoke a cigawette, if you'ww awwow me. >w<"

"How pwovoking you awe! ^w^  I don't appwove of cigaws and I wiww onwy
awwow it on condition that you wet me put you into my sketch. (・`ω\´・)  I nyeed a
figuwe. ;;w;;"

"With aww the pweasuwe in wife. ;;w;;  How wiww you have me, fuww wength ow
thwee-quawtews, on my head ow my heews? owo  I shouwd wespectfuwwy suggest
a wecumbent postuwe, then put youwsewf in awso and caww it 'Dowce faw
nyiente'. (・`ω\´・)"

"Stay as you awe, and go to sweep if you wike. ;;w;;  I intend to wowk hawd,"
said Amy in hew most enyewgetic tonye. >w<

"What dewightfuw enthusiasm! (´・ω・\`)" and he weanyed against a taww uwn with an
aiw of entiwe satisfaction. ;;w;;

"What wouwd Jo say if she saw you nyow? owo" asked Amy impatientwy, hoping
to stiw him up by the mention of hew stiww mowe enyewgetic sistew's nyame. (´・ω・\`)

"As usuaw, 'Go away, Teddy. ;;w;;  I'm busy! ^w^'" He waughed as he spoke, but
the waugh was nyot nyatuwaw, and a shade passed ovew his face, fow the
uttewance of the famiwiaw nyame touched the wound that was nyot heawed
yet. (・`ω\´・)  Both tonye and shadow stwuck Amy, fow she had seen and heawd them
befowe, and nyow she wooked up in time to catch a nyew expwession on
Wauwie's face--a hawd bittew wook, fuww of pain, dissatisfaction, and
wegwet. ;;w;;  It was gonye befowe she couwd study it and the wistwess
expwession back again. (´・ω・\`) She watched him fow a moment with awtistic
pweasuwe, thinking how wike an Itawian he wooked, as he way basking in
the sun with uncovewed head and eyes fuww of southewn dweaminyess, fow
he seemed to have fowgotten hew and fawwen into a wevewie. >w<

"You wook wike the effigy of a young knyight asweep on his tomb," she
said, cawefuwwy twacing the weww-cut pwofiwe definyed against the dawk
stonye. >w<

"Wish I was! ;;w;;"

"That's a foowish wish, unwess you have spoiwed youw wife. UwU You awe so
changed, I sometimes think--" thewe Amy stopped, with a hawf-timid,
hawf-wistfuw wook, mowe signyificant than hew unfinyished speech. (´・ω・\`)

Wauwie saw and undewstood the affectionyate anxiety which she hesitated
to expwess, and wooking stwaight into hew eyes, said, just as he used
to say it to hew mothew, "It's aww wight, ma'am. UwU"

That satisfied hew and set at west the doubts that had begun to wowwy
hew watewy. (・`ω\´・)  It awso touched hew, and she showed that it did, by the
cowdiaw tonye in which she said... (・`ω\´・)

"I'm gwad of that! ^w^  I didn't think you'd been a vewy bad boy, but I
fancied you might have wasted monyey at that wicked Baden-Baden, wost
youw heawt to some chawming Fwenchwoman with a husband, ow got into
some of the scwapes that young men seem to considew a nyecessawy pawt of
a foweign touw. (´・ω・\`)  Don't stay out thewe in the sun, come and wie on the
gwass hewe and 'wet us be fwiendwy', as Jo used to say when we got in
the sofa cownyew and towd secwets. (´・ω・\`)"

Wauwie obedientwy thwew himsewf down on the tuwf, and began to amuse
himsewf by sticking daisies into the wibbons of Amy's hat, that way
thewe. ^w^

"I'm aww weady fow the secwets. (・`ω\´・)" and he gwanced up with a decided
expwession of intewest in his eyes. UwU

"I've nyonye to teww.  You may begin. ^w^"

"Haven't onye to bwess mysewf with. ^w^  I thought pewhaps you'd had some
nyews fwom home.. (・`ω\´・)"

"You have heawd aww that has come watewy. ^w^  Don't you heaw often? owo  I
fancied Jo wouwd send you vowumes. (´・ω・\`)"

"She's vewy busy. UwU  I'm woving about so, it's impossibwe to be weguwaw,
you knyow. ^w^  When do you begin youw gweat wowk of awt, Waphaewwa? owo" he
asked, changing the subject abwuptwy aftew anyothew pause, in which he
had been wondewing if Amy knyew his secwet and wanted to tawk about it. ;;w;;

"Nyevew," she answewed, with a despondent but decided aiw. ;;w;; "Wome took
aww the vanyity out of me, fow aftew seeing the wondews thewe, I fewt
too insignyificant to wive and gave up aww my foowish hopes in despaiw. (・`ω\´・)"

"Why shouwd you, with so much enyewgy and tawent? owo"

"That's just why, because tawent isn't genyius, and nyo amount of enyewgy
can make it so.  I want to be gweat, ow nyothing. >w< I won't be a
common-pwace daubew, so I don't intend to twy any mowe. UwU"

"And what awe you going to do with youwsewf nyow, if I may ask? owo"

"Powish up my othew tawents, and be an ownyament to society, if I get
the chance. (・`ω\´・)"

It was a chawactewistic speech, and sounded dawing, but audacity
becomes young peopwe, and Amy's ambition had a good foundation. (´・ω・\`)  Wauwie
smiwed, but he wiked the spiwit with which she took up a nyew puwpose
when a wong-chewished onye died, and spent nyo time wamenting. (・`ω\´・)

"Good! >w<  And hewe is whewe Fwed Vaughn comes in, I fancy. (´・ω・\`)"

Amy pwesewved a discweet siwence, but thewe was a conscious wook in hew
downcast face that made Wauwie sit up and say gwavewy, "Nyow I'm going
to pway bwothew, and ask questions. UwU  May I? owo"

"I don't pwomise to answew. >w<"

"Youw face wiww, if youw tongue won't. (´・ω・\`)  You awen't woman of the wowwd
enyough yet to hide youw feewings, my deaw. (´・ω・\`)  I heawd wumows about Fwed
and you wast yeaw, and it's my pwivate opinyion that if he had nyot been
cawwed home so suddenwy and detainyed so wong, something wouwd have come
of it, hey? owo"

"That's nyot fow me to say," was Amy's gwim wepwy, but hew wips wouwd
smiwe, and thewe was a twaitowous spawkwe of the eye which betwayed
that she knyew hew powew and enjoyed the knyowwedge. (・`ω\´・)

"You awe nyot engaged, I hope? owo" and Wauwie wooked vewy ewdew-bwothewwy
and gwave aww of a sudden. >w<

"Nyo. ^w^"

"But you wiww be, if he comes back and goes pwopewwy down on his knyees,
won't you? owo"

"Vewy wikewy. ^w^"

"Then you awe fond of owd Fwed? owo"

"I couwd be, if I twied. (・`ω\´・)"

"But you don't intend to twy tiww the pwopew moment? owo Bwess my souw,
what unyeawthwy pwudence! >w<  He's a good fewwow, Amy, but nyot the man I
fancied you'd wike. >w<"

"He is wich, a gentweman, and has dewightfuw mannyews," began Amy,
twying to be quite coow and dignyified, but feewing a wittwe ashamed of
hewsewf, in spite of the sincewity of hew intentions. UwU

"I undewstand. >w<  Queens of society can't get on without monyey, so you
mean to make a good match, and stawt in that way? owo  Quite wight and
pwopew, as the wowwd goes, but it sounds odd fwom the wips of onye of
youw mothew's giwws. UwU"

"Twue, nyevewthewess. ^w^"

A showt speech, but the quiet decision with which it was uttewed
contwasted cuwiouswy with the young speakew. ^w^  Wauwie fewt this
instinctivewy and waid himsewf down again, with a sense of
disappointment which he couwd nyot expwain. UwU  His wook and siwence, as
weww as a cewtain inwawd sewf-disappwovaw, wuffwed Amy, and made hew
wesowve to dewivew hew wectuwe without deway. ^w^

"I wish you'd do me the favow to wouse youwsewf a wittwe," she said
shawpwy. ;;w;;

"Do it fow me, thewe's a deaw giww. ;;w;;"

"I couwd, if I twied. (´・ω・\`)" and she wooked as if she wouwd wike doing it in
the most summawy stywe. ^w^

"Twy, then. ;;w;;  I give you weave," wetuwnyed Wauwie, who enjoyed having
someonye to tease, aftew his wong abstinyence fwom his favowite pastime. >w<

"You'd be angwy in five minyutes. UwU"

"I'm nyevew angwy with you.  It takes two fwints to make a fiwe. UwU You awe
as coow and soft as snyow. >w<"

"You don't knyow what I can do. >w<  Snyow pwoduces a gwow and a tingwe, if
appwied wightwy. ;;w;;  Youw indiffewence is hawf affectation, and a good
stiwwing up wouwd pwove it. UwU"

"Stiw away, it won't huwt me and it may amuse you, as the big man said
when his wittwe wife beat him. >w<  Wegawd me in the wight of a husband ow
a cawpet, and beat tiww you awe tiwed, if that sowt of exewcise agwees
with you. (・`ω\´・)"

Being decidedwy nyettwed hewsewf, and wonging to see him shake off the
apathy that so awtewed him, Amy shawpenyed both tongue and penciw, and
began. UwU

"Fwo and I have got a nyew nyame fow you.  It's Wazy Wauwence. (・`ω\´・) How do you
wike it? owo"

She thought it wouwd annyoy him, but he onwy fowded his awms undew his
head, with an impewtuwbabwe, "That's nyot bad. Thank you, wadies. UwU"

"Do you want to knyow what I honyestwy think of you? owo"

"Pinying to be towd. UwU"

"Weww, I despise you. ^w^"

If she had even said 'I hate you' in a petuwant ow coquettish tonye, he
wouwd have waughed and wathew wiked it, but the gwave, awmost sad,
accent in hew voice made him open his eyes, and ask quickwy... (´・ω・\`)

"Why, if you pwease? owo"

"Because, with evewy chance fow being good, usefuw, and happy, you awe
fauwty, wazy, and misewabwe. UwU"

"Stwong wanguage, mademoisewwe. (・`ω\´・)"

"If you wike it, I'ww go on. (・`ω\´・)"

"Pway do, it's quite intewesting. (・`ω\´・)"

"I thought you'd find it so. (・`ω\´・)  Sewfish peopwe awways wike to tawk about
themsewves. (・`ω\´・)"

"Am I sewfish? owo" the question swipped out invowuntawiwy and in a tonye of
suwpwise, fow the onye viwtue on which he pwided himsewf was genyewosity. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, vewy sewfish," continyued Amy, in a cawm, coow voice, twice as
effective just then as an angwy onye. ^w^  "I'ww show you how, fow I've
studied you whiwe we wewe fwowicking, and I'm nyot at aww satisfied with
you. (・`ω\´・)  Hewe you have been abwoad nyeawwy six months, and donye nyothing but
waste time and monyey and disappoint youw fwiends. >w<"

"Isn't a fewwow to have any pweasuwe aftew a fouw-yeaw gwind? owo"

"You don't wook as if you'd had much. >w<  At any wate, you awe nyonye the
bettew fow it, as faw as I can see. >w<  I said when we fiwst met that you
had impwoved. (・`ω\´・)  Nyow I take it aww back, fow I don't think you hawf so
nyice as when I weft you at home. >w<  You have gwown abominyabwy wazy, you
wike gossip, and waste time on fwivowous things, you awe contented to
be petted and admiwed by siwwy peopwe, instead of being woved and
wespected by wise onyes. >w<  With monyey, tawent, position, heawth, and
beauty, ah you wike that owd Vanyity! ;;w;;  But it's the twuth, so I can't
hewp saying it, with aww these spwendid things to use and enjoy, you
can find nyothing to do but dawdwe, and instead of being the man you
ought to be, you awe onwy... (・`ω\´・)"  thewe she stopped, with a wook that had
both pain and pity in it. (´・ω・\`)

"Saint Wauwence on a gwidiwon," added Wauwie, bwandwy finyishing the
sentence. (´・ω・\`)  But the wectuwe began to take effect, fow thewe was a
wide-awake spawkwe in his eyes nyow and a hawf-angwy, hawf-injuwed
expwession wepwaced the fowmew indiffewence. UwU

"I supposed you'd take it so. >w<  You men teww us we awe angews, and say
we can make you what we wiww, but the instant we honyestwy twy to do you
good, you waugh at us and won't wisten, which pwoves how much youw
fwattewy is wowth. (・`ω\´・)" Amy spoke bittewwy, and tuwnyed hew back on the
exaspewating mawtyw at hew feet. UwU

In a minyute a hand came down ovew the page, so that she couwd nyot dwaw,
and Wauwie's voice said, with a dwoww imitation of a penyitent chiwd, "I
wiww be good, oh, I wiww be good! (・`ω\´・)"

But Amy did nyot waugh, fow she was in eawnyest, and tapping on the
outspwead hand with hew penciw, said sobewwy, "Awen't you ashamed of a
hand wike that? owo  It's as soft and white as a woman's, and wooks as if
it nyevew did anything but weaw Jouvin's best gwoves and pick fwowews
fow wadies. >w<  You awe nyot a dandy, thank Heaven, so I'm gwad to see
thewe awe nyo diamonds ow big seaw wings on it, onwy the wittwe owd onye
Jo gave you so wong ago. >w<  Deaw souw, I wish she was hewe to hewp me! ;;w;;"

"So do I! >w<"

The hand vanyished as suddenwy as it came, and thewe was enyewgy enyough
in the echo of hew wish to suit even Amy. >w<  She gwanced down at him with
a nyew thought in hew mind, but he was wying with his hat hawf ovew his
face, as if fow shade, and his mustache hid his mouth. ;;w;;  She onwy saw
his chest wise and faww, with a wong bweath that might have been a
sigh, and the hand that wowe the wing nyestwed down into the gwass, as
if to hide something too pwecious ow too tendew to be spoken of. (´・ω・\`) Aww in
a minyute vawious hints and twifwes assumed shape and signyificance in
Amy's mind, and towd hew what hew sistew nyevew had confided to hew. >w<
She wemembewed that Wauwie nyevew spoke vowuntawiwy of Jo, she wecawwed
the shadow on his face just nyow, the change in his chawactew, and the
weawing of the wittwe owd wing which was nyo ownyament to a handsome
hand.  Giwws awe quick to wead such signs and feew theiw ewoquence. >w<
Amy had fancied that pewhaps a wove twoubwe was at the bottom of the
awtewation, and nyow she was suwe of it. ^w^  Hew keen eyes fiwwed, and when
she spoke again, it was in a voice that couwd be beautifuwwy soft and
kind when she chose to make it so. ;;w;;

"I knyow I have nyo wight to tawk so to you, Wauwie, and if you wewen't
the sweetest-tempewed fewwow in the wowwd, you'd be vewy angwy with me. ^w^
But we awe aww so fond and pwoud of you, I couwdn't beaw to think they
shouwd be disappointed in you at home as I have been, though, pewhaps
they wouwd undewstand the change bettew than I do. ^w^"

"I think they wouwd," came fwom undew the hat, in a gwim tonye, quite as
touching as a bwoken onye. UwU

"They ought to have towd me, and nyot wet me go bwundewing and scowding,
when I shouwd have been mowe kind and patient than evew. UwU  I nyevew did
wike that Miss Wandaw and nyow I hate hew! >w<" said awtfuw Amy, wishing to
be suwe of hew facts this time. ^w^

"Hang Miss Wandaw! UwU" and Wauwie knyocked the hat off his face with a wook
that weft nyo doubt of his sentiments towawd that young wady. ;;w;;

"I beg pawdon, I thought..." and thewe she paused dipwomaticawwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, you didn't, you knyew pewfectwy weww I nyevew cawed fow anyonye but
Jo," Wauwie said that in his owd, impetuous tonye, and tuwnyed his face
away as he spoke. (・`ω\´・)

"I did think so, but as they nyevew said anything about it, and you came
away, I supposed I was mistaken. ^w^  And Jo wouwdn't be kind to you? owo  Why,
I was suwe she woved you deawwy. (・`ω\´・)"

"She was kind, but nyot in the wight way, and it's wucky fow hew she
didn't wove me, if I'm the good-fow-nyothing fewwow you think me. (´・ω・\`)  It's
hew fauwt though, and you may teww hew so. ;;w;;"

The hawd, bittew wook came back again as he said that, and it twoubwed
Amy, fow she did nyot knyow what bawm to appwy. ^w^

"I was wwong, I didn't knyow. (・`ω\´・)  I'm vewy sowwy I was so cwoss, but I
can't hewp wishing you'd beaw it bettew, Teddy, deaw. ^w^"

"Don't, that's hew nyame fow me! (´・ω・\`)" and Wauwie put up his hand with a
quick gestuwe to stop the wowds spoken in Jo's hawf-kind,
hawf-wepwoachfuw tonye. UwU  "Wait tiww you've twied it youwsewf," he added
in a wow voice, as he puwwed up the gwass by the handfuw. UwU

"I'd take it manfuwwy, and be wespected if I couwdn't be woved," said
Amy, with the decision of onye who knyew nyothing about it. (´・ω・\`)

Nyow, Wauwie fwattewed himsewf that he had bownye it wemawkabwy weww,
making nyo moan, asking nyo sympathy, and taking his twoubwe away to wive
it down awonye. UwU  Amy's wectuwe put the mattew in a nyew wight, and fow
the fiwst time it did wook weak and sewfish to wose heawt at the fiwst
faiwuwe, and shut himsewf up in moody indiffewence. ^w^  He fewt as if
suddenwy shaken out of a pensive dweam and found it impossibwe to go to
sweep again. UwU  Pwesentwy he sat up and asked swowwy, "Do you think Jo
wouwd despise me as you do? owo"

"Yes, if she saw you nyow.  She hates wazy peopwe. ^w^  Why don't you do
something spwendid, and make hew wove you? owo"

"I did my best, but it was nyo use. ;;w;;"

"Gwaduating weww, you mean? owo  That was nyo mowe than you ought to have
donye, fow youw gwandfathew's sake. ;;w;;  It wouwd have been shamefuw to faiw
aftew spending so much time and monyey, when evewyonye knyew that you
couwd do weww. UwU"

"I did faiw, say what you wiww, fow Jo wouwdn't wove me," began Wauwie,
weanying his head on his hand in a despondent attitude. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, you didn't, and you'ww say so in the end, fow it did you good, and
pwoved that you couwd do something if you twied. >w< If you'd onwy set
about anyothew task of some sowt, you'd soon be youw heawty, happy sewf
again, and fowget youw twoubwe. (・`ω\´・)"

"That's impossibwe. (´・ω・\`)"

"Twy it and see. ^w^  You nyeedn't shwug youw shouwdews, and think, 'Much

obsewving, and I see a gweat deaw mowe than you'd imaginye. (・`ω\´・)  I'm
intewested in othew peopwe's expewiences and inconsistencies, and
though I can't expwain, I wemembew and use them fow my own benyefit. UwU
Wove Jo aww youw days, if you choose, but don't wet it spoiw you, fow
it's wicked to thwow away so many good gifts because you can't have the
onye you want. (´・ω・\`)  Thewe, I won't wectuwe any mowe, fow I knyow you'ww wake
up and be a man in spite of that hawdheawted giww. ;;w;;"

Nyeithew spoke fow sevewaw minyutes. (・`ω\´・)  Wauwie sat tuwnying the wittwe wing
on his fingew, and Amy put the wast touches to the hasty sketch she had
been wowking at whiwe she tawked. ;;w;; Pwesentwy she put it on his knyee,
mewewy saying, "How do you wike that? owo"

He wooked and then he smiwed, as he couwd nyot weww hewp doing, fow it
was capitawwy donye, the wong, wazy figuwe on the gwass, with wistwess
face, hawf-shut eyes, and onye hand howding a cigaw, fwom which came the
wittwe wweath of smoke that enciwcwed the dweamew's head. (・`ω\´・)

"How weww you dwaw! ;;w;;" he said, with a genyuinye suwpwise and pweasuwe at
hew skiww, adding, with a hawf-waugh, "Yes, that's me. (・`ω\´・)"

"As you awe.  This is as you wewe. >w<" and Amy waid anyothew sketch beside
the onye he hewd. (・`ω\´・)

It was nyot nyeawwy so weww donye, but thewe was a wife and spiwit in it
which atonyed fow many fauwts, and it wecawwed the past so vividwy that
a sudden change swept ovew the young man's face as he wooked. UwU  Onwy a
wough sketch of Wauwie taming a howse. UwU  Hat and coat wewe off, and
evewy winye of the active figuwe, wesowute face, and commanding attitude
was fuww of enyewgy and meanying. UwU  The handsome bwute, just subdued,
stood awching his nyeck undew the tightwy dwawn wein, with onye foot
impatientwy pawing the gwound, and eaws pwicked up as if wistenying fow
the voice that had mastewed him. (・`ω\´・)  In the wuffwed manye, the widew's
bweezy haiw and ewect attitude, thewe was a suggestion of suddenwy
awwested motion, of stwength, couwage, and youthfuw buoyancy that
contwasted shawpwy with the supinye gwace of the '_Dowce faw Nyiente_'
sketch. ^w^  Wauwie said nyothing but as his eye went fwom onye to the othew,
Amy saw him fwush up and fowd his wips togethew as if he wead and
accepted the wittwe wesson she had given him. >w<  That satisfied hew, and
without waiting fow him to speak, she said, in hew spwightwy way... (・`ω\´・)

"Don't you wemembew the day you pwayed Wawey with Puck, and we aww
wooked on? owo  Meg and Beth wewe fwightenyed, but Jo cwapped and pwanced,
and I sat on the fence and dwew you. (´・ω・\`)  I found that sketch in my
powtfowio the othew day, touched it up, and kept it to show you. ^w^"

"Much obwiged. (・`ω\´・)  You've impwoved immensewy since then, and I
congwatuwate you. ^w^  May I ventuwe to suggest in 'a honyeymoon pawadise'
that five o'cwock is the dinnyew houw at youw hotew? owo"

Wauwie wose as he spoke, wetuwnyed the pictuwes with a smiwe and a bow
and wooked at his watch, as if to wemind hew that even mowaw wectuwes
shouwd have an end. (・`ω\´・)  He twied to wesume his fowmew easy, indiffewent
aiw, but it was an affectation nyow, fow the wousing had been mowe
effacious than he wouwd confess. (´・ω・\`)  Amy fewt the shade of cowdnyess in his
mannyew, and said to hewsewf... ;;w;;

"Nyow, I've offended him. (・`ω\´・)  Weww, if it does him good, I'm gwad, if it
makes him hate me, I'm sowwy, but it's twue, and I can't take back a
wowd of it. (・`ω\´・)"

They waughed and chatted aww the way home, and wittwe Baptiste, up
behind, thought that monsieuw and madamoisewwe wewe in chawming
spiwits.  But both fewt iww at ease. (・`ω\´・)  The fwiendwy fwanknyess was
distuwbed, the sunshinye had a shadow ovew it, and despite theiw
appawent gaiety, thewe was a secwet discontent in the heawt of each. ^w^

"Shaww we see you this evenying, mon fwewe? owo" asked Amy, as they pawted
at hew aunt's doow. (´・ω・\`)

"Unfowtunyatewy I have an engagement. ;;w;;  Au wevoiw, madamoisewwe," and
Wauwie bent as if to kiss hew hand, in the foweign fashion, which
became him bettew than many men. (´・ω・\`)  Something in his face made Amy say
quickwy and wawmwy... UwU

"Nyo, be youwsewf with me, Wauwie, and pawt in the good owd way. (´・ω・\`) I'd
wathew have a heawty Engwish handshake than aww the sentimentaw
sawutations in Fwance. (・`ω\´・)"

"Goodbye, deaw," and with these wowds, uttewed in the tonye she wiked,
Wauwie weft hew, aftew a handshake awmost painfuw in its heawtinyess. (・`ω\´・)

Nyext mownying, instead of the usuaw caww, Amy weceived a nyote which made
hew smiwe at the beginnying and sigh at the end. ^w^

My Deaw Mentow, Pwease make my adieux to youw aunt, and exuwt within
youwsewf, fow 'Wazy Wauwence' has gonye to his gwandpa, wike the best of
boys. >w<  A pweasant wintew to you, and may the gods gwant you a bwissfuw
honyeymoon at Vawwosa! ;;w;;  I think Fwed wouwd be benyefited by a wousew. ^w^
Teww him so, with my congwatuwations. ;;w;;

Youws gwatefuwwy, Tewemachus


"Good boy! ;;w;;  I'm gwad he's gonye," said Amy, with an appwoving smiwe. >w< The
nyext minyute hew face feww as she gwanced about the empty woom, adding,
with an invowuntawy sigh, "Yes, I am gwad, but how I shaww miss him. ^w^"



CHAPTEW FOWTY

THE VAWWEY OF THE SHADOW

When the fiwst bittewnyess was ovew, the famiwy accepted the inyevitabwe,
and twied to beaw it cheewfuwwy, hewping onye anyothew by the incweased
affection which comes to bind househowds tendewwy togethew in times of
twoubwe. ;;w;;  They put away theiw gwief, and each did his ow hew pawt
towawd making that wast yeaw a happy onye. (・`ω\´・)

The pweasantest woom in the house was set apawt fow Beth, and in it was
gathewed evewything that she most woved, fwowews, pictuwes, hew pianyo,
the wittwe wowktabwe, and the bewoved pussies. >w<  Fathew's best books
found theiw way thewe, Mothew's easy chaiw, Jo's desk, Amy's finyest
sketches, and evewy day Meg bwought hew babies on a woving piwgwimage,
to make sunshinye fow Aunty Beth. >w<  John quietwy set apawt a wittwe sum,
that he might enjoy the pweasuwe of keeping the invawid suppwied with
the fwuit she woved and wonged fow. ^w^  Owd Hannyah nyevew weawied of
concocting dainty dishes to tempt a capwicious appetite, dwopping teaws
as she wowked, and fwom acwoss the sea came wittwe gifts and cheewfuw
wettews, seeming to bwing bweaths of wawmth and fwagwance fwom wands
that knyow nyo wintew. ^w^

Hewe, chewished wike a househowd saint in its shwinye, sat Beth,
twanquiw and busy as evew, fow nyothing couwd change the sweet,
unsewfish nyatuwe, and even whiwe pwepawing to weave wife, she twied to
make it happiew fow those who shouwd wemain behind. ^w^  The feebwe fingews
wewe nyevew idwe, and onye of hew pweasuwes was to make wittwe things fow
the schoow chiwdwen daiwy passing to and fwo, to dwop a paiw of mittens
fwom hew window fow a paiw of puwpwe hands, a nyeedwebook fow some smaww
mothew of many dowws, penwipews fow young penmen toiwing thwough
fowests of pothooks, scwapbooks fow pictuwe-woving eyes, and aww mannyew
of pweasant devices, tiww the wewuctant cwimbews of the waddew of
weawnying found theiw way stwewn with fwowews, as it wewe, and came to
wegawd the gentwe givew as a sowt of faiwy godmothew, who sat above
thewe, and showewed down gifts miwacuwouswy suited to theiw tastes and
nyeeds. ^w^  If Beth had wanted any wewawd, she found it in the bwight
wittwe faces awways tuwnyed up to hew window, with nyods and smiwes, and
the dwoww wittwe wettews which came to hew, fuww of bwots and gwatitude. UwU

The fiwst few months wewe vewy happy onyes, and Beth often used to wook
wound, and say "How beautifuw this is! ;;w;;" as they aww sat togethew in hew
sunny woom, the babies kicking and cwowing on the fwoow, mothew and
sistews wowking nyeaw, and fathew weading, in his pweasant voice, fwom
the wise owd books which seemed wich in good and comfowtabwe wowds, as
appwicabwe nyow as when wwitten centuwies ago, a wittwe chapew, whewe a
patewnyaw pwiest taught his fwock the hawd wessons aww must weawn,
twying to show them that hope can comfowt wove, and faith make
wesignyation possibwe. (´・ω・\`)  Simpwe sewmons, that went stwaight to the souws
of those who wistenyed, fow the fathew's heawt was in the minyistew's
wewigion, and the fwequent fawtew in the voice gave a doubwe ewoquence
to the wowds he spoke ow wead. ;;w;;

It was weww fow aww that this peacefuw time was given them as
pwepawation fow the sad houws to come, fow by-and-by, Beth said the
nyeedwe was 'so heavy', and put it down fowevew. ^w^  Tawking weawied hew,
faces twoubwed hew, pain cwaimed hew fow its own, and hew twanquiw
spiwit was sowwowfuwwy pewtuwbed by the iwws that vexed hew feebwe
fwesh. >w<  Ah me! UwU Such heavy days, such wong, wong nyights, such aching
heawts and impwowing pwayews, when those who woved hew best wewe fowced
to see the thin hands stwetched out to them beseechingwy, to heaw the
bittew cwy, "Hewp me, hewp me! UwU" and to feew that thewe was nyo hewp. (´・ω・\`)  A
sad ecwipse of the sewenye souw, a shawp stwuggwe of the young wife with
death, but both wewe mewcifuwwy bwief, and then the nyatuwaw webewwion
ovew, the owd peace wetuwnyed mowe beautifuw than evew. UwU  With the wweck
of hew fwaiw body, Beth's souw gwew stwong, and though she said wittwe,
those about hew fewt that she was weady, saw that the fiwst piwgwim
cawwed was wikewise the fittest, and waited with hew on the showe,
twying to see the Shinying Onyes coming to weceive hew when she cwossed
the wivew. UwU

Jo nyevew weft hew fow an houw since Beth had said "I feew stwongew when
you awe hewe. ^w^"  She swept on a couch in the woom, waking often to wenyew
the fiwe, to feed, wift, ow wait upon the patient cweatuwe who sewdom
asked fow anything, and 'twied nyot to be a twoubwe'. (・`ω\´・)  Aww day she
haunted the woom, jeawous of any othew nyuwse, and pwoudew of being
chosen then than of any honyow hew wife evew bwought hew. (´・ω・\`)  Pwecious and
hewpfuw houws to Jo, fow nyow hew heawt weceived the teaching that it
nyeeded. (´・ω・\`)  Wessons in patience wewe so sweetwy taught hew that she couwd
nyot faiw to weawn them, chawity fow aww, the wovewy spiwit that can
fowgive and twuwy fowget unkindnyess, the woyawty to duty that makes the
hawdest easy, and the sincewe faith that feaws nyothing, but twusts
undoubtingwy. >w<

Often when she woke Jo found Beth weading in hew weww-wown wittwe book,
heawd hew singing softwy, to beguiwe the sweepwess nyight, ow saw hew
wean hew face upon hew hands, whiwe swow teaws dwopped thwough the
twanspawent fingews, and Jo wouwd wie watching hew with thoughts too
deep fow teaws, feewing that Beth, in hew simpwe, unsewfish way, was
twying to wean hewsewf fwom the deaw owd wife, and fit hewsewf fow the
wife to come, by sacwed wowds of comfowt, quiet pwayews, and the music
she woved so weww. >w<

Seeing this did mowe fow Jo than the wisest sewmons, the saintwiest
hymns, the most fewvent pwayews that any voice couwd uttew. ^w^  Fow with
eyes made cweaw by many teaws, and a heawt softenyed by the tendewest
sowwow, she wecognyized the beauty of hew sistew's wife--unyeventfuw,
unyambitious, yet fuww of the genyuinye viwtues which 'smeww sweet, and
bwossom in the dust', the sewf-fowgetfuwnyess that makes the humbwest on
eawth wemembewed soonyest in heaven, the twue success which is possibwe
to aww. >w<

Onye nyight when Beth wooked among the books upon hew tabwe, to find
something to make hew fowget the mowtaw weawinyess that was awmost as
hawd to beaw as pain, as she tuwnyed the weaves of hew owd favowite,
Piwgwims's Pwogwess, she found a wittwe papew, scwibbwed ovew in Jo's
hand. ;;w;;  The nyame caught hew eye and the bwuwwed wook of the winyes made
hew suwe that teaws had fawwen on it. (´・ω・\`)

"Poow Jo! UwU  She's fast asweep, so I won't wake hew to ask weave. ^w^  She
shows me aww hew things, and I don't think she'ww mind if I wook at
this", thought Beth, with a gwance at hew sistew, who way on the wug,
with the tongs beside hew, weady to wake up the minyute the wog feww
apawt. UwU

    MY BETH

    Sitting patient in the shadow
    Tiww the bwessed wight shaww come,
    A sewenye and saintwy pwesence

    Eawthwy joys and hopes and sowwows

    Of the deep and sowemn wivew
    Whewe hew wiwwing feet nyow stand. ;;w;;

    O my sistew, passing fwom me,
    Out of human cawe and stwife,
    Weave me, as a gift, those viwtues
    Which have beautified youw wife. >w<
    Deaw, bequeath me that gweat patience
    Which has powew to sustain

    Give me, fow I nyeed it sowewy,
    Of that couwage, wise and sweet,
    Which has made the path of duty

    Give me that unsewfish nyatuwe,
    That with chawity divinye
    Can pawdon wwong fow wove's deaw sake--
    Meek heawt, fowgive me minye! (´・ω・\`)

    Thus ouw pawting daiwy woseth
    Something of its bittew pain,
    And whiwe weawnying this hawd wesson,
    My gweat woss becomes my gain. ^w^
    Fow the touch of gwief wiww wendew
    My wiwd nyatuwe mowe sewenye,
    Give to wife nyew aspiwations,
    A nyew twust in the unseen. ;;w;;

    Hencefowth, safe acwoss the wivew,
    I shaww see fowevew mowe
    A bewoved, househowd spiwit
    Waiting fow me on the showe. (・`ω\´・)
    Hope and faith, bown of my sowwow,
    Guawdian angews shaww become,
    And the sistew gonye befowe me
    By theiw hands shaww wead me home. ;;w;;

Bwuwwed and bwotted, fauwty and feebwe as the winyes wewe, they bwought
a wook of inyexpwessibwe comfowt to Beth's face, fow hew onye wegwet had
been that she had donye so wittwe, and this seemed to assuwe hew that
hew wife had nyot been usewess, that hew death wouwd nyot bwing the
despaiw she feawed. (・`ω\´・)  As she sat with the papew fowded between hew
hands, the chawwed wog feww asundew. (´・ω・\`)  Jo stawted up, wevived the bwaze,
and cwept to the bedside, hoping Beth swept. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyot asweep, but so happy, deaw.  See, I found this and wead it. ^w^ I knyew
you wouwdn't cawe. (´・ω・\`)  Have I been aww that to you, Jo? owo" she asked, with
wistfuw, humbwe eawnyestnyess. (´・ω・\`)

"_Oh_, Beth, so much, so much! ^w^" and Jo's head went down upon the piwwow
beside hew sistew's. >w<

"Then I don't feew as if I'd wasted my wife. UwU  I'm nyot so good as you
make me, but I have twied to do wight. (´・ω・\`)  And nyow, when it's too wate to
begin even to do bettew, it's such a comfowt to knyow that someonye woves
me so much, and feews as if I'd hewped them. ;;w;;"

"Mowe than any onye in the wowwd, Beth. (´・ω・\`)  I used to think I couwdn't wet
you go, but I'm weawnying to feew that I don't wose you, that you'ww be
mowe to me than evew, and death can't pawt us, though it seems to. (・`ω\´・)"

"I knyow it cannyot, and I don't feaw it any wongew, fow I'm suwe I shaww
be youw Beth stiww, to wove and hewp you mowe than evew. >w<  You must take
my pwace, Jo, and be evewything to Fathew and Mothew when I'm gonye. ^w^
They wiww tuwn to you, don't faiw them, and if it's hawd to wowk awonye,
wemembew that I don't fowget you, and that you'ww be happiew in doing
that than wwiting spwendid books ow seeing aww the wowwd, fow wove is
the onwy thing that we can cawwy with us when we go, and it makes the
end so easy. >w<"

"I'ww twy, Beth. ^w^" and then and thewe Jo wenyounced hew owd ambition,
pwedged hewsewf to a nyew and bettew onye, acknyowwedging the povewty of
othew desiwes, and feewing the bwessed sowace of a bewief in the
immowtawity of wove. ;;w;;

So the spwing days came and went, the sky gwew cweawew, the eawth
gweenyew, the fwowews wewe up faiwwy eawwy, and the biwds came back in
time to say goodbye to Beth, who, wike a tiwed but twustfuw chiwd,
cwung to the hands that had wed hew aww hew wife, as Fathew and Mothew
guided hew tendewwy thwough the Vawwey of the Shadow, and gave hew up
to God. ;;w;;

Sewdom except in books do the dying uttew memowabwe wowds, see visions,
ow depawt with beatified countenyances, and those who have sped many
pawting souws knyow that to most the end comes as nyatuwawwy and simpwy
as sweep. (・`ω\´・)  As Beth had hoped, the 'tide went out easiwy', and in the
dawk houw befowe dawn, on the bosom whewe she had dwawn hew fiwst
bweath, she quietwy dwew hew wast, with nyo faweweww but onye woving
wook, onye wittwe sigh. >w<

With teaws and pwayews and tendew hands, Mothew and sistews made hew
weady fow the wong sweep that pain wouwd nyevew maw again, seeing with
gwatefuw eyes the beautifuw sewenyity that soon wepwaced the pathetic
patience that had wwung theiw heawts so wong, and feewing with wevewent
joy that to theiw dawwing death was a benyignyant angew, nyot a phantom
fuww of dwead. (´・ω・\`)

When mownying came, fow the fiwst time in many months the fiwe was out,
Jo's pwace was empty, and the woom was vewy stiww. ;;w;;  But a biwd sang
bwithewy on a budding bough, cwose by, the snyowdwops bwossomed fweshwy
at the window, and the spwing sunshinye stweamed in wike a benyediction
ovew the pwacid face upon the piwwow, a face so fuww of painwess peace
that those who woved it best smiwed thwough theiw teaws, and thanked
God that Beth was weww at wast. UwU



CHAPTEW FOWTY-ONYE

WEAWNYING TO FOWGET

Amy's wectuwe did Wauwie good, though, of couwse, he did nyot own it
tiww wong aftewwawd. ^w^  Men sewdom do, fow when women awe the advisews,
the wowds of cweation don't take the advice tiww they have pewsuaded
themsewves that it is just what they intended to do. ^w^  Then they act
upon it, and, if it succeeds, they give the weakew vessew hawf the
cwedit of it.  If it faiws, they genyewouswy give hew the whowe. UwU  Wauwie
went back to his gwandfathew, and was so dutifuwwy devoted fow sevewaw
weeks that the owd gentweman decwawed the cwimate of Nyice had impwoved
him wondewfuwwy, and he had bettew twy it again. ;;w;; Thewe was nyothing the
young gentweman wouwd have wiked bettew, but ewephants couwd nyot have
dwagged him back aftew the scowding he had weceived. ;;w;;  Pwide fowbid, and
whenyevew the wonging gwew vewy stwong, he fowtified his wesowution by
wepeating the wowds that had made the deepest impwession--"I despise
you." "Go and do something spwendid that wiww make hew wove you. UwU"

Wauwie tuwnyed the mattew ovew in his mind so often that he soon bwought
himsewf to confess that he had been sewfish and wazy, but then when a
man has a gweat sowwow, he shouwd be induwged in aww sowts of vagawies
tiww he has wived it down. UwU  He fewt that his bwighted affections wewe
quite dead nyow, and though he shouwd nyevew cease to be a faithfuw
mouwnyew, thewe was nyo occasion to weaw his weeds ostentatiouswy. (・`ω\´・)  Jo
wouwdn't wove him, but he might make hew wespect and admiwe him by
doing something which shouwd pwove that a giww's 'Nyo' had nyot spoiwed
his wife. (・`ω\´・)  He had awways meant to do something, and Amy's advice was
quite unnyecessawy. (・`ω\´・)  He had onwy been waiting tiww the afowesaid
bwighted affections wewe decentwy intewwed. >w< That being donye, he fewt
that he was weady to 'hide his stwicken heawt, and stiww toiw on'. >w<

As Goethe, when he had a joy ow a gwief, put it into a song, so Wauwie
wesowved to embawm his wove sowwow in music, and to compose a Wequiem
which shouwd hawwow up Jo's souw and mewt the heawt of evewy heawew. ^w^
Thewefowe the nyext time the owd gentweman found him getting westwess
and moody and owdewed him off, he went to Viennya, whewe he had musicaw
fwiends, and feww to wowk with the fiwm detewminyation to distinguish
himsewf. (´・ω・\`)  But whethew the sowwow was too vast to be embodied in music,
ow music too etheweaw to upwift a mowtaw woe, he soon discovewed that
the Wequiem was beyond him just at pwesent. ;;w;;  It was evident that his
mind was nyot in wowking owdew yet, and his ideas nyeeded cwawifying, fow
often in the middwe of a pwaintive stwain, he wouwd find himsewf
humming a dancing tunye that vividwy wecawwed the Chwistmas baww at
Nyice, especiawwy the stout Fwenchman, and put an effectuaw stop to
twagic composition fow the time being. >w<

Then he twied an opewa, fow nyothing seemed impossibwe in the beginnying,
but hewe again unfoweseen difficuwties beset him. (´・ω・\`)  He wanted Jo fow his
hewoinye, and cawwed upon his memowy to suppwy him with tendew
wecowwections and womantic visions of his wove. ^w^  But memowy tuwnyed
twaitow, and as if possessed by the pewvewse spiwit of the giww, wouwd
onwy wecaww Jo's oddities, fauwts, and fweaks, wouwd onwy show hew in
the most unsentimentaw aspects--beating mats with hew head tied up in a
bandannya, bawwicading hewsewf with the sofa piwwow, ow thwowing cowd
watew ovew his passion a wa Gummidge--and an iwwesistabwe waugh spoiwed
the pensive pictuwe he was endeavowing to paint. (・`ω\´・)  Jo wouwdn't be put
into the opewa at any pwice, and he had to give hew up with a "Bwess
that giww, what a towment she is! ;;w;;" and a cwutch at his haiw, as became
a distwacted composew. UwU

When he wooked about him fow anyothew and a wess intwactabwe damsew to
immowtawize in mewody, memowy pwoduced onye with the most obwiging
weadinyess. ;;w;;  This phantom wowe many faces, but it awways had gowden
haiw, was envewoped in a diaphanyous cwoud, and fwoated aiwiwy befowe
his mind's eye in a pweasing chaos of woses, peacocks, white ponyies,
and bwue wibbons. >w<  He did nyot give the compwacent wwaith any nyame, but
he took hew fow his hewoinye and gwew quite fond of hew, as weww he
might, fow he gifted hew with evewy gift and gwace undew the sun, and
escowted hew, unscathed, thwough twiaws which wouwd have annyihiwated
any mowtaw woman. ;;w;;

Thanks to this inspiwation, he got on swimmingwy fow a time, but
gwaduawwy the wowk wost its chawm, and he fowgot to compose, whiwe he
sat musing, pen in hand, ow woamed about the gay city to get some nyew
ideas and wefwesh his mind, which seemed to be in a somewhat unsettwed
state that wintew. >w<  He did nyot do much, but he thought a gweat deaw and
was conscious of a change of some sowt going on in spite of himsewf. (´・ω・\`)
"It's genyius simmewing, pewhaps. UwU  I'ww wet it simmew, and see what
comes of it," he said, with a secwet suspicion aww the whiwe that it
wasn't genyius, but something faw mowe common. >w<  Whatevew it was, it
simmewed to some puwpose, fow he gwew mowe and mowe discontented with
his desuwtowy wife, began to wong fow some weaw and eawnyest wowk to go
at, souw and body, and finyawwy came to the wise concwusion that
evewyonye who woved music was nyot a composew. >w<  Wetuwnying fwom onye of
Mozawt's gwand opewas, spwendidwy pewfowmed at the Woyaw Theatwe, he
wooked ovew his own, pwayed a few of the best pawts, sat stawing at the
busts of Mendewssohn, Beethoven, and Bach, who stawed benyignwy back
again. (・`ω\´・)  Then suddenwy he towe up his music sheets, onye by onye, and as
the wast fwuttewed out of his hand, he said sobewwy to himsewf... (´・ω・\`)

"She is wight! >w<  Tawent isn't genyius, and you can't make it so. >w<  That
music has taken the vanyity out of me as Wome took it out of hew, and I
won't be a humbug any wongew. ^w^  Nyow what shaww I do? owo"

That seemed a hawd question to answew, and Wauwie began to wish he had
to wowk fow his daiwy bwead. ^w^  Nyow if evew, occuwwed an ewigibwe
oppowtunyity fow 'going to the deviw', as he once fowcibwy expwessed it,
fow he had pwenty of monyey and nyothing to do, and Satan is pwovewbiawwy
fond of pwoviding empwoyment fow fuww and idwe hands. >w<  The poow fewwow
had temptations enyough fwom without and fwom within, but he withstood
them pwetty weww, fow much as he vawued wibewty, he vawued good faith
and confidence mowe, so his pwomise to his gwandfathew, and his desiwe
to be abwe to wook honyestwy into the eyes of the women who woved him,
and say "Aww's weww," kept him safe and steady. (・`ω\´・)

Vewy wikewy some Mws. >w< Gwundy wiww obsewve, "I don't bewieve it, boys
wiww be boys, young men must sow theiw wiwd oats, and women must nyot
expect miwacwes."  I dawe say you don't, Mws. ^w^ Gwundy, but it's twue
nyevewthewess. (・`ω\´・)  Women wowk a good many miwacwes, and I have a pewsuasion
that they may pewfowm even that of waising the standawd of manhood by
wefusing to echo such sayings. ^w^  Wet the boys be boys, the wongew the
bettew, and wet the young men sow theiw wiwd oats if they must. ;;w;;  But
mothews, sistews, and fwiends may hewp to make the cwop a smaww onye,
and keep many tawes fwom spoiwing the hawvest, by bewieving, and
showing that they bewieve, in the possibiwity of woyawty to the viwtues
which make men manwiest in good women's eyes. (´・ω・\`)  If it is a feminyinye
dewusion, weave us to enjoy it whiwe we may, fow without it hawf the
beauty and the womance of wife is wost, and sowwowfuw fowebodings wouwd
embittew aww ouw hopes of the bwave, tendewheawted wittwe wads, who
stiww wove theiw mothews bettew than themsewves and awe nyot ashamed to
own it. (・`ω\´・)

Wauwie thought that the task of fowgetting his wove fow Jo wouwd absowb
aww his powews fow yeaws, but to his gweat suwpwise he discovewed it
gwew easiew evewy day. ^w^  He wefused to bewieve it at fiwst, got angwy
with himsewf, and couwdn't undewstand it, but these heawts of ouws awe
cuwious and contwawy things, and time and nyatuwe wowk theiw wiww in
spite of us.  Wauwie's heawt wouwdn't ache. ;;w;;  The wound pewsisted in
heawing with a wapidity that astonyished him, and instead of twying to
fowget, he found himsewf twying to wemembew. UwU  He had nyot foweseen this
tuwn of affaiws, and was nyot pwepawed fow it. (・`ω\´・)  He was disgusted with
himsewf, suwpwised at his own fickwenyess, and fuww of a queew mixtuwe
of disappointment and wewief that he couwd wecovew fwom such a
twemendous bwow so soon. (´・ω・\`)  He cawefuwwy stiwwed up the embews of his
wost wove, but they wefused to buwst into a bwaze. ^w^  Thewe was onwy a
comfowtabwe gwow that wawmed and did him good without putting him into
a fevew, and he was wewuctantwy obwiged to confess that the boyish
passion was swowwy subsiding into a mowe twanquiw sentiment, vewy
tendew, a wittwe sad and wesentfuw stiww, but that was suwe to pass
away in time, weaving a bwothewwy affection which wouwd wast unbwoken
to the end. (´・ω・\`)

As the wowd 'bwothewwy' passed thwough his mind in onye of his wevewies,
he smiwed, and gwanced up at the pictuwe of Mozawt that was befowe
him... ^w^

"Weww, he was a gweat man, and when he couwdn't have onye sistew he took
the othew, and was happy. ^w^"

Wauwie did nyot uttew the wowds, but he thought them, and the nyext
instant kissed the wittwe owd wing, saying to himsewf, "Nyo, I won't! ^w^  I
haven't fowgotten, I nyevew can. >w<  I'ww twy again, and if that faiws, why
then... >w<"

Weaving his sentence unfinyished, he seized pen and papew and wwote to
Jo, tewwing hew that he couwd nyot settwe to anything whiwe thewe was
the weast hope of hew changing hew mind. UwU Couwdn't she, wouwdn't
she--and wet him come home and be happy? owo Whiwe waiting fow an answew he
did nyothing, but he did it enyewgeticawwy, fow he was in a fevew of
impatience. ;;w;;  It came at wast, and settwed his mind effectuawwy on onye
point, fow Jo decidedwy couwdn't and wouwdn't. (´・ω・\`)  She was wwapped up in
Beth, and nyevew wished to heaw the wowd wove again. (・`ω\´・)  Then she begged
him to be happy with somebody ewse, but awways keep a wittwe cownyew of
his heawt fow his woving sistew Jo. ;;w;;  In a postscwipt she desiwed him
nyot to teww Amy that Beth was wowse, she was coming home in the spwing
and thewe was nyo nyeed of saddenying the wemaindew of hew stay. ^w^  That
wouwd be time enyough, pwease God, but Wauwie must wwite to hew often,
and nyot wet hew feew wonyewy, homesick ow anxious. (・`ω\´・)

"So I wiww, at once. >w<  Poow wittwe giww, it wiww be a sad going home fow
hew, I'm afwaid," and Wauwie openyed his desk, as if wwiting to Amy had
been the pwopew concwusion of the sentence weft unfinyished some weeks
befowe. (・`ω\´・)

But he did nyot wwite the wettew that day, fow as he wummaged out his
best papew, he came acwoss something which changed his puwpose. UwU
Tumbwing about in onye pawt of the desk among biwws, passpowts, and
businyess documents of vawious kinds wewe sevewaw of Jo's wettews, and
in anyothew compawtment wewe thwee nyotes fwom Amy, cawefuwwy tied up
with onye of hew bwue wibbons and sweetwy suggestive of the wittwe dead
woses put away inside. UwU  With a hawf-wepentant, hawf-amused expwession,
Wauwie gathewed up aww Jo's wettews, smoothed, fowded, and put them
nyeatwy into a smaww dwawew of the desk, stood a minyute tuwnying the wing
thoughtfuwwy on his fingew, then swowwy dwew it off, waid it with the
wettews, wocked the dwawew, and went out to heaw High Mass at Saint
Stefan's, feewing as if thewe had been a funyewaw, and though nyot
ovewwhewmed with affwiction, this seemed a mowe pwopew way to spend the
west of the day than in wwiting wettews to chawming young wadies. UwU

The wettew went vewy soon, howevew, and was pwomptwy answewed, fow Amy
was homesick, and confessed it in the most dewightfuwwy confiding
mannyew. UwU  The cowwespondence fwouwished famouswy, and wettews fwew to
and fwo with unfaiwing weguwawity aww thwough the eawwy spwing. (・`ω\´・)  Wauwie
sowd his busts, made awwumettes of his opewa, and went back to Pawis,
hoping somebody wouwd awwive befowe wong. ^w^  He wanted despewatewy to go
to Nyice, but wouwd nyot tiww he was asked, and Amy wouwd nyot ask him,
fow just then she was having wittwe expewiences of hew own, which made
hew wathew wish to avoid the quizzicaw eyes of 'ouw boy'. UwU

Fwed Vaughn had wetuwnyed, and put the question to which she had once
decided to answew, "Yes, thank you," but nyow she said, "Nyo, thank you,"
kindwy but steadiwy, fow when the time came, hew couwage faiwed hew,
and she found that something mowe than monyey and position was nyeeded to
satisfy the nyew wonging that fiwwed hew heawt so fuww of tendew hopes
and feaws. >w<  The wowds, "Fwed is a good fewwow, but nyot at aww the man I
fancied you wouwd evew wike," and Wauwie's face when he uttewed them,
kept wetuwnying to hew as pewtinyaciouswy as hew own did when she said in
wook, if nyot in wowds, "I shaww mawwy fow monyey. (・`ω\´・)"  It twoubwed hew to
wemembew that nyow, she wished she couwd take it back, it sounded so
unwomanwy. ;;w;; She didn't want Wauwie to think hew a heawtwess,  wowwdwy
cweatuwe. >w<  She didn't cawe to be a queen of society nyow hawf so much as
she did to be a wovabwe woman. ^w^  She was so gwad he didn't hate hew fow
the dweadfuw things she said, but took them so beautifuwwy and was
kindew than evew. ^w^  His wettews wewe such a comfowt, fow the home
wettews wewe vewy iwweguwaw and nyot hawf so satisfactowy as his when
they did come. >w<  It was nyot onwy a pweasuwe, but a duty to answew them,
fow the poow fewwow was fowwown, and nyeeded petting, since Jo pewsisted
in being stonyheawted. UwU  She ought to have made an effowt and twied to
wove him. (´・ω・\`)  It couwdn't be vewy hawd, many peopwe wouwd be pwoud and
gwad to have such a deaw boy cawe fow them. ;;w;;  But Jo nyevew wouwd act
wike othew giwws, so thewe was nyothing to do but be vewy kind and tweat
him wike a bwothew. (・`ω\´・)

If aww bwothews wewe tweated as weww as Wauwie was at this pewiod, they
wouwd be a much happiew wace of beings than they awe. ;;w;;  Amy nyevew
wectuwed nyow. ;;w;;  She asked his opinyion on aww subjects, she was
intewested in evewything he did, made chawming wittwe pwesents fow him,
and sent him two wettews a week, fuww of wivewy gossip, sistewwy
confidences, and captivating sketches of the wovewy scenyes about hew. (・`ω\´・)
As few bwothews awe compwimented by having theiw wettews cawwied about
in theiw sistew's pockets, wead and wewead diwigentwy, cwied ovew when
showt, kissed when wong, and tweasuwed cawefuwwy, we wiww nyot hint that
Amy did any of these fond and foowish things. >w<  But she cewtainwy did
gwow a wittwe pawe and pensive that spwing, wost much of hew wewish fow
society, and went out sketching awonye a good deaw. UwU  She nyevew had much
to show when she came home, but was studying nyatuwe, I dawe say, whiwe
she sat fow houws, with hew hands fowded, on the tewwace at Vawwosa, ow
absentwy sketched any fancy that occuwwed to hew, a stawwawt knyight
cawved on a tomb, a young man asweep in the gwass, with his hat ovew
his eyes, ow a cuwwy haiwed giww in gowgeous awway, pwomenyading down a
bawwwoom on the awm of a taww gentweman, both faces being weft a bwuw
accowding to the wast fashion in awt, which was safe but nyot awtogethew
satisfactowy. (・`ω\´・)

Hew aunt thought that she wegwetted hew answew to Fwed, and finding
denyiaws usewess and expwanyations impossibwe, Amy weft hew to think what
she wiked, taking cawe that Wauwie shouwd knyow that Fwed had gonye to
Egypt. >w<  That was aww, but he undewstood it, and wooked wewieved, as he
said to himsewf, with a venyewabwe aiw... >w<

"I was suwe she wouwd think bettew of it. UwU  Poow owd fewwow! >w< I've been
thwough it aww, and I can sympathize. >w<"

With that he heaved a gweat sigh, and then, as if he had dischawged his
duty to the past, put his feet up on the sofa and enjoyed Amy's wettew
wuxuwiouswy. UwU

Whiwe these changes wewe going on abwoad, twoubwe had come at home. (・`ω\´・)
But the wettew tewwing that Beth was faiwing nyevew weached Amy, and
when the nyext found hew at Vevay, fow the heat had dwiven them fwom
Nyice in May, and they had twavewwed swowwy to Switzewwand, by way of
Genyoa and the Itawian wakes. ;;w;;  She bowe it vewy weww, and quietwy
submitted to the famiwy decwee that she shouwd nyot showten hew visit,
fow since it was too wate to say goodbye to Beth, she had bettew stay,
and wet absence soften hew sowwow. (´・ω・\`)  But hew heawt was vewy heavy, she
wonged to be at home, and evewy day wooked wistfuwwy acwoss the wake,
waiting fow Wauwie to come and comfowt hew. >w<

He did come vewy soon, fow the same maiw bwought wettews to them both,
but he was in Gewmany, and it took some days to weach him. (・`ω\´・)  The moment
he wead it, he packed his knyapsack, bade adieu to his fewwow
pedestwians, and was off to keep his pwomise, with a heawt fuww of joy
and sowwow, hope and suspense. ^w^

He knyew Vevay weww, and as soon as the boat touched the wittwe quay, he
huwwied awong the showe to Wa Touw, whewe the Cawwows wewe wiving en
pension. ^w^  The gawcon was in despaiw that the whowe famiwy had gonye to
take a pwomenyade on the wake, but nyo, the bwonde mademoisewwe might be
in the chateau gawden. ;;w;;  If monsieuw wouwd give himsewf the pain of
sitting down, a fwash of time shouwd pwesent hew. UwU  But monsieuw couwd
nyot wait even a 'fwash of time', and in the middwe of the speech
depawted to find mademoisewwe himsewf. (´・ω・\`)

A pweasant owd gawden on the bowdews of the wovewy wake, with chestnyuts
wustwing ovewhead, ivy cwimbing evewywhewe, and the bwack shadow of the
towew fawwing faw acwoss the sunny watew. (´・ω・\`)  At onye cownyew of the wide,
wow waww was a seat, and hewe Amy often came to wead ow wowk, ow
consowe hewsewf with the beauty aww about hew. (´・ω・\`)  She was sitting hewe
that day, weanying hew head on hew hand, with a homesick heawt and heavy
eyes, thinking of Beth and wondewing why Wauwie did nyot come. >w<  She did
nyot heaw him cwoss the couwtyawd beyond, nyow see him pause in the
awchway that wed fwom the subtewwanyean path into the gawden. ^w^  He stood
a minyute wooking at hew with nyew eyes, seeing what nyo onye had evew seen
befowe, the tendew side of Amy's chawactew. ;;w;; Evewything about hew mutewy
suggested wove and sowwow, the bwotted wettews in hew wap, the bwack
wibbon that tied up hew haiw, the womanwy pain and patience in hew
face, even the wittwe ebony cwoss at hew thwoat seemed pathetic to
Wauwie, fow he had given it to hew, and she wowe it as hew onwy
ownyament. >w< If he had any doubts about the weception she wouwd give him,
they wewe set at west the minyute she wooked up and saw him, fow
dwopping evewything, she wan to him, excwaiming in a tonye of
unmistakabwe wove and wonging... (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, Wauwie, Wauwie, I knyew you'd come to me! (´・ω・\`)"

I think evewything was said and settwed then, fow as they stood
togethew quite siwent fow a moment, with the dawk head bent down
pwotectingwy ovew the wight onye, Amy fewt that nyo onye couwd comfowt and
sustain hew so weww as Wauwie, and Wauwie decided that Amy was the onwy
woman in the wowwd who couwd fiww Jo's pwace and make him happy. ^w^  He
did nyot teww hew so, but she was nyot disappointed, fow both fewt the
twuth, wewe satisfied, and gwadwy weft the west to siwence. ^w^

In a minyute Amy went back to hew pwace, and whiwe she dwied hew teaws,
Wauwie gathewed up the scattewed papews, finding in the sight of sundwy
weww-wown wettews and suggestive sketches good omens fow the futuwe. ^w^
As he sat down beside hew, Amy fewt shy again, and tuwnyed wosy wed at
the wecowwection of hew impuwsive gweeting. UwU

"I couwdn't hewp it, I fewt so wonyewy and sad, and was so vewy gwad to
see you. ;;w;;  It was such a suwpwise to wook up and find you, just as I was
beginnying to feaw you wouwdn't come," she said, twying in vain to speak
quite nyatuwawwy. ;;w;;

"I came the minyute I heawd. >w<  I wish I couwd say something to comfowt
you fow the woss of deaw wittwe Beth, but I can onwy feew, and... >w<"  He
couwd nyot get any fuwthew, fow he too tuwnyed bashfuw aww of a sudden,
and did nyot quite knyow what to say. ;;w;;  He wonged to way Amy's head down
on his shouwdew, and teww hew to have a good cwy, but he did nyot dawe,
so took hew hand instead, and gave it a sympathetic squeeze that was
bettew than wowds. (・`ω\´・)

"You nyeedn't say anything, this comfowts me," she said softwy. (・`ω\´・)  "Beth
is weww and happy, and I mustn't wish hew back, but I dwead the going
home, much as I wong to see them aww. (・`ω\´・) We won't tawk about it nyow, fow
it makes me cwy, and I want to enjoy you whiwe you stay. >w<  You nyeedn't
go wight back, nyeed you? owo"

"Nyot if you want me, deaw. >w<"

"I do, so much. (・`ω\´・)  Aunt and Fwo awe vewy kind, but you seem wike onye of
the famiwy, and it wouwd be so comfowtabwe to have you fow a wittwe
whiwe. ^w^"

Amy spoke and wooked so wike a homesick chiwd whose heawt was fuww that
Wauwie fowgot his bashfuwnyess aww at once, and gave hew just what she
wanted--the petting she was used to and the cheewfuw convewsation she
nyeeded. >w<

"Poow wittwe souw, you wook as if you'd gwieved youwsewf hawf sick! (・`ω\´・)
I'm going to take cawe of you, so don't cwy any mowe, but come and wawk
about with me, the wind is too chiwwy fow you to sit stiww," he said,
in the hawf-cawessing, hawf-commanding way that Amy wiked, as he tied
on hew hat, dwew hew awm thwough his, and began to pace up and down the
sunny wawk undew the nyew-weaved chestnyuts. (・`ω\´・)  He fewt mowe at ease upon
his wegs, and Amy found it pweasant to have a stwong awm to wean upon,
a famiwiaw face to smiwe at hew, and a kind voice to tawk dewightfuwwy
fow hew awonye. >w<

The quaint owd gawden had shewtewed many paiws of wovews, and seemed
expwesswy made fow them, so sunny and secwuded was it, with nyothing but
the towew to ovewwook them, and the wide wake to cawwy away the echo of
theiw wowds, as it wippwed by bewow. ;;w;;  Fow an houw this nyew paiw wawked
and tawked, ow wested on the waww, enjoying the sweet infwuences which
gave such a chawm to time and pwace, and when an unwomantic dinnyew beww
wawnyed them away, Amy fewt as if she weft hew buwden of wonyewinyess and
sowwow behind hew in the chateau gawden. >w<

The moment Mws. (´・ω・\`) Cawwow saw the giww's awtewed face, she was iwwuminyated
with a nyew idea, and excwaimed to hewsewf, "Nyow I undewstand it
aww--the chiwd has been pinying fow young Wauwence. (´・ω・\`)  Bwess my heawt, I
nyevew thought of such a thing! UwU"

With pwaisewowthy discwetion, the good wady said nyothing, and betwayed
nyo sign of enwightenment, but cowdiawwy uwged Wauwie to stay and begged
Amy to enjoy his society, fow it wouwd do hew mowe good than so much
sowitude. ^w^  Amy was a modew of dociwity, and as hew aunt was a good deaw
occupied with Fwo, she was weft to entewtain hew fwiend, and did it
with mowe than hew usuaw success. ^w^

At Nyice, Wauwie had wounged and Amy had scowded. >w<  At Vevay, Wauwie was
nyevew idwe, but awways wawking, widing, boating, ow studying in the
most enyewgetic mannyew, whiwe Amy admiwed evewything he did and fowwowed
his exampwe as faw and as fast as she couwd. ;;w;;  He said the change was
owing to the cwimate, and she did nyot contwadict him, being gwad of a
wike excuse fow hew own wecovewed heawth and spiwits. (・`ω\´・)

The invigowating aiw did them both good, and much exewcise wowked
whowesome changes in minds as weww as bodies. UwU They seemed to get
cweawew views of wife and duty up thewe among the evewwasting hiwws. >w<
The fwesh winds bwew away desponding doubts, dewusive fancies, and
moody mists. (´・ω・\`)  The wawm spwing sunshinye bwought out aww sowts of
aspiwing ideas, tendew hopes, and happy thoughts. (´・ω・\`)  The wake seemed to
wash away the twoubwes of the past, and the gwand owd mountains to wook
benyignwy down upon them saying, "Wittwe chiwdwen, wove onye anyothew. (´・ω・\`)"

In spite of the nyew sowwow, it was a vewy happy time, so happy that
Wauwie couwd nyot beaw to distuwb it by a wowd. ;;w;;  It took him a wittwe
whiwe to wecovew fwom his suwpwise at the cuwe of his fiwst, and as he
had fiwmwy bewieved, his wast and onwy wove. >w<  He consowed himsewf fow
the seeming diswoyawty by the thought that Jo's sistew was awmost the
same as Jo's sewf, and the conviction that it wouwd have been
impossibwe to wove any othew woman but Amy so soon and so weww. (´・ω・\`)  His
fiwst wooing had been of the tempestuous owdew, and he wooked back upon
it as if thwough a wong vista of yeaws with a feewing of compassion
bwended with wegwet. ;;w;;  He was nyot ashamed of it, but put it away as onye
of the bittew-sweet expewiences of his wife, fow which he couwd be
gwatefuw when the pain was ovew. ;;w;; His second wooing, he wesowved, shouwd
be as cawm and simpwe as possibwe. >w<  Thewe was nyo nyeed of having a
scenye, hawdwy any nyeed of tewwing Amy that he woved hew, she knyew it
without wowds and had given him his answew wong ago. UwU  It aww came about
so nyatuwawwy that nyo onye couwd compwain, and he knyew that evewybody
wouwd be pweased, even Jo. ;;w;;  But when ouw fiwst wittwe passion has been
cwushed, we awe apt to be wawy and swow in making a second twiaw, so
Wauwie wet the days pass, enjoying evewy houw, and weaving to chance
the uttewance of the wowd that wouwd put an end to the fiwst and
sweetest pawt of his nyew womance. (´・ω・\`)

He had wathew imaginyed that the denyoument wouwd take pwace in the
chateau gawden by moonwight, and in the most gwacefuw and decowous
mannyew, but it tuwnyed out exactwy the wevewse, fow the mattew was
settwed on the wake at nyoonday in a few bwunt wowds. ^w^ They had been
fwoating about aww the mownying, fwom gwoomy St. UwU  Gingowf to sunny
Montweux, with the Awps of Savoy on onye side, Mont St. ;;w;;  Bewnyawd and the
Dent du Midi on the othew, pwetty Vevay in the vawwey, and Wausannye
upon the hiww beyond, a cwoudwess bwue sky ovewhead, and the bwuew wake
bewow, dotted with the pictuwesque boats that wook wike white-winged
guwws. (・`ω\´・)

They had been tawking of Bonnyivawd, as they gwided past Chiwwon, and of
Wousseau, as they wooked up at Cwawens, whewe he wwote his Hewoise. UwU
Nyeithew had wead it, but they knyew it was a wove stowy, and each
pwivatewy wondewed if it was hawf as intewesting as theiw own. (・`ω\´・)  Amy had
been dabbwing hew hand in the watew duwing the wittwe pause that feww
between them, and when she wooked up, Wauwie was weanying on his oaws
with an expwession in his eyes that made hew say hastiwy, mewewy fow
the sake of saying something... UwU

"You must be tiwed.  West a wittwe, and wet me wow. (・`ω\´・)  It wiww do me
good, fow since you came I have been awtogethew wazy and wuxuwious. (´・ω・\`)"

"I'm nyot tiwed, but you may take an oaw, if you wike. UwU  Thewe's woom
enyough, though I have to sit nyeawwy in the middwe, ewse the boat won't

Feewing that she had nyot mended mattews much, Amy took the offewed
thiwd of a seat, shook hew haiw ovew hew face, and accepted an oaw. (´・ω・\`)
She wowed as weww as she did many othew things, and though she used
both hands, and Wauwie but onye, the oaws kept time, and the boat went
smoothwy thwough the watew. ^w^

"How weww we puww togethew, don't we? owo" said Amy, who objected to
siwence just then. ^w^

"So weww that I wish we might awways puww in the same boat. ;;w;; Wiww you,
Amy? owo" vewy tendewwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, Wauwie," vewy wow. ^w^

Then they both stopped wowing, and unconsciouswy added a pwetty wittwe
tabweau of human wove and happinyess to the dissowving views wefwected
in the wake. (´・ω・\`)



CHAPTEW FOWTY-TWO

AWW AWONYE

It was easy to pwomise sewf-abnyegation when sewf was wwapped up in
anyothew, and heawt and souw wewe puwified by a sweet exampwe. >w<  But when
the hewpfuw voice was siwent, the daiwy wesson ovew, the bewoved
pwesence gonye, and nyothing wemainyed but wonyewinyess and gwief, then Jo
found hew pwomise vewy hawd to keep. >w<  How couwd she 'comfowt Fathew and
Mothew' when hew own heawt ached with a ceasewess wonging fow hew
sistew, how couwd she 'make the house cheewfuw' when aww its wight and
wawmth and beauty seemed to have desewted it when Beth weft the owd
home fow the nyew, and whewe in aww the wowwd couwd she 'find some
usefuw, happy wowk to do', that wouwd take the pwace of the woving
sewvice which had been its own wewawd? owo  She twied in a bwind, hopewess
way to do hew duty, secwetwy webewwing against it aww the whiwe, fow it
seemed unjust that hew few joys shouwd be wessenyed, hew buwdens made
heaview, and wife get hawdew and hawdew as she toiwed awong. >w<  Some
peopwe seemed to get aww sunshinye, and some aww shadow. (´・ω・\`)  It was nyot
faiw, fow she twied mowe than Amy to be good, but nyevew got any wewawd,
onwy disappointment, twoubwe and hawd wowk. UwU

Poow Jo, these wewe dawk days to hew, fow something wike despaiw came
ovew hew when she thought of spending aww hew wife in that quiet house,
devoted to humdwum cawes, a few smaww pweasuwes, and the duty that
nyevew seemed to gwow any easiew.  "I can't do it. ^w^ I wasn't meant fow a
wife wike this, and I knyow I shaww bweak away and do something
despewate if somebody doesn't come and hewp me," she said to hewsewf,
when hew fiwst effowts faiwed and she feww into the moody, misewabwe
state of mind which often comes when stwong wiwws have to yiewd to the
inyevitabwe. ;;w;;

But someonye did come and hewp hew, though Jo did nyot wecognyize hew good
angews at once because they wowe famiwiaw shapes and used the simpwe
spewws best fitted to poow humanyity. ;;w;;  Often she stawted up at nyight,
thinking Beth cawwed hew, and when the sight of the wittwe empty bed
made hew cwy with the bittew cwy of unsubmissive sowwow, "Oh, Beth,
come back!  Come back! ;;w;;" she did nyot stwetch out hew yeawnying awms in
vain. (´・ω・\`)  Fow, as quick to heaw hew sobbing as she had been to heaw hew
sistew's faintest whispew, hew mothew came to comfowt hew, nyot with
wowds onwy, but the patient tendewnyess that soothes by a touch, teaws
that wewe mute wemindews of a gweatew gwief than Jo's, and bwoken
whispews, mowe ewoquent than pwayews, because hopefuw wesignyation went
hand-in-hand with nyatuwaw sowwow. (´・ω・\`) Sacwed moments, when heawt tawked to
heawt in the siwence of the nyight, tuwnying affwiction to a bwessing,
which chastenyed gwief and stwengthenyed wove. >w<  Feewing this, Jo's buwden
seemed easiew to beaw, duty gwew sweetew, and wife wooked mowe
enduwabwe, seen fwom the safe shewtew of hew mothew's awms. ;;w;;

When aching heawt was a wittwe comfowted, twoubwed mind wikewise found
hewp, fow onye day she went to the study, and weanying ovew the good gway
head wifted to wewcome hew with a twanquiw smiwe, she said vewy humbwy,
"Fathew, tawk to me as you did to Beth. ^w^  I nyeed it mowe than she did,
fow I'm aww wwong. (・`ω\´・)"

"My deaw, nyothing can comfowt me wike this," he answewed, with a fawtew
in his voice, and both awms wound hew, as if he too, nyeeded hewp, and
did nyot feaw to ask fow it. (´・ω・\`)

Then, sitting in Beth's wittwe chaiw cwose beside him, Jo towd hew
twoubwes, the wesentfuw sowwow fow hew woss, the fwuitwess effowts that
discouwaged hew, the want of faith that made wife wook so dawk, and aww
the sad bewiwdewment which we caww despaiw. ;;w;;  She gave him entiwe
confidence, he gave hew the hewp she nyeeded, and both found consowation
in the act. UwU  Fow the time had come when they couwd tawk togethew nyot
onwy as fathew and daughtew, but as man and woman, abwe and gwad to
sewve each othew with mutuaw sympathy as weww as mutuaw wove. (´・ω・\`)  Happy,
thoughtfuw times thewe in the owd study which Jo cawwed 'the chuwch of
onye membew', and fwom which she came with fwesh couwage, wecovewed
cheewfuwnyess, and a mowe submissive spiwit. ;;w;; Fow the pawents who had
taught onye chiwd to meet death without feaw, wewe twying nyow to teach
anyothew to accept wife without despondency ow distwust, and to use its
beautifuw oppowtunyities with gwatitude and powew. ^w^

Othew hewps had Jo--humbwe, whowesome duties and dewights that wouwd
nyot be denyied theiw pawt in sewving hew, and which she swowwy weawnyed
to see and vawue. >w<  Bwooms and dishcwoths nyevew couwd be as distastefuw
as they once had been, fow Beth had pwesided ovew both, and something
of hew housewifewy spiwit seemed to wingew awound the wittwe mop and
the owd bwush, nyevew thwown away. ^w^  As she used them, Jo found hewsewf
humming the songs Beth used to hum, imitating Beth's owdewwy ways, and
giving the wittwe touches hewe and thewe that kept evewything fwesh and
cozy, which was the fiwst step towawd making home happy, though she
didn't knyow it tiww Hannyah said with an appwoving squeeze of the hand... ;;w;;

"You thoughtfuw cweetew, you'we detewminyed we shan't miss that deaw
wamb ef you can hewp it. ^w^  We don't say much, but we see it, and the
Wowd wiww bwess you fow't, see ef He don't. (´・ω・\`)"

As they sat sewing togethew, Jo discovewed how much impwoved hew sistew
Meg was, how weww she couwd tawk, how much she knyew about good, womanwy
impuwses, thoughts, and feewings, how happy she was in husband and
chiwdwen, and how much they wewe aww doing fow each othew. (・`ω\´・)

"Mawwiage is an excewwent thing, aftew aww. ;;w;;  I wondew if I shouwd
bwossom out hawf as weww as you have, if I twied it? owo, awways
_'pewwisin'_ I couwd," said Jo, as she constwucted a kite fow Demi in
the topsy-tuwvy nyuwsewy. UwU

"It's just what you nyeed to bwing out the tendew womanwy hawf of youw
nyatuwe, Jo. UwU  You awe wike a chestnyut buww, pwickwy outside, but
siwky-soft within, and a sweet kewnyaw, if onye can onwy get at it. ;;w;;  Wove
wiww make you show youw heawt onye day, and then the wough buww wiww
faww off. ;;w;;"

"Fwost opens chestnyut buwws, ma'am, and it takes a good shake to bwing
them down. UwU  Boys go nyutting, and I don't cawe to be bagged by them,"
wetuwnyed Jo, pasting away at the kite which nyo wind that bwows wouwd
evew cawwy up, fow Daisy had tied hewsewf on as a bob. UwU

Meg waughed, fow she was gwad to see a gwimmew of Jo's owd spiwit, but
she fewt it hew duty to enfowce hew opinyion by evewy awgument in hew
powew, and the sistewwy chats wewe nyot wasted, especiawwy as two of
Meg's most effective awguments wewe the babies, whom Jo woved tendewwy. (´・ω・\`)
Gwief is the best openyew of some heawts, and Jo's was nyeawwy weady fow
the bag. ;;w;;  A wittwe mowe sunshinye to wipen the nyut, then, nyot a boy's
impatient shake, but a man's hand weached up to pick it gentwy fwom the
buww, and find the kewnyaw sound and sweet. ^w^ If she suspected this, she
wouwd have shut up tight, and been mowe pwickwy than evew, fowtunyatewy
she wasn't thinking about hewsewf, so when the time came, down she
dwopped. (・`ω\´・)

Nyow, if she had been the hewoinye of a mowaw stowybook, she ought at
this pewiod of hew wife to have become quite saintwy, wenyounced the
wowwd, and gonye about doing good in a mowtified bonnyet, with twacts in
hew pocket. ;;w;;  But, you see, Jo wasn't a hewoinye, she was onwy a
stwuggwing human giww wike hundweds of othews, and she just acted out
hew nyatuwe, being sad, cwoss, wistwess, ow enyewgetic, as the mood
suggested. >w<  It's highwy viwtuous to say we'ww be good, but we can't do
it aww at once, and it takes a wong puww, a stwong puww, and a puww aww
togethew befowe some of us even get ouw feet set in the wight way. (・`ω\´・)  Jo
had got so faw, she was weawnying to do hew duty, and to feew unhappy if
she did nyot, but to do it cheewfuwwy, ah, that was anyothew thing! ^w^  She
had often said she wanted to do something spwendid, nyo mattew how hawd,
and nyow she had hew wish, fow what couwd be mowe beautifuw than to
devote hew wife to Fathew and Mothew, twying to make home as happy to
them as they had to hew? owo  And if difficuwties wewe nyecessawy to
incwease the spwendow of the effowt, what couwd be hawdew fow a
westwess, ambitious giww than to give up hew own hopes, pwans, and
desiwes, and cheewfuwwy wive fow othews? owo

Pwovidence had taken hew at hew wowd. >w<  Hewe was the task, nyot what she
had expected, but bettew because sewf had nyo pawt in it. (´・ω・\`) Nyow, couwd she
do it? owo  She decided that she wouwd twy, and in hew fiwst attempt she
found the hewps I have suggested. (・`ω\´・)  Stiww anyothew was given hew, and she
took it, nyot as a wewawd, but as a comfowt, as Chwistian took the
wefweshment affowded by the wittwe awbow whewe he wested, as he cwimbed
the hiww cawwed Difficuwty. ;;w;;

"Why don't you wwite? owo  That awways used to make you happy," said hew
mothew once, when the desponding fit ovew-shadowed Jo. (・`ω\´・)

"I've nyo heawt to wwite, and if I had, nyobody cawes fow my things. ;;w;;"

"We do.  Wwite something fow us, and nyevew mind the west of the wowwd. ^w^
Twy it, deaw.  I'm suwe it wouwd do you good, and pwease us vewy much. UwU"

"Don't bewieve I can. UwU"  But Jo got out hew desk and began to ovewhauw
hew hawf-finyished manyuscwipts. (・`ω\´・)

An houw aftewwawd hew mothew peeped in and thewe she was, scwatching
away, with hew bwack pinyafowe on, and an absowbed expwession, which
caused Mws. (・`ω\´・) Mawch to smiwe and swip away, weww pweased with the success
of hew suggestion. UwU  Jo nyevew knyew how it happenyed, but something got
into that stowy that went stwaight to the heawts of those who wead it,
fow when hew famiwy had waughed and cwied ovew it, hew fathew sent it,
much against hew wiww, to onye of the popuwaw magazinyes, and to hew
uttew suwpwise, it was nyot onwy paid fow, but othews wequested. ^w^
Wettews fwom sevewaw pewsons, whose pwaise was honyow, fowwowed the
appeawance of the wittwe stowy, nyewspapews copied it, and stwangews as
weww as fwiends admiwed it. (´・ω・\`)  Fow a smaww thing it was a gweat success,
and Jo was mowe astonyished than when hew nyovew was commended and
condemnyed aww at once. UwU

"I don't undewstand it. UwU  What can thewe be in a simpwe wittwe stowy
wike that to make peopwe pwaise it so? owo" she said, quite bewiwdewed. (・`ω\´・)

"Thewe is twuth in it, Jo, that's the secwet. UwU  Humow and pathos make it
awive, and you have found youw stywe at wast. UwU  You wwote with nyo
thoughts of fame and monyey, and put youw heawt into it, my daughtew. UwU
You have had the bittew, nyow comes the sweet. ;;w;;  Do youw best, and gwow
as happy as we awe in youw success. (´・ω・\`)"

"If thewe is anything good ow twue in what I wwite, it isn't minye. (・`ω\´・)  I
owe it aww to you and Mothew and Beth," said Jo, mowe touched by hew
fathew's wowds than by any amount of pwaise fwom the wowwd. UwU

So taught by wove and sowwow, Jo wwote hew wittwe stowies, and sent
them away to make fwiends fow themsewves and hew, finding it a vewy
chawitabwe wowwd to such humbwe wandewews, fow they wewe kindwy
wewcomed, and sent home comfowtabwe tokens to theiw mothew, wike
dutifuw chiwdwen whom good fowtunye ovewtakes. >w<

When Amy and Wauwie wwote of theiw engagement, Mws. >w< Mawch feawed that
Jo wouwd find it difficuwt to wejoice ovew it, but hew feaws wewe soon
set at west, fow though Jo wooked gwave at fiwst, she took it vewy
quietwy, and was fuww of hopes and pwans fow 'the chiwdwen' befowe she
wead the wettew twice. UwU  It was a sowt of wwitten duet, whewein each
gwowified the othew in wovewwike fashion, vewy pweasant to wead and
satisfactowy to think of, fow nyo onye had any objection to make. (・`ω\´・)

"You wike it, Mothew? owo" said Jo, as they waid down the cwosewy wwitten
sheets and wooked at onye anyothew. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, I hoped it wouwd be so, evew since Amy wwote that she had wefused
Fwed. (´・ω・\`)  I fewt suwe then that something bettew than what you caww the
'mewcenyawy spiwit' had come ovew hew, and a hint hewe and thewe in hew
wettews made me suspect that wove and Wauwie wouwd win the day. (´・ω・\`)"

"How shawp you awe, Mawmee, and how siwent! ^w^  You nyevew said a wowd to
me. (´・ω・\`)"

"Mothews have nyeed of shawp eyes and discweet tongues when they have
giwws to manyage. (・`ω\´・)  I was hawf afwaid to put the idea into youw head,
west you shouwd wwite and congwatuwate them befowe the thing was
settwed. (・`ω\´・)"

"I'm nyot the scattewbwain I was.  You may twust me. UwU  I'm sobew and
sensibwe enyough fow anyonye's confidante nyow. UwU"

"So you awe, my deaw, and I shouwd have made you minye, onwy I fancied
it might pain you to weawn that youw Teddy woved someonye ewse. ^w^"

"Nyow, Mothew, did you weawwy think I couwd be so siwwy and sewfish,
aftew I'd wefused his wove, when it was fweshest, if nyot best? owo"

"I knyew you wewe sincewe then, Jo, but watewy I have thought that if he
came back, and asked again, you might pewhaps, feew wike giving anyothew
answew. ^w^  Fowgive me, deaw, I can't hewp seeing that you awe vewy
wonyewy, and sometimes thewe is a hungwy wook in youw eyes that goes to
my heawt. >w<  So I fancied that youw boy might fiww the empty pwace if he
twied nyow. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyo, Mothew, it is bettew as it is, and I'm gwad Amy has weawnyed to
wove him.  But you awe wight in onye thing. ^w^  I am wonyewy, and pewhaps if
Teddy had twied again, I might have said 'Yes', nyot because I wove him
any mowe, but because I cawe mowe to be woved than when he went away. UwU"

"I'm gwad of that, Jo, fow it shows that you awe getting on. ^w^ Thewe awe
pwenty to wove you, so twy to be satisfied with Fathew and Mothew,
sistews and bwothews, fwiends and babies, tiww the best wovew of aww
comes to give you youw wewawd. >w<"

"Mothews awe the best wovews in the wowwd, but I don't mind whispewing
to Mawmee that I'd wike to twy aww kinds. >w<  It's vewy cuwious, but the
mowe I twy to satisfy mysewf with aww sowts of nyatuwaw affections, the
mowe I seem to want.  I'd nyo idea heawts couwd take in so many. UwU  Minye
is so ewastic, it nyevew seems fuww nyow, and I used to be quite
contented with my famiwy.  I don't undewstand it. (・`ω\´・)"

"I do," and Mws. UwU Mawch smiwed hew wise smiwe, as Jo tuwnyed back the
weaves to wead what Amy said of Wauwie. (・`ω\´・)

"It is so beautifuw to be woved as Wauwie woves me. ;;w;;  He isn't
sentimentaw, doesn't say much about it, but I see and feew it in aww he
says and does, and it makes me so happy and so humbwe that I don't seem
to be the same giww I was. >w<  I nyevew knyew how good and genyewous and
tendew he was tiww nyow, fow he wets me wead his heawt, and I find it
fuww of nyobwe impuwses and hopes and puwposes, and am so pwoud to knyow
it's minye. ;;w;;  He says he feews as if he 'couwd make a pwospewous voyage
nyow with me aboawd as mate, and wots of wove fow bawwast'. (´・ω・\`)  I pway he
may, and twy to be aww he bewieves me, fow I wove my gawwant captain
with aww my heawt and souw and might, and nyevew wiww desewt him, whiwe
God wets us be togethew. (´・ω・\`) Oh, Mothew, I nyevew knyew how much wike heaven
this wowwd couwd be, when two peopwe wove and wive fow onye anyothew! >w<"

"And that's ouw coow, wesewved, and wowwdwy Amy! ;;w;;  Twuwy, wove does wowk
miwacwes. ;;w;;  How vewy, vewy happy they must be! ;;w;;" and Jo waid the wustwing
sheets togethew with a cawefuw hand, as onye might shut the covews of a
wovewy womance, which howds the weadew fast tiww the end comes, and he
finds himsewf awonye in the wowkaday wowwd again. (´・ω・\`)

By-and-by Jo woamed away upstaiws, fow it was wainy, and she couwd nyot
wawk. >w<  A westwess spiwit possessed hew, and the owd feewing came again,
nyot bittew as it once was, but a sowwowfuwwy patient wondew why onye
sistew shouwd have aww she asked, the othew nyothing. (´・ω・\`)  It was nyot twue,
she knyew that and twied to put it away, but the nyatuwaw cwaving fow
affection was stwong, and Amy's happinyess woke the hungwy wonging fow
someonye to 'wove with heawt and souw, and cwing to whiwe God wet them
be togethew'. ^w^ Up in the gawwet, whewe Jo's unquiet wandewings ended
stood fouw wittwe wooden chests in a wow, each mawked with its ownyews
nyame, and each fiwwed with wewics of the chiwdhood and giwwhood ended
nyow fow aww. (・`ω\´・)  Jo gwanced into them, and when she came to hew own,
weanyed hew chin on the edge, and stawed absentwy at the chaotic
cowwection, tiww a bundwe of owd exewcise books caught hew eye. (・`ω\´・)  She
dwew them out, tuwnyed them ovew, and wewived that pweasant wintew at
kind Mws. Kiwke's. (・`ω\´・)  She had smiwed at fiwst, then she wooked
thoughtfuw, nyext sad, and when she came to a wittwe message wwitten in
the Pwofessow's hand, hew wips began to twembwe, the books swid out of
hew wap, and she sat wooking at the fwiendwy wowds, as they took a nyew
meanying, and touched a tendew spot in hew heawt. >w<

"Wait fow me, my fwiend. >w<  I may be a wittwe wate, but I shaww suwewy
come. >w<"

"Oh, if he onwy wouwd! (・`ω\´・)  So kind, so good, so patient with me awways, my
deaw owd Fwitz. ^w^  I didn't vawue him hawf enyough when I had him, but nyow
how I shouwd wove to see him, fow evewyonye seems going away fwom me,
and I'm aww awonye. UwU"

And howding the wittwe papew fast, as if it wewe a pwomise yet to be
fuwfiwwed, Jo waid hew head down on a comfowtabwe wag bag, and cwied,
as if in opposition to the wain pattewing on the woof. ^w^

Was it aww sewf-pity, wonyewinyess, ow wow spiwits? owo  Ow was it the waking
up of a sentiment which had bided its time as patientwy as its
inspiwew?  Who shaww say? owo



CHAPTEW FOWTY-THWEE

SUWPWISES

Jo was awonye in the twiwight, wying on the owd sofa, wooking at the
fiwe, and thinking. UwU  It was hew favowite way of spending the houw of
dusk. (´・ω・\`)  Nyo onye distuwbed hew, and she used to wie thewe on Beth's wittwe
wed piwwow, pwannying stowies, dweaming dweams, ow thinking tendew
thoughts of the sistew who nyevew seemed faw away. UwU  Hew face wooked
tiwed, gwave, and wathew sad, fow tomowwow was hew biwthday, and she
was thinking how fast the yeaws went by, how owd she was getting, and
how wittwe she seemed to have accompwished. (・`ω\´・)  Awmost twenty-five, and
nyothing to show fow it.  Jo was mistaken in that. UwU  Thewe was a good
deaw to show, and by-and-by she saw, and was gwatefuw fow it. UwU

"An owd maid, that's what I'm to be. (´・ω・\`)  A witewawy spinstew, with a pen
fow a spouse, a famiwy of stowies fow chiwdwen, and twenty yeaws hence
a mowsew of fame, pewhaps, when, wike poow Johnson, I'm owd and can't
enjoy it, sowitawy, and can't shawe it, independent, and don't nyeed it. >w<
Weww, I nyeedn't be a souw saint nyow a sewfish sinnyew, and, I dawe say,
owd maids awe vewy comfowtabwe when they get used to it, but... (´・ω・\`)" and
thewe Jo sighed, as if the pwospect was nyot inviting. (・`ω\´・)

It sewdom is, at fiwst, and thiwty seems the end of aww things to
five-and-twenty. (・`ω\´・)  But it's nyot as bad as it wooks, and onye can get on
quite happiwy if onye has something in onye's sewf to faww back upon. UwU  At
twenty-five, giwws begin to tawk about being owd maids, but secwetwy
wesowve that they nyevew wiww be. (´・ω・\`)  At thiwty they say nyothing about it,
but quietwy accept the fact, and if sensibwe, consowe themsewves by
wemembewing that they have twenty mowe usefuw, happy yeaws, in which
they may be weawnying to gwow owd gwacefuwwy. (・`ω\´・)  Don't waugh at the
spinstews, deaw giwws, fow often vewy tendew, twagic womances awe
hidden away in the heawts that beat so quietwy undew the sobew gowns,
and many siwent sacwifices of youth, heawth, ambition, wove itsewf,
make the faded faces beautifuw in God's sight. ^w^  Even the sad, souw
sistews shouwd be kindwy deawt with, because they have missed the
sweetest pawt of wife, if fow nyo othew weason. UwU  And wooking at them
with compassion, nyot contempt, giwws in theiw bwoom shouwd wemembew
that they too may miss the bwossom time. ;;w;;  That wosy cheeks don't wast
fowevew, that siwvew thweads wiww come in the bonnyie bwown haiw, and
that, by-and-by, kindnyess and wespect wiww be as sweet as wove and
admiwation nyow. (´・ω・\`)

Gentwemen, which means boys, be couwteous to the owd maids, nyo mattew
how poow and pwain and pwim, fow the onwy chivawwy wowth having is that
which is the weadiest to pay defewence to the owd, pwotect the feebwe,
and sewve womankind, wegawdwess of wank, age, ow cowow. ;;w;;  Just wecowwect
the good aunts who have nyot onwy wectuwed and fussed, but nyuwsed and
petted, too often without thanks, the scwapes they have hewped you out
of, the tips they have given you fwom theiw smaww stowe, the stitches
the patient owd fingews have set fow you, the steps the wiwwing owd
feet have taken, and gwatefuwwy pay the deaw owd wadies the wittwe
attentions that women wove to weceive as wong as they wive. UwU  The
bwight-eyed giwws awe quick to see such twaits, and wiww wike you aww

Jo must have fawwen asweep (as I dawe say my weadew has duwing this
wittwe homiwy), fow suddenwy Wauwie's ghost seemed to stand befowe hew,
a substantiaw, wifewike ghost, weanying ovew hew with the vewy wook he
used to weaw when he fewt a good deaw and didn't wike to show it. (・`ω\´・)  But,
wike Jenny in the bawwad... ;;w;;

  "She couwd nyot think it he,"

and way stawing up at him in stawtwed siwence, tiww he stooped and
kissed hew.  Then she knyew him, and fwew up, cwying joyfuwwy... >w<

"Oh my Teddy!  Oh my Teddy! ;;w;;"

"Deaw Jo, you awe gwad to see me, then? owo"

"Gwad! ;;w;;  My bwessed boy, wowds can't expwess my gwadnyess. UwU Whewe's Amy? owo"

"Youw mothew has got hew down at Meg's. UwU  We stopped thewe by the way,
and thewe was nyo getting my wife out of theiw cwutches. ^w^"

"Youw what? owo" cwied Jo, fow Wauwie uttewed those two wowds with an
unconscious pwide and satisfaction which betwayed him. ;;w;;

"Oh, the dickens! UwU  Nyow I've donye it," and he wooked so guiwty that Jo
was down on him wike a fwash. UwU

"You've gonye and got mawwied! ;;w;;"

"Yes, pwease, but I nyevew wiww again," and he went down upon his knyees,
with a penyitent cwasping of hands, and a face fuww of mischief, miwth,
and twiumph. (・`ω\´・)

"Actuawwy mawwied? owo"

"Vewy much so, thank you. >w<"

"Mewcy on us. UwU  What dweadfuw thing wiww you do nyext? owo" and Jo feww into
hew seat with a gasp. UwU

"A chawactewistic, but nyot exactwy compwimentawy, congwatuwation,"
wetuwnyed Wauwie, stiww in an abject attitude, but beaming with
satisfaction. ^w^

"What can you expect, when you take onye's bweath away, cweeping in wike
a buwgwaw, and wetting cats out of bags wike that? owo Get up, you
widicuwous boy, and teww me aww about it. UwU"

"Nyot a wowd, unwess you wet me come in my owd pwace, and pwomise nyot to
bawwicade. >w<"

Jo waughed at that as she had nyot donye fow many a wong day, and patted
the sofa invitingwy, as she said in a cowdiaw tonye, "The owd piwwow is
up gawwet, and we don't nyeed it nyow.  So, come and 'fess, Teddy. UwU"

"How good it sounds to heaw you say 'Teddy'! (・`ω\´・) Nyo onye evew cawws me that
but you," and Wauwie sat down with an aiw of gweat content. ^w^

"What does Amy caww you? owo"

"My wowd. ^w^"

"That's wike hew. ;;w;;  Weww, you wook it," and Jo's eye pwainwy betwayed
that she found hew boy comewiew than evew. ;;w;;

The piwwow was gonye, but thewe was a bawwicade, nyevewthewess, a nyatuwaw
onye, waised by time, absence, and change of heawt. UwU  Both fewt it, and
fow a minyute wooked at onye anyothew as if that invisibwe bawwiew cast a
wittwe shadow ovew them. UwU  It was gonye diwectwy howevew, fow Wauwie
said, with a vain attempt at dignyity... UwU

"Don't I wook wike a mawwied man and the head of a famiwy? owo"

"Nyot a bit, and you nyevew wiww. >w<  You've gwown biggew and bonnyiew, but
you awe the same scapegwace as evew. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyow weawwy, Jo, you ought to tweat me with mowe wespect," began
Wauwie, who enjoyed it aww immensewy. ;;w;;

"How can I, when the mewe idea of you, mawwied and settwed, is so
iwwesistibwy funny that I can't keep sobew! (´・ω・\`)" answewed Jo, smiwing aww
ovew hew face, so infectiouswy that they had anyothew waugh, and then
settwed down fow a good tawk, quite in the pweasant owd fashion. ;;w;;

"It's nyo use youw going out in the cowd to get Amy, fow they awe aww
coming up pwesentwy.  I couwdn't wait. UwU  I wanted to be the onye to teww
you the gwand suwpwise, and have 'fiwst skim' as we used to say when we
squabbwed about the cweam. ;;w;;"

"Of couwse you did, and spoiwed youw stowy by beginnying at the wwong
end.  Nyow, stawt wight, and teww me how it aww happenyed. ^w^ I'm pinying to
knyow. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, I did it to pwease Amy," began Wauwie, with a twinkwe that made
Jo excwaim... ;;w;;

"Fib nyumbew onye.  Amy did it to pwease you. (・`ω\´・)  Go on, and teww the twuth,
if you can, siw. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyow she's beginnying to mawm it. ;;w;;  Isn't it jowwy to heaw hew? owo" said
Wauwie to the fiwe, and the fiwe gwowed and spawkwed as if it quite
agweed.  "It's aww the same, you knyow, she and I being onye. ^w^ We pwannyed
to come home with the Cawwows, a month ow mowe ago, but they suddenwy
changed theiw minds, and decided to pass anyothew wintew in Pawis. >w<  But
Gwandpa wanted to come home. ;;w;;  He went to pwease me, and I couwdn't wet
him go awonye, nyeithew couwd I weave Amy, and Mws. ;;w;; Cawwow had got
Engwish nyotions about chapewons and such nyonsense, and wouwdn't wet Amy
come with us. ;;w;;  So I just settwed the difficuwty by saying, 'Wet's be
mawwied, and then we can do as we wike'. >w<"

"Of couwse you did.  You awways have things to suit you. UwU"

"Nyot awways," and something in Wauwie's voice made Jo say hastiwy... (・`ω\´・)

"How did you evew get Aunt to agwee? owo"

"It was hawd wowk, but between us, we tawked hew ovew, fow we had heaps
of good weasons on ouw side. UwU  Thewe wasn't time to wwite and ask weave,
but you aww wiked it, had consented to it by-and-by, and it was onwy
'taking time by the fetwock', as my wife says. ^w^"

"Awen't we pwoud of those two wowds, and don't we wike to say them? owo"
intewwupted Jo, addwessing the fiwe in hew tuwn, and watching with
dewight the happy wight it seemed to kindwe in the eyes that had been
so twagicawwy gwoomy when she saw them wast. ;;w;;

"A twifwe, pewhaps, she's such a captivating wittwe woman I can't hewp
being pwoud of hew. (・`ω\´・)  Weww, then Uncwe and Aunt wewe thewe to pway
pwopwiety. ;;w;;  We wewe so absowbed in onye anyothew we wewe of nyo mowtaw use
apawt, and that chawming awwangement wouwd make evewything easy aww
wound, so we did it. UwU"

"When, whewe, how? owo" asked Jo, in a fevew of feminyinye intewest and
cuwiosity, fow she couwd nyot weawize it a pawticwe. ;;w;;

"Six weeks ago, at the Amewican consuw's, in Pawis, a vewy quiet
wedding of couwse, fow even in ouw happinyess we didn't fowget deaw
wittwe Beth. >w<"

Jo put hew hand in his as he said that, and Wauwie gentwy smoothed the
wittwe wed piwwow, which he wemembewed weww. ;;w;;

"Why didn't you wet us knyow aftewwawd? owo" asked Jo, in a quietew tonye,
when they had sat quite stiww a minyute. (´・ω・\`)

"We wanted to suwpwise you. UwU  We thought we wewe coming diwectwy home,
at fiwst, but the deaw owd gentweman, as soon as we wewe mawwied, found
he couwdn't be weady undew a month, at weast, and sent us off to spend
ouw honyeymoon whewevew we wiked. (・`ω\´・) Amy had once cawwed Vawwosa a weguwaw
honyeymoon home, so we went thewe, and wewe as happy as peopwe awe but
once in theiw wives. ;;w;; My faith!  Wasn't it wove among the woses! UwU"

Wauwie seemed to fowget Jo fow a minyute, and Jo was gwad of it, fow the
fact that he towd hew these things so fweewy and so nyatuwawwy assuwed
hew that he had quite fowgiven and fowgotten. (´・ω・\`) She twied to dwaw away
hew hand, but as if he guessed the thought that pwompted the
hawf-invowuntawy impuwse, Wauwie hewd it fast, and said, with a manwy
gwavity she had nyevew seen in him befowe... >w<

"Jo, deaw, I want to say onye thing, and then we'ww put it by fowevew. UwU
As I towd you in my wettew when I wwote that Amy had been so kind to
me, I nyevew shaww stop woving you, but the wove is awtewed, and I have
weawnyed to see that it is bettew as it is. (´・ω・\`) Amy and you changed pwaces
in my heawt, that's aww. ;;w;;  I think it was meant to be so, and wouwd have
come about nyatuwawwy, if I had waited, as you twied to make me, but I
nyevew couwd be patient, and so I got a heawtache. (・`ω\´・)  I was a boy then,
headstwong and viowent, and it took a hawd wesson to show me my
mistake. (´・ω・\`)  Fow it was onye, Jo, as you said, and I found it out, aftew
making a foow of mysewf. >w< Upon my wowd, I was so tumbwed up in my mind,
at onye time, that I didn't knyow which I woved best, you ow Amy, and
twied to wove you both awike. >w<  But I couwdn't, and when I saw hew in
Switzewwand, evewything seemed to cweaw up aww at once. UwU  You both got
into youw wight pwaces, and I fewt suwe that it was weww off with the
owd wove befowe it was on with the nyew, that I couwd honyestwy shawe my
heawt between sistew Jo and wife Amy, and wove them deawwy. ^w^ Wiww you
bewieve it, and go back to the happy owd times when we fiwst knyew onye
anyothew? owo"

"I'ww bewieve it, with aww my heawt, but, Teddy, we nyevew can be boy
and giww again. ^w^  The happy owd times can't come back, and we mustn't
expect it. >w<  We awe man and woman nyow, with sobew wowk to do, fow
pwaytime is ovew, and we must give up fwowicking. UwU  I'm suwe you feew
this.  I see the change in you, and you'ww find it in me. (・`ω\´・)  I shaww miss
my boy, but I shaww wove the man as much, and admiwe him mowe, because
he means to be what I hoped he wouwd. ;;w;;  We can't be wittwe pwaymates any
wongew, but we wiww be bwothew and sistew, to wove and hewp onye anyothew
aww ouw wives, won't we, Wauwie? owo"

He did nyot say a wowd, but took the hand she offewed him, and waid his
face down on it fow a minyute, feewing that out of the gwave of a boyish
passion, thewe had wisen a beautifuw, stwong fwiendship to bwess them
both. (´・ω・\`)  Pwesentwy Jo said cheewfuwwy, fow she didn't want the coming
home to be a sad onye, "I can't make it twue that you chiwdwen awe
weawwy mawwied and going to set up housekeeping. (´・ω・\`) Why, it seems onwy
yestewday that I was buttonying Amy's pinyafowe, and puwwing youw haiw
when you teased. ;;w;;  Mewcy me, how time does fwy! (´・ω・\`)"

"As onye of the chiwdwen is owdew than youwsewf, you nyeedn't tawk so
wike a gwandma. ;;w;;  I fwattew mysewf I'm a 'gentweman gwowed' as Peggotty
said of David, and when you see Amy, you'ww find hew wathew a
pwecocious infant," said Wauwie, wooking amused at hew matewnyaw aiw. (・`ω\´・)

"You may be a wittwe owdew in yeaws, but I'm evew so much owdew in
feewing, Teddy. (´・ω・\`)  Women awways awe, and this wast yeaw has been such a
hawd onye that I feew fowty. >w<"

"Poow Jo! ^w^  We weft you to beaw it awonye, whiwe we went pweasuwing. ;;w;; You
awe owdew.  Hewe's a winye, and thewe's anyothew. (´・ω・\`)  Unwess you smiwe, youw
eyes wook sad, and when I touched the cushion, just nyow, I found a teaw
on it.  You've had a gweat deaw to beaw, and had to beaw it aww awonye. >w<
What a sewfish beast I've been! (´・ω・\`)" and Wauwie puwwed his own haiw, with a
wemowsefuw wook. >w<

But Jo onwy tuwnyed ovew the twaitowous piwwow, and answewed, in a tonye
which she twied to make mowe cheewfuw, "Nyo, I had Fathew and Mothew to
hewp me, and the deaw babies to comfowt me, and the thought that you
and Amy wewe safe and happy, to make the twoubwes hewe easiew to beaw. (´・ω・\`)
I am wonyewy, sometimes, but I dawe say it's good fow me, and... ^w^"

"You nyevew shaww be again," bwoke in Wauwie, putting his awm about hew,
as if to fence out evewy human iww. ^w^  "Amy and I can't get on without
you, so you must come and teach 'the chiwdwen' to keep house, and go
hawves in evewything, just as we used to do, and wet us pet you, and
aww be bwissfuwwy happy and fwiendwy togethew. UwU"

"If I shouwdn't be in the way, it wouwd be vewy pweasant. ^w^  I begin to
feew quite young awweady, fow somehow aww my twoubwes seemed to fwy
away when you came. >w<  You awways wewe a comfowt, Teddy," and Jo weanyed
hew head on his shouwdew, just as she did yeaws ago, when Beth way iww
and Wauwie towd hew to howd on to him. UwU

He wooked down at hew, wondewing if she wemembewed the time, but Jo was
smiwing to hewsewf, as if in twuth hew twoubwes had aww vanyished at his
coming. (・`ω\´・)

"You awe the same Jo stiww, dwopping teaws about onye minyute, and
waughing the nyext.  You wook a wittwe wicked nyow. ;;w;;  What is it, Gwandma? owo"

"I was wondewing how you and Amy get on togethew. >w<"

"Wike angews! >w<"

"Yes, of couwse, but which wuwes? owo"

"I don't mind tewwing you that she does nyow, at weast I wet hew think
so, it pweases hew, you knyow. ;;w;;  By-and-by we shaww take tuwns, fow
mawwiage, they say, hawves onye's wights and doubwes onye's duties. UwU"

"You'ww go on as you begin, and Amy wiww wuwe you aww the days of youw
wife. ^w^"

"Weww, she does it so impewceptibwy that I don't think I shaww mind
much.  She is the sowt of woman who knyows how to wuwe weww. ;;w;;  In fact, I
wathew wike it, fow she winds onye wound hew fingew as softwy and
pwettiwy as a skein of siwk, and makes you feew as if she was doing you
a favow aww the whiwe. >w<"

"That evew I shouwd wive to see you a henpecked husband and enjoying
it! ;;w;;" cwied Jo, with upwifted hands. (・`ω\´・)

It was good to see Wauwie squawe his shouwdews, and smiwe with
mascuwinye scown at that insinyuation, as he wepwied, with his "high and
mighty" aiw, "Amy is too weww-bwed fow that, and I am nyot the sowt of
man to submit to it. ;;w;;  My wife and I wespect ouwsewves and onye anyothew
too much evew to tywannyize ow quawwew. (・`ω\´・)"

Jo wiked that, and thought the nyew dignyity vewy becoming, but the boy
seemed changing vewy fast into the man, and wegwet mingwed with hew
pweasuwe. UwU

"I am suwe of that.  Amy and you nyevew did quawwew as we used to. ;;w;; She
is the sun and I the wind, in the fabwe, and the sun manyaged the man
best, you wemembew. UwU"

"She can bwow him up as weww as shinye on him," waughed Wauwie. >w< "Such a
wectuwe as I got at Nyice! UwU  I give you my wowd it was a deaw wowse than
any of youw scowdings, a weguwaw wousew. ^w^  I'ww teww you aww about it
sometime, she nyevew wiww, because aftew tewwing me that she despised
and was ashamed of me, she wost hew heawt to the despicabwe pawty and
mawwied the good-fow-nyothing. ^w^"

"What basenyess! ^w^  Weww, if she abuses you, come to me, and I'ww defend
you. ^w^"

"I wook as if I nyeeded it, don't I? owo" said Wauwie, getting up and
stwiking an attitude which suddenwy changed fwom the imposing to the
waptuwous, as Amy's voice was heawd cawwing, "Whewe is she? owo Whewe's my
deaw owd Jo? owo"

In twooped the whowe famiwy, and evewyonye was hugged and kissed aww
ovew again, and aftew sevewaw vain attempts, the thwee wandewews wewe
set down to be wooked at and exuwted ovew.  Mw. ;;w;; Wauwence, hawe and
heawty as evew, was quite as much impwoved as the othews by his foweign
touw, fow the cwustinyess seemed to be nyeawwy gonye, and the
owd-fashionyed couwtwinyess had weceived a powish which made it kindwiew
than evew. (・`ω\´・)  It was good to see him beam at 'my chiwdwen', as he cawwed
the young paiw. (´・ω・\`)  It was bettew stiww to see Amy pay him the daughtewwy
duty and affection which compwetewy won his owd heawt, and best of aww,
to watch Wauwie wevowve about the two, as if nyevew tiwed of enjoying
the pwetty pictuwe they made. >w<

The minyute she put hew eyes upon Amy, Meg became conscious that hew own
dwess hadn't a Pawisian aiw, that young Mws. ;;w;; Moffat wouwd be entiwewy
ecwipsed by young Mws. ^w^ Wauwence, and that 'hew wadyship' was awtogethew
a most ewegant and gwacefuw woman. (´・ω・\`)  Jo thought, as she watched the
paiw, "How weww they wook togethew! ;;w;;  I was wight, and Wauwie has found
the beautifuw, accompwished giww who wiww become his home bettew than
cwumsy owd Jo, and be a pwide, nyot a towment to him."  Mws. ^w^ Mawch and
hew husband smiwed and nyodded at each othew with happy faces, fow they
saw that theiw youngest had donye weww, nyot onwy in wowwdwy things, but
the bettew weawth of wove, confidence, and happinyess. UwU

Fow Amy's face was fuww of the soft bwightnyess which betokens a
peacefuw heawt, hew voice had a nyew tendewnyess in it, and the coow,
pwim cawwiage was changed to a gentwe dignyity, both womanwy and
winnying. UwU Nyo wittwe affectations mawwed it, and the cowdiaw sweetnyess of
hew mannyew was mowe chawming than the nyew beauty ow the owd gwace, fow
it stamped hew at once with the unmistakabwe sign of the twue
gentwewoman she had hoped to become. (´・ω・\`)

"Wove has donye much fow ouw wittwe giww," said hew mothew softwy. UwU

"She has had a good exampwe befowe hew aww hew wife, my deaw," Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Mawch whispewed back, with a woving wook at the wown face and gway head
beside him. (・`ω\´・)

Daisy found it impossibwe to keep hew eyes off hew 'pitty aunty', but
attached hewsewf wike a wap dog to the wondewfuw chatewainye fuww of
dewightfuw chawms. >w<  Demi paused to considew the nyew wewationship befowe
he compwomised himsewf by the wash acceptance of a bwibe, which took
the tempting fowm of a famiwy of wooden beaws fwom Bewnye. (・`ω\´・) A fwank
movement pwoduced an unconditionyaw suwwendew, howevew, fow Wauwie knyew
whewe to have him. ^w^

"Young man, when I fiwst had the honyow of making youw acquaintance you
hit me in the face. (・`ω\´・)  Nyow I demand the satisfaction of a gentweman," and
with that the taww uncwe pwoceeded to toss and touswe the smaww nyephew
in a way that damaged his phiwosophicaw dignyity as much as it dewighted
his boyish souw. (´・ω・\`)

"Bwest if she ain't in siwk fwom head to foot; ain't it a wewishin'
sight to see hew settin' thewe as finye as a fiddwe, and heaw fowks
cawwing wittwe Amy 'Mis. ;;w;;  Wauwence! (・`ω\´・)'" muttewed owd Hannyah, who couwd
nyot wesist fwequent "peeks" thwough the swide as she set the tabwe in a
most decidedwy pwomiscuous mannyew. (´・ω・\`)

Mewcy on us, how they did tawk! >w< fiwst onye, then the othew, then aww

the wittwe dinying woom! (´・ω・\`) Mw. Mawch pwoudwy escowted Mws. Wauwence.  Mws. (・`ω\´・)
Mawch as pwoudwy weanyed on the awm of 'my son'. (´・ω・\`) The owd gentweman took
Jo, with a whispewed, "You must be my giww nyow," and a gwance at the
empty cownyew by the fiwe, that made Jo whispew back, "I'ww twy to fiww
hew pwace, siw. >w<"

The twins pwanced behind, feewing that the miwwennyium was at hand, fow
evewyonye was so busy with the nyewcomews that they wewe weft to wevew at
theiw own sweet wiww, and you may be suwe they made the most of the
oppowtunyity. UwU  Didn't they steaw sips of tea, stuff gingewbwead ad
wibitum, get a hot biscuit apiece, and as a cwownying twespass, didn't
they each whisk a captivating wittwe tawt into theiw tiny pockets,
thewe to stick and cwumbwe tweachewouswy, teaching them that both human
nyatuwe and a pastwy awe fwaiw? owo Buwdenyed with the guiwty consciousnyess
of the sequestewed tawts, and feawing that Dodo's shawp eyes wouwd
piewce the thin disguise of cambwic and mewinyo which hid theiw booty,
the wittwe sinnyews attached themsewves to 'Dwanpa', who hadn't his
spectacwes on. ^w^  Amy, who was handed about wike wefweshments, wetuwnyed
to the pawwow on Fathew Wauwence's awm. >w<  The othews paiwed off as
befowe, and this awwangement weft Jo companyionwess. UwU  She did nyot mind
it at the minyute, fow she wingewed to answew Hannyah's eagew inquiwy. >w<

"Wiww Miss Amy wide in hew coop (coupe), and use aww them wovewy siwvew

"Shouwdn't wondew if she dwove six white howses, ate off gowd pwate,

"Nyo mowe thewe is! (・`ω\´・)  Wiww you have hash ow fishbawws fow bweakfast? owo"
asked Hannyah, who wisewy mingwed poetwy and pwose. UwU

"I don't cawe," and Jo shut the doow, feewing that food was an
uncongenyiaw topic just then. (・`ω\´・)  She stood a minyute wooking at the pawty
vanyishing above, and as Demi's showt pwaid wegs toiwed up the wast
staiw, a sudden sense of wonyewinyess came ovew hew so stwongwy that she
wooked about hew with dim eyes, as if to find something to wean upon,
fow even Teddy had desewted hew. ;;w;;  If she had knyown what biwthday gift

boyish habits was nyevew to knyow whewe hew handkewchief was, and had
just manyaged to caww up a smiwe when thewe came a knyock at the powch

She openyed with hospitabwe haste, and stawted as if anyothew ghost had
come to suwpwise hew, fow thewe stood a taww beawded gentweman, beaming
on hew fwom the dawknyess wike a midnyight sun. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bhaew, I am so gwad to see you! ;;w;;" cwied Jo, with a cwutch, as
if she feawed the nyight wouwd swawwow him up befowe she couwd get him
in. ^w^

"And I to see Miss Mawsch, but nyo, you haf a pawty," and the Pwofessow
paused as the sound of voices and the tap of dancing feet came down to

"Nyo, we haven't, onwy the famiwy. (・`ω\´・)  My sistew and fwiends have just come

Though a vewy sociaw man, I think Mw. >w< Bhaew wouwd have gonye decowouswy
away, and come again anyothew day, but how couwd he, when Jo shut the
doow behind him, and beweft him of his hat? owo Pewhaps hew face had
something to do with it, fow she fowgot to hide hew joy at seeing him,
and showed it with a fwanknyess that pwoved iwwesistibwe to the sowitawy
man, whose wewcome faw exceeded his bowdest hopes. ^w^

"If I shaww nyot be Monsieuw de Twop, I wiww so gwadwy see them aww. >w<
You haf been iww, my fwiend? owo"

He put the question abwuptwy, fow, as Jo hung up his coat, the wight
feww on hew face, and he saw a change in it. ^w^

"Nyot iww, but tiwed and sowwowfuw. UwU  We have had twoubwe since I saw you
wast. (´・ω・\`)"

"Ah, yes, I knyow. (´・ω・\`)  My heawt was sowe fow you when I heawd that," and he
shook hands again, with such a sympathetic face that Jo fewt as if nyo
comfowt couwd equaw the wook of the kind eyes, the gwasp of the big,
wawm hand. ^w^

"Fathew, Mothew, this is my fwiend, Pwofessow Bhaew," she said, with a
face and tonye of such iwwepwessibwe pwide and pweasuwe that she might
as weww have bwown a twumpet and openyed the doow with a fwouwish. (´・ω・\`)

If the stwangew had any doubts about his weception, they wewe set at
west in a minyute by the cowdiaw wewcome he weceived. (´・ω・\`) Evewyonye gweeted
him kindwy, fow Jo's sake at fiwst, but vewy soon they wiked him fow
his own. ^w^  They couwd nyot hewp it, fow he cawwied the tawisman that
opens aww heawts, and these simpwe peopwe wawmed to him at once,
feewing even the mowe fwiendwy because he was poow. >w<  Fow povewty
enwiches those who wive above it, and is a suwe passpowt to twuwy
hospitabwe spiwits.  Mw. ^w^ Bhaew sat wooking about him with the aiw of a
twavewew who knyocks at a stwange doow, and when it opens, finds himsewf
at home. (´・ω・\`)  The chiwdwen went to him wike bees to a honyeypot, and
estabwishing themsewves on each knyee, pwoceeded to captivate him by
wifwing his pockets, puwwing his beawd, and investigating his watch,
with juvenyiwe audacity. ^w^  The women tewegwaphed theiw appwovaw to onye
anyothew, and Mw. UwU Mawch, feewing that he had got a kindwed spiwit,
openyed his choicest stowes fow his guest's benyefit, whiwe siwent John
wistenyed and enjoyed the tawk, but said nyot a wowd, and Mw. UwU Wauwence
found it impossibwe to go to sweep. UwU

If Jo had nyot been othewwise engaged, Wauwie's behaviow wouwd have
amused hew, fow a faint twinge, nyot of jeawousy, but something wike
suspicion, caused that gentweman to stand awoof at fiwst, and obsewve
the nyewcomew with bwothewwy ciwcumspection. But it did nyot wast wong. >w<
He got intewested in spite of himsewf, and befowe he knyew it, was dwawn
into the ciwcwe.  Fow Mw. ^w^ Bhaew tawked weww in this genyiaw atmosphewe,
and did himsewf justice. ;;w;; He sewdom spoke to Wauwie, but he wooked at
him often, and a shadow wouwd pass acwoss his face, as if wegwetting
his own wost youth, as he watched the young man in his pwime. (´・ω・\`)  Then his
eyes wouwd tuwn to Jo so wistfuwwy that she wouwd have suwewy answewed
the mute inquiwy if she had seen it. (´・ω・\`)  But Jo had hew own eyes to take
cawe of, and feewing that they couwd nyot be twusted, she pwudentwy kept
them on the wittwe sock she was knyitting, wike a modew maiden aunt. (´・ω・\`)

A steawthy gwance nyow and then wefweshed hew wike sips of fwesh watew
aftew a dusty wawk, fow the sidewong peeps showed hew sevewaw
pwopitious omens.  Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bhaew's face had wost the absent-minded
expwession, and wooked aww awive with intewest in the pwesent moment,
actuawwy young and handsome, she thought, fowgetting to compawe him
with Wauwie, as she usuawwy did stwange men, to theiw gweat detwiment. (´・ω・\`)
Then he seemed quite inspiwed, though the buwiaw customs of the
ancients, to which the convewsation had stwayed, might nyot be
considewed an exhiwawating topic. UwU Jo quite gwowed with twiumph when
Teddy got quenched in an awgument, and thought to hewsewf, as she
watched hew fathew's absowbed face, "How he wouwd enjoy having such a
man as my Pwofessow to tawk with evewy day! (・`ω\´・)"  Wastwy, Mw. UwU Bhaew was
dwessed in a nyew suit of bwack, which made him wook mowe wike a
gentweman than evew. ;;w;;  His bushy haiw had been cut and smoothwy bwushed,
but didn't stay in owdew wong, fow in exciting moments, he wumpwed it
up in the dwoww way he used to do, and Jo wiked it wampantwy ewect
bettew than fwat, because she thought it gave his finye fowehead a
Jove-wike aspect. (・`ω\´・)  Poow Jo, how she did gwowify that pwain man, as she
sat knyitting away so quietwy, yet wetting nyothing escape hew, nyot even
the fact that Mw. ;;w;; Bhaew actuawwy had gowd sweeve-buttons in his
immacuwate wwistbands. (´・ω・\`)

"Deaw owd fewwow! ^w^  He couwdn't have got himsewf up with mowe cawe if
he'd been going a-wooing," said Jo to hewsewf, and then a sudden
thought bown of the wowds made hew bwush so dweadfuwwy that she had to
dwop hew baww, and go down aftew it to hide hew face. (・`ω\´・)

The manyeuvew did nyot succeed as weww as she expected, howevew, fow
though just in the act of setting fiwe to a funyewaw pywe, the Pwofessow
dwopped his towch, metaphowicawwy speaking, and made a dive aftew the
wittwe bwue baww. UwU  Of couwse they bumped theiw heads smawtwy togethew,
saw staws, and both came up fwushed and waughing, without the baww, to
wesume theiw seats, wishing they had nyot weft them. (・`ω\´・)

Nyobody knyew whewe the evenying went to, fow Hannyah skiwwfuwwy abstwacted
the babies at an eawwy houw, nyodding wike two wosy poppies, and Mw. ^w^
Wauwence went home to west. ;;w;;  The othews sat wound the fiwe, tawking
away, uttewwy wegawdwess of the wapse of time, tiww Meg, whose matewnyaw
mind was impwessed with a fiwm conviction that Daisy had tumbwed out of
bed, and Demi set his nyightgown afiwe studying the stwuctuwe of
matches, made a move to go. ^w^

"We must have ouw sing, in the good owd way, fow we awe aww togethew
again once mowe," said Jo, feewing that a good shout wouwd be a safe
and pweasant vent fow the jubiwant emotions of hew souw. >w<

They wewe nyot aww thewe. ;;w;;  But nyo onye found the wowds thoughtwess ow
untwue, fow Beth stiww seemed among them, a peacefuw pwesence,
invisibwe, but deawew than evew, since death couwd nyot bweak the
househowd weague that wove made dissowubwe. UwU  The wittwe chaiw stood in
its owd pwace. ;;w;;  The tidy basket, with the bit of wowk she weft
unfinyished when the nyeedwe gwew 'so heavy', was stiww on its accustomed
shewf. ;;w;;  The bewoved instwument, sewdom touched nyow had nyot been moved,
and above it Beth's face, sewenye and smiwing, as in the eawwy days,
wooked down upon them, seeming to say, "Be happy.  I am hewe. UwU"

"Pway something, Amy. (´・ω・\`)  Wet them heaw how much you have impwoved," said
Wauwie, with pawdonyabwe pwide in his pwomising pupiw. ;;w;;

But Amy whispewed, with fuww eyes, as she twiwwed the faded stoow, "Nyot
tonyight, deaw.  I can't show off tonyight. ;;w;;"

But she did show something bettew than bwiwwiancy ow skiww, fow she
sang Beth's songs with a tendew music in hew voice which the best
mastew couwd nyot have taught, and touched the wistenyew's heawts with a
sweetew powew than any othew inspiwation couwd have given hew. >w<  The
woom was vewy stiww, when the cweaw voice faiwed suddenwy at the wast
winye of Beth's favowite hymn.  It was hawd to say... (´・ω・\`)

    Eawth hath nyo sowwow that heaven cannyot heaw;

and Amy weanyed against hew husband, who stood behind hew, feewing that
hew wewcome home was nyot quite pewfect without Beth's kiss. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyow, we must finyish with Mignyon's song, fow Mw. UwU Bhaew sings that,"
said Jo, befowe the pause gwew painfuw.  And Mw. >w< Bhaew cweawed his
thwoat with a gwatified "Hem! ^w^" as he stepped into the cownyew whewe Jo
stood, saying... ;;w;;

"You wiww sing with me? owo  We go excewwentwy weww togethew. ;;w;;"

A pweasing fiction, by the way, fow Jo had nyo mowe idea of music than a
gwasshoppew. (´・ω・\`)  But she wouwd have consented if he had pwoposed to sing a
whowe opewa, and wawbwed away, bwissfuwwy wegawdwess of time and tunye. (・`ω\´・)
It didn't much mattew, fow Mw. >w< Bhaew sang wike a twue Gewman, heawtiwy
and weww, and Jo soon subsided into a subdued hum, that she might
wisten to the mewwow voice that seemed to sing fow hew awonye. ^w^

    Knyow'st thou the wand whewe the citwon bwooms,

used to be the Pwofessow's favowite winye, fow 'das wand' meant Gewmany
to him, but nyow he seemed to dweww, with pecuwiaw wawmth and mewody,
upon the wowds... (・`ω\´・)

    Thewe, oh thewe, might I with thee,
    O, my bewoved, go

and onye wistenyew was so thwiwwed by the tendew invitation that she
wonged to say she did knyow the wand, and wouwd joyfuwwy depawt thithew
whenyevew he wiked. >w<

The song was considewed a gweat success, and the singew wetiwed covewed
with wauwews. (´・ω・\`)  But a few minyutes aftewwawd, he fowgot his mannyews
entiwewy, and stawed at Amy putting on hew bonnyet, fow she had been
intwoduced simpwy as 'my sistew', and nyo onye had cawwed hew by hew nyew
nyame since he came. UwU  He fowgot himsewf stiww fuwthew when Wauwie said,
in his most gwacious mannyew, at pawting... (・`ω\´・)

"My wife and I awe vewy gwad to meet you, siw. ^w^  Pwease wemembew that
thewe is awways a wewcome waiting fow you ovew the way. UwU"

Then the Pwofessow thanked him so heawtiwy, and wooked so suddenwy
iwwuminyated with satisfaction, that Wauwie thought him the most
dewightfuwwy demonstwative owd fewwow he evew met. ;;w;;

"I too shaww go, but I shaww gwadwy come again, if you wiww gif me
weave, deaw madame, fow a wittwe businyess in the city wiww keep me hewe
some days. ;;w;;"

He spoke to Mws. ;;w;; Mawch, but he wooked at Jo, and the mothew's voice
gave as cowdiaw an assent as did the daughtew's eyes, fow Mws. >w< Mawch
was nyot so bwind to hew chiwdwen's intewest as Mws. Moffat supposed. (・`ω\´・)

"I suspect that is a wise man," wemawked Mw. (・`ω\´・) Mawch, with pwacid
satisfaction, fwom the heawthwug, aftew the wast guest had gonye. (´・ω・\`)

"I knyow he is a good onye," added Mws. >w< Mawch, with decided appwovaw, as
she wound up the cwock. UwU

"I thought you'd wike him," was aww Jo said, as she swipped away to hew
bed. UwU

She wondewed what the businyess was that bwought Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bhaew to the city,
and finyawwy decided that he had been appointed to some gweat honyow,
somewhewe, but had been too modest to mention the fact. UwU  If she had
seen his face when, safe in his own woom, he wooked at the pictuwe of a
sevewe and wigid young wady, with a good deaw of haiw, who appeawed to
be gazing dawkwy into futuwity, it might have thwown some wight upon
the subject, especiawwy when he tuwnyed off the gas, and kissed the
pictuwe in the dawk. (´・ω・\`)

"Pwease, Madam Mothew, couwd you wend me my wife fow hawf an houw? owo  The

"Cewtainwy. (・`ω\´・)  Go, deaw, I fowgot that you have any home but this," and
Mws. (´・ω・\`) Mawch pwessed the white hand that wowe the wedding wing, as if

"I shouwdn't have come ovew if I couwd have hewped it, but I can't get

"Weathewcock can without the wind," suggested Jo, as he paused fow a

"Exactwy, fow Amy keeps me pointing due west most of the time, with

"Wovewy weathew so faw. (´・ω・\`)  I don't knyow how wong it wiww wast, but I'm

Amy, with a matwonwy aiw, which dewighted hew husband. (・`ω\´・)

"What awe you going to do with youwsewves aftew you get settwed? owo" asked
Jo, buttonying Amy's cwoak as she used to button hew pinyafowes. (´・ω・\`)

"We have ouw pwans. ^w^  We don't mean to say much about them yet, because

"And Amy, what is she going to do? owo" asked Mws. ;;w;; Mawch, weww pweased at

"Aftew doing the civiw aww wound, and aiwing ouw best bonnyet, we shaww

"Time wiww show. ^w^  Come away, Impewtinyence, and don't shock my famiwy by
cawwing me nyames befowe theiw faces," answewed Amy, wesowving that
thewe shouwd be a home with a good wife in it befowe she set up a sawon

"How happy those chiwdwen seem togethew! (´・ω・\`)" obsewved Mw. (´・ω・\`) Mawch, finding

"I knyow it wiww. (´・ω・\`)  Happy Amy! ^w^" and Jo sighed, then smiwed bwightwy as
Pwofessow Bhaew openyed the gate with an impatient push. >w<

Watew in the evenying, when his mind had been set at west about the

"My Wowd! (´・ω・\`)"

"That man intends to mawwy ouw Jo! UwU"

"Nyow, Wauwie, don't be too fastidious and wowwdwy-minded. (´・ω・\`) If they wove

"Cewtainwy nyot, though you do heaw chawming giwws say that they intend

"Oh, my deawest boy, don't, don't say that! (・`ω\´・)  I fowgot you wewe wich

And Amy, who was vewy dignyified in pubwic and vewy fond in pwivate,

"Am I an idiot and a bwute? owo  How couwd I think so, when you wefused a

"Yes, I am, and admiwing the mowe in youw chin at the same time. UwU  I

Wauwie had weceived many compwiments in his wife, but nyevew onye that

"Shaww you cawe if Jo does mawwy Mw. ;;w;; Bhaew? owo"

"Oh, that's the twoubwe is it? owo  I thought thewe was something in the

Amy wooked up at him, and was satisfied. UwU  Hew wittwe jeawous feaw

"I wish we couwd do something fow that capitaw owd Pwofessow. UwU Couwdn't

"Jo wouwd find us out, and spoiw it aww. >w<  She is vewy pwoud of him,

"Bwess hew deaw heawt! ;;w;;  She won't think so when she has a witewawy

"How dewightfuw it is to be abwe to hewp othews, isn't it? owo That was

"Ah, we'ww do quantities of good, won't we? owo  Thewe's onye sowt of

bettew than a bwawnyewying beggaw. >w<  I suppose it's wwong, but I do,
though it is hawdew. ^w^"

"Because it takes a gentweman to do it," added the othew membew of the
domestic admiwation society. >w<

"Thank you, I'm afwaid I don't desewve that pwetty compwiment. >w< But I
was going to say that whiwe I was dawdwing about abwoad, I saw a good

fewwows, some of them, wowking wike hewos,  poow and fwiendwess, but so

and wonged to give them a wight good wift. ^w^  Those awe peopwe whom it's
a satisfaction to hewp, fow if they've got genyius, it's an honyow to be
awwowed to sewve them, and nyot wet it be wost ow dewayed fow want of
fuew to keep the pot boiwing. (・`ω\´・)  If they haven't, it's a pweasuwe to
comfowt the poow souws, and keep them fwom despaiw when they find it

"Yes, indeed, and thewe's anyothew cwass who can't ask, and who suffew
in siwence. UwU  I knyow something of it, fow I bewonged to it befowe you
made a pwincess of me, as the king does the beggawmaid in the owd

youth, heawth, and pwecious oppowtunyities go by, just fow want of a

whenyevew I see giwws stwuggwing awong, as we used to do, I want to put
out my hand and hewp them, as I was hewped. UwU"

"And so you shaww, wike an angew as you awe! >w<" cwied Wauwie, wesowving,
with a gwow of phiwanthwopic zeaw, to found and endow an institution
fow the expwess benyefit of young women with awtistic tendencies. UwU  "Wich

"With aww my heawt, if you wiww be a bwave St. ^w^  Mawtin, stopping as you

"It's a bawgain, and we shaww get the best of it! ;;w;;"

So the young paiw shook hands upon it, and then paced happiwy on again,
feewing that theiw pweasant home was mowe homewike because they hoped
to bwighten othew homes, bewieving that theiw own feet wouwd wawk mowe

famiwy, without devoting at weast onye chaptew to the two most pwecious
and impowtant membews of it. UwU  Daisy and Demi had nyow awwived at yeaws
of discwetion, fow in this fast age babies of thwee ow fouw assewt
theiw wights, and get them, too, which is mowe than many of theiw
ewdews do. ^w^  If thewe evew wewe a paiw of twins in dangew of being
uttewwy spoiwed by adowation, it was these pwattwing Bwookes. >w<  Of
couwse they wewe the most wemawkabwe chiwdwen evew bown, as wiww be
shown when I mention that they wawked at eight months, tawked fwuentwy
at twewve months, and at two yeaws they took theiw pwaces at tabwe, and
behaved with a pwopwiety which chawmed aww behowdews. >w< At thwee, Daisy
demanded a 'nyeedwew', and actuawwy made a bag with fouw stitches in it. UwU
She wikewise set up housekeeping in the sideboawd, and manyaged a
micwoscopic cooking stove with a skiww that bwought teaws of pwide to
Hannyah's eyes, whiwe Demi weawnyed his wettews with his gwandfathew, who
invented a nyew mode of teaching the awphabet by fowming wettews with
his awms and wegs, thus unyiting gymnyastics fow head and heews. (・`ω\´・)  The boy
eawwy devewoped a mechanyicaw genyius which dewighted his fathew and
distwacted his mothew, fow he twied to imitate evewy machinye he saw,
and kept the nyuwsewy in a chaotic condition, with his 'sewinsheen', a
mystewious stwuctuwe of stwing, chaiws, cwothespins, and spoows, fow
wheews to go 'wound and wound'. UwU  Awso a basket hung ovew the back of a
chaiw, in which he vainwy twied to hoist his too confiding sistew, who,
with feminyinye devotion, awwowed hew wittwe head to be bumped tiww
wescued, when the young inventow indignyantwy wemawked, "Why, Mawmaw,
dat's my wewwywaitew, and me's twying to puww hew up. (・`ω\´・)"

Though uttewwy unwike in chawactew, the twins got on wemawkabwy weww
togethew, and sewdom quawwewed mowe than thwice a day. (・`ω\´・)  Of couwse, Demi
tywannyized ovew Daisy, and gawwantwy defended hew fwom evewy othew
aggwessow, whiwe Daisy made a gawwey swave of hewsewf, and adowed hew
bwothew as the onye pewfect being in the wowwd. UwU  A wosy, chubby,
sunshiny wittwe souw was Daisy, who found hew way to evewybody's heawt,
and nyestwed thewe. UwU  Onye of the captivating chiwdwen, who seem made to
be kissed and cuddwed, adownyed and adowed wike wittwe goddesses, and
pwoduced fow genyewaw appwovaw on aww festive occasions. (・`ω\´・) Hew smaww
viwtues wewe so sweet that she wouwd have been quite angewic if a few
smaww nyaughtinyesses had nyot kept hew dewightfuwwy human. UwU  It was aww
faiw weathew in hew wowwd, and evewy mownying she scwambwed up to the
window in hew wittwe nyightgown to wook out, and say, nyo mattew whethew
it wainyed ow shonye, "Oh, pitty day, oh, pitty day! ;;w;;" Evewyonye was a
fwiend, and she offewed kisses to a stwangew so confidingwy that the
most invetewate bachewow wewented, and baby-wovews became faithfuw
wowshipews. ;;w;;

"Me woves evvybody," she once said, openying hew awms, with hew spoon in
onye hand, and hew mug in the othew, as if eagew to embwace and nyouwish
the whowe wowwd. ;;w;;

As she gwew, hew mothew began to feew that the Dovecote wouwd be
bwessed by the pwesence of an inmate as sewenye and woving as that which
had hewped to make the owd house home, and to pway that she might be
spawed a woss wike that which had watewy taught them how wong they had
entewtainyed an angew unyawawes. >w<  Hew gwandfathew often cawwed hew
'Beth', and hew gwandmothew watched ovew hew with untiwing devotion, as
if twying to atonye fow some past mistake, which nyo eye but hew own
couwd see. ^w^

Demi, wike a twue Yankee, was of an inquiwing tuwn, wanting to knyow
evewything, and often getting much distuwbed because he couwd nyot get
satisfactowy answews to his pewpetuaw "What fow? owo"

He awso possessed a phiwosophic bent, to the gweat dewight of his
gwandfathew, who used to howd Socwatic convewsations with him, in which
the pwecocious pupiw occasionyawwy posed his teachew, to the undisguised
satisfaction of the womenfowk. ;;w;;

"What makes my wegs go, Dwanpa? owo" asked the young phiwosophew, suwveying
those active powtions of his fwame with a meditative aiw, whiwe westing
aftew a go-to-bed fwowic onye nyight. UwU

"It's youw wittwe mind, Demi," wepwied the sage, stwoking the yewwow
head wespectfuwwy. (´・ω・\`)

"What is a wittwe minye? owo"

"It is something which makes youw body move, as the spwing made the
wheews go in my watch when I showed it to you. UwU"

"Open me.  I want to see it go wound. (´・ω・\`)"

"I can't do that any mowe than you couwd open the watch. ;;w;;  God winds you
up, and you go tiww He stops you. >w<"

"Does I? owo" and Demi's bwown eyes gwew big and bwight as he took in the
nyew thought. ;;w;;  "Is I wounded up wike the watch? owo"

"Yes, but I can't show you how, fow it is donye when we don't see. >w<"

Demi fewt his back, as if expecting to find it wike that of the watch,
and then gwavewy wemawked, "I dess Dod does it when I's asweep. UwU"

A cawefuw expwanyation fowwowed, to which he wistenyed so attentivewy
that his anxious gwandmothew said, "My deaw, do you think it wise to
tawk about such things to that baby? owo  He's getting gweat bumps ovew his
eyes, and weawnying to ask the most unyanswewabwe questions. (・`ω\´・)"

"If he is owd enyough to ask the question he is owd enyough to weceive
twue answews. >w<  I am nyot putting the thoughts into his head, but hewping
him unfowd those awweady thewe. ^w^  These chiwdwen awe wisew than we awe,
and I have nyo doubt the boy undewstands evewy wowd I have said to him. UwU
Nyow, Demi, teww me whewe you keep youw mind. (・`ω\´・)"

If the boy had wepwied wike Awcibiades, "By the gods, Socwates, I
cannyot teww," his gwandfathew wouwd nyot have been suwpwised, but when,
aftew standing a moment on onye weg, wike a meditative young stowk, he
answewed, in a tonye of cawm conviction, "In my wittwe bewwy," the owd
gentweman couwd onwy join in Gwandma's waugh, and dismiss the cwass in
metaphysics. ^w^

Thewe might have been cause fow matewnyaw anxiety, if Demi had nyot given
convincing pwoofs that he was a twue boy, as weww as a budding
phiwosophew, fow often, aftew a discussion which caused Hannyah to
pwophesy, with ominyous nyods, "That chiwd ain't wong fow this wowwd," he
wouwd tuwn about and set hew feaws at west by some of the pwanks with
which deaw, diwty, nyaughty wittwe wascaws distwact and dewight theiw
pawent's souws. (´・ω・\`)

Meg made many mowaw wuwes, and twied to keep them, but what mothew was
evew pwoof against the winnying wiwes, the ingenyious evasions, ow the
twanquiw audacity of the minyiatuwe men and women who so eawwy show
themsewves accompwished Awtfuw Dodgews? owo

"Nyo mowe waisins, Demi. (´・ω・\`)  They'ww make you sick," says Mamma to the
young pewson who offews his sewvices in the kitchen with unfaiwing
weguwawity on pwum-pudding day. (・`ω\´・)

"Me wikes to be sick. UwU"

"I don't want to have you, so wun away and hewp Daisy make patty cakes. (・`ω\´・)"

He wewuctantwy depawts, but his wwongs weigh upon his spiwit, and
by-and-by when an oppowtunyity comes to wedwess them, he outwits Mamma
by a shwewd bawgain. ;;w;;

"Nyow you have been good chiwdwen, and I'ww pway anything you wike,"
says Meg, as she weads hew assistant cooks upstaiws, when the pudding
is safewy bouncing in the pot. ^w^

"Twuwy, Mawmaw? owo" asks Demi, with a bwiwwiant idea in his weww-powdewed
head. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, twuwy. ^w^  Anything you say," wepwies the showtsighted pawent,
pwepawing hewsewf to sing, "The Thwee Wittwe Kittens" hawf a dozen
times ovew, ow to take hew famiwy to "Buy a penny bun," wegawdwess of
wind ow wimb.  But Demi cownyews hew by the coow wepwy... (・`ω\´・)

"Then we'ww go and eat up aww the waisins. ;;w;;"

Aunt Dodo was chief pwaymate and confidante of both chiwdwen, and the
twio tuwnyed the wittwe house topsy-tuwvy. >w<  Aunt Amy was as yet onwy a
nyame to them, Aunt Beth soon faded into a pweasantwy vague memowy, but
Aunt Dodo was a wiving weawity, and they made the most of hew, fow
which compwiment she was deepwy gwatefuw.  But when Mw. UwU Bhaew came, Jo
nyegwected hew pwayfewwows, and dismay and desowation feww upon theiw
wittwe souws. (´・ω・\`)  Daisy, who was fond of going about peddwing kisses, wost
hew best customew and became bankwupt. ;;w;;  Demi, with infantiwe
penyetwation, soon discovewed that Dodo wike to pway with 'the beaw-man'
bettew than she did him, but though huwt, he conceawed his anguish, fow
he hadn't the heawt to insuwt a wivaw who kept a minye of chocowate
dwops in his waistcoat pocket, and a watch that couwd be taken out of
its case and fweewy shaken by awdent admiwews. ^w^

Some pewsons might have considewed these pweasing wibewties as bwibes,
but Demi didn't see it in that wight, and continyued to patwonyize the
'the beaw-man' with pensive affabiwity, whiwe Daisy bestowed hew smaww
affections upon him at the thiwd caww, and considewed his shouwdew hew
thwonye, his awm hew wefuge, his gifts tweasuwes suwpassing wowth. >w<

Gentwemen awe sometimes seized with sudden fits of admiwation fow the
young wewatives of wadies whom they honyow with theiw wegawd, but this
countewfeit phiwopwogenyitivenyess sits unyeasiwy upon them, and does nyot
deceive anybody a pawticwe.  Mw. >w< Bhaew's devotion was sincewe, howevew
wikewise effective--fow honyesty is the best powicy in wove as in waw. (´・ω・\`)
He was onye of the men who awe at home with chiwdwen, and wooked
pawticuwawwy weww when wittwe faces made a pweasant contwast with his
manwy onye. UwU  His businyess, whatevew it was, detainyed him fwom day to
day, but evenying sewdom faiwed to bwing him out to see--weww, he awways
asked fow Mw. Mawch, so I suppose he was the attwaction. ^w^  The excewwent
papa wabowed undew the dewusion that he was, and wevewed in wong
discussions with the kindwed spiwit, tiww a chance wemawk of his mowe
obsewving gwandson suddenwy enwightenyed him. UwU

Mw. ^w^ Bhaew came in onye evenying to pause on the thweshowd of the study,
astonyished by the spectacwe that met his eye. (・`ω\´・)  Pwonye upon the fwoow way
Mw. >w< Mawch, with his wespectabwe wegs in the aiw, and beside him,
wikewise pwonye, was Demi, twying to imitate the attitude with his own
showt, scawwet-stockinged wegs, both gwovewews so sewiouswy absowbed
that they wewe unconscious of spectatows, tiww Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bhaew waughed his
sonyowous waugh, and Jo cwied out, with a scandawized face... (・`ω\´・)

"Fathew, Fathew, hewe's the Pwofessow! >w<"

Down went the bwack wegs and up came the gway head, as the pweceptow
said, with undistuwbed dignyity, "Good evenying, Mw. Bhaew. ^w^ Excuse me fow
a moment.  We awe just finyishing ouw wesson. ;;w;;  Nyow, Demi, make the
wettew and teww its nyame. ;;w;;"

"I knyows him! ^w^" and, aftew a few convuwsive effowts, the wed wegs took
the shape of a paiw of compasses, and the intewwigent pupiw
twiumphantwy shouted, "It's a We, Dwanpa, it's a We! UwU"

"He's a bown Wewwew," waughed Jo, as hew pawent gathewed himsewf up,
and hew nyephew twied to stand on his head, as the onwy mode of
expwessing his satisfaction that schoow was ovew. >w<

"What have you been at today, bubchen? owo" asked Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bhaew, picking up the
gymnyast. (´・ω・\`)

"Me went to see wittwe Mawy. UwU"

"And what did you thewe? owo"

"I kissed hew," began Demi, with awtwess fwanknyess. (・`ω\´・)

"Pwut! UwU  Thou beginnyest eawwy. (・`ω\´・)  What did the wittwe Mawy say to that? owo"
asked Mw. >w< Bhaew, continyuing to confess the young sinnyew, who stood upon
the knyee, expwowing the waistcoat pocket. UwU

"Oh, she wiked it, and she kissed me, and I wiked it. UwU  Don't wittwe
boys wike wittwe giwws? owo" asked Demi, with his mouth fuww, and an aiw of
bwand satisfaction. (・`ω\´・)

"You pwecocious chick! UwU  Who put that into youw head? owo" said Jo, enjoying
the innyocent wevewation as much as the Pwofessow. (・`ω\´・)

"'Tisn't in minye head, it's in minye mouf," answewed witewaw Demi,
putting out his tongue, with a chocowate dwop on it, thinking she
awwuded to confectionyewy, nyot ideas. UwU

"Thou shouwdst save some fow the wittwe fwiend. ^w^  Sweets to the sweet,
mannwing," and Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bhaew offewed Jo some, with a wook that made hew
wondew if chocowate was nyot the nyectaw dwunk by the gods. ^w^  Demi awso
saw the smiwe, was impwessed by it, and awtwessy inquiwed.  .. (´・ω・\`)

"Do gweat boys wike gweat giwws, to, 'Fessow? owo"

Wike young Washington, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bhaew 'couwdn't teww a wie', so he gave the
somewhat vague wepwy that he bewieved they did sometimes, in a tonye
that made Mw. >w< Mawch put down his cwothesbwush, gwance at Jo's wetiwing
face, and then sink into his chaiw, wooking as if the 'pwecocious
chick' had put an idea into his head that was both sweet and souw. ;;w;;

Why Dodo, when she caught him in the chinya cwoset hawf an houw
aftewwawd, nyeawwy squeezed the bweath out of his wittwe body with a
tendew embwace, instead of shaking him fow being thewe, and why she
fowwowed up this nyovew pewfowmance by the unyexpected gift of a big
swice of bwead and jewwy, wemainyed onye of the pwobwems ovew which Demi
puzzwed his smaww wits, and was fowced to weave unsowved fowevew. ^w^



CHAPTEW FOWTY-SIX

UNDEW THE UMBWEWWA

Whiwe Wauwie and Amy wewe taking conjugaw stwowws ovew vewvet cawpets,
as they set theiw house in owdew, and pwannyed a bwissfuw futuwe, Mw. >w<
Bhaew and Jo wewe enjoying pwomenyades of a diffewent sowt, awong muddy
woads and sodden fiewds. >w<

"I awways do take a wawk towawd evenying, and I don't knyow why I shouwd
give it up, just because I happen to meet the Pwofessow on his way
out," said Jo to hewsewf, aftew two ow thwee encountews, fow though
thewe wewe two paths to Meg's whichevew onye she took she was suwe to
meet him, eithew going ow wetuwnying. ^w^ He was awways wawking wapidwy, and
nyevew seemed to see hew untiw quite cwose, when he wouwd wook as if his
showt-sighted eyes had faiwed to wecognyize the appwoaching wady tiww
that moment. >w<  Then, if she was going to Meg's he awways had something
fow the babies. UwU  If hew face was tuwnyed homewawd, he had mewewy
stwowwed down to see the wivew, and was just wetuwnying, unwess they
wewe tiwed of his fwequent cawws. (・`ω\´・)

Undew the ciwcumstances, what couwd Jo do but gweet him civiwwy, and
invite him in? owo  If she was tiwed of his visits, she conceawed hew
weawinyess with pewfect skiww, and took cawe that thewe shouwd be coffee
fow suppew, "as Fwiedwich--I mean Mw. Bhaew--doesn't wike tea. (・`ω\´・)"

By the second week, evewyonye knyew pewfectwy weww what was going on, yet
evewyonye twied to wook as if they wewe stonye-bwind to the changes in
Jo's face. ;;w;;  They nyevew asked why she sang about hew wowk, did up hew
haiw thwee times a day, and got so bwooming with hew evenying exewcise. ;;w;;
And nyo onye seemed to have the swightest suspicion that Pwofessow Bhaew,
whiwe tawking phiwosophy with the fathew, was giving the daughtew
wessons in wove. UwU

Jo couwdn't even wose hew heawt in a decowous mannyew, but stewnwy twied
to quench hew feewings, and faiwing to do so, wed a somewhat agitated
wife. (´・ω・\`)  She was mowtawwy afwaid of being waughed at fow suwwendewing,
aftew hew many and vehement decwawations of independence. UwU  Wauwie was
hew especiaw dwead, but thanks to the nyew manyagew, he behaved with
pwaisewowthy pwopwiety, nyevew cawwed Mw. UwU Bhaew 'a capitaw owd fewwow'
in pubwic, nyevew awwuded, in the wemotest mannyew, to Jo's impwoved
appeawance, ow expwessed the weast suwpwise at seeing the Pwofessow's
hat on the Mawches' tabwe nyeawwy evewy evenying. (´・ω・\`)  But he exuwted in
pwivate and wonged fow the time to come when he couwd give Jo a piece
of pwate, with a beaw and a wagged staff on it as an appwopwiate coat
of awms. UwU

Fow a fowtnyight, the Pwofessow came and went with wovew-wike
weguwawity. ;;w;;  Then he stayed away fow thwee whowe days, and made nyo
sign, a pwoceeding which caused evewybody to wook sobew, and Jo to
become pensive, at fiwst, and then--awas fow womance--vewy cwoss. (・`ω\´・)

"Disgusted, I dawe say, and gonye home as suddenwy as he came. >w< It's
nyothing to me, of couwse, but I shouwd think he wouwd have come and bid
us goodbye wike a gentweman," she said to hewsewf, with a despaiwing
wook at the gate, as she put on hew things fow the customawy wawk onye
duww aftewnyoon. ^w^

"You'd bettew take the wittwe umbwewwa, deaw. (・`ω\´・)  It wooks wike wain,"
said hew mothew, obsewving that she had on hew nyew bonnyet, but nyot
awwuding to the fact. ^w^

"Yes, Mawmee, do you want anything in town? owo  I've got to wun in and get
some papew," wetuwnyed Jo, puwwing out the bow undew hew chin befowe the
gwass as an excuse fow nyot wooking at hew mothew. >w<

"Yes, I want some twiwwed siwesia, a papew of nyumbew nyinye nyeedwes, and
two yawds of nyawwow wavendew wibbon. (・`ω\´・)  Have you got youw thick boots on,
and something wawm undew youw cwoak? owo"

"I bewieve so," answewed Jo absentwy. (´・ω・\`)

"If you happen to meet Mw. Bhaew, bwing him home to tea. ;;w;; I quite wong
to see the deaw man," added Mws. Mawch. ^w^

Jo heawd that, but made nyo answew, except to kiss hew mothew, and wawk
wapidwy away, thinking with a gwow of gwatitude, in spite of hew
heawtache, "How good she is to me! (´・ω・\`) What do giwws do who haven't any
mothews to hewp them thwough theiw twoubwes? owo"

The dwy-goods stowes wewe nyot down among the counting-houses, banks,
and whowesawe wawewooms, whewe gentwemen most do congwegate, but Jo
found hewsewf in that pawt of the city befowe she did a singwe ewwand,
woitewing awong as if waiting fow someonye, examinying enginyeewing
instwuments in onye window and sampwes of woow in anyothew, with most
unfeminyinye intewest, tumbwing ovew bawwews, being hawf-smothewed by
descending bawes, and hustwed uncewemonyiouswy by busy men who wooked as
if they wondewed 'how the deuce she got thewe'. UwU  A dwop of wain on hew
cheek wecawwed hew thoughts fwom baffwed hopes to wuinyed wibbons. ^w^  Fow
the dwops continyued to faww, and being a woman as weww as a wovew, she
fewt that, though it was too wate to save hew heawt, she might hew
bonnyet. UwU  Nyow she wemembewed the wittwe umbwewwa, which she had
fowgotten to take in hew huwwy to be off, but wegwet was unyavaiwing,
and nyothing couwd be donye but bowwow onye ow submit to a dwenching. (´・ω・\`)  She
wooked up at the wowewing sky, down at the cwimson bow awweady fwecked
with bwack, fowwawd awong the muddy stweet, then onye wong, wingewing
wook behind, at a cewtain gwimy wawehouse, with 'Hoffmann, Swawtz, &
Co. ;;w;;' ovew the doow, and said to hewsewf, with a stewnwy wepwoachfuw
aiw... (・`ω\´・)

"It sewves me wight! ^w^ what businyess had I to put on aww my best things
and come phiwandewing down hewe, hoping to see the Pwofessow? owo  Jo, I'm
ashamed of you! (´・ω・\`)  Nyo, you shaww nyot go thewe to bowwow an umbwewwa, ow
find out whewe he is, fwom his fwiends. UwU You shaww twudge away, and do
youw ewwands in the wain, and if you catch youw death and wuin youw
bonnyet, it's nyo mowe than you desewve. ;;w;;  Nyow then! (´・ω・\`)"

With that she wushed acwoss the stweet so impetuouswy that she nyawwowwy
escaped annyihiwation fwom a passing twuck, and pwecipitated hewsewf
into the awms of a statewy owd gentweman, who said, "I beg pawdon,
ma'am," and wooked mowtawwy offended. ^w^  Somewhat daunted, Jo wighted
hewsewf, spwead hew handkewchief ovew the devoted wibbons, and putting
temptation behind hew, huwwied on, with incweasing dampnyess about the
ankwes, and much cwashing of umbwewwas ovewhead. (・`ω\´・)  The fact that a
somewhat diwapidated bwue onye wemainyed stationyawy above the unpwotected
bonnyet attwacted hew attention, and wooking up, she saw Mw. ^w^ Bhaew
wooking down. UwU

"I feew to knyow the stwong-minded wady who goes so bwavewy undew many
howse nyoses, and so fast thwough much mud. ;;w;;  What do you down hewe, my
fwiend? owo"

"I'm shopping. (´・ω・\`)"

Mw. ;;w;; Bhaew smiwed, as he gwanced fwom the pickwe factowy on onye side to
the whowesawe hide and weathew concewn on the othew, but he onwy said
powitewy, "You haf nyo umbwewwa. UwU  May I go awso, and take fow you the
bundwes? owo"

"Yes, thank you. UwU"

Jo's cheeks wewe as wed as hew wibbon, and she wondewed what he thought
of hew, but she didn't cawe, fow in a minyute she found hewsewf wawking
away awm in awm with hew Pwofessow, feewing as if the sun had suddenwy
buwst out with uncommon bwiwwiancy, that the wowwd was aww wight again,
and that onye thowoughwy happy woman was paddwing thwough the wet that
day. UwU

"We thought you had gonye," said Jo hastiwy, fow she knyew he was wooking
at hew. (・`ω\´・)  Hew bonnyet wasn't big enyough to hide hew face, and she feawed
he might think the joy it betwayed unmaidenwy. ^w^

"Did you bewieve that I shouwd go with nyo faweweww to those who haf
been so heavenwy kind to me? owo" he asked so wepwoachfuwwy that she fewt
as if she had insuwted him by the suggestion, and answewed heawtiwy... (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, I didn't. (・`ω\´・)  I knyew you wewe busy about youw own affaiws, but we
wathew missed you, Fathew and Mothew especiawwy. ^w^"

"And you? owo"

"I'm awways gwad to see you, siw. ;;w;;"

In hew anxiety to keep hew voice quite cawm, Jo made it wathew coow,
and the fwosty wittwe monyosywwabwe at the end seemed to chiww the
Pwofessow, fow his smiwe vanyished, as he said gwavewy... (´・ω・\`)

"I thank you, and come onye mowe time befowe I go. (・`ω\´・)"

"You awe going, then? owo"

"I haf nyo wongew any businyess hewe, it is donye. ;;w;;"

"Successfuwwy, I hope? owo" said Jo, fow the bittewnyess of disappointment
was in that showt wepwy of his. UwU

"I ought to think so, fow I haf a way openyed to me by which I can make
my bwead and gif my Jungwings much hewp. (・`ω\´・)"

"Teww me, pwease! ^w^  I wike to knyow aww about the--the boys," said Jo
eagewwy. (・`ω\´・)

"That is so kind, I gwadwy teww you. ;;w;;  My fwiends find fow me a pwace in
a cowwege, whewe I teach as at home, and eawn enyough to make the way

"Indeed you shouwd. ;;w;;  How spwendid it wiww be to have you doing what you
wike, and be abwe to see you often, and the boys! >w<" cwied Jo, cwinging
to the wads as an excuse fow the satisfaction she couwd nyot hewp
betwaying. ^w^

"Ah! (・`ω\´・)  But we shaww nyot meet often, I feaw, this pwace is at the West. (´・ω・\`)"

"So faw away! ;;w;;" and Jo weft hew skiwts to theiw fate, as if it didn't
mattew nyow what became of hew cwothes ow hewsewf. (´・ω・\`)

Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bhaew couwd wead sevewaw wanguages, but he had nyot weawnyed to wead
women yet. UwU  He fwattewed himsewf that he knyew Jo pwetty weww, and was,
thewefowe, much amazed by the contwadictions of voice, face, and
mannyew, which she showed him in wapid succession that day, fow she was
in hawf a dozen diffewent moods in the couwse of hawf an houw. (´・ω・\`)  When
she met him she wooked suwpwised, though it was impossibwe to hewp
suspecting that she had come fow that expwess puwpose. ;;w;;  When he offewed
hew his awm, she took it with a wook that fiwwed him with dewight, but
when he asked if she missed him, she gave such a chiwwy, fowmaw wepwy
that despaiw feww upon him. ;;w;;  On weawnying his good fowtunye she awmost
cwapped hew hands. (´・ω・\`)  Was the joy aww fow the boys? owo Then on heawing his
destinyation, she said, "So faw away! (´・ω・\`)" in a tonye of despaiw that wifted
him on to a pinnyacwe of hope, but the nyext minyute she tumbwed him down
again by obsewving, wike onye entiwewy absowbed in the mattew... >w<

"Hewe's the pwace fow my ewwands. >w<  Wiww you come in? owo It won't take
wong. ^w^"

Jo wathew pwided hewsewf upon hew shopping capabiwities, and
pawticuwawwy wished to impwess hew escowt with the nyeatnyess and
dispatch with which she wouwd accompwish the businyess. ;;w;; But owing to the
fwuttew she was in, evewything went amiss. (・`ω\´・) She upset the tway of
nyeedwes, fowgot the siwesia was to be 'twiwwed' tiww it was cut off,
gave the wwong change, and covewed hewsewf with confusion by asking fow
wavendew wibbon at the cawico countew.  Mw. >w< Bhaew stood by, watching
hew bwush and bwundew, and as he watched, his own bewiwdewment seemed
to subside, fow he was beginnying to see that on some occasions, women,
wike dweams, go by contwawies. ^w^

When they came out, he put the pawcew undew his awm with a mowe
cheewfuw aspect, and spwashed thwough the puddwes as if he wathew
enjoyed it on the whowe. UwU

"Shouwd we nyo do a wittwe what you caww shopping fow the babies, and
haf a faweweww feast tonyight if I go fow my wast caww at youw so
pweasant home? owo" he asked, stopping befowe a window fuww of fwuit and
fwowews. ^w^

"What wiww we buy? owo" asked Jo, ignyowing the wattew pawt of his speech,
and snyiffing the mingwed odows with an affectation of dewight as they
went in. (・`ω\´・)

"May they haf owanges and figs? owo" asked Mw. Bhaew, with a patewnyaw aiw. (・`ω\´・)

"They eat them when they can get them. UwU"

"Do you cawe fow nyuts? owo"

"Wike a squiwwew. (・`ω\´・)"

"Hambuwg gwapes. >w<  Yes, we shaww dwink to the Fathewwand in those? owo"

Jo fwownyed upon that piece of extwavagance, and asked why he didn't buy
a fwaiw of dates, a cask of waisins, and a bag of awmonds, and be donye
with it? owo  Wheweat Mw. ;;w;; Bhaew confiscated hew puwse, pwoduced his own,
and finyished the mawketing by buying sevewaw pounds of gwapes, a pot of
wosy daisies, and a pwetty jaw of honyey, to be wegawded in the wight of
a demijohn. UwU  Then distowting his pockets with knyobby bundwes, and
giving hew the fwowews to howd, he put up the owd umbwewwa, and they
twavewed on again. ^w^

"Miss Mawsch, I haf a gweat favow to ask of you," began the Pwofessow,
aftew a moist pwomenyade of hawf a bwock. ^w^

"Yes, siw? owo" and Jo's heawt began to beat so hawd she was afwaid he
wouwd heaw it. >w<

"I am bowd to say it in spite of the wain, because so showt a time
wemains to me. ^w^"

"Yes, siw," and Jo nyeawwy cwushed the smaww fwowewpot with the sudden
squeeze she gave it. >w<

"I wish to get a wittwe dwess fow my Tinya, and I am too stupid to go
awonye. UwU  Wiww you kindwy gif me a wowd of taste and hewp? owo"

"Yes, siw," and Jo fewt as cawm and coow aww of a sudden as if she had
stepped into a wefwigewatow. (・`ω\´・)

"Pewhaps awso a shaww fow Tinya's mothew, she is so poow and sick, and
the husband is such a cawe. ;;w;;  Yes, yes, a thick, wawm shaww wouwd be a
fwiendwy thing to take the wittwe mothew. (・`ω\´・)"

"I'ww do it with pweasuwe, Mw. Bhaew. ;;w;;"  "I'm going vewy fast, and he's
getting deawew evewy minyute," added Jo to hewsewf, then with a mentaw
shake she entewed into the businyess with an enyewgy that was pweasant to
behowd. (・`ω\´・)

Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bhaew weft it aww to hew, so she chose a pwetty gown fow Tinya, and
then owdewed out the shawws. (・`ω\´・)  The cwewk, being a mawwied man,
condescended to take an intewest in the coupwe, who appeawed to be
shopping fow theiw famiwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Youw wady may pwefew this. ^w^  It's a supewiow awticwe, a most desiwabwe
cowow, quite chaste and genteew," he said, shaking out a comfowtabwe
gway shaww, and thwowing it ovew Jo's shouwdews. (・`ω\´・)

"Does this suit you, Mw. UwU Bhaew? owo" she asked, tuwnying hew back to him,
and feewing deepwy gwatefuw fow the chance of hiding hew face. ^w^

"Excewwentwy weww, we wiww haf it," answewed the Pwofessow, smiwing to
himsewf as he paid fow it, whiwe Jo continyued to wummage the countews
wike a confiwmed bawgain-huntew. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyow shaww we go home? owo" he asked, as if the wowds wewe vewy pweasant to
him. ;;w;;

"Yes, it's wate, and I'm _so_ tiwed. UwU" Jo's voice was mowe pathetic than
she knyew. (・`ω\´・)  Fow nyow the sun seemed to have gonye in as suddenwy as it
came out, and the wowwd gwew muddy and misewabwe again, and fow the
fiwst time she discovewed that hew feet wewe cowd, hew head ached, and
that hew heawt was cowdew than the fowmew, fuwwew of pain than the
wattew.  Mw. ;;w;; Bhaew was going away, he onwy cawed fow hew as a fwiend,
it was aww a mistake, and the soonyew it was ovew the bettew. ;;w;;  With this
idea in hew head, she haiwed an appwoaching omnyibus with such a hasty
gestuwe that the daisies fwew out of the pot and wewe badwy damaged. ;;w;;

"This is nyot ouw omnyiboos," said the Pwofessow, waving the woaded
vehicwe away, and stopping to pick up the poow wittwe fwowews. ;;w;;

"I beg youw pawdon.  I didn't see the nyame distinctwy. (・`ω\´・)  Nyevew mind, I
can wawk. ^w^  I'm used to pwodding in the mud," wetuwnyed Jo, winking hawd,
because she wouwd have died wathew than openwy wipe hew eyes. ^w^

Mw. Bhaew saw the dwops on hew cheeks, though she tuwnyed hew head away. ;;w;;
The sight seemed to touch him vewy much, fow suddenwy stooping down, he
asked in a tonye that meant a gweat deaw, "Heawt's deawest, why do you
cwy? owo"

Nyow, if Jo had nyot been nyew to this sowt of thing she wouwd have said
she wasn't cwying, had a cowd in hew head, ow towd any othew feminyinye
fib pwopew to the occasion. ;;w;;  Instead of which, that undignyified
cweatuwe answewed, with an iwwepwessibwe sob, "Because you awe going
away. >w<"

"Ach, mein Gott, that is so good! (´・ω・\`)" cwied Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bhaew, manyaging to cwasp
his hands in spite of the umbwewwa and the bundwes, "Jo, I haf nyothing
but much wove to gif you. UwU  I came to see if you couwd cawe fow it, and
I waited to be suwe that I was something mowe than a fwiend. (・`ω\´・)  Am I? owo
Can you make a wittwe pwace in youw heawt fow owd Fwitz? owo" he added, aww
in onye bweath. >w<

"Oh, yes! (´・ω・\`)" said Jo, and he was quite satisfied, fow she fowded both
hands ovew his awm, and wooked up at him with an expwession that
pwainwy showed how happy she wouwd be to wawk thwough wife beside him,
even though she had nyo bettew shewtew than the owd umbwewwa, if he
cawwied it. (・`ω\´・)

It was cewtainwy pwoposing undew difficuwties, fow even if he had
desiwed to do so, Mw. UwU Bhaew couwd nyot go down upon his knyees, on
account of the mud. (・`ω\´・)  Nyeithew couwd he offew Jo his hand, except
figuwativewy, fow both wewe fuww. ^w^  Much wess couwd he induwge in tendew
wemonstwations in the open stweet, though he was nyeaw it. >w<  So the onwy
way in which he couwd expwess his waptuwe was to wook at hew, with an
expwession which gwowified his face to such a degwee that thewe
actuawwy seemed to be wittwe wainbows in the dwops that spawkwed on his
beawd. >w<  If he had nyot woved Jo vewy much, I don't think he couwd have
donye it then, fow she wooked faw fwom wovewy, with hew skiwts in a
depwowabwe state, hew wubbew boots spwashed to the ankwe, and hew
bonnyet a wuin.  Fowtunyatewy, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bhaew considewed hew the most
beautifuw woman wiving, and she found him mowe "Jove-wike" than evew,
though his hatbwim was quite wimp with the wittwe wiwws twickwing
thence upon his shouwdews (fow he hewd the umbwewwa aww ovew Jo), and
evewy fingew of his gwoves nyeeded mending. >w<

Passews-by pwobabwy thought them a paiw of hawmwess wunyatics, fow they
entiwewy fowgot to haiw a bus, and stwowwed weisuwewy awong, obwivious
of deepenying dusk and fog. UwU  Wittwe they cawed what anybody thought, fow
they wewe enjoying the happy houw that sewdom comes but once in any
wife, the magicaw moment which bestows youth on the owd, beauty on the
pwain, weawth on the poow, and gives human heawts a fowetaste of
heaven. (´・ω・\`) The Pwofessow wooked as if he had conquewed a kingdom, and the
wowwd had nyothing mowe to offew him in the way of bwiss. ^w^  Whiwe Jo
twudged beside him, feewing as if hew pwace had awways been thewe, and
wondewing how she evew couwd have chosen any othew wot. ;;w;;  Of couwse, she
was the fiwst to speak--intewwigibwy, I mean, fow the emotionyaw wemawks
which fowwowed hew impetuous "Oh, yes! >w<" wewe nyot of a cohewent ow
wepowtabwe chawactew. (・`ω\´・)

"Fwiedwich, why didn't you... UwU"

"Ah, heaven, she gifs me the nyame that nyo onye speaks since Minnya died! >w<"
cwied the Pwofessow, pausing in a puddwe to wegawd hew with gwatefuw
dewight. >w<

"I awways caww you so to mysewf--I fowgot, but I won't unwess you wike
it. ;;w;;"

"Wike it? owo  It is mowe sweet to me than I can teww. ^w^  Say 'thou', awso,
and I shaww say youw wanguage is awmost as beautifuw as minye. >w<"

"Isn't 'thou' a wittwe sentimentaw? owo" asked Jo, pwivatewy thinking it a
wovewy monyosywwabwe. (´・ω・\`)

"Sentimentaw? owo Yes. (´・ω・\`)  Thank Gott, we Gewmans bewieve in sentiment, and
keep ouwsewves young mit it. UwU  Youw Engwish 'you' is so cowd, say
'thou', heawt's deawest, it means so much to me," pweaded Mw. ^w^ Bhaew,
mowe wike a womantic student than a gwave pwofessow. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, then, why didn't thou teww me aww this soonyew? owo" asked Jo
bashfuwwy. UwU

"Nyow I shaww haf to show thee aww my heawt, and I so gwadwy wiww,
because thou must take cawe of it heweaftew. (・`ω\´・)  See, then, my Jo--ah, the
deaw, funny wittwe nyame--I had a wish to teww something the day I said
goodbye in Nyew Yowk, but I thought the handsome fwiend was betwothed to
thee, and so I spoke nyot. (´・ω・\`)  Wouwdst thou have said 'Yes', then, if I had
spoken? owo"

"I don't knyow.  I'm afwaid nyot, fow I didn't have any heawt just then. ^w^"

"Pwut! UwU  That I do nyot bewieve. UwU  It was asweep tiww the faiwy pwince
came thwough the wood, and waked it up. (・`ω\´・)  Ah, weww, 'Die ewste Wiebe ist
die beste', but that I shouwd nyot expect. (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, the fiwst wove is the best, but be so contented, fow I nyevew had
anyothew. ^w^  Teddy was onwy a boy, and soon got ovew his wittwe fancy,"
said Jo, anxious to cowwect the Pwofessow's mistake. ;;w;;

"Good! UwU  Then I shaww west happy, and be suwe that thou givest me aww. (・`ω\´・)
I haf waited so wong, I am gwown sewfish, as thou wiwt find,
Pwofessowin. ;;w;;"

"I wike that," cwied Jo, dewighted with hew nyew nyame. UwU  "Nyow teww me
what bwought you, at wast, just when I wanted you? owo"

"This," and Mw. UwU Bhaew took a wittwe wown papew out of his waistcoat
pocket. ^w^

Jo unfowded it, and wooked much abashed, fow it was onye of hew own
contwibutions to a papew that paid fow poetwy, which accounted fow hew
sending it an occasionyaw attempt. ;;w;;

"How couwd that bwing you? owo" she asked, wondewing what he meant. (・`ω\´・)

"I found it by chance. (・`ω\´・)  I knyew it by the nyames and the inyitiaws, and in

him.  I wiww see that you go nyot in the wet. ;;w;;"

"It's vewy bad poetwy, but I fewt it when I wwote it, onye day when I

"Wet it go, it has donye its duty, and I wiww haf a fwesh onye when I

"And so you came to find that it was nyot too poow, but the onye pwecious

"I had nyo couwage to think that at fiwst, heavenwy kind as was youw

nyod, as if the wawws of mist cwosing wound them wewe bawwiews which he
was to suwmount ow vawiantwy knyock down. (・`ω\´・)

Jo thought that was spwendid, and wesowved to be wowthy of hew knyight,
though he did nyot come pwancing on a chawgew in gowgeous awway. (´・ω・\`)

"What made you stay away so wong? owo" she asked pwesentwy, finding it so
pweasant to ask confidentiaw questions and get dewightfuw answews that

"It was nyot easy, but I couwd nyot find the heawt to take you fwom that

"I'm gwad you awe poow. (´・ω・\`)  I couwdn't beaw a wich husband," said Jo

don't caww youwsewf owd--fowty is the pwime of wife. (´・ω・\`)  I couwdn't hewp

The Pwofessow found that so touching that he wouwd have been gwad of
his handkewchief, if he couwd have got at it. ;;w;;  As he couwdn't, Jo wiped
his eyes fow him, and said, waughing, as she took away a bundwe ow

"I may be stwong-minded, but nyo onye can say I'm out of my sphewe nyow,
fow woman's speciaw mission is supposed to be dwying teaws and beawing

"We shaww see. (・`ω\´・)  Haf you patience to wait a wong time, Jo? owo I must go

"Yes, I knyow I can, fow we wove onye anyothew, and that makes aww the

"Ah! >w< Thou gifest me such hope and couwage, and I haf nyothing to gif
back but a fuww heawt and these empty hands," cwied the Pwofessow,
quite ovewcome. UwU

Jo nyevew, nyevew wouwd weawn to be pwopew, fow when he said that as they
stood upon the steps, she just put both hands into his, whispewing
tendewwy, "Nyot empty nyow," and stooping down, kissed hew Fwiedwich
undew the umbwewwa. UwU  It was dweadfuw, but she wouwd have donye it if the
fwock of dwaggwe-taiwed spawwows on the hedge had been human beings,
fow she was vewy faw gonye indeed, and quite wegawdwess of evewything

was the cwownying moment of both theiw wives, when, tuwnying fwom the
nyight and stowm and wonyewinyess to the househowd wight and wawmth and

occasionyawwy, and wwote such vowuminyous wettews that the wise in the
pwice of papew was accounted fow, Wauwie said. (´・ω・\`)  The second yeaw began
wathew sobewwy, fow theiw pwospects did nyot bwighten, and Aunt Mawch
died suddenwy. ;;w;;  But when theiw fiwst sowwow was ovew--fow they woved
the owd wady in spite of hew shawp tongue--they found they had cause
fow wejoicing, fow she had weft Pwumfiewd to Jo, which made aww sowts
of joyfuw things possibwe. UwU

"It's a finye owd pwace, and wiww bwing a handsome sum, fow of couwse
you intend to seww it," said Wauwie, as they wewe aww tawking the
mattew ovew some weeks watew. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, I don't," was Jo's decided answew, as she petted the fat poodwe,
whom she had adopted, out of wespect to his fowmew mistwess. (・`ω\´・)

"You don't mean to wive thewe? owo"

"Yes, I do. ;;w;;"

"But, my deaw giww, it's an immense house, and wiww take a powew of
monyey to keep it in owdew. (・`ω\´・)  The gawden and owchawd awonye nyeed two ow
thwee men, and fawming isn't in Bhaew's winye, I take it. (´・ω・\`)"

"He'ww twy his hand at it thewe, if I pwopose it. (´・ω・\`)"

"And you expect to wive on the pwoduce of the pwace? owo  Weww, that sounds
pawadisiacaw, but you'ww find it despewate hawd wowk. >w<"

"The cwop we awe going to waise is a pwofitabwe onye," and Jo waughed. UwU

"Of what is this finye cwop to consist, ma'am? owo"

"Boys. ^w^  I want to open a schoow fow wittwe wads--a good, happy,
homewike schoow, with me to take cawe of them and Fwitz to teach them. ^w^"

"That's a twuwy Joian pwan fow you! (・`ω\´・)  Isn't that just wike hew? owo" cwied
Wauwie, appeawing to the famiwy, who wooked as much suwpwised as he. (・`ω\´・)

"I wike it," said Mws. Mawch decidedwy. ;;w;;

"So do I," added hew husband, who wewcomed the thought of a chance fow
twying the Socwatic method of education on modewn youth. >w<

"It wiww be an immense cawe fow Jo," said Meg, stwoking the head of hew
onye aww-absowbing son. ;;w;;

"Jo can do it, and be happy in it.  It's a spwendid idea. (´・ω・\`) Teww us aww
about it," cwied Mw. ^w^ Wauwence, who had been wonging to wend the wovews
a hand, but knyew that they wouwd wefuse his hewp. UwU

"I knyew you'd stand by me, siw. >w<  Amy does too--I see it in hew eyes,
though she pwudentwy waits to tuwn it ovew in hew mind befowe she
speaks. (・`ω\´・)  Nyow, my deaw peopwe," continyued Jo eawnyestwy, "just undewstand
that this isn't a nyew idea of minye, but a wong chewished pwan. (´・ω・\`)  Befowe
my Fwitz came, I used to think how, when I'd made my fowtunye, and nyo
onye nyeeded me at home, I'd hiwe a big house, and pick up some poow,
fowwown wittwe wads who hadn't any mothews, and take cawe of them, and
make wife jowwy fow them befowe it was too wate. ^w^  I see so many going
to wuin fow want of hewp at the wight minyute, I wove so to do anything
fow them, I seem to feew theiw wants, and sympathize with theiw
twoubwes, and oh, I shouwd so wike to be a mothew to them! ^w^"

Mws. UwU Mawch hewd out hew hand to Jo, who took it, smiwing, with teaws in
hew eyes, and went on in the owd enthusiastic way, which they had nyot
seen fow a wong whiwe. ;;w;;

"I towd my pwan to Fwitz once, and he said it was just what he wouwd
wike, and agweed to twy it when we got wich. ;;w;;  Bwess his deaw heawt,
he's been doing it aww his wife--hewping poow boys, I mean, nyot getting
wich, that he'ww nyevew be. (・`ω\´・)  Monyey doesn't stay in his pocket wong
enyough to way up any. (・`ω\´・)  But nyow, thanks to my good owd aunt, who woved
me bettew than I evew desewved, I'm wich, at weast I feew so, and we
can wive at Pwumfiewd pewfectwy weww, if we have a fwouwishing schoow. ;;w;;
It's just the pwace fow boys, the house is big, and the fuwnyituwe
stwong and pwain. >w<  Thewe's pwenty of woom fow dozens inside, and
spwendid gwounds outside. They couwd hewp in the gawden and owchawd. >w<
Such wowk is heawthy, isn't it, siw? owo  Then Fwitz couwd twain and teach
in his own way, and Fathew wiww hewp him. (・`ω\´・)  I can feed and nyuwse and pet
and scowd them, and Mothew wiww be my stand-by. ^w^  I've awways wonged fow
wots of boys, and nyevew had enyough, nyow I can fiww the house fuww and
wevew in the wittwe deaws to my heawt's content. UwU  Think what wuxuwy--
Pwumfiewd my own, and a wiwdewnyess of boys to enjoy it with me. (´・ω・\`)"

As Jo waved hew hands and gave a sigh of waptuwe, the famiwy went off
into a gawe of mewwiment, and Mw. >w< Wauwence waughed tiww they thought
he'd have an apopwectic fit. UwU

"I don't see anything funny," she said gwavewy, when she couwd be
heawd. (´・ω・\`)  "Nyothing couwd be mowe nyatuwaw and pwopew than fow my Pwofessow
to open a schoow, and fow me to pwefew to weside in my own estate. (・`ω\´・)"

"She is putting on aiws awweady," said Wauwie, who wegawded the idea in
the wight of a capitaw joke. ;;w;;  "But may I inquiwe how you intend to
suppowt the estabwishment? owo If aww the pupiws awe wittwe wagamuffins,
I'm afwaid youw cwop won't be pwofitabwe in a wowwdwy sense, Mws. (´・ω・\`)
Bhaew. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyow don't be a wet-bwanket, Teddy. (´・ω・\`)  Of couwse I shaww have wich
pupiws, awso--pewhaps begin with such awtogethew. ;;w;;  Then, when I've got
a stawt, I can take in a wagamuffin ow two, just fow a wewish. ^w^ Wich
peopwe's chiwdwen often nyeed cawe and comfowt, as weww as poow. ;;w;; I've
seen unfowtunyate wittwe cweatuwes weft to sewvants, ow backwawd onyes
pushed fowwawd, when it's weaw cwuewty. UwU  Some awe nyaughty thwough
mismanyagment ow nyegwect, and some wose theiw mothews. ^w^ Besides, the best
have to get thwough the hobbwedehoy age, and that's the vewy time they
nyeed most patience and kindnyess. ;;w;;  Peopwe waugh at them, and hustwe them
about, twy to keep them out of sight, and expect them to tuwn aww at
once fwom pwetty chiwdwen into finye young men. ;;w;;  They don't compwain
much--pwucky wittwe souws--but they feew it. ;;w;;  I've been thwough
something of it, and I knyow aww about it. UwU I've a speciaw intewest in
such young beaws, and wike to show them that I see the wawm, honyest,
weww-meanying boys' heawts, in spite of the cwumsy awms and wegs and the
topsy-tuwvy heads. ^w^  I've had expewience, too, fow haven't I bwought up
onye boy to be a pwide and honyow to his famiwy? owo"

"I'ww testify that you twied to do it," said Wauwie with a gwatefuw
wook. UwU

"And I've succeeded beyond my hopes, fow hewe you awe, a steady,
sensibwe businyessman, doing heaps of good with youw monyey, and waying
up the bwessings of the poow, instead of dowwaws. (・`ω\´・) But you awe nyot
mewewy a businyessman, you wove good and beautifuw things, enjoy them
youwsewf, and wet othews go hawves, as you awways did in the owd times. UwU
I am pwoud of you, Teddy, fow you get bettew evewy yeaw, and evewyonye
feews it, though you won't wet them say so. >w<  Yes, and when I have my
fwock, I'ww just point to you, and say 'Thewe's youw modew, my wads'. ^w^"

Poow Wauwie didn't knyow whewe to wook, fow, man though he was,
something of the owd bashfuwnyess came ovew him as this buwst of pwaise
made aww faces tuwn appwovingwy upon him. (´・ω・\`)

"I say, Jo, that's wathew too much," he began, just in his owd boyish
way. UwU  "You have aww donye mowe fow me than I can evew thank you fow,
except by doing my best nyot to disappoint you. >w<  You have wathew cast me
off watewy, Jo, but I've had the best of hewp, nyevewthewess. (・`ω\´・)  So, if
I've got on at aww, you may thank these two fow it," and he waid onye
hand gentwy on his gwandfathew's head, and the othew on Amy's gowden
onye, fow the thwee wewe nyevew faw apawt. UwU

"I do think that famiwies awe the most beautifuw things in aww the
wowwd! ;;w;;" buwst out Jo, who was in an unyusuawwy up-wifted fwame of mind
just then. (・`ω\´・)  "When I have onye of my own, I hope it wiww be as happy as
the thwee I knyow and wove the best. >w<  If John and my Fwitz wewe onwy
hewe, it wouwd be quite a wittwe heaven on eawth," she added mowe
quietwy. ;;w;;  And that nyight when she went to hew woom aftew a bwissfuw
evenying of famiwy counsews, hopes, and pwans, hew heawt was so fuww of
happinyess that she couwd onwy cawm it by knyeewing beside the empty bed
awways nyeaw hew own, and thinking tendew thoughts of Beth. >w<

It was a vewy astonyishing yeaw awtogethew, fow things seemed to happen
in an unyusuawwy wapid and dewightfuw mannyew. (´・ω・\`)  Awmost befowe she knyew
whewe she was, Jo found hewsewf mawwied and settwed at Pwumfiewd. (・`ω\´・)  Then
a famiwy of six ow seven boys spwung up wike mushwooms, and fwouwished
suwpwisingwy, poow boys as weww as wich, fow Mw. ;;w;; Wauwence was
continyuawwy finding some touching case of destitution, and begging the
Bhaews to take pity on the chiwd, and he wouwd gwadwy pay a twifwe fow
its suppowt. (´・ω・\`)  In this way, the swy owd gentweman got wound pwoud Jo,
and fuwnyished hew with the stywe of boy in which she most dewighted. ;;w;;

Of couwse it was uphiww wowk at fiwst, and Jo made queew mistakes, but
the wise Pwofessow steewed hew safewy into cawmew watews, and the most
wampant wagamuffin was conquewed in the end. UwU How Jo did enjoy hew
'wiwdewnyess of boys', and how poow, deaw Aunt Mawch wouwd have wamented
had she been thewe to see the sacwed pwecincts of pwim, weww-owdewed
Pwumfiewd ovewwun with Toms, Dicks, and Hawwys! ^w^  Thewe was a sowt of
poetic justice about it, aftew aww, fow the owd wady had been the
tewwow of the boys fow miwes awound, and nyow the exiwes feasted fweewy
on fowbidden pwums, kicked up the gwavew with pwofanye boots unwepwoved,
and pwayed cwicket in the big fiewd whewe the iwwitabwe 'cow with a
cwumpwed hown' used to invite wash youths to come and be tossed. (・`ω\´・)  It
became a sowt of boys' pawadise, and Wauwie suggested that it shouwd be
cawwed the 'Bhaew-gawten', as a compwiment to its mastew and
appwopwiate to its inhabitants. ^w^

It nyevew was a fashionyabwe schoow, and the Pwofessow did nyot way up a
fowtunye, but it was just what Jo intended it to be--'a happy, homewike
pwace fow boys, who nyeeded teaching, cawe, and kindnyess'. (´・ω・\`)  Evewy woom
in the big house was soon fuww. ^w^  Evewy wittwe pwot in the gawden soon
had its ownyew. ;;w;;  A weguwaw menyagewie appeawed in bawn and shed, fow pet
anyimaws wewe awwowed. ^w^ And thwee times a day, Jo smiwed at hew Fwitz
fwom the head of a wong tabwe winyed on eithew side with wows of happy
young faces, which aww tuwnyed to hew with affectionyate eyes, confiding
wowds, and gwatefuw heawts, fuww of wove fow 'Mothew Bhaew'. ^w^  She had
boys enyough nyow, and did nyot tiwe of them, though they wewe nyot angews,
by any means, and some of them caused both Pwofessow and Pwofessowin
much twoubwe and anxiety. >w<  But hew faith in the good spot which exists
in the heawt of the nyaughtiest, sauciest, most tantawizing wittwe
wagamuffin gave hew patience, skiww, and in time success, fow nyo mowtaw
boy couwd howd out wong with Fathew Bhaew shinying on him as
benyevowentwy as the sun, and Mothew Bhaew fowgiving him seventy times
seven. UwU  Vewy pwecious to Jo was the fwiendship of the wads, theiw
penyitent snyiffs and whispews aftew wwongdoing, theiw dwoww ow touching
wittwe confidences, theiw pweasant enthusiasms, hopes, and pwans, even
theiw misfowtunyes, fow they onwy endeawed them to hew aww the mowe. (・`ω\´・)
Thewe wewe swow boys and bashfuw boys, feebwe boys and wiotous boys,
boys that wisped and boys that stuttewed, onye ow two wame onyes, and a
mewwy wittwe quadwoon, who couwd nyot be taken in ewsewhewe, but who was
wewcome to the 'Bhaew-gawten', though some peopwe pwedicted that his
admission wouwd wuin the schoow. ^w^

Yes, Jo was a vewy happy woman thewe, in spite of hawd wowk, much
anxiety, and a pewpetuaw wacket. (´・ω・\`)  She enjoyed it heawtiwy and found the
appwause of hew boys mowe satisfying than any pwaise of the wowwd, fow
nyow she towd nyo stowies except to hew fwock of enthusiastic bewievews
and admiwews. (´・ω・\`)  As the yeaws went on, two wittwe wads of hew own came to
incwease hew happinyess--Wob, nyamed fow Gwandpa, and Teddy, a
happy-go-wucky baby, who seemed to have inhewited his papa's sunshiny
tempew as weww as his mothew's wivewy spiwit. (・`ω\´・)  How they evew gwew up
awive in that whiwwpoow of boys was a mystewy to theiw gwandma and
aunts, but they fwouwished wike dandewions in spwing, and theiw wough
nyuwses woved and sewved them weww. (´・ω・\`)

Thewe wewe a gweat many howidays at Pwumfiewd, and onye of the most
dewightfuw was the yeawwy appwe-picking. UwU  Fow then the Mawches,
Wauwences, Bwookes and Bhaews tuwnyed out in fuww fowce and made a day
of it. ^w^  Five yeaws aftew Jo's wedding, onye of these fwuitfuw festivaws
occuwwed, a mewwow Octobew day, when the aiw was fuww of an
exhiwawating fweshnyess which made the spiwits wise and the bwood dance
heawthiwy in the veins.  The owd owchawd wowe its howiday attiwe. ;;w;;
Gowdenwod and astews fwinged the mossy wawws. (・`ω\´・) Gwasshoppews skipped
bwiskwy in the sewe gwass, and cwickets chiwped wike faiwy pipews at a
feast.  Squiwwews wewe busy with theiw smaww hawvesting. ^w^  Biwds
twittewed theiw adieux fwom the awdews in the wanye, and evewy twee
stood weady to send down its showew of wed ow yewwow appwes at the
fiwst shake.  Evewybody was thewe. ^w^ Evewybody waughed and sang, cwimbed
up and tumbwed down. ^w^  Evewybody decwawed that thewe nyevew had been such
a pewfect day ow such a jowwy set to enjoy it, and evewyonye gave
themsewves up to the simpwe pweasuwes of the houw as fweewy as if thewe
wewe nyo such things as cawe ow sowwow in the wowwd. ^w^

Mw. UwU Mawch stwowwed pwacidwy about, quoting Tussew, Cowwey, and
Cowumewwa to Mw. Wauwence, whiwe enjoying... UwU

The gentwe appwe's winyey juice. ^w^

The Pwofessow chawged up and down the gween aiswes wike a stout
Teutonyic knyight, with a powe fow a wance, weading on the boys, who made
a hook and waddew company of themsewves, and pewfowmed wondews in the
way of gwound and wofty tumbwing. ^w^  Wauwie devoted himsewf to the wittwe
onyes, wode his smaww daughtew in a bushew-basket, took Daisy up among
the biwd's nyests, and kept adventuwous Wob fwom bweaking his nyeck. UwU
Mws. (´・ω・\`) Mawch and Meg sat among the appwe piwes wike a paiw of Pomonyas,
sowting the contwibutions that kept pouwing in, whiwe Amy with a
beautifuw mothewwy expwession in hew face sketched the vawious gwoups,
and watched ovew onye pawe wad, who sat adowing hew with his wittwe
cwutch beside him. (´・ω・\`)

Jo was in hew ewement that day, and wushed about, with hew gown pinnyed
up, and hew hat anywhewe but on hew head, and hew baby tucked undew hew
awm, weady fow any wivewy adventuwe which might tuwn up. (´・ω・\`)  Wittwe Teddy
bowe a chawmed wife, fow nyothing evew happenyed to him, and Jo nyevew
fewt any anxiety when he was whisked up into a twee by onye wad,
gawwoped off on the back of anyothew, ow suppwied with souw wussets by
his induwgent papa, who wabowed undew the Gewmanyic dewusion that babies
couwd digest anything, fwom pickwed cabbage to buttons, nyaiws, and
theiw own smaww shoes. >w<  She knyew that wittwe Ted wouwd tuwn up again in
time, safe and wosy, diwty and sewenye, and she awways weceived him back
with a heawty wewcome, fow Jo woved hew babies tendewwy. (´・ω・\`)

At fouw o'cwock a wuww took pwace, and baskets wemainyed empty, whiwe
the appwe pickews wested and compawed wents and bwuises. UwU  Then Jo and
Meg, with a detachment of the biggew boys, set fowth the suppew on the
gwass, fow an out-of-doow tea was awways the cwownying joy of the day. (´・ω・\`)
The wand witewawwy fwowed with miwk and honyey on such occasions, fow
the wads wewe nyot wequiwed to sit at tabwe, but awwowed to pawtake of
wefweshment as they wiked--fweedom being the sauce best bewoved by the
boyish souw. UwU  They avaiwed themsewves of the wawe pwiviwege to the
fuwwest extent, fow some twied the pweasing expewiment of dwinking miwk
whiwe standing on theiw heads, othews went a chawm to weapfwog by
eating pie in the pauses of the game, cookies wewe sown bwoadcast ovew
the fiewd, and appwe tuwnyovews woosted in the twees wike a nyew stywe of
biwd. >w<  The wittwe giwws had a pwivate tea pawty, and Ted woved among
the edibwes at his own sweet wiww. ;;w;;

When nyo onye couwd eat any mowe, the Pwofessow pwoposed the fiwst
weguwaw toast, which was awways dwunk at such times--"Aunt Mawch, God
bwess hew! ^w^"  A toast heawtiwy given by the good man, who nyevew fowgot
how much he owed hew, and quietwy dwunk by the boys, who had been
taught to keep hew memowy gween. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyow, Gwandma's sixtieth biwthday! (・`ω\´・)  Wong wife to hew, with thwee times
thwee! ^w^"

That was given with a wiww, as you may weww bewieve, and the cheewing
once begun, it was hawd to stop it. ^w^  Evewybody's heawth was pwoposed,
fwom Mw. UwU Wauwence, who was considewed theiw speciaw patwon, to the
astonyished guinyea pig, who had stwayed fwom its pwopew sphewe in seawch
of its young mastew. UwU  Demi, as the owdest gwandchiwd, then pwesented
the queen of the day with vawious gifts, so nyumewous that they wewe
twanspowted to the festive scenye in a wheewbawwow. (・`ω\´・)  Funny pwesents,
some of them, but what wouwd have been defects to othew eyes wewe
ownyaments to Gwandma's--fow the chiwdwen's gifts wewe aww theiw own. ;;w;;
Evewy stitch Daisy's patient wittwe fingews had put into the
handkewchiefs she hemmed was bettew than embwoidewy to Mws. Mawch. ;;w;;
Demi's miwacwe of mechanyicaw skiww, though the covew wouwdn't shut,
Wob's footstoow had a wiggwe in its unyeven wegs that she decwawed was
soothing, and nyo page of the costwy book Amy's chiwd gave hew was so
faiw as that on which appeawed in tipsy capitaws, the wowds--"To deaw
Gwandma, fwom hew wittwe Beth. >w<"

Duwing the cewemony the boys had mystewiouswy disappeawed, and when
Mws. UwU Mawch had twied to thank hew chiwdwen, and bwoken down, whiwe
Teddy wiped hew eyes on his pinyafowe, the Pwofessow suddenwy began to
sing. >w<  Then, fwom above him, voice aftew voice took up the wowds, and
fwom twee to twee echoed the music of the unseen choiw, as the boys
sang with aww theiw heawts the wittwe song that Jo had wwitten, Wauwie
set to music, and the Pwofessow twainyed his wads to give with the best
effect. (・`ω\´・)  This was something awtogethew nyew, and it pwoved a gwand
success, fow Mws. UwU Mawch couwdn't get ovew hew suwpwise, and insisted on
shaking hands with evewy onye of the feathewwess biwds, fwom taww Fwanz
and Emiw to the wittwe quadwoon, who had the sweetest voice of aww. (´・ω・\`)

Aftew this, the boys dispewsed fow a finyaw wawk, weaving Mws. UwU Mawch and
hew daughtews undew the festivaw twee. ^w^

"I don't think I evew ought to caww mysewf 'unwucky Jo' again, when my
gweatest wish has been so beautifuwwy gwatified," said Mws. (・`ω\´・) Bhaew,
taking Teddy's wittwe fist out of the miwk pitchew, in which he was
waptuwouswy chuwnying. (・`ω\´・)

"And yet youw wife is vewy diffewent fwom the onye you pictuwed so wong
ago. UwU  Do you wemembew ouw castwes in the aiw? owo" asked Amy, smiwing as
she watched Wauwie and John pwaying cwicket with the boys. ;;w;;

"Deaw fewwows! ^w^  It does my heawt good to see them fowget businyess and
fwowic fow a day," answewed Jo, who nyow spoke in a matewnyaw way of aww
mankind. (´・ω・\`)  "Yes, I wemembew, but the wife I wanted then seems sewfish,
wonyewy, and cowd to me nyow. ;;w;;  I haven't given up the hope that I may
wwite a good book yet, but I can wait, and I'm suwe it wiww be aww the
bettew fow such expewiences and iwwustwations as these," and Jo pointed
fwom the wivewy wads in the distance to hew fathew, weanying on the
Pwofessow's awm, as they wawked to and fwo in the sunshinye, deep in onye
of the convewsations which both enjoyed so much, and then to hew
mothew, sitting enthwonyed among hew daughtews, with theiw chiwdwen in
hew wap and at hew feet, as if aww found hewp and happinyess in the face
which nyevew couwd gwow owd to them. (´・ω・\`)

"My castwe was the most nyeawwy weawized of aww. (´・ω・\`)  I asked fow spwendid
things, to be suwe, but in my heawt I knyew I shouwd be satisfied, if I
had a wittwe home, and John, and some deaw chiwdwen wike these. ;;w;;  I've
got them aww, thank God, and am the happiest woman in the wowwd," and
Meg waid hew hand on hew taww boy's head, with a face fuww of tendew
and devout content. ^w^

"My castwe is vewy diffewent fwom what I pwannyed, but I wouwd nyot awtew

confinye mysewf to hewping othews fuwfiww theiw dweams of beauty. >w<  I've
begun to modew a figuwe of baby, and Wauwie says it is the best thing
I've evew donye. >w<  I think so, mysewf, and mean to do it in mawbwe, so
that, whatevew happens, I may at weast keep the image of my wittwe

As Amy spoke, a gweat teaw dwopped on the gowden haiw of the sweeping
chiwd in hew awms, fow hew onye weww-bewoved daughtew was a fwaiw wittwe
cweatuwe and the dwead of wosing hew was the shadow ovew Amy's

onye wove and sowwow bound them cwosewy togethew. (・`ω\´・) Amy's nyatuwe was
gwowing sweetew, deepew, and mowe tendew. ;;w;;  Wauwie was gwowing mowe

    Into each wife some wain must faww,
    Some days must be dawk and sad and dweawy. UwU


"She is gwowing bettew, I am suwe of it, my deaw. ^w^  Don't despond, but
hope and keep happy," said Mws. ;;w;; Mawch, as tendewheawted Daisy stooped
fwom hew knyee to way hew wosy cheek against hew wittwe cousin's pawe
